         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This <hi>Rogers</hi> briefly and not very poſitively affirms, <hi>p. 7.</hi>

as not only to proclame us <hi>guilty</hi> (to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and ſucceeding Generations) in the Higheſt Degree,
without hearing or trial, but to pronounce this peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Sentence againſt us;<note n="a" place="margin">Page 36, 37.</note> 
               <hi>That not only by the Law of
Neceſſity</hi> (which they pleaded that acted it) <hi>but by the Law
of the Land, they might have been called to account for their
lives in a Capital manner: But were Favourably, as well
as Iuſtly dealt with, in being deprived only of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in the Houſe, when as their heads might have béen
required.</hi> So this <hi>Headſman, ex Tripode,</hi> magiſterially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines.</p>
            <p>This Queſtion, ſo highly concerning us in our preſent
and future <hi>reputations;</hi> and the right, freedom of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and their Members in all generations, I ſhall more
largely debate; and for ever acquit my ſelf and <hi>fellow-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
Members,</hi> from this <hi>Scandalum Magnum st Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum,</hi>
long ſince<note n="b" place="margin">In my Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle before my Speech, Dec. 4. 1648. and Vindication of the ſecured and ſecluded Members.</note> 
               <hi>cleared, refuted by us,</hi> yet now revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
afreſh againſt us, in the higheſt degree. I ſhall deſire
the Readers to conſider;</p>
            <p>1. Thoſe who firſt accuſed us as <hi>breakers of our Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Truſts</hi> repoſed in us, were neither the reſpective
<hi>Counties, Cities, Boroughs,</hi> who elected, authorized, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
truſted us for their <hi>Knights, Citizens, Burgeſſes</hi> in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the only fit accuſers and judges of us out of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who all abſolve and juſtifie us againſt this Calumny;
nor yet our fellow-<hi>Members,</hi> or <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> the onely
meet <hi>impeachers, judges</hi> of us in Parliament, if guilty; But
onely the <hi>General Council of Officers in the Army,</hi> who neither
elected nor intruſted us; were only our mercinary, ſworn
<hi>Servants,</hi> not our <hi>Iudges;</hi> and yet moſt notoriouſly, trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
perfidiouſly violated both their truſts, faith, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
by waging war againſt us, and forcibly ſeiſing, ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
us, againſt their Commiſſions, the <hi>Proteſtation, Solemn
League and Covenant</hi> they had all ſubſcribed. And were
theſe fit perſons to accuſe us then or now of <hi>breach of trust,</hi>
who are ſuch <hi>Grand Truſt-breakers</hi> themſelves?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:115450:4"/>
2. That this <hi>breach of truſt,</hi> was not ſo much as objected
againſt us by them, before, nor at their treaſonable ſodain
ſecluding and ſecuring us, Decem. 6. &amp; 7. 1648. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not be the true cauſe of our ſecluſion, but a
ſubſequent pretence: Yea theſe Officers to mutiny the
common Souldiers againſt us, told them; <hi>That the Members
they ſeiſed at the Houſe door, were thoſe who purſed up and kept
away their pay from them;</hi> and <hi>that was the only cauſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſoldiers aſsisted them to ſecure us, elſe they would not have
medled with any of us;</hi> as they told me and Col: <hi>Birch</hi> in the
Queens Court the day we were ſeiſed. Whereupon I aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them, it was a <hi>groſſe untruth;</hi> for neither of us then
<hi>ſecured, was a Treaſurer or Receiver of monyes;</hi> they anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>They were informed the contrary by their Officers, and
were ſorry we were thus abuſed, and kept out of the Houſe upon
ſuch a falſe ſuggeſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>That they never charged us with</hi> breaking our truſts,
<hi>till near a full month after our ſecluſion and ſecuring; and
that upon this occaſion, as</hi> Nedham <hi>himſelf relates,</hi> p. 31.
<hi>Upon the Armies ſeiſing us, Decemb. 6. the</hi> Members then
ſitting in the Houſe, ſent out the Serjeant into the <hi>Queens
Court, where we were detained, to</hi> command our attendance
in the Houſe; <hi>but the</hi> Soldiers detaining us Priſoners, would
not permit us to go to the Houſe: <hi>Thereupon he was ſent the
ſecond time,</hi> with the mace to fetch us in; <hi>but the</hi> Officers ſtaid
him at the Houſe door, and would not permit him to paſs: <hi>which
was entred in the</hi> Iournal <hi>Book, as a Contempt. Being</hi>
ſtartled with <hi>this ſodain force on the Houſe,</hi> they concluded
<hi>not to procéed in Buſineſs till their Members ſhould be
reſtored. (Therefore they judged them no breakers, but
performers of their truſt, when ſeiſed and ſecluded by the
Army;)</hi> and in the mean time ordered, that the General ſhould
be ſent to, to know the reaſon of the Armies proceedings in ſeiſing
the Members? <hi>Upon this,</hi> The General Council of Officers <hi>not
before</hi> Ianuary 3. 1648. <hi>(when they had not left 50 Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in it) returned their Anſwer to them,</hi> That they were
neceſſitated thereunto; <hi>(upon meer forged pretences) and
that theſe</hi> Members had broken their truſts, <hi>which</hi> occaſioned
them to ſeclude and ſeiſe them. <hi>A pretty excuſe and cloak for
ſo tranſcendent a</hi> Treaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115450:5"/>
4. That in this Anſwer, they moſt falſly ſcandalized, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the ſecluded and ſecured Members (as <hi>Nedham</hi> doth
in their terms, with ſome additions of his own) which I
ſhall briefly refute:</p>
            <p>1. He ſaith, that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> and his <hi>party</hi> heretofore and
now ſecluded, did <hi>ſeclude and ſeparate themſelves from the
Publike Intereſt before they were ſecluded, p. 28.</hi> But wherein
he tells us not. And is this either evidence or conviction
to ſeclude us?<note n="a" place="margin">Tertull. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologia pro Chriſtianis.</note> a <hi>Quis inſons erit ſi accuſaſse ſufficiat?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2ly. He addes, our ſecluſion is juſtifiable by <hi>Lex talionis,</hi>
becauſe <hi>We had ſome time before ſecluded the honeſt party of the
Houſe,</hi> by <hi>encouraging the Apprentices who came to the Houſe
door, drave away the faithful party (of which the Members now
ſitting are principal) ſo that the Speaker and they were forced to
fly out of Town for protection to the Army,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And Mr. Prynne
and all his party approved this Procéeding.</hi> Here <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
lies</hi> for the whetſtone: For 1. Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſate not at
all as a Member in the Houſe, till <hi>Novemb: 7. 1648</hi> being
elected but in <hi>August</hi> before, without his privity, and much
againſt his will: This tumult was in <hi>July, 1647.</hi> above a
year and quarter before; yet Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> muſt then aſſent
to it, as a <hi>Member, and be guilty of it and all his charges, p. 30,
31, 32.</hi> before he was a <hi>Member,</hi> and be
<hi>for ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and ſilenced thereby.</hi> 2ly. There was never the leaſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>ers <hi>raiſed,</hi> 
or <hi>encouraged</hi> this tumult of the Apprentices. 3ly. Moſt
of them, to my knowledge, did then both in publike and
private, declare their diſlike thereof as much as any now
ſitting. 4ly. Theſe Apprentices <hi>ſecluded</hi> not one Member
out of the Houſe, much leſſe <hi>ſecured</hi> any, as the Army did;
but only kept <hi>moſt</hi> of them <hi>in the Houſe,</hi> till their petition
was anſwered by them; upon which they all departed
without any future force: After which the Houſe adjour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from <hi>Monday</hi> night till <hi>Thurſday</hi> morning, becauſe of
the <hi>general Faſt</hi> the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following. 5ly. The Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
pretended to be forced out of Town by this tumult,
and to <hi>fly for protection to the Army,</hi> departed not thence,
till ſome <hi>Army-Officers</hi> ſollicited them by <hi>perſwaſions</hi> and
<hi>menaces</hi> to repair to the Army and leave the Houſe, againſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115450:5"/>
their judgements, as divers of them have confeſſed. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
Mr. <hi>Lenthall</hi> the Speaker being at the Faſt in <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garets</hi>
Church the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following, diſcourſing with
Sir <hi>Ralph Aſhton,</hi> Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyer</hi> and 4. more Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
ſitting with him, between the two Sermons; told
them of his own accord; <q rend="margQuotes">That there was a ſcandalous
report raiſed in Town, that he meant to leave the Houſe
and run away to the Army: but for his own part, he
had not any ſuch thought or intention, but reſolved to
continue in Town, and to live and die with the other
Members in the Houſe, if there were cauſe.</q> On Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
morning moſt of the Members appeared at the Houſe,
expecting the <hi>Speakers</hi> coming till near 11 of the clock, and
ſent 2 or 3 <hi>Meſſengers for him.</hi> At laſt they were informed,
<hi>that he was ſent for, and gone that morning to the Army.</hi>
Whereupon Sir <hi>Ralph Aſhton</hi> and thoſe who ſat with him
at the Faſt, related his words in my hearing (being then
caſually in the Houſe) to the other Members, and ſundry
times ſince to the Houſe and to my ſelf; Hereupon the
Members preſent were neceſſitated <hi>to chuſe another Speaker
pro tempore,</hi> (as they had oft times done in caſe of ſickneſs
or abſence, both before and ſince) to ſupply his place, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ
and diſpatch the buſineſſe of the Houſe: So as the
Speaker and Members then departing to the Army, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Houſes leave or privity, <hi>voluntarily ſecluded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
and were neither ſecluded by the Apprentices, nor
their fellow-members; who were ſo farr from ſecluding,
that they ſent ſundry <hi>Meſſengers</hi> to <hi>call them to the Houſe,</hi> and
<hi>were highly diſcontented at this their cauſleſs departure from it.</hi>
5ly. Theſe Apprentices came without any arms at all to
the Houſe, only with a Petition (occaſioned by the <hi>Army-Officers</hi>
encroachments upon the Cities <hi>Militia,</hi> and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,)
without any intention to ſeclude or ſecure any
one Member, departing from the Houſe that day, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
returning to diſturb them after. But the undutifull
<hi>Army-Officers,</hi> who ſo much declame againſt this unarmed
force <hi>as Treaſonable;</hi> againſt <hi>both Houſes Votes, Orders,
Letters</hi> to them, not only brought up the Army to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
placed whole Regiments of them in arms at their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115450:6"/>
very doors, who ſecluded the whole Houſe of Peers, and
above two parts of three of the Commons Houſe; giving
the Captains of the guards a <hi>particular liſt</hi> whom to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
whom to ſeclude, and whom only to admit; but
likewiſe continued their forcible great armed guards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Houſes, ſeveral weeks, yea moneths, and detained
me with other Members Priſoners under them two or
three moneths; and that after this pretended force of the
Apprentices, (no wayes parallel to theirs, who were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
raiſed to guard us, not ſeclude us) which they ſo
much condemned; and the <hi>Speaker</hi> himſelf in his printed
Letter of <hi>July 29.</hi> with the reſt upon their return to the
Houſe in their <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Auguſt 20. 1647.</hi> ſo far brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as to make and declare <hi>all proceedings during their abſence
voyd, by reaſon of it. Therefore what ever other men may do,</hi>
Nedham (to uſe his own words, p. 29.) <hi>and his now ſitting
party, the Army-Officers</hi> and all their adherents, <hi>muſt hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
be ſilent, and for ſhame lay their mouthes in the duſt for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as to this particular.</hi> For, if our falſly pretended en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging,
conniving at this unarmed ſodain tumult of the
<hi>Apprentices</hi> in July, 1647. were a ſufficient ground for our
ſecluſion from the Houſe as infringers of our <hi>trusts;</hi> then
their evident, apparent fore-plotted encouraging, conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at and juſtifying the Armies force upon the Houſe it
ſelf and the XI. <hi>Members</hi> twice or thrice, <hi>Anno 1647.</hi> and

Lords, 1648. and now again on Mr: P: and others of them
<hi>May 7. &amp; 9. 1659.</hi> muſt for ever diſable and ſeclude them
to ſit or act as Members in the Houſe, by their own Law
and Plea.</p>
            <p>3ly. All the reſt of his <hi>Objections, p: 29, 30.</hi> (taken out
of the Officers Anſwer, Jan: 3.) as they concern not Mr:
<hi>Prynne,</hi> being then no Member; ſo they were ſo ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
anſwered, refelled as moſt <hi>falſe and ſcandalous,</hi> by the
<hi>ſecured and ſecluded Members</hi> themſelves, in their <hi>Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in anſwer thereunto, printed 1649: <hi>p. 7,</hi> to 22. that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency
it ſelf might bluſh to revive them now: to which
I referr the Reader for ſatisfaction. Only whereas the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
then, and <hi>Nedham</hi> now Object, <hi>That the</hi> Malignant <hi>and</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:115450:6"/>
Neutral <hi>party in the Houſe to gain the Major Vote, upon new
elections, by indirect means, brought in a floud of</hi> Malignants <hi>or</hi>
Neuters <hi>into the Houſe;</hi> I ſhall adde to what the ſecluded
Members then replied unto this forged <hi>Aſperſion</hi> in their
<hi>Vindication, p. 7, 8.</hi> Firſt, That all the <hi>ſecluded Members</hi> came
in upon fair and unqueſtionable elections, upon the new
recruit; but many of thoſe who ſate both before, at, and
after our ſecluſion, upon <hi>most foul ones,</hi> voted voyd long
before by the <hi>Committee of Privileges,</hi> as <hi>Humfry Edwards,</hi>
and <hi>Fryes</hi> elections were, continued ſitting. 2. That moſt
of theſe new Members were brought in by the force, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and menaces of the <hi>Army,</hi> and ſolicitation of their <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor
General</hi> and Chaplain, <hi>Hugh Peters;</hi> who like an <hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biquitary,</hi>
was preſent at the elections for moſt Counties,
Cities and Boroughs throughout <hi>England,</hi> and well bribed
for his pains, to <hi>Canvas</hi> for voices for the <hi>Armies Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
3ly. That 22 of thoſe 42 Members called in by the
Army-Officers, <hi>May 7. 1659.</hi> and above half of thoſe who
ſat with them ſince, came in upon this new Recruit of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants</hi>
and <hi>Neuters.</hi> 4ly. Col: <hi>Ireton, Harriſon, Skippon,
Rich, Ludlow, Ingoldesby, Mountague, White, Sydenham, Bing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Jones,</hi> yea <hi>Fleetwood</hi> himſelf, (the ſwaying <hi>Army-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
when we were ſecluded, and chief Actors in it) came
all in upon theſe New elections; ſome of them being prime
<hi>Authors, Members</hi> of this New <hi>Convention</hi> invited in <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi>
name and Army-Officers to ſit, and authors of our
new ſecluſion: Therfore the <hi>Armies</hi> and <hi>Nedhams</hi> ſlander of
our pretended <hi>filling the houſe upon the new recruit</hi> with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants</hi>
(as theſe have proved to us at leaſt) muſt recoyl
wholly upon themſelves, as ſuch, and be a real ground for
their, not our ſecluſions. Laſtly, if our filling the Houſe
by New Elections to get a Major Vote, were a Crime de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meriting
ſecluſion from it: Certainly their emptying the
Houſe then and now to get a Major vote by ſecluding
moſt of the Members, muſt be a Crime and practice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meriting
an expulſion.</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>Army-Officers</hi> themſelves in their very <hi>anſwer,</hi>
waved all theſe Calumnies, as no ground of our ſecluſion;
declaring to the ſitting Members; <hi>That the ſole ground of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115450:7"/>
our ſecluſion, was, The Vote we paſſed upon the long nights de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: <hi>That the Anſwers of the King to the Propoſitions
of both Houſes, was a ground for the Houſe to procéed
upon for the ſettlement of the Peace of the Kingdom:</hi>

nights ſolemn debate, without dividing the Houſe,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Armies march to the very doors. Hereupon the
<hi>Army-Officers</hi> (to wreſt both the <hi>Regal</hi> and <hi>Parliamental
power,</hi> &amp; Kings Revenues into their own hands, prevent all
hopes of future peace, ſettlement, and involve us in endleſs
<hi>wars, changes, revolutions,</hi> as viſible ſad experience hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnced

of both Houſes, guarding all acceſſes to them; where

or <hi>Parliamentary Conventicle</hi> whatſoever; <hi>was a breach
of our Parliamentary truſts, and a cloſing with the King upon his

have yeelded up &amp; betrayed our lives, liberties, and whole cauſe
contested for into the Kings tyrannical power,</hi> as theſe <hi>Army-Officers,</hi>
and this impudent <hi>Mountebank</hi> moſt ſcandalouſly
affirm, let their own conſciences and our whole 3 Nations
judge; the <hi>ſecured and ſecluded Members in their Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and I, in My <hi>Speech in Parliament,</hi> and <hi>Epiſtle</hi> before it,
having ſo largely reſuted it, that the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf (the

               <hi>Father of lies)</hi> would bluſh to revive ſuch a <hi>Lie and
Slander</hi> as this: And how deſtructive it is and hath been
not only to the privileges and freedom, but being of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
for Soldiers and thoſe who are no Members,
without hearing or accuſation, to <hi>pull the Major part</hi> of the
Members out of the Houſe, only for voting according to
their conſciences, after free and full debates, againſt the
votes or deſigns of the leſſer, inconſiderabler part confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating
with the Army; let all wiſe men, and the ſad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
thereof ever ſince, determin.</p>
            <p>6ly. Theſe Army-Officers never impeached any of the
then ſecluded Members for breach of their truſts, to thoſe
few ſitting Members they left behind of their own party,
by way of Charge or Article, to which they might give a
legal anſwer, and be brought to a publike trial; and when
they were preſſed to <hi>charge ſome of them</hi> they ſecured as the
greateſt Delinquents in this kind, <hi>with particular breaches
of their truſts,</hi> they anſwered, <hi>They had yet no charge at all
ready againſt any of them, but hoped to provide one in due time;</hi>
which they never did to this day. As for their ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<hi>Anſwer,</hi> Jan: 3. being no legal <hi>Charge</hi> againſt the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
but a pittiful falſe excuſe of their own <hi>breach of truſt,
faith, duty in ſeiſing and ſecluding them;</hi> Mr. Prynne in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
in his <hi>Epiſtle to his Speech,</hi> and the other <hi>Members</hi> in
their <hi>Vindication,</hi> gave ſuch a ſatisfactory Anſwer to all the
Calumnies in it, as they never yet replyed to: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
muſt ſtand clear from this <hi>Scandalum Magnum &amp; Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum</hi>
in the ſight of God and Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly. Sundry of the Members ſitting ſince our ſecluſion,
and now again, have confeſſed to me; that our</hi> ſecluſion
was moſt unjust; and that their forcible ſecluſions ſince, April
20. 1659. and in 1654. was but a juſt retaliation and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God upon them, for conſenting to our unjust ſecluſion in
<hi>December 1648. yea, a</hi> means to deprive us from all future
hopes of a free Parliament, ſo long as we had any standing Army
in England. <hi>And yet muſt we be guilty of breach of truſt?</hi>

<hi>publikely acknowledged in the Houſe, in a long</hi>

Speech, <hi>that he and others of the</hi> Army <hi>who had a hand in
ſecuring and ſecluding us, were</hi> ſeduced <hi>and inſtigated
thereunto by</hi> Cromwels <hi>(and</hi> Iretons) ſuggeſtions; that wee
were diſhoneſt men, who purſued our own private intereſts and
the Kings, to the prejudice of the publike: But afterwards he
clearly diſcerned, <hi>That we were very honeſt Gentlemen,
purſuing nothing but the publike Intereſt;</hi> acting accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

in publike; and hoped they would all forgive him,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a hand in ſecluding us: <hi>which he oft repeated. And

<hi>That the Houſe doth approve of the Subſtance of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

For 1. it approves only the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the Armies

without once vouchſafing to ſee us, ſending us away thence

it in my Narrative,</hi> p. 24, to 34. Adding, <hi>How Néedleſſe
that long Diſcourſe is, to prove what we never denied.</hi> But
though he, and his <hi>wee,</hi> denied it not; yet thoſe who ſate
from 1648. till 1653. by pretext of their firſt writs, electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and of this Act, as they then affirmed in and by their
<hi>Speeches, Declarations;</hi> Mr. <hi>Abbot</hi> and <hi>Purefoye,</hi> in their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115450:10"/>
               <hi>Prynne</hi> againſt <hi>Prynne,</hi> (both of them Members, and one of
them now ſitting) with their Preſident <hi>John Bradſhaw,</hi>
who condemned the King, and ſundry denyed it; yea moſt
now ſitting <hi>denyed</hi> it by words and action; therefore I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerably
refelled them, and ſatisfied moſt others by that
long Diſcourſe: Therefore it was not <hi>needleſs,</hi> as this <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
raſhly cenſures it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nedham,</hi> p. 35, 36, 37. though he confeſſeth; <hi>That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law the Parliament was diſſolved by the
Kings death; and that whiles the old Constitution of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
remained without disturbance it is reaſon this Law
ſhould be retained,</hi> for the reaſons I have rendered: Yet
in <hi>this particular caſe,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>warr between King and
Parliament,</hi> he will by no means yeeld the Parliament to be
diſſolved by the Kings death, but to remain intirely in the
Members ſitting at his death; and that it is now <hi>again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived</hi>
in them, after above 6. years <hi>interruption:</hi> to prove
which ſtrange <hi>Chymaera,</hi> by ſtronger <hi>Mediums,</hi> he<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 35, to 42.</note> ſpends
ſome <hi>pages,</hi> to <hi>convince and ſatisfie all Contradictors.</hi> I ſhall
a little examin his abſurd and moſt dangerous Principles
from whence he draws his Concluſion. His main Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to prove it, is this.</p>
            <p>That the King by his actual war against the Parliament, did
thereupon forfeit his Kingſhip and Crown, and became a private
perſon and enemy; <hi>diſſolved the Conſtitution both of the
Kingdom and Parliament;</hi> and not only violated all Law in
the branches, <hi>but plucked up the very root of it, in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Parliamentary Eſtabliſhment,</hi> as much as in him
lay, and thereby introduced another Law <hi>of Arms. From
whence he deduceth 3. Concluſions:</hi> 1 The Justice of ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Members: <hi>2ly,</hi> The Sufficiency of the authority that
condemned and executed the King: <hi>3ly,</hi> The Legality of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
Members continuing and ſitting as the Parliament, and
Supreme Authority of <hi>England,</hi> which after the Kings behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and other Members and Lords ſecluſion, deſcended and was
tranſmitted to them by the Law of war, for the people. <hi>This he
determines to be Law and Reaſon too,</hi> ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
both <hi>Royalliſts and Presbyterians</hi> of the <hi>Lawfulnes
of the Power,</hi> and preſent ſitting, acting <hi>as a Parliament,</hi>
by thoſe few Members at Weſtminster, <hi>ſecluding all the reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:115450:10"/>
To which I anſwer: 1. That if the Kings death by <hi>Law,
Reaſon,</hi> diſſolved the Parliament in an orderly cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his writs of ſummons <hi>abated by his death,</hi> &amp; they could
<hi>not treat with him concerning his and his Kingdoms affairs, nor
he conſent to any Bills after his deceaſe:</hi> Which he freely
grants: Then by the ſelf-ſame Reaſon, Law, his violent
death muſt diſſolve this Parliament, as I have largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
2ly, If the Kings levying war againſt the Parliament,
did actually diſſolve the very Conſtitution, Law of the
Parliament and Kingdom, and made him no King at all,
but a private perſon; which he layes for his foundation;
then it muſt neceſſarily diſſolve the Parliament and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
too, and make them no Parliament, no Kingdom
at all, as well as himſelf no King. For how can the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
continue, when <hi>its very Conſtitution is diſſolved?</hi>
3ly, By this Poſition it inevitably follows, that we had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
King, Parliament, Kingdom, nor any Laws at all but
only of Warr, from the beginning of the wars or firſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
at leaſt, between the Kings and Parliaments forces
many years before his death; But this the King, kingdom,
Parliament, the ſitting as well as ſecluded Members, both
Armies, and our whole 3. kingdoms ever denied in all
their Votes, Orders, Ordinances, Declarations, Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances,
Petitions, Treaties, Propoſitions whatſoever from
1641. till <hi>December 1648.</hi> and <hi>Nedham</hi> himſelf in his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnalls</hi>
and <hi>Mercuries;</hi> In all which the Parliament, both
Houſes, and Army-Officers ſtiled him their <hi>KING,</hi> and the
King and his party ever ſtiled them <hi>the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Therefore this poſition muſt be a moſt <hi>Notorious
Falthood,</hi> wherein <hi>Interest doth groſly lie.</hi> 4ly. Thoſe he
ſtiles the <hi>honest faithfull Members,</hi> in their very Votes of <hi>Non
addreſſes</hi> (paſſed by force and fraud) in their <hi>Knack</hi> for the
<hi>Kings tryal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Impeachment,</hi> Proceedings, Sentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
againſt him, after our ſecluſion, in their <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of 17 <hi>Martii</hi> 1648. after his death, and ſundry other
Papers, ever ſtiled and acknowledged him TO BE KING,
and <hi>ENGLAND</hi> HIS KINGDOM, notwithſtanding the
wars between him and the Parliament: Therefore the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
war did not <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nking,</hi> nor make him a <hi>Private perſon,</hi> nor
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115450:11"/>
diſſolve the <hi>Conſtitution of the Kingdom and Parliament:</hi> elſe
there could not be <hi>a war</hi> againſt or between the <hi>King</hi> or
<hi>Parliament,</hi> if the war it ſelf unkinged him, unparliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, and diſſolved all their <hi>conſtitutions.</hi> 5ly. No

               <hi>Law of God, Nature, Nations,</hi> the <hi>Great

               <hi>tryal, conviction, judgement, attainder:</hi> Much leſs then
the King himſelf, the Supreme Magiſtrate, and Governor
of the Realm (in whom all have a common intereſt) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinged
and made a private perſon, or publike Enemy, and
totally deprived of his Crown and Soveraignty: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his actual levying war againſt the Parliament, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
before any legal impeachment, conviction, or ſentence
of depoſition, could not unking nor make him a private
perſon, as the caſes of <hi>Edward</hi> the 2. and <hi>Richard</hi> the 2.
and the<note n="b" place="margin">See my Plea for the Lords, p. 424, to 460.</note> Parliaments which deprived them of their
Kingſhips after their reſignations, clearly reſolved, againſt
this <hi>Jeſuitical new Doctrine.</hi> 6ly. If the King by his bare le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
war againſt the Parliament, actually loſt his Kingſhip
and became a meer private perſon before any ſentence of
deprivation, then by the ſelf-ſame reaſon, law, every Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
levying war or conſpiring againſt the King, every
Murderer, Theef, Felon, corrupt Judge, Juſtice, Mayor,
Sherif, Inferior Officer, by the very committing of Treaſon,
Murder, Felony, Adultery, Bribery, Injuſtice, and breach
of their reſpective truſts, ſhould be actually attainted of
thoſe offences, their Lands, Offices preſently confiſcated,
without any Indictment, trial, verdict, judgement againſt
them: yea every act of Adultery by any Husband or Wife
ſhould actually diſſolve the bond of marriage for ever,
without and before any Sentence of divorce between
them: which<note n="*" place="margin">In his Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh.</note> Mr. <hi>Wheatly</hi> publikely recanted as a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
error. And how deſtructive ſuch new <hi>Nedham, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
Law</hi> would prove to all mens lives, liberties, eſtates,
yea to every mans ſoul (ſince every act of ſinne by like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
ſhould actually damn, and make even Saints
themſelves to fall totally and finally from Grace and Gods
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115450:11"/>
favor) let all judicious men reſolve. 7ly. If this be Law,
then had the King and Parliament upon any Treaty after
the wars accorded; he ought to have been new proclamed,
inſtalled, crowned King again; and the Parliament reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
by new writs. 8ly. He confeſſeth this to be the very
principle of <hi>Barclay</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> from whom he borrows it,
<hi>p. 34.</hi> Therefore his preſent Parliament and Republike
built thereon, are <hi>purely Jeſuitical</hi> by his own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
9ly. This <hi>Jeſuits</hi> poſition is not ſo bad as his; He ſpeaks
not of every Civil war made by a King upon his Subjects,
for which there may be <hi>juſt occaſions;</hi> but only <hi>of a King
warring upon his people of purpoſe to extirpate and deſtroy them:</hi>
which he ſaith, <hi>it ſeems almost impoſsible any King ſhould be
ſo mad as ever to attempt.</hi> Which the King in his <hi>war againſt
the Parliament,</hi> by his victories, proceedings againſt the
Priſoners, Members, Towns he took during the wars, in
ſparing all their lives actually, really, and oft times verbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and profeſſedly diſclamed in all his Proclamations,
Speeches, Remonſtrances, Meſſages to, and Treaties with
the Houſes. Therefore his war againſt them, did neither
<hi>unking</hi> him, nor make him a <hi>private perſon</hi> and <hi>publike Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
by this <hi>Jeſuites</hi> reſolution. 10ly. If the Kings war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Parliament did really unking him; then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Generals, Army-Officers, and Armies actual levying
war upon both Houſes of Parliament, by ſecluding, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Members and King, did really uncommiſſion and
unarmy them, and made them <hi>no Officers,</hi> no <hi>Army</hi> at all,
but a <hi>rebellious rout;</hi> and all Members concurring with them
therein, no <hi>Members,</hi> no <hi>Parliament</hi> at all. The ſequel is
infallible. Therefore <hi>Nedham</hi> muſt either now diſclaim
this deſperate <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> poſition, with all his 3. <hi>Treaſonable
Concluſions</hi> from it; or elſe henceforth <hi>diſclame</hi> the <hi>Army-Officers,
Army,</hi> and their <hi>formerly</hi> ſuppreſſed, now revived
Parliament. 11ly. Admit his Paradox true, that the King
by his war againſt the Parliament, actually ceaſed to be a
King, &amp;c. yet his Inference thence, that the <hi>Parliament was
not diſſolved by his death, but continued after it,</hi> is moſt falſe;
yea the contrary thence inevitably follows, that it was
wholly diſſolved long before his death, ſo ſoon as he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115450:12"/>
to be a King and became a private perſon; and that by
the expreſſe reſolution of the <hi>whole Parliaments</hi> of 22 R. 2.
and 1. H. 4. rot. Parl. n. 1, 2, 3. in a caſe moſt like to ours.
<note n="*" place="margin">See Speed, Truſſel, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſhed, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham, Hall, Stow, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in R. 2. &amp; H. 4. My Plea for the Lords, p. 424, to 456.</note> 
               <hi>Henry Duke of Lancaſter,</hi> raiſing a great Army to lay Title
to the Crown, King <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d. bringing an Army to
ſuppreſſe him; the King finding his forces over-weak, and
the Dukes too potent for him, having ſeiſed <hi>Bristol,</hi> and
other ſorts; thereupon a <hi>Parlee</hi> was had between them,
and agreed, King <hi>Richard</hi> ſhould ſummon a Parliament at
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> wherein he ſhould <hi>reſign his Crown, renounce his
Kingſhip, and the Duke to ſucceed him.</hi> Upon this he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
ſummoned a Parliament, where he formally reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
renounced his Kingſhip, and was actually depoſed of
it by ſentence, and <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. who claimed the Crown
upon his reſignation, <hi>declared King.</hi> Which done, it <hi>was
reſolved, declared both by the Parliament, King, Lords, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
Judges, that this Parliament was actually diſſolved by
King</hi> Richards <hi>depoſing to all intents; and a new Parliament
ordered to be ſummoned by King</hi> Henry <hi>in his own name, wherein
he was declared, crowned King, and the reſignation, depoſing of</hi>
Richard <hi>the 2. ratified,</hi> and recorded. Therefore by the
reſolution of both theſe Parliaments, (by <hi>Nedhams</hi> own
poſition, if true) the laſt Parliament of King <hi>Charles,</hi> was
ſo farr from being continued only by his wars, even after
his death, which elſe would have diſſolved it without
diſpute, that it actually diſſolved it in his life time, ſix
years before his death, by degrading him from his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and making him a private perſon. And then his <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter
Juncto</hi> ſitting from 1648. to 1653. and now again,
cannot have the leaſt ſhadow of right, law, reaſon, to ſit,
act as any part of the laſt Parliament ſummoned by the
King, neither could the whole Parliamentary and ſupreme
power <hi>deſcend or be transferred to them alone by any Law or
colour of right whatſoever,</hi> by the Kings war, death, or our
ſecluſions, as he moſt abſurdly concludes. 12ly. The
ſum of all <hi>Nedhams</hi> diſcourſe to ſupport his preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
and Republikes right, title, is but this: <hi>That in
civil wars and commotions the conquering or prevailing party
gains a legal Supreme Authority and Parliamentary power over
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115450:12"/>
over the whole: That the Kings royal authority devolved by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
to the Parliament: the whole Parliamentary Authority to
his Juncto by their forcible ſecluſion of the Majority of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and ſuppreſſion of the Houſe of Lords.</hi> And if ſo, then
by the ſelf-ſame conſequence; the whole Kingly and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamental
Authority was lawfully devolved on the Lord
General <hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Army-Officers</hi> when they ſeiſed the
King, ſecluded the Members, ſuppreſſed the Lords, and
placed Guards on thoſe that ſate in 1648. Or at leaſt to
ſuch of them as were then Members of the Commons
Houſe; not to the <hi>Juncto</hi> ſince or now ſitting; That after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it deſcended, devolved to General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> when
he conquered and turned the <hi>Juncto</hi> out of doors, <hi>April 20.
1653.</hi> as he and the Army-Officers then argued; who
thereupon (after ſome Moneths exerciſe thereof by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>New Laws,</hi> and impoſing <hi>New Taxes</hi> at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
1653.) afterwards transferred it by deed to their <hi>Litle
Conventicle</hi> elected by them in <hi>September,</hi> part of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
back their <hi>Supreme power</hi> to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> he thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
claimed it as wholly and <hi>abſolutely veſted ia himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any limits</hi> (as he declared in his printed <hi>Speeches 1654.</hi>
and 1657.) whereupon he detained it under the Title of
A ROYAL PROTECTOR, till his death, then delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it to his Son <hi>Richard,</hi> who by this original Title en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
it; till overpowred by his <hi>Brother Fleetwood</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Army-Officers,</hi> who by this right of the <hi>Long Sword</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
unprotectored him, and then called in the remainder
of the <hi>Old Juncto</hi> to ſit and act as a <hi>Parliament</hi> under them.
So that by <hi>Nedhams</hi> Doctrine, the <hi>Supreme Regal and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamental
power</hi> is legally reſiding in thoſe <hi>Army-Officers</hi> who
have conquered all the reſt, till ſome other greater, ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
power ſhall be able to conquer them; and his <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter
Conventicle</hi> is but their Subſtitute to act, vote what
they ſhall preſcribe. And by the ſelf-ſame principle, as
the Army-Officers by rebelling againſt and ſuppreſſing the
Parliament and their Maſters, who raiſed, waged them for
their defence, contrary to all Laws of God, man, their
own Oathes, Commiſſions, thereby gained a juſt and legal
Title (as he argues) to the Supreme Regal and Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115450:13"/>
Authority of the Nation (not the people in whom they
pretended it to be veſted) ſo any Traytor by killing or
diſpoſſeſſing his lawfull Soveraign, any Son by killing or
diſſeiſing his Father, any Servant by impriſoning, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or turning, keeping his Maſter out of doors, every
Theef, plunderer in the world, able by force to take away
any perſons purſe, goods, houſe, lands, or ſhall by power
make himſelf a Judge, Juſtice, Magiſtrate, or take away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
mans wife, ſhall have a juſt and legal Title againſt
the owners and all others: and <hi>Nedhams</hi> Parliament and
new Republike can neither condemn nor execute any
Thief, Pirate, Murderer, Plunderer, Adulterer, Raviſher,
nor puniſh any diſſeiſer or wrong-doer whatſoever that
was ſtronger than the party injured; ſince they all may ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
their force, actions, to be lawfull againſt the letter of
the 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 Commandements by the ſelf-ſame
Law, Divinity, Saintlike Title of the <hi>longeſt Sword,</hi> the
greateſt might, and prevailing party. I hope by this time,
he and all others clearly diſcern the deſperate fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of his <hi>Jeſuitical poſition,</hi> and that his <hi>Intereſt will not
lie,</hi> is but a meer ſink of <hi>Lies,</hi> and deſtructive paradoxes.</p>
            <p>If all this will not help to prop up the legal Soveraign
Authority of his preſent <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Republike,</hi> he hath
3. other Pillars to ſupport them, p. 37. 1. The <hi>Law of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,</hi>
a pretty bull, when as the old proverb reſolves, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitas
non habet legem;</hi> I am ſure it will now admit of no
Law, Juſtice, Conſcience, Equity. 2. Did not the beheaded
King plead this Law for <hi>Ship-money, Exciſe,</hi> and other ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
projects? yet the long<note n="a" place="margin">See the Acts, Votes, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</note> 
               <hi>Parliament</hi> adjudged <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
in theſe caſes, to be <hi>no Law,</hi> nor <hi>Plea at all.</hi> And ſhall
thoſe very Members plead it in their own caſe now, who
then judged it no <hi>Law</hi> nor <hi>Plea</hi> in his? 3ly. This Law was
pleaded by <hi>Cromwel</hi> and the <hi>Army-Officers</hi> in April 1653.
for the <hi>diſſolution</hi> of thoſe now ſitting, who together with
<hi>Nedham,</hi> p. 40. reſolve it no Law or Plea at all; and
can it be juſtly urged now for their <hi>reſtitution?</hi> 4ly. It is
a pretext for all <hi>villany, treachery, impiety, violence</hi> being
acted in the world, as I have proved in my <hi>Epistle to my
Speech,</hi> and the <hi>ſecluded Members</hi> in their <hi>Vindication,</hi> when
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115450:13"/>
the Officers pretended it for our <hi>ſecluſion;</hi> and can it then
be made the foundation of <hi>Commonwealths</hi> and its Junctoes
conſtitution? 5ly. He addes out of <hi>Grotius, l. 2. de Jure
Belli, cap. 6. Neceſſitas ſumma reducit res ad merum jus natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae.</hi>
If ſo, and we are now reduced to ſuch a neceſſity, as he
argues: then it followes, 1. That this extreme neceſſity
<hi>which exempts any part of a Kingdom, Republike, City from the
power, juriſdiction of the whole,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> there reſolves, hath
much more exempted our whole three Kingdoms, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Lords Houſe and Nobility, the Majority of the old
Commons Houſe yet ſurviving, with all Counties, Cities,
Boroughs for which they ſerved; from the power, juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the preſent <hi>uſurping Juncto, Army,</hi> ſo that they
have no right, authority, colour at all to impoſe any new
<hi>Laws, Taxes, Militiaes, Exciſes</hi> on all or any of them; nor
yet to impriſon, ſequeſter, puniſh any of them for defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves by force of arms againſt their unjuſt uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
over them. 2ly. That they can impoſe no new
Government or Republike on all or any of them, without
their own free voluntary elections, conſents; becauſe all
politick Governments and Corporations <hi>are and ought to be
made by voluntary contract and free conſent of all the parts, ac
propterea jus ejus, in partes ex primae va voluntate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiendum
eſt,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> there reſolves. 3ly. That all the
integral parts of any politick body, when the firſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Government which united them into a Kingdom
or Republike is diſſolved (as <hi>Nedham</hi> aſſerts our <hi>Kingdom</hi>
and <hi>Parliament</hi> are) by the meer right and Law of Nature
have as inſeparable, inherent a right, vote to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into another new form of Government, as any one
prevailing party of that body, being all equally men, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen,</hi>
free-men by Nature, and having no ſuperiority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
each other. Therefore the Supreme authority and
Parliamentary power in our <hi>preſent condition</hi> and <hi>extreme
neceſſity</hi> by <hi>Grotius</hi> his deciſion is not devolved to the <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster
Juncto,</hi> or <hi>Army-Officers,</hi> as <hi>Nedham</hi> abſurdly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
againſt his Oracle <hi>Grotius,</hi> but to the <hi>generality of
the people,</hi> as this very <hi>Juncto</hi> voted Jan: 6. 1648. and the
<hi>Army-Officers</hi> declared, in their <hi>Agreement of the people</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115450:14"/>
to them November 20. 1648. and Jan. 20. 1649.
Therefore by their own Votes, reſolutions, practices, the
generality of the people, not the <hi>Juncto,</hi> are now the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
authoritie;</hi> and thoſe 50 or 60 Members of the old
Parliament and Army, have not the leaſt pretext of Right,
Law, Reaſon, power to domineer over all the Nobility,
Gentry, Clergy, Freemen of the Nation, and the ſecluded
Members, nor totally to ſeclude them all from their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
Company; muchleſſe to ſecure, diſarm, plunder them
at their pleaſures, to double, treble their Taxes, to uſe
them not like their <hi>fellow freemen,</hi> but their <hi>Aegyptian bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves,</hi>
as now they do. What ſuch an Extremity, Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may put then our whole three Nations juſtly upon by
<hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Nedhams</hi> Law too, let them wiſely and timely
conſider for their own and the publike ſafety.</p>
            <p>His 2. Pillar is this of <hi>Grotius,</hi> That <hi>In a civil warr, the
written and eſtabliſhed Laws of Nations are of no force;</hi> (In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we now finde it true by ſad experience under our
<hi>New Legifers</hi> and Tax-maſters) <hi>and then that only is to be
admitted Law, which ſhall be ſetled by the prevailing
party.</hi> How this new doctrine will ſuit with all our late
Parliamentary Votes, Ordinances, Declarations, Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances,
Proteſtations, League, Covenant, Soldiers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions,
and Army-Remonſtrances; or with our Civil
war, which was only for the <hi>preſervation and defence of our
antient fundamental Laws, Statutes, and Great Charter of our
Liberties, against all arbitrary encroachments, alterations, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of them;</hi> Or with the <hi>Junctoes</hi> Declaration, March
17. 1648. for turning our Kingdom into a Free State;
wherein they promiſe over and over, <hi>inviolably to defend
and maintain theſe antient Laws, The Badges of our Frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the moſt excellent of all other Laws in the world, by
violation, alteration, or abrogation whereof greater miſchiefs
would inevitably befall us, than ever we ſuffered under our Kings
and Kingly Government:</hi> Or how it will accord with their
Proclamation, May 7. 1659. to like purpoſe; let <hi>Nedham,</hi>
and that power for which he pleads reſolve us: To whoſe
arbitrary wills and tyranny (if this monſtrous paradox be
<hi>Oracle)</hi> he proſtrates all our Laws and Liberties, after
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115450:14"/>
full 17 years bloody conteſts, and moſt cruel Concertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for their Defence, againſt this his poſition and <hi>prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His 3. pillar is this, which he applies to the particular
caſe of the ſecluded Members, p. 37. <hi>Si qui jure ſuo uti non
poſſunt, eorum jus accreſcit praeſentibus:</hi> Grotius l. 2. c. 5. His
meaning is, that if any Members of a Senate, Court or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
be abſent through ſickneſs, or any other voluntary
or neceſſary occaſions, the reſt may ſit and act: will it
thence follow, as this <hi>Mountebank</hi> argues, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Minor
part of the Commons Houſe may ſit and act now and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
not only as a Commons Houſe, but abſolute Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
becauſe they and the Army forcibly ſecluded
the Major part, the whole Houſe of Lords, and beheaded
King. Such a groſſe <hi>Nonſequitur</hi> as this, is no better ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
from <hi>Grotius</hi> words, than this; The Army may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
ſeclude all but 5. or 6, of thoſe now ſitting, or leave
<hi>Fleetwood,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> alone: <hi>Ergo,</hi> in ſuch a caſe
the whole right and power of the Parliament accrues to
them alone, and they may ſit, vote as a Parliament, and
make what Laws, Acts, and impoſe what Taxes, Exciſes
they pleaſe, as <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his <hi>Council</hi> did at <hi>Whitehall</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſelf-ſame ground. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>no abſurdo dato mille ſequun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>You ſee now by this time the falſhood, abſurdity, and
dangerous conſequences of</hi> Nedhams Atheiſtical, Jeſuitical
<hi>Principles, whereon he would bottom the</hi> continuance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival,
juſtice, legality <hi>of his pretended</hi> Parliament, <hi>and</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike,
<hi>laying a</hi> ground for, <hi>and</hi> encouraging all diſorders,
confuſions, violences, treacheries and villanies whatſoever by the
Law of Neceſſity and the longeſt ſword: and what a neceſſary
Tool he is for the party, becauſe he can ſay or print any thing for
them, though never ſo falſe, abſurd, miſchievous, and yet not be
in danger of his head: <hi>(they are his own expreſſions, p. 32.
37.) I ſhall inform him of ſome other</hi> Principles <hi>preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to all Saints, Chriſtians, and Souldiers, by God and
Chriſt himſelf, which they ought to follow under pain of
damnation. The firſt is Mat. 7. 12.</hi> All things whatſoever
ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them, for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115450:15"/>
this is the Law and the Prophets. <hi>The 2. is Mat. 22. 21.</hi>
Render therefore to Caeſar the things that are Caeſars, and unto
God the things that are Gods. <hi>The 3. i, Luke 3. 14.</hi> Do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to no man, neither accuſe any falſly, and be content with
your wages. <hi>The 4. is Rom. 13. 7, 8.</hi> Render therefore to all
their dues, &amp;c. Owe nothing to any man, but love one another.
<hi>The 5. is Prov. 24. 21.</hi> My Son, fear thou the Lord and the
King, and meddle not with thoſe who are given to change. <hi>The
6. is Pſ. 4. 8.</hi> Whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are
honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are lovely,
whatſoever things are of good report, do. <hi>And if he can found
his preſent or former Parliament, Republike, or</hi> Intereſt
<hi>will not lie, and forecited Concluſions on theſe Principles,
I ſhall be his Proſelyte; till then I cannot, I dare not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not follow him in his <hi>Wild-gooſe</hi> chaſe any further,
to prove the old Parliament undiſſolved, and now revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
what he writes of<note n="*" place="margin">Page 40, 41.</note> 
               <hi>Cromwels Parliaments</hi> and <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
during the <hi>preternatural dead Interval</hi> from April 53.
to May 59. <hi>That they had not the legal force and vertue of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments:
That they were nothing in Law of themſelves, being
creatures of another extraction:</hi> (though he writ the quite
contrary in his life-time) <hi>That the Members of this revived
Parliament ſitting in them, did not own them for legal Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
That their ſitting in them as Parliaments, could not
prejudice nor conclude the Body now ſitting, becanſe a body of men
in equal power and right, cannot be concluded by particular acts
done by their own Members without conſent of the reſt; And that
though they did not own thoſe Parliaments, nor the power that
called them, yet their many and great complaints of their being
ſecluded from them</hi> (by force, or new Oathes) <hi>as an infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Peoples right in Parliament, were juſt, and they
might well complain, becauſe their complaint of violation was
grounded only upon the General Right inherent in the
People,</hi> will fully manifeſt the Parliament of King <hi>Charles</hi>
to be fully diſſolved by his death, notwithſtanding any
private Members ſitting in it afterwards, his pretended
Parliament of Commons then and now ſitting, to be no
Parliament at all, nor yet revived in Law or verity; that yet
M. <hi>Prynne</hi> and other Members, might <hi>juſtly complain</hi> of their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115450:15"/>
forcible ſecluſion from it, in <hi>the peoples general inherent right,</hi>
as themſelves did when ſecluded from <hi>Cromwels</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which they held void and null. And that if it be
ſtill in being, and was <hi>only ſuſpended</hi> by <hi>Cromwels 6.</hi> years
force, in reſpect only of the actual exerciſe of their power,
not their inherent right, which is now revived: All the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<hi>Members, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Charls Stewart</hi> too, ought in
right and juſtice to be recalled and remitted to their
rights, from which they were forcibly interrupted, as
well as thoſe now ſitting, having no legal power, ground,
nor colour to ſeclude them, as I have already proved.</p>
            <p>To cloze up this Queſtion, I ſhall propoſe this <hi>Dilemma</hi>
to my diſſenting Opponents. If the old Parliament were
totally and finally diſſolved by the Kings death, as <hi>Rogers</hi>
confeſſeth, and <hi>Nedham</hi> grants in point of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Reaſon:</hi>
Then thoſe few Commons ſitting after his death, and now
again, cannot poſſibly be a Parliament, nor Committee of
Parliament in any ſence. 1. Becauſe never ſummoned by
any writ to any ſuch Parl. as this. 2. Becauſe never elected,
intruſted by the people, who elected the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the old Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to ſit in this, or any other Parliament, without a
King and Houſe of Lords. 3ly. Becauſe not new elected
by their old electors, or any other Counties, Cities, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs
ſince the Kings death to ſit alone, as then or now
they do. 4ly. Becauſe permitted, deſired to ſit at firſt
only by the Army-Officers, their former mercenary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
and now invited to ſit again only upon ſome of
their motions; having no pretence of Law or right to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
or create them a Parliament, or Repreſentative
of the People of <hi>England:</hi> much leſſe then of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland.</hi> 5ly. Becauſe they are not the fifth part
of a Commons Houſe for number or quality, by our old
Laws, Statutes, or the new <hi>Instrument</hi> or <hi>Advice,</hi> moſt
Counties, Cities, Boroughs of the Nation having not ſo
much as one Knight, Citizen or Burgeſſe in it to repreſent
them, and <hi>Scotland, Ireland</hi> none at all: and ſo by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
own <hi>Declaration</hi> at <hi>St. Albans,</hi> their own <hi>Agreement of
the People,</hi> and own Votes for <hi>An Equal Repreſentative,</hi> can

pardons to Rebells and others who ſlew his faithfull Lords and
Subjects: By ſeiſing, diſpoſing of the Kings Treaſure and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
at their pleaſures; and enforcing the King to grant them a
Commiſſion to manage his Royal affairs, truſt and revenues, in
restraint and derogation of his royal power and prerogative:</hi>
was no leſſe than <hi>High Treaſon by Law:</hi> For ſome of
which <hi>encroachments of Regality, ſome of them were</hi> Baniſhed,
<hi>others of them Beheaded and Executed as Traytors, and
their Eſtates confiſcated by Iudgements and Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
If then the encroaching and uſurping of REGAL
POWER in any of theſe particulars, be no leſſe than HIGH
TREASON by the reſolution of theſe Parliaments, then
queſtionleſſe the uſurpation, exerciſe, not only of Regal
power in the higheſt degree, in calling, creating, diſſolving
Parliaments, giving the royal aſſents to Bils, Pardons, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
Lords, Commons, creating publike Officers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
new Seals, iſſuing out Writs, Commiſſions, making
Warr and Peace, coyning Money, &amp;c. but alſo of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
power too, in making new Laws, Acts, Treaſons,
repealing, altering old Lawes, and forms of Proceſſe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
new Taxes, Exciſes, Forfeitures, <hi>Militiaes,</hi> erecting
new Courts, Judicatures, neither of all which the King
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115450:16"/>
can do by his regal Power, but in and by the Parliament
only, wherein both the Power of the King in its higheſt
orb, and of all the Lords, Commons are united, concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
muſt needs be <hi>the higheſt Treaſon</hi> that poſſibly can
be committed, both againſt the King, Kingdom, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Lords, Commons, People; all injured, uſurped on,
tyrannized over, diſhonored, and oppreſſed thereby in the
higheſt degree. Which ſhould diſcourage, deterr all thoſe
who have any dread of God, Men, or love to Parliaments,
and their Native Country, from uſurping ſuch a power,
as well for their own, as the publick weal.</p>
            <p>If the long Parliament be <hi>ſtill in being and now revived,</hi>
(as <hi>Nedham</hi> pleads, but proves not at all, his own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
evincing the contrary) then all the Lords and ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Members ought in right and Juſtice to be freely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
for the premiſed reaſons; elſe thoſe now ſitting
and acting without them, will incurr the guilt of High
Treaſon for Uſurping both <hi>Regal</hi> and <hi>Parliamental power,</hi>
by meer force, without any Act of Parliament, which an
expreſs Act of Parliament made by aſſent of all the 3. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates

            <p>Having diſpatched theſe grand queſtions, I ſhall be brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in the 4th. being only this.</p>
            <p>Whether the Oathes of Supremacy,<note place="margin">Queſt. 4.</note> Allegiance, and Homage
to the late <hi>King, his Heirs and Succeſſors;</hi> were finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by, and expired at his death?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nedham,</hi> p. 41, 42. and <hi>Rogers,</hi> p. 33. <hi>affirming they are;
becauſe the old form of Kingly Government is lawfully</hi> (as they
ſay) <hi>extinguiſhed, and a new form introduced, and ſo the Oath
impoſſible, becauſe the perſons and things to whom they were made
are at an end:</hi> Which opinion having largely refuted, in
my <hi>Concordia Diſcors,</hi> proving thoſe Oathes to be ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory
and binding, by unanſwerable Scripture-preſidents
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115450:17"/>
and authorities, to which neither of theſe <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
one ſyllable; I ſhall briefly reply to what they object,
1. That the frame of our Kingly Government was not <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
diſſolved,</hi> but <hi>violently</hi> and <hi>trayterouſly interrupted only,</hi>
as he ſaith this Parliament and Republike were by <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi>
intruſion. 2ly. That by the reſolution of our Statutes,
Judges, Laws, which admit no <hi>Interregnum,</hi> we have ſtill a
Kingdom, a King, an Heir and Succeſſor to the Crown in
actual being, (though out of actual, not legal poſſeſſion)
to whom we may and ought to make good our Oathes.
3ly. That our fellow-members and ſubjects who took theſe
Oathes as well as we, can neither abſolve themſelves nor
us by their <hi>perjury</hi> or <hi>treachery</hi> in violating them, by their
late forcible, illegal proceedings, and new Ingagement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King, his Heirs and ſucceſſors. 4ly. That it is
both poſſible, juſt, neceſſary, ſafe, honourable, Chriſtian,
for them and us, and our 3. Kingdoms, Churches, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
to call in the right heir and ſucceſſor to the Crown,
upon honorable <hi>Terms;</hi> there being no obſtacle to it but
only want of will, or the covetouſneſs, rapine, ambition,
guilt or fear of puniſhment in ſome particular perſons in
preſent power, againſt the general deſire and intereſt of our
3. whole Kingdoms, Nations, endangered, embroyled, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
and well-nigh totally ruined, exhauſted by his
long ſecluſion. 5. That theſe Objectors and others ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
neglecting, violating, abſolving themſelves and others
from the conſcientious obligation, legal performance of
theſe ſacred Oathes, obliging themſelves in particular and
the whole Kingdom in general, to the late <hi>King his Heirs
and Succeſſors in perpetuity,</hi> is no argument of their piety,
ſaintſhip, religion, fear of God, honeſty, truth, juſtice, but
of their avowed Atheiſm, Impiety, Injuſtice, contempt of
God, and all his threats, judgments denounced, inflicted
upon Perjured infringers of their Oathes, Covenants to
their King and others. 6ly. That for the violation of theſe
Oathes, the whole three Kingdoms have deeply mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſuffred in ſundry kinds ever ſince 1648. and are now
likely to be ruined by Taxes, Contributions, Oppreſſions
of all ſorts, loſſe of trade, unſeaſonable weather, diſeaſes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115450:17"/>
epidemically reigning, and other judgements. 7ly. That
<hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf the father of all the faithfull; <hi>ſwearing by
God, that he would not deal falſly with</hi> Abimelech, <hi>nor with his
Son, nor with his Sons ſon, but according to the kindneſs he
had done to</hi> Abraham, Gen. 21. 23, 24, &amp;c. and his care to
perform his Oath; hath juſtified not only the lawfulneſs
of all our Oathes to <hi>the King, his heirs and ſucceſſors,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
our Obligation to them all, and how conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
we ought to perform them without <hi>fraud</hi> or <hi>falſhood,</hi>
yea diſowning all thoſe from being of his <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual
ſeed,</hi> who make little conſcience to perform them.
8ly. Thus as the Apoſtle reſolves, Gal. 3. 16, 17. <hi>That the
Covenant made by God to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeed in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Law which was made 430. years after cannot diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null,
that it ſhould make the Promiſe of no effect:</hi> So the
<hi>New Ingagement</hi> made, taken after theſe two Oathes to our
New Governors, and their late Oath to <hi>be Conſtant, as
well as True and Faithfull to their new Republike, without
King, or Single perſon, or Houſe of Lords,</hi> (obliging thoſe
who take it, if binding, not only to ſundry Perjuries, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and conſtant perſeverance in them without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
<hi>cannot diſannull theſe former Oathes</hi> to the King, his
heirs and ſucceſſors, and make them of no effect, as <hi>Rogers</hi>
tells us, which I have elſwhere proved. 9ly. <hi>John Rogers, p.
9.</hi> informs us, that <hi>Cleomines</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> ſware to
his friend <hi>Archonides, that he</hi> would do all things joyntly
with him, and Act nothing without his HEAD
were in it. After which watching his time, <hi>he cut off his
Companions head; and to keep his Covenant, after he had
par boyled it, he kept it by him, honored and preſerved it; and upon
every weighty matter or conſultation would ſet his Scull by
him, and tell it what he purpoſed;</hi> ſaying <hi>that he did not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
his Ingagement, or break his Oath in the leaſt, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he did ever take counſel with the head of Archoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
and did nothing without it.</hi> Verily my Antagoniſts
and thoſe Members they plead for, have dealt more falſly
with the late King, Lords, and their fellow Members, than
<hi>Cleomines</hi> with <hi>Archonides;</hi> they twice Swore, Proteſted,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115450:18"/>
Vowed and Covenanted too over and over, to be true and
faithful to the King, and to act <hi>all things Ioyntly</hi> with him,
the Lords, and their fellow Commons in Parliament, and
tranſact nothing without their heads and advice were in it.
But though afterwards watching their opportunity, they
cut off the <hi>Kings head, and ſome of the Lords,</hi> as he did
his Friends; ſuppreſſed the whole Houſe of Lords, and
ſecluded moſt of their fellow Commoners; yet they do
not ſet either their heads, ſculls, or any of their ſeeming
perſons before them in the Houſe when they conſult upon
every or any weighty matter, nor tell them what they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
And yet they and theſe their Advocates tell us and
others; They doe not violate their Proteſtations, Vows,
Covenants, nor yet break their Oathes. Whether of them
are the greateſt Hypocrites, Impoſtors, let the world now
judge.</p>
            <p>The 5. Queſtion between <hi>J. Rogers</hi> and me alone,<note place="margin">Queſt. 5.</note> is
this.</p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and our forein <hi>Spaniſh, French</hi> and
other <hi>Common Popiſh Adverſaries,</hi> were the <hi>Original Plotters,</hi>
and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-hand fomentors,</hi> of the change of our antient <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
Kingſhip</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> into a NEW COMMON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WEALTH,
and of the late <hi>Exorbitant violent Proceedings</hi>
againſt the <hi>Kings, Parliament, and ſecluded Members, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
this their deſign?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> hath abundantly proved the affirmative by
punctual Teſtimonies out of <hi>Parſons, Campanella, Watſon,
Clerke, Richelieu</hi>'s <hi>Inſtructions, Conte Galeazzo,</hi> the <hi>Lord Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies
and others Letters, Mutatus Polemo,</hi> and other Evidences;
by pregnant <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Demonſtrations,</hi> both <hi>à priori et po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriori,</hi>
in his <hi>Speech, Memento,</hi> Epiſtles to his <hi>New Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Free-State Tyranny, Jus Patronatus, Seaſonable Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
The <hi>Republicans Good Old Cauſe anatomized,</hi> and in his

<note n="a" place="margin">P. 27, to 36.</note> 
               <hi>J. Rogers</hi> neither doth, nor can deny in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
only he contradicts the Concluſion, as not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
warranted by the premiſes; when as moſt judicious
Proteſtants of all profeſſions and degrees who have ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115450:18"/>
peruſed them, are abundantly ſatisfied, and conclude
the contrary to this <hi>Johannis ad oppoſitum;</hi> who beſtows
whole ſheets and volumes of rayling Epithites, Scurrilous
ſcoffs, <hi>unchriſtian</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">P. 34, to 41.</note> 
               <hi>obſcene</hi> Queres and ſarcaſmes upon me,
only upon this accompt; that I have tranſlated the <hi>Odium</hi>
and <hi>guilt</hi> of the contriving, fomenting the late <hi>Gunpowder
Treaſon</hi> which blew up our <hi>King, Kingdom, Parliament, Lords
Houſe,</hi> and <hi>Kingly Government,</hi> to erect a New <hi>Republike,</hi>
from the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and thoſe of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
who plotted the old one, and would have fathered it
on the <hi>Puritans,</hi> had it taken the like effect as this hath
done; which I thought would have deſerved thanks, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than ſuch reproachfull uſage from ſuch a <hi>Zealet</hi> as he
pretends to be. But ſince he will needs appropriate the
glory and honour of this laſt <hi>Powder-Plot,</hi> (tranſcending
the former) to <hi>thoſe worthies</hi> for whom he pleads, and to
himſelf and his diſciples, and allow the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> (a <hi>many
of</hi> whom he confeſſeth are doubtleſſe <hi>in</hi> England <hi>under</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes
and folding-dores p. 35.) no ſhare at all in its <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi>
or <hi>execution;</hi> I ſhall no waies envy them this new
<hi>Garland,</hi> wherewith he <hi>Crowns</hi> their Temples; let them
wear it in triumph to their graves, or <hi>Tiburn;</hi> I ſhall not
envy them this new <hi>Crown of glory,</hi> of which they are ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious,
that <hi>Rogers</hi> ſpends many leaves, <hi>p. 27,</hi> to 37. to
evade the Authors I quote to prove the Commonwealth a
ſpurious iſſue of the <hi>Jeſuits projection,</hi> by his impertinent
anſwers to them.</p>
            <p>1. He endeavours to evade my quotations of <hi>Parſons</hi> and
<hi>Campanella,</hi> the firſt projectors of turning our <hi>Engliſh</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
into an <hi>Holland</hi> Commonwealth, by the agency of

by what Title they hold their Crowns, and to alter, change
the courſe, inheritance and ſucceſſion of the Crown and publike Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
at their pleaſures, and diſſeiſe the right heirs general to
the Crown, and put them to their Formedon to recover them.</hi> To
which he anſwers, 1. That theſe their Politicks were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
to the State of the Nation as it was in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi>
time when they writ; to divide us with factions,
and diviſions at home, ſtir up the ſeeds of an inexplicable,
irreconcilable war between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
King <hi>James</hi> of the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> to promote
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> intereſt, and hinder the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from infeſting
his Fleet, and <hi>Indies: Ergo</hi> the Jeſuites were not the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
projectors of turning our Kingdom into a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
though he produceth none elſe before or beſides
them; nor yet proſecuted this deſign (ſo long ſince laid)
afreſh (as I have proved they did) in 1647. and 1648. for
the ſelf-ſame ends, in ſubſtance, by the ſelf-ſame means and
inſtruments. 2ly. He ſaith, I ſhould prove <hi>that This,
this is the ſame Commonwealth they plotted then in every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance:</hi>
I prove it produced by the ſame inſtruments,
means, pattern they preſcribed, and that it purſued the
ſame ends, deſigns, which is ſufficient and punctual. The
rather, becauſe himſelf and thoſe he pleads for, are not yet
agreed <hi>what</hi> form or kinde of creature their new Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
ſhall be; they being much divided about it, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
atteſts: who ſpends ſome ſheets againſt Mr. <hi>Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>

proved abortive in <hi>Qu. Elizabeths</hi> reign, and in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-plot
againſt King <hi>James;</hi> What then? <hi>Ergo,</hi> they
purſued it not ſince, as I prove by late pregnant Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and more than probable arguments, is a meer incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent.
4ly. He objects, the Jeſuits Commonwealth admits
no toleration of Religions; <hi>never was againſt Kingſhip and
the Office of it, as theirs is, nor hath any ſimilitude with Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115450:19"/>
moſt Popiſh Kings, and projected to make up a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
upon this account in oppoſition to Kingſhip: it
hath ſimilitude with <hi>Ieſuitiſm</hi> both in its principles, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
thoſe of <hi>Barclay</hi> and <hi>Mariana,</hi> cited by <hi>Nedham,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he founds it; and in its practices of <hi>murdering Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Kings, blowing up Parliaments, abſolving Subjects from
their Oath and Allegiance, &amp;c.</hi> by which it was founded, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
revived. What elſe he allegeth, is but meer Froth
of his wanton brain, and <hi>ſcurrillous pen,</hi> unworthy reply.
Only becauſe he calls upon me for <hi>more evidence,</hi> if I have it,
to prove his <hi>Good Old Cauſe and Commonwealth a Plot of the
Ieſuites,</hi> I ſhall gratify him herein. 1. <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> himſelf,
very well acquainted of late years with the Jeſuits perſons,
plots, principles, practices, in his Letter to a great <hi>Army-Officer</hi>
(quoted by himſelf, p. 12.) ſtiles it, <hi>A Cheat of
the Ieſuites put upon the Army;</hi> and that with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
of heart and ſpirit. 2ly. A grave Proteſtant Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the Temple laſt <hi>Trinity Term</hi> riding up to <hi>London,</hi>
meeting with a Popiſh Gent. of his acquaintance on the
way, they diſcourſing of theſe laſt Revolutions and changes
of Government, the Proteſtant told him, <hi>that theſe alterations
were but the Plots and productions of the Jeſuites and thoſe of his
Religion, who did but laugh at us in their ſleeves, to ſee what
fools they made us.</hi> At which the Papiſt growing ſomwhat
angry; <hi>He deſired him to be patient, ſince they were antient
friends, and what he ſpake was not in jeast or ſcoff, as he took it,
but in ſober ſadneſs;</hi> deſiring him <hi>(having great acquaintance
amongſt the Papiſts) to inquire out the truth of what he ſpake,
when he came to London, where moſt Papiſts in England were then
aſsembled, for both their ſatisfactions, and to give him an account
thereof;</hi> which he promiſed to do. About 5. or 6. dayes
after, this Papiſt told him, <hi>That according to his requeſt, he
nad made diligent inquiry of the truth of what he ſpake on the way;
and that he found, all or moſt of the Ieſuites were Knaves,
they and moſt of the Ieſuited Papiſts being againſt the
King, and wholly for a Commonwealth, as being moſt
advantagious for the King of Spains Intereſt;</hi> uſing
more words to the ſame effect. Which the Proteſtant (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115450:20"/>
my old familiar acquaintance) about two dayes after
related to me in <hi>Weſtminſter- hall,</hi> as a <hi>concurrent teſtimony</hi>
with that I had publiſhed to this effect in my <hi>True and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Narrative,</hi> and the <hi>Republicans Spurious good old Cauſe
truly Anatomized.</hi> 3ly. <hi>Lilly</hi> (a zealous Republican) in

did then promiſe Acts of Grace and Favor to Popiſh Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants,
who in their Zeal and Loyalty to the New Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike
excéeded moſt Presbyterians.</hi> An argument it
was a creature of the Jeſuites and their projection, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them more <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favor</hi> than before, and promote
their deſigns againſt us. 4ly. <hi>Nedham (Rogers</hi> his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
and fellow Champion againſt me) makes uſe of the
Jeſuit <hi>Barclay</hi> his forecited <hi>Jeſuitical Principle,</hi> as the chief
<hi>corner-stone</hi> of our New Parliaments and Republikes ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
whereon they are both built: And not only ſo, but
he uſeth the very Arguments of <hi>Campanella,</hi> which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to ſuggeſt to the Engliſh Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Proteſtants and Clergy, to hinder and keep out King
<hi>James</hi> from the Crown of <hi>England</hi> upon Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
death; to diſſwade and draw them all off from King

in his <hi>Interest,</hi> Sect 3. of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> p. 12, 13. <hi>The

founded upon the ruine of</hi> HIS GRANDMOTHER,
<hi>continued &amp; improved by the perpetual vexation of his</hi> GRAND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FATHER,
<hi>and at length proſecuted</hi> TO THE DECAPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATION
OF HIS FATHER. <hi>Be not ſo weak as to fool
your ſelves that you ſhall fare better than others. It is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſence of the</hi> Cavaliers, <hi>that you prepared his</hi> FATHER <hi>for
the block, and are incenſed at others becauſe they took from you the
honor of the execution.</hi> Dr. Creighton <hi>told him,</hi> That the
Presbyterians pulled his FATHER DOWN and held him
by the hair, while the Independents cut off his head.
<hi>And after him it was more elegantly expreſsed by</hi> Salmatius,
Presbyteriani Sacrificium ligarunt, Independentes jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larent,

a Creature of the Father, for many reaſons they have no cauſe to
fear foul dealing from the Son. As for</hi> HIS RELIGION (if
any) <hi>it is at beſt, but a devotion to Prelacy, which was bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
to him by Legacy. All his other pretences of Religion in</hi>
Scotland, <hi>he forfeited before ever he left that Countrey. What
profeſſion he hath ſince owned abroad, hath (for reaſons of State)
been kept very cloſe, yet not ſo cloſe but he diſcovered it. But if
this be not evident, let us have recourſe to reaſon, and then conſider,</hi>
HOW LONG HE WAS UNDER THE WING OF
HIS MOTHERS INSTRUCTIONS IN <hi>FRANCE,

IS THE MOST JESUITED PLACE IN THE

            <p>Here I ſhall deſire the Readers to take ſpecial Notice of
4. particulars. 1. Of <hi>Campanellaes,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> forein Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Princes and their Inſtruments Machiavilian practice;
ſecretly, ſeriouſly, frequently to ſuggeſt to <hi>Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
that</hi> their moſt <hi>Orthodox Protestant Kings, and right heirs
to the Crown, are inwardly inclined and well-affected to Popery,
that they profeſs themſelves Proteſtants, only for politick ends, to
gain or retain the Crown; that when they are ſetled in their
thrones, they will either profeſs, or introduce Popery</hi> (which would
be the Jeſuites and Papiſts greateſt advantage who thus ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
it, if true) <hi>purpoſly to exaſperate their Proteſtant Subjects

the viſible inſtruments to keep them from their <hi>hereditary
Crowns,</hi> to the ſcandal, prejudice of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi>
though they be moſt real, cordial, conſtant Profeſſors of it.
And whence ſuch ſcandalous ſuggeſtions originally ſpring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>Writing</hi> a little before his death, <hi>viz.
Above all, I would have you, as I hope you are already, well-grounded
and ſetled in your Religion: the beſt profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of which I have ever eſtéemed that of the Church of
England, in which you have béen educated: Yet I would
have your own Judgement and Reaſon now ſeal to that ſacred
Bond which education hath written, that it may be judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
your own Religion, and not other mens Cuſtome or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
which you profeſs. In this I charge you to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
as coming neareſt to Gods word for Doctrine, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115450:21"/>
to the Primitive examples for Government, with ſome little amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp;c. Your fixation in matters of Religion will not
be more neceſſary for your Souls, than your Kingdoms
peace, when God ſhall bring you to them, &amp;c. If you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſee my face again, I do require and intreat you, as your
Father and your King, that you never ſuffer your heart
to receive the leaſt check againſt or diſaffection from the
Religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of England. I tell
you, I have tried it, and after much ſearch and many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
have concluded it to be the beſt in the world, not
only in the community, as Chriſtian, but alſo in the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
notion, as Reformed, keeping the middle way between the
Pomp of ſuperſtitious Tyranny, and the meanneſs of fantastique
Anarchy. The ſcandal of the late Troubles, which ſome may
object and urge to you, againſt the Proteſtant Religion
eſtabliſhed in England, is eaſily anſwered to them and to
your own thoughts. Kéep you to true principles of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
Vertue and Honour, you ſhall never want a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
For thoſe who repent of any defects in their duty towards
me, as I fréely forgive them, in the word of a Chriſtian
King: ſo I believe, you will find them truly zealous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay
with Intereſt that Loyalty and Love to you, which
was due to me. In ſumme, What good I intended, do
you perform, when God ſhall give you power.</hi> Next, in
urging, <hi>how long he was under the wing of his Mothers inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in</hi> France (but a few Moneths ſpace at moſt) <hi>and what
a Nurſery</hi> Flanders <hi>hath been for him ſince, which is the moſt
Jeſuited place in the world;</hi> as his principal reaſon, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Protestants, to believe him ſufficiently
affected, if not ſworn to Popery,</hi> as if he had been there educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his own <hi>voluntary election;</hi> and not neceſſitated, yea
forced thither by the <hi>Army-Officers,</hi> and thoſe in late and

               <hi>might be declared uncapable of any trust or government in this

to ſtand Exiled for ever, as Enemies and Traytors, and
to die without mercy, if ever taken or found within the

When the <hi>King</hi> was executed before <hi>Whitehall,</hi> Jan. 30.
1648. Mr. <hi>Henry Spotteſworth</hi> riding caſually that way juſt
as his head was cut off, eſpied the <hi>Queens Confeſſor</hi> there
on Horſeback in the habit of a Trooper, drawing <hi>forth his
ſword, and flouriſhing it over his head in triumph,</hi> (as others
there did) <hi>at this ſpectacle.</hi> At which being much amazed,
and being familiarly acquainted with the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> he rode
up to him, and ſaid; <hi>O Father! I little thought to have
found you here, or any of your profeſſion at ſuch a ſad ſpectacle.</hi>
To which he anſwered, <hi>There were at leaſt forty or
more Prieſts and Ieſuites there preſent on Horſeback
beſides himſelf; and that one end of his and their coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was, That if the King had died a Roman Catholick
he might not want a Confeſſor, had he deſired one.</hi> This
the Gentleman (now dead) and his Siſter (whom the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
oft ſollicited to turn Papiſts) within few daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and at other times ſeriouſly related to a <hi>Bencher</hi> of
<hi>Lincolns Inne</hi> his familiar acquaintance (who oft reported
it to me and others) uſing it as one chief reaſon, <hi>Why they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115450:25"/>
refuſed to turn Papiſts; and becauſe they alſo found the</hi> Jeſuits
and Popiſh Prieſts <hi>both before and after the Kings death, had
divers meetings about</hi> London, <hi>to alter the Government, and
diſinherit the Kings poſterity.</hi> Which compared with their
releaſes from Impriſonment, and free liberty they enjoyed,
ever ſince the Kings death til now under the New Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,

Since which I hear of ſundry Proteſtant Miniſters, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Noblemen, and ſome ſecluded Members, ſecured,

this controverſie, if theſe be not ſufficient. As for
1. <hi>Rogers</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> they deny the Jeſuits and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
party to have any ſhare in our late Changes, becauſe
they would monopolize the honor and reward thereof to

revived <hi>High Court of Parliament,</hi> p. 96. <hi>We can tell you,
that no men in England did more (if ſo much move,

This is grievous, and muſt needs prove dangerous to the

baniſhment, plunderings, perils of life, liberty, eſtates, 5, or 6.
years together, in many priſons one after another; and yet no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
reſtitution, proviſion, or encouragement, for holding out
like Fortreſſes, againſt ſo hard a ſiege. All this for the Cauſe,

béen Inſtruments of your Reſtitution: but theſe are ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by friends and foes: the Pipers, Dancers, and Deviſers of
New Forms to trouble us with: that are rather the Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
than Incumbents of a Frée-State.</hi> If this his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
be true, it is either a juſt puniſhment of God upon
him and them for their <hi>Innovations,</hi> Prov. 24. 21, 22. or
an Evidence, the Jeſuits and Romaniſts had a greater ſhare
and activity in <hi>the Cauſe,</hi> and our <hi>Changes,</hi> than <hi>He</hi> and
