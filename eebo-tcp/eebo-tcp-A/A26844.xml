            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>COuld any man believe that Phanatick Fury had such power
to impell and force any that pretend to that Sacred Name
of Christians, to perpetrate such villanies which the <hi>Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midons</hi>
and <hi>Scythians</hi> in the midst of Barbarism it self never
heard of? But its a Maxim in Philosophy, <hi>Corruptio optimi est
pessima, The best things corrupted are the worst;</hi> So as the profession
of Christianity is a most sacred thing, the doctrine of the Gospel
a most holy Rule, the Authour of our Religion an exemplar and
pattern of meekness; so when Christians renounce this sacred
profession, lay aside this Holy Gospel, and abrenuntiate Christ the
pattern of meekness, they soon become the most desperate vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
in the world; as may be instanc'd in <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate, and
<hi>Sergius</hi> the Associate of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and compiler of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
And we daily see that among the <hi>Turks</hi> none are such implacable
persecutors of Captive-Christians as Renegade-Protestants.
When I seriously consider these things, I forbear to wonder at the
great and desperate Villanies perpetrated by the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> those
Renegade-Christians, who deny Baptism that initiating Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and first Sacrament of Christianity. Dares any man affirm
the Anabaptists to be Christians? For how can they be Christians
who deny Christning, deride Christs Institution of Baptism, and
scoffingly call it <hi>Baby-sprinkling,</hi> and in place thereof substitute
their prophane <hi>Booby-dipping?</hi> But what need words be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
when deeds cry out so loud? And are not such unparallel'd
Villanies enough to un-Christian the stoutest Professors in the
world?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Josiah Baxter</hi> in the year 1661. was sollicited with
much importunity by some <hi>Virginia</hi> Merchants to leave <hi>England,</hi>
and imbarque for <hi>Virginia;</hi> He condescended to their requests,
not upon the account of any earthly concern, but because he
thought in those New Plantations they might not be so well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59208:3"/>
of Labourers in the Lord's Vineyard, and in this Nation (God
be thanked) there was good store both of able and painful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters:
He also propos'd to himself the effecting some good upon
the <hi>Indians,</hi> as he often intimated to me before his departure.</p>
            <p>He lived many years in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and did much good among
those people; But seeing that his health was much impaired by
his Studies and Labours, and that the Ayr of that Countrey did
not at all agree with his body, he began to think of removing, and
especially seeing he had such a fair opportunity as the most cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and loving Invitation of M. <hi>T.</hi> M. <hi>G.</hi> and M. <hi>O.</hi> very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Merchants in <hi>New-England,</hi> and his ancient and intimate
Friends and Acquaintance; He therefore in the year 1672. with his
Wife and Family left <hi>Virginia</hi> and setled himself in a solitary
house about a mile and half distant from <hi>Boston:</hi> The Merchants
and good people of <hi>Boston</hi> and the circum-jacent Countrey re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
him with all the kindness and tenderness imaginable.</p>
            <p>He had not been long in these parts but all good Christians had
him in great veneration, for his great learning, his diligent preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and for his great zeal; He had not been many Moneths in
<hi>New-England</hi> but he understood there was a notorious Sectarian
by name <hi>Richard Batt</hi> (who formerly had been a Taylor in <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
but some two years after the happy Restauration of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
under pretence of a tender Conscience he left <hi>Coventry,</hi> and
came to <hi>New-England.)</hi> This <hi>Batt</hi> was a fellow of a prodigious
confidence, a good wit, a voluble tongue, and an insinuating car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and comportment: M. <hi>Baxter</hi> therefore quickly found out
this Fox, and was very apprehensive of his designs against Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion for the advancement of his unchristian Sect, and was
also inform'd that he had already seduc'd many well-meaning peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
He thought it was now high time to oppose this Son of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial,</hi>
to discover from Gods Word the falsity of his Tenets, the
wickedness of his principles, and the danger of his practises, and
also to confirm good Christians in the Truth: He therefore omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no pains, but constantly in all his Sermons evidently declared
and prov'd from God's Word the Divine Institution of Baptism:
he answered all Objections, and most solidly proved, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists
were most sacrilegious persons, who endeavoured to
rob Christ's Church of that Holy Sacrament which Christ her Spouse
had left her; and that the very denying of <hi>Infant-Baptism</hi> was a
denying and renouncing of Christianity it self, because Christ had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59208:3"/>
instituted Baptism to be an <hi>initiating Sacrament</hi> whereby such as
embrace Christian Religion were to be admitted within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of his Church,; but these wicked Sectarians deny this
Sacrament, and compel their adherents to renounce their Baptism,
and to be dipt again in their prophane waters: He told them also,
that the waters wherein <hi>Batt</hi> dipt his followers, were not (as he
falsly told them) the pure waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> wherein the holy sons
and daughters of <hi>Sion</hi> were baptiz'd, but the stinking and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
waters of <hi>Egypt</hi> wherein none but <hi>Babylons</hi> children were
dip't and prophan'd: He also charg'd and conjur'd all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
if they had any care or regard for their souls, not to associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
with those prophane and Sacrilegious persons the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi>
but to consider their personal vices, their scandalous lives, and
their bloudy and dangerous practices in forreign Countreys, but
especially in <hi>Germany, Holland, Poland</hi> and <hi>Switzerland;</hi> and he
would often instance many of their high misdemeanours in several
places in <hi>England,</hi> and pressingly urge his hearers not to have any
commerce or society with men of such bad principles and detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
lives.</p>
            <p>Thus did this zealous Minister of the Gospel like a good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
diligently watch over the Flock which Christ had committed
to his charge.</p>
            <p>Good men were much edified by his zeal, and the weaker and
wavering Christians were most solidly confirm'd in the Truth: But
this good man thought it was not enough to edifie the orthodox,
and confirm the doubtful, but he did most earnestly thirst after the
conversion of misbelievers; he was resolved to try all means for
the conviction and conversion of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> themselves; He
did endeavour to bring M. <hi>Batt</hi> to a personal conference; He o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
challenged him in the Church, and openly protested that if
he would come to a publike dispute and conference, all things
should be manag'd with Christian lenity and brotherly love; but
in case he should refuse such Christian-like Proposals of a publike
conference and dispute, the whole world would conclude he was
conscious to himself both of the badness of his Cause, and also of
his own disabilities to manage and maintain it, especially seeing
he was so openly, so often, and so pressingly mov'd to it by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist:
<hi>Batt</hi> and his Partizans us'd all the Artifices imaginable
to avoid the conference; and when M. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s friends urg'd him
to it, he would reply, that Disputes and Debates were altogether
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59208:4"/>
unprofitable; that he could finde no Warrant or Example in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
of any publike Dispute between parties; that Disputes in
Religion did but incense Christians one against the other, and
heighten animosities; that they did no ways conduce to the convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Dissenters; and that tender Consciences who had left
their Native Countrey for Religion, should endeavour for peace
and mutual love, and not by disputes to divide themselves in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but every man sit quietly under his own Vine, and enjoy the
Liberty of his Conscience. These were the specious pretences
that M. <hi>Batt</hi> used to avoid the dispute; But M. <hi>Baxter</hi> was not at
all satisfied with these excuses, but himself in publick, and his
friends in private continually press'd them to admit a conference,
where both parties might make out their Tenets to prevent all
miss-understandings, and that the truth might be confirm'd by the
Word of God.</p>
            <p>When the Anabaptists saw they could shift off the business no
longer, and that their own party were unsatisfied with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
declining of the dispute, they began now to see the necessity
of admitting a conference, and resolved upon the time and place.</p>
            <p>The day appointed for this solemn dispute, was <hi>Jan.</hi> 10. the
place was M. <hi>Smith</hi>'s House, the two Disputants were M. <hi>Baxter</hi>
and M. <hi>Batt:</hi> When the Company were met, M. <hi>Baxter</hi> desired
they would all make their humble Addresses to Heaven, that God
would grant a happy success to the whole business: When pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was ended, they began the Dispute.</p>
            <p>But not to trouble you with a tedious rehearsal of circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> managed the dispute with so much Prudence,
Learning, and Zeal, that <hi>Batt</hi> and his <hi>Partizans</hi> were most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
confuted, and by unanswerable Arguments deduced from
Holy Scripture fully convicted, and <hi>Infant-Baptism</hi> confirm'd:
M. <hi>Batt</hi> did desire that the further prosecution of the whole matter
might be left for another day, for now his spirits were spent, night
was drawing on, and many of the company had a great way home.
Hereupon the company concluded the Anabaptists were worsted,
and signified as much by a general out-cry, that M. <hi>Batt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</hi>
When the Dispute was ended, every man went to his
own home.</p>
            <p>In this Conference the Anabaptists receiv'd such a deadly blow,
that many of their followers began to open their eyes, and upon
the next Lord's Day brought their Children to be baptized, which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59208:4"/>
was a very pleasing sight to all good men, but a heart-breaking
business to these Sons of <hi>Belial.</hi> M. <hi>Baxter</hi> was extremely glad
of this happy success, and was resolv'd to prosecute the business
to the utmost, hoping now that a full conversion of that wicked
Party might easily be obtained. He omitted therefore no pains,
but ever after made it his whole business to preach against that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
Sect, to lay open their dangerous Tenets, and also to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
his Auditors to detest that party as being men of wicked
principles and worser lives.</p>
            <p>The Anabaptists could by no means digest this disgrace, they
now therefore consult the Prince of darkness, and are resolved to,
put in execution the hellish counsels that he suggests to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
and wicked hearts.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Feb.</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> about 11. of the clock in the fore-noon there
came four Ruffians to <hi>Mr. Baxters</hi> house (the solitariness of the
house gave too much opportunity to these hellish Designs;) They
had vizors upon their faces; as soon as they were entred, they
severely charg'd them under pain of death not to cry out, or cause
any disturbance: hereupon they bound <hi>Mrs. Baxter</hi> and her three
daughters (for this was all <hi>Mr. Baxters</hi> family.) When they had
done this, they went to <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> and rudely tore the cloths from
his back, when he was stript they most cruelly whipt him. Then
they told him he must die. He desired some time for prayer, and
also that he might be permitted the liberty to speak to his wife
and children before he died. All which they deny'd, and told him
that 'twas in vain for him to pray, or think on heaven, for that
was a place appointed for the Elect, but he was a vile Reprobate,
and from eternity destin'd to damnation. You are, said they, a
most wicked villain and have done much hurt in these parts,
your sins cry to heaven for vengeance, &amp; God has sent us to punish
you; you have been an Incendiary, you have endeavour'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
good men with fire and saggot; you have been a most bitter
persecuter of Gods servants, who have left their native Country
for their Conscience, these poor souls you have persecuted to
death, you must therefore for these ungodly practices submit
your self to Justice. When they had said these words, like so many
Hell-hounds, they most barbarously fell upon this innocent Lamb,
and with knives cut open his belly, and violently tore off his skin
from his body. And when this holy Martyr by reason of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
cryed out in a most dreadful manner, they said, 'twas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59208:5"/>
Musick. One of them said, now the Rascal is urging the
point against the <hi>baptists.</hi> When they had perpetrated this most
execrable villany they fled. Oh! what a sad house is here? The
Good man is flead alive, bleeding and crying out in the midst of
his anguish and pain, the house swimming in bloud, the wife and
children bound, and roaring out to see this poor Martyr wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his bloud, and they not able to afford him any assistance.
Things continued in this doleful posture until three of the clock in
in the evening: and then by a signal providence one <hi>Thomas Smith</hi>
of <hi>Boston</hi> came to the house, he unbound <hi>Mrs. Baxter</hi> and her three
daughters. The youngest of the three was so consternated with
horrour, that she fell into <hi>Convulsion-fits,</hi> and dyed the next day,
About six of the clock at night this holy Martyr dyed, and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to <hi>Abrahams bosome.</hi> And this is a full sad Account of this
mans sufferings and martyrdom for his Zeal for the true Religion.</p>
            <p>The Murtherers are not yet found, but we hope that heaven
will not let such horrid villanies goe unpunish'd long. The
Anabaptists were examin'd, but did deny the Fact, and have since
publisht a Writing, endeavouring thereby to perswade the world
of their Innocence, and that this Fact was done by the <hi>Indians.</hi>
But 'tis utterly improbable, that these Assassines were <hi>Indians,</hi>
for had they been strangers, what needed any disguise? And 'tis
more then probable, that they were some of M. <hi>Batts</hi> party by
their reproachful words to M. <hi>Baxter:</hi> And this is the general opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>New-England.</hi> The Widdow and her daughters were
forthwith removed, and kindly entertain'd at the Ministers house,
until further care is taken of them.</p>
            <p>I have penn'd and publisht this Narrative <hi>in perpetuam rei me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriam,</hi>
that the world may see the Spirit and temper of these
men, and that it may stand as an <hi>Eternal Memorial</hi> of their cruelty
and hatred to all Orthodox Ministers.</p>
