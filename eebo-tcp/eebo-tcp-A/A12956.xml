            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>A Mercenarie, though a famous man,</l>
               <l>To proue the labours, which thy Muses make;</l>

either by single prioritie, or prioritie vnited to noble pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, should seeke to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the part of nature vndone in more then complement, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill silence, or common passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and make the birth absolute. For Man, a sluggish Creature, (prompt enough to decline af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter satietie) seemes naturally to be vnfurnished, that hee might not be vnoccupied. So Nature hath left much imperfect, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate by the vacant absence of some things needfull, that mans labour should make things vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Nature affoords timber, but workmanship the structure: the earth produces Ore, but Art the Siluer: <hi>Nature</hi> giues plants, <hi>Knowledge</hi> the vse: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all which shee doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a more ample and lesse supplement, according to the

value, raritie or estimation of the thing. For Chymicks know, the more pretious mettals aske more paines in extraction of the true quintessence, then baser Minerals: Gold is the seuenth time purified, and then becomes beautifull: besides the qualitie of things more pretious, ought still to bee equiualent with their pretious subiect. Couragious horses bee managed with curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie: delicate voyces bee sele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to learne harmonies, whilst harsh and strong voyc'd cryers bee ridiculous. Diamonds, not glasse, become pure mettall, and rich garments haue much cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appearance. High blouds likewise be the fittest receptacles for high actions; but if a sacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth bee embroydred, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunct may deserue honor, thogh the ground-worke be Plebeian:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18400:30"/>
and men of vp-start Parentage may, in respect of braine, take place before Nobilitie, though their persons bee odious. Our selues and parents, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structors, be the secondary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which protract or abbreui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, enrich or impouerish, our owne destinies. For either wee are driven with fatall obstinacie, to ouer-take fortune; else, by the negligence of education, or being not season'd in minority, our stupid dulnesse giues For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune leaue to ouer-take vs. High birth is so farre from priuiledge to exempt any from these, as it approches neere to miserie, when shame is vnpreuented; and makes destinie notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>I know no difference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore betwixt the degrees of Fortune, if Birth alone makes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18400:31"/>
the comparison. For which is more predominant, if one of obscure fortune becomes pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke by merits, remaining still the same if he transgresse; or if one descended nobly, doth but deserue himselfe, and family, through great engagements, being ready to descend below himselfe if he miscarry, and be as publicke in disgrace, as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starts in applause? For this Age of Innouation is fitter to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold one swimming to a remote shore, then to reuolue how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the inhabitants be there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted: fitter to see new acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; actiue spirits <hi>proceeding,</hi> then the maintenance of honour <hi>proceeded</hi>: and fitter to behold one falling from a rocke, then from a stumbling mole-hill. So that if Noble-men aduanced, continue so; and ambitious
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18400:31"/>
Gentry, nay or basenesse, do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire and thriue, I see no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: if ruine threatens both, the last transcends in outward happinesse. The best similitude which makes diuersitie, reaches but thus farre: I see an embroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred emptie purse, and stoope to view it narrowly, because the out-side glisters: I spurne a powch before me, and heare the sound of siluer; I take both, keepe both, and will esteeme the coyne aboue the emptie purse, and yet preferre the outsides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone not both alike; because the one is <hi>capable</hi> and beauteous al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, the other doth <hi>containe</hi> already, but can neuer be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: no more then vpstarts, though renowned in merits, can euer take Nobilitie of <hi>Birth</hi>; because it will demand successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to confirme antiquitie.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18400:32"/>
So that ennobled fortunes (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an outward beauty) shall but make me more willing (as an embroidred purse) to see their in-sides, not enlarge their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue: when as perhaps one base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obscure, shall more purchase my reverence, though lesse at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract my labour to discouer him. As for the chiefe ornaments which qualifie great parentage, they should bee such as make most in the aduancement of a Common-wealth. For when Lawes receiue their body from the concordance of Nobilitie; it must (by good coniecture) follow, that the life or motion of them (which is an equal prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iustice) would, through the countenance of Nobilitie, receiue more credit and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.

               <p>Besides (that I may continue this Mythologie) the necke of a Lyon hath no ioyntes; whereby he cannot looke back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, vnlesse hee turnes his body; neither can Princes, without scandall to their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and bountie, turne their head onely vpon the foe that makes pursuite, with a meaning to runne away faster, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine their Title, or recall gifts with an intention to vpbrayd, except they turne themselues to encounter, or their iust rage to inflict a deserued ruine. The

Lyons haue an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite propertie to smell out their owne aduantage: For it is reported, the male knowes when the Lionesse hath beene adulterous with the <hi>Panther,</hi> by a peculiar sense of smelling: And the wisest part of men

worthily descended, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray their owne abuses; for men of this ranck are incident to strong delusions. A Lyon sleepes and yet his eies are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: so prouident high States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that possesse much, cannot haue eyes too many, or too watchfull: Neither may absolute man incurre security.

Neither may ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Natures bee nobly offended, except, as by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsiue, or sufficient cause, they ouercome.

               <p>Howsoeuer it may bee

It is admirable (if true) to see how generously Lyons haue scorned to be base debtors: Insomuch that it is memorably reported, <hi>Androcles</hi> a vagabond captiue, cured a Lyons paw; In gratification whereof,<note place="margin">

Again it is notably remembred, that Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neuer run away, except they can priuately withdraw, (being ouercome with multitude) into a secure Mountaine, or wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

Lastly, I may conclude this moralized comparison, with <hi>Aesops</hi> controuersie betwixt a Lyonesse and the Fox: the Foxe commends her owne fruitfull generation, seeming to disgrace the Lyons single birth, to which this answer doth reioyne: <hi>I bring forth one, &amp; yet that one is a Lyon</hi>: which good allusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may remoue the curse which some would cast vpon Nobility, because often

their children in number be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to common prostitutes: But I am peremptorily resolued, that the multiplicity of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren reares vp an obscure fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and brings an ancient stocke to ruine: For among many base childrens blessings, birth may make variety of fortunes: But among much Noble posterity, Fortune doth challenge a more vaste partition; and makes a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented heire fit for all inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uating enterprises; so that one Noble remainder of much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, or one true Lyon of a family (if Art and Nature can be made operatiue) will be a more safe prop to succession, then the doubtfull variety of children. I obserue it as an infa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For, as questionlesse the largest Riuers bee deriued from lowly Springs; So birth and succession haue beene so basely intermingled, so casually interrupted, so frequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and very often attainted (though with absolution) that I may well iustifie the first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and adde further, That gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, to maintaine the noble estate of dead Ancestors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as much true policy, as to erect a new Family: And to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the patterne of heroicke ancestry, deserues perpetuall commendations.

That he who from a diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish disposition findes a soone-moued contrariety betwixt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his vndoubted chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, must (of necessity) bee a man who refuses all men, except aduantage pleades for them; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he neglects those, for whom nature pleades, if aduantage bee

But for the first I haue obserued it generally; that he who was apt for disinheritance, hath bene a man alwaies of as many affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as there be faces: And as prompt to refuse any, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any, if hee might saue by the bargain.

Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence you may gather, that no sparke of naturall affection, but only a compulsiue maintenance, keeps the reference betwixt such parents, and such children. For louing nature and affection be flexible, of long for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, much pitty, manifest care; &amp; keepe an establisht forme of affability, with which friends or kinsfolk be vnacquainted: this prouokes an eminent reflexe of loue; whereas rough carriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets <hi>loue</hi> in Curres, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptible <hi>scorne</hi> in Noble Spirits.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:18400:45"/>It is therefore more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to follow the extreame of vertue <hi>abounding,</hi> then <hi>defectiue</hi>: The first partakes with medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie in the nature; but the last is altogether opposite. We may more safely therefore allow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, then austerity; because it approcheth neerer to true loue. For though indulgence hath made children loftie in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour towards others, yet (I obserue) it breeds a true and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuorced affection towards the originall cause. It is therefore an excellent rule, for children, to receiue instruction of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and by the consequent, to bee any way restrain'd without the parents knowledge, or at least their taking notice: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Nature cannot grudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Nature, nor yet want re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:18400:45"/>For howsoeuer <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> said well, That he had rather vnrewarded for doing well, then vnpunished for offences: yet we haue naturally a secret spleene against the Iudge, though wee account him righteous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall. It must bee expected then, that children doe know a difference betwixt Fathers and Maisters; which makes them the more implacable, when they see Nature impartiall. From hence <hi>Sertorius,</hi> a politicke Captaine, would not himselfe represse the impudence of his Souldiers; least, howsoeuer they deserued ill, yet his correction might take away their louing dutie: which respect made him suffer the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies incursions, rather to scourge their insolence, whilst they, out of a hare-brained luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie desired battaile. And thus the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18400:46"/>
sacred decree of Correction may bee kept vnviolate, and the loue of Children vnblemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. For I am vnanswerably perswaded, that parents wrath diminisheth the Childes loue, making him seruile, or else re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractorie to the doctrine of themselues and others; because they cannot vndertake with delight, so long as <hi>frownes</hi> and <hi>feare</hi> bee crept into their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. But affable parents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get truely affectionate chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who may endure another mans reproofe to mitigate the name of <hi>Cosset,</hi> and yet louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adore the father because hee was alwayes louing. So then the Fathers diligent loue, and a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors modest instruction, may make a seldome-seene heire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his Fathers life without hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, and proue a venerable
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18400:46"/>
wise man. Without which loue apparant, or oftentimes indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, I see an eldest sonne, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead of the Fathers blessing, render backe sweating curses. I see another inclining onely to the mother; and a third, slippe into his disinherited For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>The Comaedian therefore saith ingenuously touching a fathers dutie: <hi>I ouer-passe expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I call not euery thing to a strict account; and that which other sonnes labour to keepe secret, I do not bitterly condemne in mine, lest many things should bee concealed; for hee that (through a rugged v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage) depriues his father (by false excuses) of youthfull accidents, will soone deceiue others.</hi> It is more availeable then, to governe by liberalitie, not base compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: for hee that thus becomes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18400:47"/>
obedient, expects onely till hee may want the witnesse of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>Now for the dangerous effect of parents changeable loue (it having beene propounded, that want of loue breedes disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) I will demonstrate, how horrible, vnlawful, &amp; impossible disinheritance maybe iudicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accounted. The diuorce of mariage is a weighty case, much forbidden, much controverted; because marriage it selfe is made a strict vnion, so farre as Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands seeme incorporate with their Wiues, being both to bee taken as one flesh. But this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on admits many exceptions; neither may any thinke their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made <hi>one,</hi> extends further, then the rhetoricall aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vnitie, to insinuate how difficult a thing Diuorce will be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18400:47"/>
betwixt two, so narrowly vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but children haue a more exquisite property of indiuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, because they really partake with parents by existence; deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a particular &amp; true strength of body from the parents abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And therefore it seemes the matter of disinheritance is a thing so odious, as (being held improbable to be acted among the Iewes, or any Nation) no Law of Scripture contradicts it. Indeed rebellious sonnes are by the verdict of Divine iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to suffer death, if they shall strike the parents, or rise vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: But for the matter of Disinheritance (which farre transcends the punishment of death, as shall appeare) I haue read no sillable which may giue the toleration of Divinitie. Death indeed, comparatiuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18400:48"/>
may bee thought the best wages of a rebellious sonne: for the act includes his full sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; because to smite his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, is to seeke the destruction of his efficient cause: which act keepes within it so much ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as heauenly Iustice can doe no lesse then remoue him, who durst remoue his begetter; it beeing an inseparable part of holinesse, to pay offenders with their owne coyne. But disinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance so much exceeds death, as it approches to a continued torment. Death is so fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, or abdication, doth not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18400:48"/>
onely enforce death, but makes the circumstance tyrannicall. A violent death is but an abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of nature; but disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance doth often bring a violent death, and enlarge the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of nature. I see no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt them in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion: for death is an effect commonly of disinheritance; but no death more excludes all humanitie. The case is palpable. I giue directions to a traveller: hee arrogantly contemnes my counsell; which doth so much provoke mee, as (to amend the matter) I draw him by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion to an apparant ambush: in which, after many sustained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses, horrible vexations, and desperate incounters, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his life with infamie; or perhaps blasphemy. So, currish and cruell parents, by disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18400:49"/>
deales every way answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this similitude. The hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>or of which barbarisme is the more amplified, by so much as naturall affinitie claimes a more humane president then strangers. Banishment or abiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is tolerable: for it takes originall by publicke decree, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior counsell, and authority of those, from whom I can cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge nothing but iustice; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as disinheritance, a National ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment (transcending forraine exile in the <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi>) proceedes from priuate occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, which cannot reach so high an affliction; because the nature of it is equall to, nay aboue publicke iustice.</p>
               <p>Now it may well bee estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med humane, when parents pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish with rigor, where the Law condemnes not; because in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18400:49"/>
offence highly punishable, the Law is open: if that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes, the Parents loue may a little bee excused, though hee doth not excuse his sonnes accusation; but where himselfe exceedes the Lawes rigor, when the Law is silent, and becomes Accuser, Iudge, and Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, wee may discouer a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable flintie heart; apt enough for massacre; seeing hee first plaies the tyrant with his owne Image.</p>
               <p>Parents therefore cannot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue and say (except Disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) they haue no remedie for disobedience; seeing there is no crime which may deserue so great satisfaction, but the Law is all-sufficient to render Iustice, and saue them vnpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiced in the aspersion of <hi>Vnnaturall</hi>: which the Title
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18400:50"/>
                  <hi>Disinheritance</hi> drawes with it inseparate. For if wee take a view of those impulsiue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which breede occasion, wee shall perceiue how accessary Parents bee to all their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens vices; and by the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, how culpable they are to punish that so strictly, of which themselues bee Authors.</p>
               <p>Setting aside the position which makes the Children participate with Parents in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces liable to constitution, wee may (without these) demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, how guiltie they are of each notorious crime in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, through a deficiencie of rectified education. For as, in naturall productions, nothing is so absurd, from which Art cannot extract a deere quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence; so among naturall men, and the conditions of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18400:50"/>
humanitie, nothing is so irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, from which industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and true instructiue me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode cannot produce a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine excellence. Indeed the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition of natures is difficult, and much iudicious labour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the true sifting of a perverse disposition. But que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse, the worst natured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all badde men, are, by a true seasoning of minoritie, a wise progresse, or institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ripe yeares, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious confirmation of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises well deserued; they are capable of goodnesse, subdued in mischiefe, and apprehensiue in a sufficient measure. So that we must not ignorantly impute the curse of Children to a wrong cause, seeing it is either the curse of the Parents; First, not to instruct children at all.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18400:51"/>
Secondly, not to instruct them sufficiently. Thirdly, not in the true manner. Examples are infinite: <hi>Alcibiades</hi> may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all.

               </p>
               <p>Which manner of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, respecting the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and person, of method and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18400:51"/>
Tutors, bee matters onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the Parents charge. Now (if a curse impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vpon them, bee a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the perfection of both, whereby they neither can be prouided of true Instructors or instructions) Shall wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the childe as an efficient of the Fathers curse, or the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers curse now existent, as an originall of the childs future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences?</p>
               <p>This being necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, wee may well inferre, concerning disinheritance, That parents curses beeing the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly causes which may prouoke this irreligious act (seeing they might sometimes, but doe not, and doe not sometimes because they cannot, though it be possible, ingraft good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) by their owne igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18400:52"/>
wee may inferre, (and that most iustly) that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cause of his friendes drunkennesse, would cast the miserable wretches amongst tame Beares and Lyons, to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie them when they awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. But herein they differ: hee was the voluntarie cause of his Friendes; Parents, the vnadvised cause of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens errour: in stead of which hee threw his friendes among tame Beares and Lyons; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, by disinheritance, throw their issue amongst rampant Wolues.</p>
               <p>For besides the perplexed imfamie, and sorrowfull pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of such excluded Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes; what shal we coniecture touching their desperate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution? Or how shall wee

condemne, if they bee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilessely ouerthrowne by the impulsiue necessity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction? Seeing their desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute fortune inuites them to embrace each glistering temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and to shake hands with calamity.</p>
               <p>I cannot (for mine owne part) comprehend all this without remembrance and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of such parents ruines; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they cannot discharge all, before children haue incurred destruction without them.</p>
               <p>Nothing is written which doth not amplifie our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction (saith Diuinity) and Nothing amongst all is more effectuall then true OBSERVATIONS, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept DIVINITIE. Most ingenious therefore and full of perswasion, may that Morality

bee, soone collected from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible creatures, they haue an excellent and singular loue (each creature in his kind) to nourish vp their weake little ones. The hunted Lionesse driues her whelpes before. The pregnant Beare forsakes not her den vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till she be deliuered; neither do the whelpes come forrh vntill they can escape danger. The Snake swallowes her yong, if any disaduantage happens. And aboue all, most admirable is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ingenuity, touching that forraine creature, called by the name of <hi>Su</hi>; which (being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted) shuts vp her Cubbes in a depending scrip, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects them from the Huntsman. The multitude of examples would be tedious. Briefly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is a generall note among them; they neuer forsake their
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18400:53"/>
infantry till it be able euery way (like themselues) to preuent mischiefe.</p>
               <p>This may rebuke all cruell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded parents, who (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the discursiue light of reason) can cast off meere Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and goe beneath a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish goodnesse of nature, not onely to forsake, but to abhorre their issue; and leaue them desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, before they be any way ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to sustaine nature. For children bee indeed thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected euer, because they be vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Omitting these indifferent allegations, which some may account sophistry, rather then sound doctrine; because they beleeue nothing but what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes apparant; nor that can be accepted among them, vnlesse no Christian contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts it; neither can that which

               <p>Wee cannot (where things bee left vntouched in Scripture) assume a safer patterne then the Omnipotent properties of our Creator. First then, that Metaphoricall affinitie, of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and sonne, which Himselfe hath pleased to entertaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Himselfe and the Elected, may serue to instruct parents (without controuersie) in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of duty, and inseparate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>Now all agree vpon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that whomsoeuer God
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18400:54"/>
hath once loued, him hee hath loued euerlastingly. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible therefore, if at any time there hath bene <hi>Amity</hi> betwixt father and sonne, that (this being obserued) it should fall away to disinheritance. For if Gods Maiestie descend so low, as to continue his loue alwaies where Hee hath begunne to <hi>Loue</hi>: shall not imitation hereof be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site in fathers, who be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to loue their children, and in whom nature exacts more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate equality, then in the least degree can be imagined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt holinesse and frailty? each circumstance appeares so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, as I know not how So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisters can colourably distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish. A second instance may confirme this president. God neuer hath forsaken the most wicked Reprobates, till
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18400:55"/>
they haue voluntarily forsaken him first: The prodigall deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his portion, left his father, and yet the father willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts him being conuerted. This becomes farre opposite to the practise of our age: so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory is the humor of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inheriting-parents, as they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get common charity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse loue with an implacable contempt of reconcilement. As for the pretended causes which commonly prouoke parents, I cannot any way coniecture, that they be either halfe so infinite, or in the least degree so terrible, as those with which all parents prouoke Omnipotence: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot well see how such fathers can claime the petition of forgiuenesse, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forgiue their owne issue. The heire of a Kingdome enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18400:55"/>
himselfe not more iustly to his Crowne, then eldest sonnes do to their homely inheritance. Now I obserue, that wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath been a successory regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there, weake-braind, ryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, tyrannicall, and lewd prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, haue been admitted to their dignities without contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And doth not the bloud of common heires answere to a Kings priuiledge, in the Title of <hi>Legitimate</hi>? Why then shall wee protect such vniust partialitie? If children should receiue no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they deserue: or if they shold claime interest of loue, no longer then merits make a full proportion; how should the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of parents, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of children, appeare? or what thankes and filiall loue may Fathers expect from such Children, more then from good
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18400:56"/>
Apprentices? <hi>Cimon</hi> could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombe his Mares, when they purchased credite in the swift races of <hi>Olimpiades. Xanthippus</hi> could bewaile his dogges death which had followed his Maister from <hi>Calamina. Alexander</hi> could erect a Citty in the honor of <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> when hee had long bene defended by him in the dangerous attempts of many fortunate battailes. The <hi>Asse</hi> may well (among the Heathen) be adorned with Lillies, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and Garlands; when their Goddesse, <hi>Vesta,</hi> by an Asses voyce, auoyded the rape of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apus.</hi> If merits therefore should onely challenge the loue of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, nothing might make a difference betwixt sonnes and bond-slaues: Seeing bare Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hath accounted the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18400:56"/>
of <hi>One worthy to be honored,</hi> nothing but equall and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary thankes. Nay, in all ages, so bountifull and respectiue hath authority beene to true merites, as euen the desertlesse children haue met with dignitie to remunerate the fathers worthinesse: Thus did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians bestow great wages vpon <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> to gratifie the seruice of <hi>Aristides</hi>: And thus the Romans preferred the cause of <hi>Marcus Brutus,</hi> because his Ancestors had tooke the Countries quarrell against ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. Shall fathers then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme it such irregular cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome to dignifie their owne begotten issue, though desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse; seeing strangers haue done this to congratulate good fathers?</p>
               <p>Two examples there bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18400:57"/>
and moderne (worth our memory) that shew the practise of our Theame in question; and affoords singular obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The first is euident, in the raigne of <hi>Agis</hi> a Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian King: In whose prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Citie of <hi>Sparta,</hi> the custome had prohibited alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations that preiudice the heire: The custome grew to bee a confirmed Law: After conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, there fell a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt one of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Magistrates and his eldest sonne: The father was so actually prouoked, that hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibites a Decree to licence Disinheritance; the Decree was established: And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (saith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse became publick. From hence my obseruation is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. First, the originall cause of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18400:57"/>
disinheritance was fury: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the commodity was ranke couetousnesse.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it is apparant by the Tower-rowles, that (during the raigne of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth) one <hi>Thomas Burdet</hi> an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, being somewhat innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned to death (about captions tearmes ignorantly vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered) in his way to death es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied his eldest sonne, whom (before) hee disinherited: him therefore hee penitently recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and hauing now confessed seriously, that hee felt Gods wrath vpon him onely to punish that vnnaturall sinne: Hee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg'd forgiuenesse of God, and of his sonne: The applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such a paenitent remorse is easy.</p>
               <p>Hauing now marshald vp this troope of Arguments,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18400:58"/>
which (I thinke) are approue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; some (questionlesse) will account them white-liuerd soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, drest vp onely with a Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall habite: But censure is no lesse infinite, then often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times odious: Tryall therefore shall discharge the integrity of these; whilst I proceed briefly to muster one troope more; whose courage is enough ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by their aduersaries weaknes; if not impossibility of appearance. For if the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right (which intitles an heire) be inseparate, then the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue is also inseparate; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance depends vpon priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which being vnremoueable; the adiunct essentiall cannot perish without the subiect. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations therefore be so congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that we may sooner affirme the <hi>Sonne</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> not to be,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18400:58"/>
then heires and inheritance not to bee correlatiues: and by the consequent as lawfully may wee depriue both of <hi>Beeing</hi>; as we may permit the one without the other. (:*:.:*:.:*:) (* * *)</p>

                  </note> Philosophie hath diuided our soules faculty; and makes the <hi>Intelligent</hi> part our principall essence; <hi>that</hi> cannot perish: Poetry depends on <hi>that,</hi> and a sublime fancie; they being the helpes of our dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall: or (to speake truely) a Poet vseth euery function of the soule: Depending vpon which, hee must reiect Nature: for Nature perisheth; the Soule cannot. <hi>Nature</hi> is then the Hand-maide; but an <hi>Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue worthinesse,</hi> the soule of Poetry.</p>
               <p>Conceiue but this, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will disclaime: Nature imparts her Faculties by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18400:60"/>
excluding study and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome: A Poet neuer is engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred so, further then a naturall Logician, therefore he exceeds Nature.</p>
               <p>We may obserue a sweete concordance in this mighty Fabricke: All things are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with an allusiue vnion: Life, is a flash of immortality; Sleepe, of death: middle age of Summer: Arts also, and ages past, haue a similitude with things inferiour, and signifie things future.</p>
               <p>Language is likened to a Casket, Logicke to an Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers Instrument; Rhetoricke to a pretious Colour; And Poetry likewise hath a fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance with Prophecy: both bee an vnutterable rapture; both bee a boundlesse large capacitie: both bee a vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18400:60"/>
tractate: both bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within a small number: both bee discredited with false pretenders: both bee dispersed among men (originally) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure: both bee alike neglected: both (generally) contemned alike.</p>
               <p>Poetry is made the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of amorous delights: and certainely it doth bestow much sweetnesse in apparrelling loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accents. This onely might discover it for a supreme do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue; seeing the musicke in heaven is an agreement of soules. <hi>Ierome Savanarola,</hi> the Monkish Phylosopher, makes Poetry a part of reasonable Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy; maintaining this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst naturall pretenders of Poetry: I will not meddle with his arguments, they are elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and learned: the truth is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18400:61"/>
without serious proofe.</p>
               <p>Verse and Rime bee things naturall: for they be onely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and appearance: but if you value the <hi>Phrase</hi> and the <hi>Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi> after the same proportion; as thinking your conceit able to furnish a poeme; you shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed perceiue it likewise natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; <hi>that is,</hi> naked, vnpolished, nay the scorne of Poetry. A quicke contriving head may vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter laudably; but never was a braine so sudden, as to compose well without the president of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the like kinde: nay, take the most illiterate Writers, (who propound experience and familiar allusions) they haue a time to <hi>Meditate,</hi> to <hi>compare,</hi> to <hi>dispose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Art of Poetry cannot proue eminent, vnlesse the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath a reioycing heart, an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensiue

head, and a disclou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded memory. It is impossible therefore for one deiected by calamity, or one perplexed with questions of another Science, to get perfection in this free know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: I say, <hi>perplexed with que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions of another Science</hi>; because a Poet should rather copiously discourse of <hi>all,</hi> by application to a witty purpose, rather then be exquisite in a <hi>particular</hi> Art, respecting depth of rule, or quidditie. <hi>Notions,</hi> coniectures, and some of the best passages, be more sufficient for him, then a praecise certaintie of rules.</p>
               <p>He therfore who propounds excellence, must refuse the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of questions, and the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of miseries: both bee as clogges and fetters to that aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring facultie. From hence I may conclude the perfection of

The nourishment of Poetry is good applause: for Poems being made to allure and bewitch the reader in a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of moral precept, must pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in their meaning, or be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced: As all professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be, which make mens good opinions the reward of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and therefore hath <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> affoorded few men accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in Poetry, because opinion hath vouchsafed to ranke her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong triviall labours, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatiue vanities: whereas the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians</hi> haue proved singular <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients</hi>; because (saith <hi>Rosinus</hi>) au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority hath graced their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18400:62"/>
The reason (I thinke) which hath wrought in <hi>England</hi> such a degenerate value of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, proceeded (first) from the the professors ignorance &amp; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall basenesse: but secondly from the stubborn gravity of the best readers; who scorne to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the best <hi>Poems profitable works,</hi> because all haue hitherto bin accounted <hi>slight composures,</hi> or at best <hi>vnprofitable.</hi> And we i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine it a weaknesse to recant an error. Some haue certainely contemned the worthiest <hi>labors</hi> even throgh malicious despaire of attempting the like <hi>worthily.</hi> Howsoever, the base opinion which Poetry incurs among vs, hath bin repaid with iustice: <hi>that is,</hi> the discredit of our Nation: for our vnder-valuing opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath deprived the <hi>publicke</hi> of more iudicious workes then

bee already extant: And so the glory of our Nations eminent wit, hath beene eclipsed with forraigners.</p>
               <p>As for the private and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefit (which any shal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in publishing his labours) I see none vertuous but this: he may excuse (by them) his silent nature; and bee accounted bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as a <hi>Melancholy Poet,</hi> then a <hi>speechlesse foole.</hi> Fame and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence savour of a fruitlesse am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; that will now purchase nothing for Poetry by prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but an opinion that <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> is his knowledge, and (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so) that he is fit for nothing else: or some perhaps; nay, the wisest, will bestow compassion, and say, <hi>It is pitty such a pregnant wit should e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of it. The deepest Poets haue neglected verse, I meane the polished forme of verse: but I would sooner loue such workes in prose; and heartily intreate such writers, even for their own dispatch-sake, and the readers also, to abandon Poetry, except they can avoyd that crabbed stile and forme, which weakens any readers appetite and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension.</p>
               <p>The relish of Poetry is a candied barke: an elegance so sweetned with apt phrase and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration, as it excludes rough harshnesse, and all mystery: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies and Phylosophicall questions bee therefore impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per arguments for a Poeticall tractate: they cannot be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with an inticing libertie. Similitudes be the fit interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Poets: when I affirme
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18400:64"/>
this, I doe not approue all simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, but such as doe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete: which they cannot do, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be more familiar then the thing interpreted. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes any, who from a depth in learning, shall produce the Mathematickes, to illustrate <hi>Grammer</hi>: or shall compare things knowne by repetition to an example in Astronomy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poore</hi> and <hi>Prodigall</hi> haue been a Poets Titles: these haue been fixt with a contemptiue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but I imagine they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his qualitie: for therefore he neglects wealth, because he feeles in himselfe a Iewell which can redeeme his bondage in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie. Freedome of <hi>Braine</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> is a Poets musicke: <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Health</hi> preserue, and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viue his fancie. When therefore a <hi>Reward</hi> is motiue, it makes the

Poetry should therefore (being an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall free science) be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the free <hi>Professor</hi>; a man sufficient in estate: such a one as need not vse flattery to win re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; nor so indite, that things may be dispatched quickly, and his wants quickly furnished; nor so dispatch, that hee may rather make things saleable, through obscoenitie or scandals, then approved labour. These mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes follow a mercenarie hope: and therefore be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenarie Poets odious: such (I meane) as are provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by poverty, and will exact their wages.</p>

               <p>Opinion is indeed the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate cause of discontents; but then a rectified or false capacitie (being an immediate cause of rectified or false opinions) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a true or idle discontent.

Hee can with as much selfe-credit bee a Captiue, as a promoted Courtier. Dignities may do him honour, not entice him: povertie may threaten, and be peremptory, but cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-come. Riches may make his honesty more eminent, not more exquisite. Hee is so far from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding malice to any, that he can praise the merits of an enemy. Anger and Revenge bee two turbulent passions: in him (therefore) the first shewes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that hee can apprehend: the last, that he can iustly prevent further mischiefe. So he neither doth insult through anger; nor satisfie his bitternesse by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Repentance, which with
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18400:80"/>
some proues melancholly, with him proues a delightfull assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: for seldome doth hee lament things meerely vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, so much as vertues im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly attempted. Hee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes every thing with more advantage, then any (but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) can imitate: for beeing voyd of troublesome vexation, his willing minde makes the way lesse difficult. His poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and close dealing doe not disturbe his time of pleasure, or his quiet dreames: For he can awake with as much delight in day, and sleepe with as much solace in the darke, as either his intimate purpose can awake to every mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause; or bee concealed to his owne safetie, and no mans detriment. Hee doth not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily incurre anothers rage;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18400:81"/>
nor doth hee raile against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; for he cannot bee before hand with quarrelsome engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; nor rashly run into a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest error. He doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (when all approue him) mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call himselfe, closely, damned Hypocrite, or lewd villaine. He feeles more felicitie in this, that he can forbeare to enioy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, rather then let any thing enioy him; or rather then hee will enioy any thing indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly. He is not so selfe-subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hee scornes to borrow; so shamelesse, that hee borrowes all: nor so alone contented, that others doe not partake in his freedome: or so absolute in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that hee becomes not more absolute by the vse of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

the foundation or structure of his worthinesse. His workes doe every way pronounce both nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, delight, and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the readers soule: which makes him neither rough, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, nor windy: for by a sweet contemperament of Tune and Ditty, hee entices others to goodnesse; and shewes himselfe perfect in the lesson. Hee never writes vpon a full stomacke, and an empty head; or a full head, and an emptie stomacke. For he cannot make so Diuine a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle stoope to the sordid folly of gall or enuy, without strength: or strength of braine stoope, and debase it selfe with hunting out the bodies suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. Hee is not so impartiall as to condemne every new fashion, or taxe idle circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; nor so easie as to allow
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18400:84"/>
vices, and account them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous humours. So hee neither seekes to enlarge his credit of bitternesse, by a snarling seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; nor to augment his substance by insinuating court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe. Hee hath more debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in knowledge among the present Writers, then Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors among the ancient Poets. Hee is possessed with an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent libertie, which excludes him from the slavish labour and meanes of setting a glosse vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon fraile commodities.

He is no miserable selfe-louer, nor no vnbounded prodigall: for he can communicate himselfe wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to auoide dull reseruednesse, but not make euery thought common, to maintaine his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. It must be imputed to his perfect eye-sight, that he can see error, and auoide it without the hazard of a new one: As in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, so in proiects, by an easie coniecture. Hee cannot flatter, nor bee flattered: If hee giues <hi>Desert,</hi> hee giues no more;

and leaues <hi>Hyperbole</hi> in such a matter of importance: As for himselfe, he is so well knowne vnto himselfe, that neither pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke fame, nor yet his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, can make him ouervalued in himselfe. Hee is an enemy to Atheists; for he is no Fatist nor Naturalist: hee therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>Lucke</hi> and <hi>Rime,</hi> from the acceptance of his Poems; scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to acknowledge the one as an efficient, the other as an essence, of his Muses fauour. Hee paies back all his imitation with interest; whilst his Authors (if reuiued) would confesse their chiefe credit was to bee such a patterne: otherwise (for the most part) he proues himselfe the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, and the proiect in hand: Siluer onely and sound mettall comprehends his nature: rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, motion, and customary

The first therefore may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the last; but the last neuer hath predomina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other.

He resorts to <hi>London</hi> with a more full braine, then empty bags, and (at his returne) he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses vp more full comfort, then yellow coine. He cannot bee so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fident as to persist in error; nor so ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as to erre by weaknes: When therefore (through an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance) some knowledge is confounded; his errour onely proues a doubtfull question; and serues to reduce scattered rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants into methode. The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of contentions make not him reioice in the number, but in the difficulty; that truth may appeare manifest to our proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. He railes not against the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his profession, but makes his profession commendable by his owne practise of vertue: his Clients disease of being suspe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded touches him like his own sicknes; hee dares not giue a dangerous purgation to dispatch him, nor

by negligence and delay, let the euill grow inward and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; to strengthen it selfe, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the patient. He is therefore exquisit in preseruatiues against the consumption; though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he may faile in restoratiues to support weakenesse. Hee may well bee a president to the best Physitians; for he vndertakes no cure when he perceiues it incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to bee desperate: So hee makes the cause, and not his Client, the obiect of his labour. If hee hath fauour enough to make truth be currant, he lookes no further: which he needs not to patch businesse; nor would he willingly pursue it; if truth were not often discountenanced. Hee doth therefore at a Iudges death lament the death of his learning, not his owne priuate lucre: Hee can ride the circuit, and scorne
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:18400:87"/>
to be circular. He hath no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to protract time or saue his Clients opinion with iests pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated, or windy inferences: His modesty was neuer below his courage in a good cause; nor his courage inclining to impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, though hee were still ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored with a prosperous euent. He owes so much worship to desert and innocence, that hee can as faithfully applaud suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent worth, as not insult ouer, or exclaime against dull igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. He is miraculously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued against incantations: the strongest spell cannot charme him silent, nor the most temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting spirit prouoke him to a vaine pleading.

His education hath beene (from a childe) tenderly fearefull; and the mother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains still afraid of his fortunes, least his politicke wisedome should hazard them too farre: whilst his fortunes hazard his wisedome. Hee hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a yong Master, and yoked
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18400:93"/>
his eares first to insinuation, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some oylie-tong'd seruant, or flattering Tutor.

A round oath is valour enough, a foolish Dittie Art enough, and good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship honesty enough. The truth is, he scornes to bee a searcher,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18400:94"/>
and thinkes it enough for his Taylor to medle with linings. But in the circumstance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your cloathes, the price of your Beaver and silke stockins, your purpose to travaile, or of your long absence; The <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition cannot be so vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull. He is contented richly, nay absolutely, to be taken onely for a harmlesse man. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rositie and noble carriage of his discourse, is to run desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the name of some coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious gallant Knight, or some Baron in favour: if their alliance to his family can be detected, he giues way with an apparant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish. He is very well fitted for all societies, if his out-side be suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; further then which he never conversed with himselfe effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Nor can I wonder, though he payes deerely, and preserues
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18400:94"/>
cloathes delitiously; seeing those alone are the maintenance of his whole worth; and therefore you shall perceiue him more furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously engaged about the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his doublet, or a little lace, then a magnanimous box, or a bastinado. He is ambitious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen to be promoted, either by some embassage to divulge his pedigree, and learne fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or by entertainment of some chiefe Noble men to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his bountie; and (withall) his stipendious affection. Hee shifts his familiars by the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of prospect, and the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; but his directions proceed from the proverbe of <hi>like to like,</hi> rather then <hi>Physiognomy.</hi> Hee is credulous and confident: the lesse certainty hee hath of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, the more publicke hee is, and peremptory.

the best part of his vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a talkatiue Barber: with whom he is the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; because he thinks, to haue a curle pate, is to haue a visible wit.

Hee is arrogant in his knowledge so far, as he (thinks) to study men, will excuse him from the labour of reading, and yet furnish him with absolute ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, fit for all fashions, all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses. He is a very promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fellow; and from thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the vice which makes him without difference, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ponderous and triviall pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages

vnder the same degree of value or estimation. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever becomes his politicke vent, becomes his vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. When he doth therefore fill vp the vessell of his conceits, he hath regard to such things as may bee vttered with most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, either of money among the plaiers, or reputation among the generall gallants of our Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. He takes account of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and through the practise of a contempt to all, he partakes in all: for hee vses what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides, vnder the priviledge of scorne, and so makes it familiar. So the largest benefit which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reape by contemning the vice in himselfe, arises beyond his purpose or intention: for he extends to others no further then agrees with his owne gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy constitution, meaning to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18400:96"/>
credit, or enrich himselfe; not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend others: by which meanes all his goodnesse is accidentall. He doth (notwithstanding) in some poynts resemble vertue; but in the worst manner. For being impartiall, he playes the tyrant; and sels the vices of his deerest friends to discoverie, by playes or pamphlets, but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that they should stil reserue them to their future infamie: So hee becomes sooner excluded oftentimes from society, then his flattring shifts can readily repaire. Flattery and insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be indeed the number of his thriving morall vertues, through which (vnder a pretence of faire meaning) he takes occasion to betray the marrow of mans vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie: and this affoords fuell for his bitter derision. His Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bookes be a chiefe adiunct, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18400:97"/>
the most significant Embleme of his owne qualitie, that man may beare about him: for the wiping out of old notes giue way to new: and he likewise, to try a new disposition, will final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forsake an ancient friends loue; because he consists of new enterprises. His capacity is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensiue in a strange measure: if he were lesse capable, he might be more commended. For hee incroaches often vpon admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (where things be well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered) to multiply his obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: and yet hee will verifie the thing, as if it were now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. If hee converts to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving qualitie, hee will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the credit of a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning no stipend for his vaine discoueries. Till then, he must intreate to be suspected, or odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, whilst he whispers closely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

free companions: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must he hope to amend the <hi>Age,</hi> or himselfe; because he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended the first; and the last he forgets (though he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it) through vaine glory; as being transported with his pride onely, that he hath obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and can obserue againe. Briefly, he resembles a foolish patient, who takes a costiue pill to loosen his body: for whilst hee meanes to purge himselfe by observing other humors, hee practises them by a shadow of mockage, and so becomes a more fast corruption: if he doth not therefore feele the disease, hee dies <hi>hide-bound.</hi> (* * *)</p>

The Church is a principall part of his devotion; and to bee a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Auditor, or outwardly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue, is a sure defence (hee thinkes) against capitall errour.

Hee is openly kinde-hearted; cries <hi>God forbid, Amen, Christ bee his comfort.</hi> But rather then hee will seeme a <hi>Puritan,</hi> with indifferent companions, hee can breake an obscoene Iest, bee wanton, sociable, or any thing, till hee converse with a Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian by whom he hopes to saue: then the eyes roule vpward, the hands be elevated, commisera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting tearmes bee multiplied, with sighes innumerable: then hee railes against the wicked, whom a little before hee hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie saluted. And after some paraphrase vpon the verse of such an Evangelist, Apostle, or Prophet, hee dismisses the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan, that himselfe may laugh in a corner.

of weighty labours, that he giues no attention to things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly recited, though they actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally possesse him. To be imploid therefore for a Noble man, is (to him) an infinite trouble, and begets imployment with all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance to discover it: so the bare meanes to make men think hee is much entertained, costs a time equall to his occurrents. Being to bee visited (though by sure Clients) he hath the roome of attendance, the Art of delay, and a visage that seemes pittiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interrupted. If he rides to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, the horses be early sadled, and brought to the doore, that neighbours may obserue; when, after fiue or sixe houres expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, hee comes like one that was detained by vrgent importunacies.

Therefore he revolues continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, what may be most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the tast, and hurtfull for the stomake.

If you be ciuill, he saith you are phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18400:111"/>
and friendly language he termes flattery. No estate, no aduancement, can remoue his humour: for hee doth not liue (whilst he liues not disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) but sleepes, or counterfeits. He thinkes salutations were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to <hi>beguile,</hi> or <hi>betray</hi>; hee loues not therefore to salute, or be saluted. Hee will refuse gifts, that come from reconciled foes, and thinkes an iniury can neuer be forgotten. On equall termes likewise, he is heartily vnwilling to receiue, except (in glory) he can ouer-value his deserts, by thinking he hath deserued tenne times more. A <hi>selfe-respect,</hi> and a <hi>disdaine</hi> of others, be his nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing vices: So he chuses ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to loose a bargaine, then to become a debtor; for he holds it more honour and pollicy to steale, then to be beholding. If
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18400:112"/>
you enquire his health, or the times newes, hee dares protest you are an impertinent, or a shallow companion. Other mens triumph is his sorrow, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens sorrow his triumph: for in his conscience he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced never, if not in mis-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of <hi>some,</hi> or <hi>all.</hi> His owne adversitie quickens him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce at others misery. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore bee saved, seeing he admits company as a delight, in nothing but desolation: and then, not their company, but their <hi>passion.</hi> His entertainments be, a fierce dogge to bid you wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, a currish voyce to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it, and <hi>the way is open</hi> for a fare-well. The two first be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, the latter hee intends: So doth he embrace acquaintance or neighbours; but impotent people he threatens in another

He will prevent you in a commoditie, and giue more; as also, hee dares discredit any thing, or any, not with a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to commend his owne, but to endammage others. He will bee shaven all wayes to the best helpe of a deformitie: and though his actions will soone verifie the Character, yet he will more mis-shape na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by ill-favoured Linnen, a greasie felt, and Garments made for the purpose; as if hee meant to discover himselfe by the fore-head, least hee should not be knowne quickly. He is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied vpon the smallest wrong,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:18400:113"/>
and will rather take the lawes assignment, though a trifle, then be content with large composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet none doth more grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble against the Law-professors. He listens to the death of great personages, as a Butchers dogge to the Oxes slaughter; reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to be glutted with his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes, or vices, seeing hee is not bettred by his body of worth, the best food.

If you fasten a gift vpon him, his thankes bee liberall, though he doth not requite: if hee doth not brand you with an insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Title; yet in extremitie of his passion he is so farre (as hee thinkes) from being vncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as he makes the charitie of <hi>Counsell, Purse,</hi> or <hi>Assistance,</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:18400:113"/>
things that would giue little thanke for his labour: and so he practises them vnder the ranke of such things as doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne him: He saith therefore, <hi>Meddle with me, when I meddle with you.</hi> So that if shame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes his wealth to invite stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, he hath no bountifull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but a resolution to liue by broken meate long after, which doth not savour well, except it be mouldy: <hi>that,</hi> and <hi>himselfe</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, should be spent sooner; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they grow visibly odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but himselfe more odious then <hi>that.</hi>

He should (by his qualities) be a good Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; for the one is iust in league with a voluntary ignorance, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inforced knowledge, as much as the other: Hee neuer offends this way, but he offends double; for he cannot with credit, or knowledge of the Art Military, thinke it sufficient to defend with bare affirmance, &amp; the wals of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uention, except his canno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

for all his truth'is extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, winne no beleife; because no false-hoods are so frequent. Any aduantage accruing to himselfe prouokes his faculty; though sometimes a friends loue intices him to strange aduentures. If neither the first nor second bee opportune, he so labours onely to beget wonderfull narrations. Hee is ready enough to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value himselfe, his friends, and his commodity: accounting it a pollitick straine to set an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent faire glosse on all; that hee may purchase the reputation of a large estate: Which seemes to argue an innocent vpright course, not fearing tyranny: But indeed he doth (from hence) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the world and die a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, through the foregoing esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Hee tels no wonder, without some preparatiue: as
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:18400:117"/>
namely, he admits before hand what may be: or he begins thus: <hi>You may thinke it is a lie</hi>: or, <hi>it will seeme strange, but I protest before God, it is very true:</hi> or the like: But if hee bee one that maintaines Ordinaries and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meetings; he speakes alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vpon credible report; and you shall be the third man partakes of the nouelty: for hee hath alwaies talked with one, that was an eye-witnesse: if hee were not himselfe the agent or beholder. He may at his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be admitted into the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Iesuites, but hee loues not to forsake his Country, though he boasts of trauailes; and yet he is a meere fugitiue. He was originally intended for a Rhetorician; and lackes onely a little instruction: For hee is more conuersant with <hi>Tropes</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:18400:118"/>
then <hi>Figures</hi>; and yet the figure of repetition, is his owne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. Attention makes thee very much culpable in his reports: beliefe makes thee apt to erre in the same kind. He is more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (if hee could be vncased) in the rare exploits of <hi>Rosaclere,</hi> and <hi>Delphoebo, Amadis de Gaule,</hi> or <hi>Parismus,</hi> then the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Text of Scripture. If hee should striue for Antiquity, no English Generation can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with him: And yet hee needes no Herald, for hee deriues his Pedigree immediately from the deuill.</p>

And for his Trauailes let the <hi>Globe</hi> witnesse; through euery corner of which, he hath or can walke at his pleasure.

otherwise he shifts his watring place; either to auoid his lowse, the Baylife; or to renew his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: the last onely pleades for his commendation, because hee proceedes still from worse to better: which discommends him most, because it nourishes his facultie.

He hath from the first

houre of his <hi>Matriculation</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited the name of <hi>Sharke,</hi> by way of a generall dependance in the Colledge: But being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps expulsed, or departing in a hungry humor, he trauels with a prompt memory, insteed of other knowledge; and aboue all things he is wise enough for himselfe, to remember his wants. Hee neuer looked into Diuinity beyond the meaning of two Sermons; and vpon those he hath insisted so often, that he feeles no need of another Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary: He still pretends (like some single Physitian) the cure of one disease, that is, the cold of charity, and therefore (his charitable aduise being ended) a bill of receipt followes for the ingredients: But the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease may be thought to grow more desperate through the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18400:122"/>
mistaken cure; because the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is applied vnfitly.

If you would priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know him; you must know likewise, the iourney to his friends hath beene tediously vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken; and whilst hee brings his mony in question, you must know he begges for an answere, and so betrayes the doubt of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency: howsoeuer (in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick) he insinuates a depriuation;

Being admitted (for Hospitality sake) to receiue lodging; he hath a slight of hand, or cleanely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiance, which threaten siluer spoones; and leaues a desperate sorrow among all the houshold seruants, because he departed so soone.

with the same reason: either by being satisfied with pleasure, or content with ill fortune.

The bringing vp, and Mariage of his eldest sonne, is an ambition

which afflicts him so soone as the boy is borne, and the hope to see his sonne superior, or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced aboue him, driues him to dote vpon the boy in his Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: To peruse the Statutes and preferre them before the Bible, makes him purchase the credit of a shrewd fellow, and then he brings all aduersaries to compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; and if at length he can discouer himselfe in large Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies beyond expectation, he hath his desire.

                  <hi>IS an Infernall: the Belzebub of a Sellar, and the very motion of a double Iugge.</hi> Hee was ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by a Drunkards <hi>appetite</hi> and <hi>vrine</hi>: for nothing but <hi>his</hi> desire to fill and emptie, hath bred a Tapster. He striues to be familiar at first sight; but instead of friendship hee retaines the names of Customers: onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Brewers men and him, there passes hungry and thirstie loue; consisting of Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheese &amp; rowles in recompence of Bottle-ale, and strong Beere. Drawers and hee liue at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for he thinkes the grape a disparragement to malt; and therefore hee incounters Wine
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:18400:143"/>
even with the smallest Beere he hath, to affright the fortitude of Sacke and Claret with extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: But (which betrayes his stratagems) he gladly makes the Vintners vessell his vassaile and <hi>Renegado.</hi> His riches are single, they consist of single money; his profession double, it consists of double Beere: but then his faculties are againe so single, that if he leaues the cellar, hee must begge or steale: for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and lazinesse haue beene his education. Meane time he is kept from robbery by exchange of single peeces: and yet hee disables himselfe in exchange, vnlesse hee expects nothing by delay. He feeles the same sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to heare you discommend his liquor, that hee doth to see you depart. <note n="*" place="margin">That which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agrees with a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous mans gain, agrees with his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his profit, goes against his conscience</note> It goes against his conscience to see the cup stand
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:18400:144"/>
quietly; and against his stomack to see you preferre Mutton be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore powdred beefe. He hath an ambitious memory, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deceiue him, because hee hath taught it to deceiue others: for his aboundance of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his meaning to get a stocke, labour to beget a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous two-pence in the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. His braine swarmes with a tempest of bottle-reckonings; which makes him carelesse of hats, least hee should breed an impostume, by inclosing their multitude, else he is afraid least the hot and moyst reckonings he carries in his head, should dissolue his felt; and therfor che goes vncovered: else to shew he reverences the Cellar &amp; weeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, more then the Church or Sabboth; for then onely hee playes the Turke, and puts on
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:18400:144"/>
else (which is indeed the reason) he knowes all commers claime his dutie, and therfore he walkes bare-headed to saue a labour. He attributes the scant measure of his Iugge to the Cellars darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and his saving nature; but rather then he will iustifie both, he hath a certaine slight of hand to fill the first glasse, and so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyds inquisition. All his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is, that he dares not cast away Gods good creatures; and therefore he preserues the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings to make a compound. Of his prayers and religion, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther finde any thing, nor will I leaue any thing written. But I beleeue strongly, that in stead of <hi>Praying,</hi> he <hi>wishes</hi> to heare men desirous of Collops and Egges, or red Herrings. And therefore I thinke he should thriue best in a sea voyage; because hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:18400:145"/>
the relish of meates sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned exceedingly. He hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to commend his litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but <hi>Brachigraphy,</hi> or the sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of short writing, which hee practises vpon the barrels head, or behind the doore: the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof hee propounds, but doth not discover the rules. If he dares defend his function in Winter, he must provide an Orator: for he speakes coldly for himselfe, as being troubled with a common hoarsenesse, to betray his vigilance. Briefly, you must imagine him a light fellow, and like the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of meeknesse, the sheeps-skinne; except the itch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles him. You can make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion that he is not ignorant to dispatch readily; for he hath his businesse at his fingers end. Hee may pretend <hi>Schollership,</hi> but all <hi>that</hi> is nothing to a Iugglers, who exceedes in the slight of hand; which is the Art of both. Hee trembles therefore alike with all <hi>Handicrafts,</hi> (though he be most valorous) to thinke he should dare strike in the court: for vpon his Palmes and Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers depend his <hi>In-comes.</hi> Hee is no vaine Disputant; his knowledge is positiue ingros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and so vpon record. <hi>Selfe-conceit</hi> in labours, hee refuses: for hee labours about nothing which is not iustifiable by <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents</hi>; either of <hi>West,</hi> his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, or a teacher. His Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:18400:147"/>
is meere naturall, if he hath any; that costs him no labour: in carriage, and the rest, hee barely imitates; that labour is worth nothing. Hee is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of what he doth: for hee regards not to haue a finger, but a whole hand in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. To which purpose you may see his name subscribed in Court, after <hi>sealed</hi> and <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> Hee doth relye vpon his masters practise, large inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and a deske to write vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Westminster</hi> likewise doth not altogether not concerne him: hee hath a motion <hi>thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and a motion <hi>there</hi>: thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee moues by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction from his Master: there he moues in the common place of breake-fasts, for reliefe of his stomacke; and if hee can match his breake fast and din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:18400:147"/>
without grudging of his stomacke, hee hath his desire. Hee is a follower: for he weares a livery; but no seruant, for hee payes his owne wages. Serving himselfe, he serues God by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion: for whilst hee loues his gaine, and serues his desire of getting, hee hates idlenesse. If his master thriues, hee cannot doe amisse; for hee leades the way, and still rides before; but if hee incline to the consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of state, hee needes a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster that can thriue in that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise also, to recover him.

heire, as hee with flattery ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues the Vsurer, and with nice dutifull care to preserue him, makes his rotten hide, the chiefe Indentures that containe his Title. Obligations be his best prayers; for hee cannot tie God to performe conditions, or put in fuertyship: his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath a <hi>Counter mand</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too honest; which hee will obey, rather then not saue by the bargaine. Hee is the safest man from danger in the pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of rapines; for first, the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant liues by sale and Country Tenants; the Cittizen by the Gallant; the Scriuener and the deuill vpon both, or all: So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liues by losse with the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, nor vpon trust, with the Citizen: his condemnation is a knot of <hi>Seales</hi> and their <hi>Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</hi> the first discouer to him a

conformed vnity; yet none hath more hand in the procuring of variance. The last discouers a tractable nature, which <hi>giues</hi> and <hi>takes</hi> impression. Of the first (that is to giue) he knowes no meaning but when he giues the print of his fist, that it may sticke by elder brothers a whole age: Of the last (that is to take impression) hee knowes none but a wrong meaning: for the best seale that imprints loue in him, is onely the Kings picture; and that loue continues no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then he beholds it. His quils and instruments betoken peace: you cannot therefore expect more valour in him, then to win ground by the aduantage of weake Prodigals, and such as runne away from thriftinesse: they be most importunate with him: with them hee preuailes
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:18400:151"/>
most: to them he sels his extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious nature at the highest value, because they be most willing to make it their peny-worth. His memory is his owne; another cannot safely trust it in recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the day of payment: for he reckons what he can saue, by renewing the hazard of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond forfeit, not your losse by the first: and so he ouer-reaches you, by ouer-reaching the time, when you trust his memory: which (like an old ridden Iade) lookes not to the Iourneies end but to the baiting place, though he goes further then the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies end: If you trust him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may feele the forfeite, and pay largely for an acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. His learning iumps iust with, or fals sometimes short of an Atturnies; being onely able to repeate the <hi>afore-said</hi> forme
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:18400:152"/>
to thousand purposes: So all his mistery is indeed nothing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his <hi>Art,</hi> but his <hi>Policy,</hi> or plaine knauery: And that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing serued in, to the worlds ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, represents a large foxes head, and a little Sheepe-skinne in diuers dishes. It is the totall of his Creed, that nothing should bee iustified, or called lawful, which hath not hand and Seale: that makes him exercise <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Seale,</hi> as the warrant for deuises of his <hi>head</hi> and <hi>Soule.</hi> He neuer rayses the spirit of a <hi>Prodigall</hi> by charmes, but he to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether rayses the spirit of mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a Citizen, and then this potent coniurer binds them both fast in a <hi>Quadrangle.</hi> Hee will seeme to know the Statute and common Law; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction failes commonly (for he looks to his owne aduantage)

Hee makes the Tearme his time of pilgrimage, and Offices at Law, the Shrine where hee offers vp his deuotion: Which (after hee hath ended his voyage) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to voluntary pennance; for hee trauailes bare foote.

She rises with a resolution to be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sober: this begets silence, which giues her a repletion of aire without ventage: and that takes away her appetite. Shee seemes therefore commendably sober vnto all: but she driues the Parson out of patience with her modesty, vnlesse he haue interest or be inuited: She inclines to statelines, thogh ignorant of the meaning: Her interpretor, taster, caruer, and Sewer, be theresore

accidentall; and yet without these, she were an Image to the assembly. Rosemary and Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands be her best magnificence. She will therefore bestow a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, though she receiues backe wages: behauiour stickes to her like a disease; necessity brings it; neither can she take pleasure in the custome: and therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunacie with repetition, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force her to dumbe signes: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise you must not looke for an answere. She is a courteous creature: nothing proceedes from her without a courtesie: Shee hath no ornament worth observance, if her gloues be not miraculous and singular. Those be the Trophy of some forlorne sutor, who contents himselfe with a large offring, or this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious sentence, that she should haue beene his bed-fellow. Her
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:18400:157"/>
best commendation is to be kist often: this onely proceeds from her without interruption. She may to some, seeme very raw in cariage, but this becomes noted through the feare of discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it. No question is to bee made of her maiden-head: yet if she weepes, a question may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise; as whether she doth still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to keepe it? but the answere take: away the doubt of loosing it: for neither can she repent her match before tryal, nor the losse of chastitie, seing she matcht for that purpose: but these are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to preserue her honesty: for she cannot also cunningly proceed; but like a quiet crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wishes to loose her Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters quickly, that shee may loose her maiden-head likewise. And now she is layd.</p>

                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:18400:158"/>
amorous veine, that I despised her meaning. She had her edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation vnder a great Countesse; and if she could leaue the court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship she learnt when she was a waiter, she might quickly proue a reasonable good woman. Her body is (I presume) of Gods making; and yet I cannot tell, for many parts therof she made herselfe.</p>
               <p>Her head is in effect her whole body and attire: for from thence, and the devises there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred, proceeds her blushing modesty, her innocent white teeth, her gawdy gownes, her powdred haire, her yellow bands, her farthingals, and false Diamonds.</p>
               <p>All these together, and a quicke fansie commend her function: for Fidlers and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:18400:158"/>
Painters be full of Crotchets. I haue heard her also wish for new hands: but those she hath, will serue conveniently among them that know her properties: you need not make the question whether she can sing; for visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will teach you, that she can scarce leaue singing. And as for dauncing, she will aske the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of you. She hath the tricke of courtship, not to bee spoken with; to take Physicke, and to let her mountebancke bee the best ingredient. Her wit is <hi>Dainty,</hi> because seldome: and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is wanting in the present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacie of conceit, shee makes good by rehearsall of stolne wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie answeres, even to the seventh addition. She purposes to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell shortly, when as her voyage will onely returne with some
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:18400:159"/>
French commoditie; and shee will rather fetch it, though shee may be furnished at home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause shee loues the cheapest ware, and the outlandish fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Her generositie extends thus farre; to bestow loue, and looke for neither thankes nor requital; because a Marmoset and little Dogge bee ignorant of both. These excepted, she never loved truely. Her morall vertues be a subtill thrift, and a thriving sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie. But whilst she makes the best construction of a matter, she would make likewise a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound Ioyncture of her behaviour onely, and Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage. This bargaine is open for any man, who thinks not the peny-worth doubtfull. Her best Religion is to teach a Parret the Lords prayer; but the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements be a new matter:
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:18400:159"/>
so that Petitions be more plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with her, then Iniunctions: at her owne request therefore I giue this to her looking-glasse.</p>

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:18400:160"/>
her tongue; and the reason her tongue also: but the subiect of her eloquence is the neighbours wife, and her husband; or the neighbours wife and husband both.

Being once a servant, shee then learnt to runne, or goe apace;
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:18400:160"/>
that she might tarry and take, or giue intelligence by the way. Shee aemulates a Lawyer in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the circuite, and therefore she keepes a circuit in, or out of her own liberties: striuing to be both one of the Iudges, Iury and false witnesses: that is her free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome onely, to censure. Shee contemplates within, that she may practise abroad; that makes her reveale secrets. Her mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is <hi>colour,</hi> that shee dawbes on every Fable; but in her selfe abhorres it.
