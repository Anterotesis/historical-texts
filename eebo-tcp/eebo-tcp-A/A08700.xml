            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Item</hi> It shall not be lawfull for any Person, or Persons whatsoeuer, to Traffique, Merchandize, buy or sell by any Weights and Measures within this <hi>Vniuersitie</hi> and Cittie of <hi>Oxon,</hi> or Suburbs of the same, except such Weights and Measures be found lawfull, approued and Sealed by the said Chancellour, his Deputie, or Deputies, the <hi>Clerkes</hi> of this Market, vpon paine of forfeiture for euery such offence, twentie shillings, and all such false Weights and Measures to be vtterly destroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item</hi> That all manner of Persons, that bring any <hi>Corne</hi> or <hi>Graine</hi> to the Market, of this <hi>Vniuersitie</hi> and Cittie of <hi>Oxon</hi> to be sold, shall measure the same with the common Market-Bushels, and Measures, &amp; in the Market-place, and not with any other Bushells, or Measures, nor any other where. And whereas We vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that diverse of the Cittie of <hi>Oxford,</hi> inhabiting in, or neere the said Corne-market, haue lately of their owne will, without any approbation from Vs, or our Vice-chancellour, taken vpon them to keepe and set forth on Market-dayes, publique Bushells and Measures, for the measuring of <hi>Corne</hi> and <hi>Graine,</hi> and take Tole for the same, without stint or limitation, sometimes a Pint and halfe, and sometimes a Quart for the measuring of a Bushell, whereas the ancient and laudable Due is, but the quantity of a quarter of a Pint at the most for such Measure: And also that diverse Malsters, Bakers, and Brewers, doe keepe in their private houses two Bushells, a bigger wherewith to buy, and a lesser to sell, whereby the Country people that bring in their <hi>Corne</hi> and <hi>Graine</hi> to the said <hi>Vniuersitie,</hi> are deterred to furnish the said Market, in regard that the Measure of <hi>Graine,</hi> will not hold out fully with the said great Bushells. We therefore for the future pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the said Inconveniences, and for the better governement of the said Market, that there bee no fraud vsed, doe by these <hi>Presents,</hi> straightly prohibite the Inhabitants of the <hi>Vniuersitie</hi> and Cittie of <hi>Oxon,</hi> and all others resorting to that Market, from keeping and setting forth any publique Bushell, or any other Measure, or to receaue any Tole or profit for the same: And also all Malsters, Bakers, and Brewers, from keeping in their houses, any more then one lawfull and sealed Bushell, by which they shall sell, as well as buy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item</hi> That to provide a sufficient and convenient remedie for the premises. We haue by our <hi>Letters Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi> vnder our <hi>Seale,</hi> appointed <hi>Christopher Divall</hi> Inhabitant within the said <hi>Vniuersitie,</hi> to looke vnto the
<pb facs="tcp:1222:3"/>
cleansing, and sweet keeping the Corne-market-place, and to provide a competent and sufficient number of Bushells, and other Measures, to be approued and Sealed by vs, or our Deputies the <hi>Clerkes</hi> of the Market, to measure the <hi>Corne</hi> and <hi>Graine</hi> brought to the said Market, and to take and receaue the iust and due Tole for the same, <hi>Viz:</hi> a Quarter of a Pint for every Bushell and not aboue: And We will and require, that no Buyer or Seller, or Inhabitant within the <hi>Vniuersitie</hi> or Cittie of <hi>Oxon,</hi> not exempt from paying of Tole, doe hinder, denie, or molest, Him the said <hi>Christopher Divall,</hi> in the due and lawfull execution of the said office, and taking the said Tole vnder penaltie to be punished, as contemners of the Priviledges and Liberties of this <hi>Vniuersitie,</hi> and the government of the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item</hi> It shall not be lawfull for any Hucster, liuing and inhabiting within the <hi>Vniuersitie</hi> or Cittie of <hi>Oxon,</hi> and Suburbs of the same, or any other Person whatsoeuer vnder colour of buying, keeping or making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for any Colledge or Hall of this <hi>Vniuersitie,</hi> or for any other Person whatsoeuer Priviledged or not, or vnder any other pretence to buy, obtaine, or get into his hands or possession in this Market, or within foure Miles thereof, any <hi>Piggs, Geese, Capons, Hennes, Chickens, Conies, Fish, Butter, Cheese, Eggs,</hi> or other Victuall whatsoeuer, to sell the same againe in this Market, or within foure Miles thereof, or to dispose of the same otherwise then for his owne vse and spending. And because Hucsters haue proued the Baine of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and their cunning devises by any former Rules and Orders heretofore published, haue not beene suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently met withall: We doe therefore hereby straightly Prohibite, all and every Hucster aforesaid, from bringing or placing their Wares, Victualls, and Provisions, though bought without the foure Miles afore mentioned, to be sold in the common Market-place, <hi>Viz:</hi> vpon or neere CARFOX, or <hi>Penny-loes-bench,</hi> but that they keepe and containe themselues for the vttering their said Wares and Provisions in one proper place, to be appointed and assigned from time to time, by vs or our Deputies, which place for the present We appoint and assigne, to be vnder the <hi>West-wall</hi> of <hi>Christ-church,</hi> betweene the great Gate thereof and CARFOX, only so farre as that Wall reacheth. And in case any Hucster aforesaid, shall presume to place his said Wares and Provisions, or put the same to sale elsewhere, then in the place formerly appointed &amp; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, (<hi>Viz:</hi>) vnder <hi>Christ-church-wall,</hi> or shall otherwise breake or violate any part, or clause of this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; for every time so offending, he shall incurre the penalties of the Statutes of this <hi>Realme</hi> in that behalfe provided, and be farther proceeded against as a Contemner of the Liberties and Priviledges of this <hi>Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,</hi> and the Government of the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item</hi> Whereas the greedie, and over hasty coveting of Victualls in the Buyer, hath beene a great meanes to encourage, and cherish Hucsters, it shall not be lawfull for any Person or Persons whatsoeuer, to buy of any Hucster any manner of Provision aforesaid, elsewhere then in the Place formerly appointed and assigned by Vs, nor before the same be brought and placed there openly to be sold, vpon paine of forfeiting for every such said offence, tenne shillings, and farther to be punished for Contempt.</p>
            <p>
