            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas <hi>Time</hi> hath seene much vanity, which is all laid upon <hi>Times</hi> old Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and wheras <hi>Times</hi> ears have beene tyr'd with Tales of Cocks and buls, lying, swearing, and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, scoffes, and jeeres, while one cryes, O <hi>Times!</hi> O <hi>Manners!</hi> another saies, What <hi>Times</hi> are these? another sings no other song but, Here's an <hi>Age</hi> would make a man mad: <hi>Time</hi> therefore to cleere himselfe, and to shew that the World is deceived in
<pb facs="tcp:3126:3"/>
laying the blame of all matters upon <hi>Times</hi> backe, hath here set downe his abuses, and certaine merry orders to be observed, that so the World may not grudge at the present <hi>Time,</hi> nor <hi>Time</hi> bee offended with the vice and vanity of the World, but both live merrily, according to these orders following.</p>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:3126:3"/>O Mortalls! why doe you complaine of <hi>Time?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Read here my griefe and wrongs in every line.</l>
            <l>You oftentimes doe wish that I would stay,</l>
            <l>When you are at the Ale-house, or at play:</l>
            <l>But never thinke that <hi>Time</hi> with his sharpe Sithe,</l>
            <l>Mowes downe by houres and daies your mortal life.</l>
            <l>And when you commit any wickednesse,</l>
            <l>And thereby bring your selves to great distresse,</l>
            <l>Then with poore <hi>Time</hi> you presently are mad,</l>
            <l>And thinke <hi>me</hi> evill because you are bad.</l>
            <l>What should <hi>Time</hi> doe, if he should strive to please</l>
            <l>All those who are sicke of a mad disease?</l>
            <l>And are so discontented with old <hi>Time,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who quietly doth runne through every Signe.</l>
            <l>For if that he would get the Land-lords praise,</l>
            <l>Then he must turne himselfe to Quarter-dayes:</l>
            <l>Or if the Tennants curses he would shunne,</l>
            <l>Then he must make the Quarter slowly come:</l>
            <l>If he would please the Virgin, he must bring</l>
            <l>A Suiter to her in her youthfull Spring:</l>
            <l>If he would please the Old man, he must stay</l>
            <l>His Houre-glasse, and his houre of Death delay:</l>
            <l>Or if he would the Cittizens love earne,</l>
            <l>Then he must adde to the yeare a fifth Terme.</l>
            <l>One sayes that <hi>Time</hi> is now growne very hard,</l>
            <l>And that his gates against the poore are barr'd:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:3126:4"/>Another sayes, it is a wanton <hi>Time,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>When men are onely guilty of that crime.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Time</hi> is much asham'd by Day and Night,</l>
            <l>To see such sights as doe him much affright,</l>
            <l>And make his old gray Fore-lock stand on end,</l>
            <l>To see how some doe prodigally spend</l>
            <l>Their precious houres in drinking and in swearing,</l>
            <l>Making a shew, and to the world appearing</l>
            <l>Brave Gallants, who are onely outward shapes</l>
            <l>Of Gentlemen, or rather but their Apes.</l>
            <l>For they esteeme that Vertue cannot be</l>
            <l>The formall cause of true Gentility,</l>
            <l>Or that poore undiscerned <hi>Vertue</hi> can</l>
            <l>Give onely being to a Gentleman.</l>
            <l>But let them passe; they that doe thus abuse</l>
            <l>Poore <hi>Time,</hi> shall want <hi>Time,</hi> which they scorne to use.</l>
            <l>And in a word, most men their <hi>Time</hi> doe spend</l>

<pb facs="tcp:3126:5"/>
the hands of <hi>Time</hi> will not be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of so much théeving and stealing.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Also it is ordered by <hi>Time,</hi> that hee that spends money before hee hath it, shall bee counted a forward fellow, and a cunning man; but because women are like this yeere to have tender eyes, therefore they shall have mourning Gownes made with great sleeves, that they may mourne for their Husbands decease in their Gownes, and laugh in their sleeves.</p>
