         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat about the yeare, 1639. The Pope and his Councell ſent <hi>William Oconner,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Jeſuit unto the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the reſt of the Catholick Princes for their contribution of Money, Arms and Amunition to carry on the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre of all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the 3. Nations. And for that end the ſaid <hi>Oconner</hi> came over into <hi>England</hi> about <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1640. And went daily in the garbe of a Courtier attending upon the Queen Mother. About 1. <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1640. the ſaid <hi>Oconnee</hi> did boaſt unto an Jriſh convert that he was the chief contriver of that intended Maſſacre, and that there were 7000. men in private pay for the Maſſacre in <hi>London.</hi> And that the L. <hi>Cottington</hi> was to be Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and had 500. <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts ſent out of <hi>Flanders</hi> to guard the Tower under him. And that the Queene was to goe beyond Sea, and pawne the jewels of the Crowne for that purpoſe. And that the Money, Arms, and Amunition which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had ſent over was ſecured at the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors houſe in <hi>London,</hi> and was diſpoſed of amongſt the Papiſts by one <hi>Garrat Dillon</hi> an Iriſh Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, who had his Reſidence at the Spaniſh Ambaſſadors.</p>
            <p>That upon diſcovery of the Maſſacre the ſaid <hi>O conner</hi> was apprehended, and committed to the <hi>Gate-hoaſe,</hi> 3. <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1640. But divers perſons in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Weſt minſter,</hi> cauſed the ſaid <hi>O conner</hi> to be protected from Iuſtice above 4. years and then to be releaſed, contrary to the Law of God, and the laws of the Land. And though the ſaid <hi>O conner</hi> was ſo time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehended that the Maſſacre was prevented here, yet becauſe Iuſtice was not ſpeedily executed upon him that others might heare &amp; feare, and do no more ſo wickedly. Therefore the hearts of his Confederates were fully ſet in them to do evill. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that above 100000 <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> were barbarouſly murdered in cold blood ſeverall moneths after the ſaid <hi>O con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> was apprehended. Moreover thoſe perſons did not only prevaile, that the bloody Maſſacre was not at all diſcovered to the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland</hi> to fore-warn and arme them to fight for their lives; but they improved ſuch an Intereſt here, that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh party who had a hand in the Maſſacre intended in <hi>England</hi> were never ſearched out. Yea thoſe perſons wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuffered the Queen to goe beyond Sea to pawne the Jewels of the Crowne for laying the foundation of the late warres here to carry on the Popes helliſh Intereſt.</p>
            <p>That thoſe Perſons have from time to time, Protected the Popes Agents from Iuſtice, when they were apprehended by his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and others during the wars, and ſent to the Parliament, to be tryed for their lives as Trayterous Incendiaries. Inſomuch, that the Pope &amp; his Conclave finding ſuch encouragement they ſent over 300 choſen Jeſuits into <hi>England</hi> to make factions, and parties amongſt Profeſſors, and ſo preach us into Confuſion as they have boaſted. Moreover the Pope cauſed his Buls to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged up on the Church doores at <hi>Antwerp</hi> and other places, in 1643. and 1644. giving diſpenſations to all Prieſts, and Ieſuits to come into <hi>England</hi> and to transforme themſelves into the various formes of Religion amongſt us, the better to divide the People and carry on their bloudy Deſignes under a form of Godlineſs. And by that ſtratagem they have all along exaſperated the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Profeſſors differing in Iudgement and made them bite, and endeavour to devour one another. Mean while the Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt hath gone on unſuſpected. And under this colour they have conſpired divers yeares to ſet the City of <hi>London</hi> on fire in a hundred places at once, and then fall to Maſſacre, and cut off the root and branch of all the Proteſtants in theſe Nations. Yea, they have boaſted that they are in conſtant readineſs, and watch only for the remove of the Army as they did in 1648. upon the <hi>Scots</hi> Invaſion, and the Inſurrection in <hi>Kent Wales,</hi> &amp;c. And the Captain Generall for that bloody worke had his conſtant reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadours houſe till hee removed from <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the aforeſaid Perſons have from time to time dammed up Juſtice againſt the Diſcoverers of thoſe horrid Conſpiracies, and all others who have appeared on their behalfe. And have cauſed them and their friends to bee defrauded of Eſtates above 40000. pounds in value. Mean while they have cauſed divers friends to thoſe diſcoverers to goe with ſorrow to their Graves, and others to lead languiſhing lives in diſgrace and repreach. Upon which account the foreſaid Perſons being ſubtle ſecret Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies did improve ſuch an Intereſt in the three laſt Parliaments, that no Law was made to remedy ſuch abhominable obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Iuſtice whereby the Agents for the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the King of <hi>Scots</hi> have been encouraged, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in their barbarous Conſpiracies, and the friends of the Common-wealth expoſed to ruine. Onely the good hand of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath preſerved thoſe Diſcoverers, and many of their friends even to Admiration for to make good the fore-going parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars on behalfe of this divided, and wel-nigh diſtracted Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>That the King of <hi>Scots</hi> hath many yeares ſince engaged to the Pope to ſet up Popery in theſe Nations upon the <hi>Popes</hi> engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to improve his Intereſt to ſettle him in his Throne. And from that mutuall Ingagement, The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and here may gather that their making a party to bring in the K. of <hi>Scots</hi> for the Eſtabliſhing of <hi>Presbytery</hi> was to ſtrengthen the hands of the Popes party to murder them, and their poſterities. And the <hi>Proteſtant Cavalier</hi> may likewiſe obſerve that if they ſhould have conquered the Parliaments party, yet all the advantage they would have gained thereby would have been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this to have been laſt deſtroyed. For the <hi>Popes</hi> bloody Monſters would have given them no more quarter then they did the 100000. in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which they murdered in cold blood.</p>
            <p>That the Spine ſaith. <hi>No Propheſie of Scripture is of any private Interpretation. And becauſe thou haſt let goe out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter deſtruction, thy life ſhall goe for his life, and thy People for his People. And neglect to ſtrengthen the hands of the poore and needy, was one of the ſins of</hi> Sodom, <hi>And God abhorres ſolemne Faſts, and other duties where Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Righteouſneſs are neglected,</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 42. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 49. <hi>Iſa</hi> 1. 11. to 18. <hi>Amos,</hi> 5. 21.) From whence it doth appeare that the unparalell'd mercies which God hath beſtowed upon theſe Nations have been hitherto intermixed with dreadfull Iudgements threatning utter deſolation. Becauſe! The <hi>Popes</hi> bloody Monſters have been let goe from time to time by the aforeſaid ſecret Enemies. And, becauſe men of knowne Integrity, fearing God, and of a good converſation are not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Commiſſioners to bring theſe ſecret Enemies unto ſpeedy publick Juſtice, and to breake the heavie yoke of oppreſſion by delivering the ſpoyled from their oppreſſors and ſtrengthen the hands of the poore and needy, which is the faft that God hath choſen, and promiſed a ſpeciall bleſſing unto.</p>
            <p>In tender conſideration of the premiſſes J doe earneſtly beſeech all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> under what forme whatſoever, ſpecially in, and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Weſt minſter</hi> (as they will anſwer it at the great day of Account, and deſire to be free from the blood of themſelves, and their Wives, Children and friends.) That they would unite as one man, and improve their utmoſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Parliament by Petition and otherwiſe, for the obtaining of ſuch Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners, to the end the Innocent blood which hath been ſpilt by the Trechery of thoſe ſecret Enemies may be expiated, and the <hi>Pope</hi>'s bloody Deſignes now on foot may bee defeated. And that the complainings in our Streets may ceaſe by ſetting the oppreſſed free from the obſtructions of Iuſtice which they have long groaned under. And I doe hereby engage my Life to make good the aforeſaid particulars before ſuch Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, and do profeſſe before God and men that J am moved to declare theſe things out of no ſelf-end or by-reſpect whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but out of a deſire to diſcharge a good Conſcience and a zeale to promote the good and welfare of theſe Nations; being fully convinced that the appointment of ſuch Commiſſioners would ſoone root out the <hi>Popes</hi> Incendiaries, and undeceive many thouſands of deluded diſſenters, and reconcile this divided People and open an effectuall doore for judgement, &amp; righteouſneſs to run downe like a mighty ſtreame, and would give the People cauſe to bleſſe the Lord, for raiſing and Spiriting his Highneſs, and this Parliament, to be Repairers of our Breaches, and the Reſtorers of paths to dwell in.</p>
