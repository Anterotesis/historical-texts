         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="2">2. The sayd Perfection of the first Man consisted in two things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98869:5"/>
if either had beene wantinge, it had not bene that Perfection that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was &amp; which wee his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie are to seeke after as our cheife, &amp; only happynesse.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The one of those two things soe necessarie was a perfection in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that were requisit (as a meane) towards the exercise of the other as cheife, &amp; its end. And that <hi>Other cheife thinge was a continuall perfect actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of loue by the Mans soule towards God that caused an Vnion with him.</hi> In which Actuation &amp; Vnion causin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge the fruition heeretofore mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by mee, consisted the Mans feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie for this life, &amp; the degree &amp; measure whereof was to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his more real felicitie in the future.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The former of those two beinge the perfection of all vertues (that is the same as the perfect habits of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) implyeth in it an exemption &amp; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from their contrarie being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or habits, or (which

               <p n="5">5.

profitable and proper vse of the rest, &amp; of those acts alsoe soe farre as they may make them agree with their state and condition by some smal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration. As where it is spoken of obedience to Superiors; it may be applyed of wiues to their Husbands, Children to their Parents, single peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to their Ghostly Fathers, yea of all People to their Ghostly Fathers in a good sense. Soe also where it is spoken of Pouertye, it may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in Spirit &amp; affection, which all, euen lay people ought to Haue. And in like manner where it is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Religious offices both for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptinge meane and base ones, and refusinge honorable ones, may be as well applyed to lay Offices both in priuate familyes, and common Wealths. And thus appropriatinge euery thinge to each ones particular state and condition, very good and profitable vse may be made of them all.</item>
                  <item>3. Though these Deuotions be ample
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98869:13"/>
and large enough, yet they cannot reach to euery ones particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions &amp; necessities, wherefore they are to obserue that what Deuotions may be specially inspired them, or vpon some iust Occasion suggested vnto them as proper and necessarye for them, they ought to make vse of them freely and cheerefully though they be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <item>4. Now as concerninge the maner of exercisinge these Deuotions, it ought cheifly to be done in Spirit &amp; mind and without any vocalitie at all, especially in beginners who would be more distracted through such vocalitie as more sensible, and soe more subiect to distraction, yet in some who haue such a Grace to exercise them both vocallie &amp; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallye that is spiritually; they may doe well, and best it is soe to doe.</item>
                  <item>5. And as concerninge the quantitie though they be deuided into seuerall
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98869:14"/>
Exercises and those into seueral Acts. Yet is it not to be vnderstood that all the Acts of euerie exercise are to be vsed at one tyme; nor that one Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise and all its Acts only are to be vsed at one tyme, but in this <hi>discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is to be vsed, and libertie of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; sometymes to vse fewer, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes more as may be expedient for our soules good.

And heere it is to be obserued that wee must not be deiected or giue ouer our Mentall Prayer though wee doe not find soe soone an alteration, and amendment in our life, as wee hoped for. The reason is because <hi>God</hi> many tymes petmitts vs to fall into our wonted imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and Frailties for our Humilitie and Mortification. Agayne wee ought to consider that if wee are so fraile with this kind of Souueraigne <hi>Prayer</hi> what should wee be without itt.

at least a Director for some tyme in the Beginninge; especially, til wee haue gott some feelinge of them, and then wee may better wrastle with difficulties Alone. And wee shall easilie perceiue whom wee are to make vse of in this kind, and who are for our purpose, and who are not. And the like may be said of Bookes. What Bookes, or Parts or Parcells of Bookes rellish with our Spirits, breed discreet feruour and Deuotion in vs, those wee are to make vse of and be conuersant in; such as breed Feare, Scruples, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Confusion, and disquiet of Mind &amp;c. they are not for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, neither doe they concerne vs. And thus doinge, wee shall make right vse of all Bookes, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, and reape profitt and noe harme by them; which <hi>God</hi> send wee may. <hi>Iesus.</hi>
