            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>HOld, Sir, why so fast? Should your Worship now be found scampering again, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wing, (though not I hope for <hi>Holland</hi>) for all your Pilloring of me, you may chance pass with some People for a Knight of the <hi>Post</hi> too.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>R.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Indeed Doctor you find me habited some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a Man of Expedition, but not, as you would maliciously insinuate, running away: I see you have none of that distinguishing Faculty which has alway attended my way of Writing: Though I may look like one that is making a sort of Fashiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Retreat, and have the <hi>Habitus</hi> of a Man in the <hi>Mode,</hi> yet I am not come to the <hi>Modality</hi> it self, which is the very <hi>Actus</hi> that must denominate a man <hi>a Run-away.</hi>

               <p>So then, all this Rhetorical Circumlocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on serves only to tell us, you are only, what we call in our vulgar Tongue, <hi>Absconding.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>R.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Truly I were, as they commonly call it, actually <hi>Absconded</hi>; but it was my Fate to fare, as in the Business of your old Friend Sir <hi>Patience</hi>; when they were hunting for one Knight, they stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in a Garret upon another, who gave them the slip, left me in the lurch; and the greater Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite of the Two had the better luck; and <hi>so good night Sir</hi> Nicholas.</p>

            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>Why, methinks you might have taken warning by me too; I staid also a little too long after the Tide was turn'd: <hi>Faelix quem faciunt,</hi> &amp;c. was as good a Lesson as ever you learnt on the <hi>Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi>; and you know what follow'd, Friend, from my Fool-hardiness; I was forc'd to follow the Cart for it; and your <hi>fiddling Observators</hi> help'd to lead me such a Dance, that you would be loth to have such another to the same Tune.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>R.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You had a little hard measure, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, Doctor, and I were a little too smart upon your misfortunes, when your Back-side sufficiently smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and when you were fast enough in the Pillory, I had so little Conscience as to toss you from Pillar to Post in my Papers; but I hope, since you have been so much <hi>Passive,</hi> and such a <hi>Gospeller,</hi> you have learnt somewhat of that Christian Temper, <hi>the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good for Evil.</hi>

               <p>I must confess Dr. <hi>O.</hi> (for till now I could never call thee any thing but plain <hi>Titus</hi>), I have been twice very near hanging: You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member when your old Friend <hi>Colledge</hi> had truss'd me up in his Picture; but you know <hi>Towzer</hi> broke the Rope, and left the <hi>Joyner</hi> to hang in his room: And I han't forgot when my old Master <hi>Noll</hi> was like to have spoil'd me for an <hi>Observator,</hi> but my <hi>Fiddle</hi> brought me off, like <hi>Arion with his Harp,</hi> and so I <hi>weather'd the Storm.</hi>

               <p>But there are some unlucky <hi>Sayings</hi> that may now spoil your Comfortable Expectations; <hi>The Third Time is commonly fatal too</hi>; and <hi>the Pitcher that comes oft from the Well, may be broke at last.</hi>

               <p>And so you think at last may my Neck too; but I hope better Times: However, I must tell you, <hi>Titus,</hi> after all my Service to the King and Government, and especially the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I am a little <hi>hardly us'd.</hi>

                  <hi>Hardly us'd,</hi> say you? <hi>Soft</hi> there, I pray, <hi>Hemp and Halter</hi> are <hi>hard</hi> things, I confess; but yet they may be <hi>easily</hi> born with, for the Good of the Publick, for the Administration of Justice, and the giving every man his due. But how comes the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be so much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd

to you? and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not at all?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>R.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Why truly, as I manag'd the matter, I writ for both Churches, accordingly as they paid me, but still that of <hi>Rome</hi> I reserv'd to reap the benefit of all that should be done or said for the good of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other; by the Obligations of Honour and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude I was retain'd to that Party; for though a Counsel Learned in the Law, may allow himself to take Fees on both sides, yet he is bound in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to plead most strongly for that side which has feed him most; and he that disciplin'd your Hide so to <hi>Tyburn, Titus,</hi> that Officer of the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-feed by the Adverse Party, did not spare you in the least for all your Guineys that you gave.</p>

               <p>So that, if I apprehend you a-right, there is some <hi>Honesty</hi> even in playing the <hi>Knave</hi>; and that you had a constant Sallary for the <hi>Catholick</hi> Cause, and but some poor Collections from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>Though you were once in my Opinion but a very bad Evidence, I see you are very good at guessing: But for all this, though I design'd to serve none but the Popish Party, I had that jilting Trick to pretend with them too now and then some Coyness, when I had a mind to screw up my Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants to be more liberal.</p>

               <p>No, you may be sure of it: and so to work <hi>I</hi> went to spirit them out again: <hi>I</hi> laid my self up a whole week from greater Concerns, to prove, That for all they came to Confession, tho' they conform'd to all the Ceremony of the <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> Responces, Postures, and received the very Sacraments in the Form the Church requires, all this signified nothing, they long'd still for the Flesh-pots of <hi>Egypt</hi>; their hearts were not <hi>with us,</hi> and therefore must be <hi>against us.</hi> They <hi>Trimm'd</hi> only with God <hi>Almighty,</hi> and so <hi>I</hi> put this <hi>Hook</hi> into <hi>their Nostrils,</hi> and return'd them to the place
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107084:11"/>

My two Books would have bid fair for that too; for when my hand is in, <hi>I</hi> can prove any thing: but for some certain Reasons <hi>I</hi> found <hi>Felo de se,</hi> and the killing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to be the better way. He <hi>fell</hi> upon his Sword, 'tis certain, and that upon <hi>Primrose-Hill, I</hi> say: which I've made out so plain in my two Treatises, on that Subject, that you may as well disbelieve the Bible, or think <hi>Saul</hi> never <hi>fell</hi> so on <hi>Mount Gilboa.</hi>

               <p>But there was a plaguy Observation that a certain Chirurgeon made against this, which seems to have some weight with it: When persons do destroy themselves, fall voluntarily on their Swords; when they are thus run through, the Orifice in the Back from the bent and position of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107084:12"/>
the body, must be higher than that before in the Breast; whereas the quite contrary appear'd here, and the Orifice behind, where the Sword came <hi>out,</hi> was lower than that before where the Sword went <hi>in.</hi> But besides, Mr. Observator, if <hi>violent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions</hi> may take place, and, which a great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer call'd a <hi>plain Proof,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sp</hi>—'s being pluck'd in at the same Water-gate only for resembling so much Sir <hi>Edm.</hi> and his hearing <hi>Hill</hi> bidding them to let him go, and that they had mistook the Man; this seems not so ridiculous a Connexion as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servator may be ready to make it.</p>

There were indeed two or three plaguy Affidavits taken by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice <hi>Dolb—n</hi> about the business, of persons that saw this unfortunate Gentleman parlying with some certain Fellows the same night at the same Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, when and where he was sworn to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed;

and whatever was the profligate <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Witness</hi> (whom you know <hi>I</hi> set forth with a <hi>Witness</hi> too) some credulous men may think <hi>Bedloe</hi> might be believed on his <hi>Death</hi>-bed, and his Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony then taken by the Lord Chief Justice, and publisht under his own Hand; These (I say) are mighty Matters with men of ordinary Capacities; but what is all this to such a man of Wit and Parts as my self to confute?

But you may talk of <hi>introducing Popery</hi> by <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Secret Consults</hi>; I had a better way than all that: I undertook to perswade the King to make it a Case of Conscience, to promote his Religion, and declare <hi>openly,</hi> we must all be of it; for this purpose, you know, I spent several <hi>Observators</hi> upon the <hi>Theologo-political Casuistical Thesis</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,</hi> That every Supream Magistrate and Prince was bound in <hi>Conscience</hi> to answer to God for the Religion of all his Subjects, and make them to conform to that which he thought best.</p>
