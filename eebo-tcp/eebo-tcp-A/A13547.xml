            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E reade, that when <hi>Obed-edom</hi> entertained the Arke of the Lord, the Lord blessed <hi>Obed-edom,</hi> and all that hee had, because of the Arke of God. That Arke was a signe of Gods presence, and a type of our Ministery, to
<pb facs="tcp:18777:3"/>
which Iesus Christ hath tyed his speciall presence. That Arke was graced with many miracles: By it, the waters of Iordan diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themselues, and gaue way to Israel to passe, as on dry land. By it, the huge walls of Ierico fell downe to the ground. By it, <hi>Dagon,</hi> the Idoll of the Philistims, was throwne to the earth and dis-membred. This our Euangelicall Arke is countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with as many, and mighty miracles as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that was: It passeth all the Israel of God thorow the mighty flouds, and impassable streames of afflictions and impediments, that otherwise would stop them in their way to Canaan. By it, the huge walls of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, and lusts, euen all high thoughts, lift vp against God, and reared vp against heauen, are throwne downe, and cast to ground. By it, the adored <hi>Dagon</hi> of Popish Idolatry, and superstition; of errours, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, false-worship, and ignorant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, is cast vpon his face, not able to abide the presence of the Arke, and truth of God: and a thousand such miracles are daily wrought by it in the conuersion of men.
<pb facs="tcp:18777:3"/>
From that Arke, the Lord gaue immediate answeres, and diuine Oracles. From ours, we haue as sure directions, in all cases of faith, and sound doctrine, and also of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian manners. In that, were the Tables of stone written with Gods finger: In this, are those Tables, not laid vp, but vnfolded, and Christ, the end of the Law, included. Before that, was the Pot of Manna, and the flourishing Rod of <hi>Aaron.</hi> This exhibiteth Christ the Bread of Life, and the Manna that came downe from heauen; together with his Rod and gouernment, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med quite cut off, and withered, in his death; bur gloriously budding, and flourishing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in his powerfull Resurrection. Now the way to meete wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h blessing, is, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our Arke, as <hi>Obed-edom</hi> did that. For it was not the presence of the Arke, but <hi>Obed-edoms</hi> reuerent entertainment of it, that procured his prosperity. No more is it the presence of a powerfull Ministery (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose by Christs owne person and presence) but the kind and louing respect of it, that may expect blessing from it. This kind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
<pb facs="tcp:18777:4"/>
               <hi>Obed-edom</hi> expressed in these particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He loued God himselfe first, and for his sake, the Arke of his presence. Hee that loues not God, can neuer entertaine the Arke: and a sure signe of a man hating God himselfe, is the hatred of a faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Obed-edom</hi> embraced the Law of God with a reuerend affection; and for the loue of that, entertained the Arke, in which the Law was preserued. For if <hi>Obed-edom</hi> had violated the Tables of stone, or broken the Rod of <hi>Aaron,</hi> or mis-vsed the Manna; he had been so frrre from being bettered by the presence of the Arke, that it would haue proued his destruction. No man can friendly embrace the Ministery, that liueth in the ordinary violation of any of the Lawes of God; or despiseth any of the rules by which Iesus Christ gouerneth his Church. Yea, for such a man to liue vnder a godly Ministery, it rather furthers his Iudgement, than any way procures his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:18777:4"/>3. <hi>Obed-edom</hi> entertaining the Arke, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained also the Officers of it; hee brake not off the rings, nor the barres in the rings, by which it was carried to and fro. No man can benefit himselfe by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, that despiseth such godly Ministers, who as the barres in the rings of the Arke, propagate the Truth, and carry the Word of saluation among the Nations. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the Arke of God, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of blessing to our selues, and all that we haue. It is true, that Gods presence is not to bee desired for outward blessings: but yet euen these are annexed often vnto it. For godlinesse is neuer without some great gaine; nor the doctrine of godlinesse so sory a ghest, but it leaues some bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gratuity for kind and louing entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Arke was neuer separated from the Mercy-seate; to shew, that Gods mercy is neere vnto him that affecteth Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
            <p>To you (Right Worshipfull) I commend this care of prizing Gods Arke, set vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, because I thirst after your
<pb facs="tcp:18777:5"/>
prosperity. Faile in this, and you haue let out the vitall spirit of your Corporation, which shall runne vpon rocks and ruine, as the ships on a stormie Sea, whose Mariners haue cast away their Card. Your wisdomes know what Gods Wisedome is plentifull in teaching, that declining in goodnesse, for most part bringeth a declination in the outward estate: whereof <hi>Salomon</hi> had wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full experience; whose departing from Gods wayes, lost him ten parts of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome at one clap. The dying speech of <hi>Phineas</hi> his wife is memorable; that when the Arke was taken from Israel, The glory is departed from Israel. Many things I might heere moue in, but I spare both you, and my selfe, seeing I can weakly speake vnto you. Onely now I will turne precepts into praiers, that as the dew from Hermon, and Mount Sion, did distill on the valleyes round about them; so may this Towne, by your prudent gouernment, bee a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of piety, charity, and sobriety, to the whole Countrey about you. And as this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Towne for pleasant situation, and
<pb facs="tcp:18777:5"/>
rich commodities, for prudent gouernment and ciuill state, but especially for the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull meanes of knowledge and grace, is as a light set vp in a Candlestick, as a Tower on the top of an hill, and as a Beacon to the whole Countrey: so your godly care may be so much the more to walk worthy your great priuiledges. For if darknesse should be on this Hill, what can be expected in the valleyes? And if your faith should not bee published, and your obedience should not come abroad, among whom Gods Arke hath been seated so long, who can expect the continuance of your prosperity? I speak not, to blot you with dis-respect of your Ministers, or the meanes of Gods presence which you enioy; for I praise God, to see the House of God so frequented, and your selues can confesse, how God hath been a good Pay-master already for some good affections this way, in much increase added of late yeeres to the outward estate both of your publike Corporation, and many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate persons: but to incourage you, both to the continuing, and adding to that you
<pb facs="tcp:18777:6"/>
haue begun; as knowing, it is no lesse ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to keepe, than to get; and that the more respect you giue to the Arke of God, the more will the Lord respect you in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Your example that are in eminent place, shall greatly further in others with Gods glory your own reckoning. Of <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> we reade, <hi>Bonis legibus à se latis multa correxit, sed exemplo probae vitae plus effecit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud populum:</hi> Good Magistrates doe more good by good examples, than by good Lawes: and on the contrary, <hi>Plus exemplo nocent quam peccato:</hi> Their sinne is not so hurtfull as their example. But I haue inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my selfe silence; and onely for your furtherance to the duty perswaded, make offer to your Worships this little helpe and direction. A signification of my loue, a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of my duty, and a piece of my thankfulnesse for sundry fruits of your lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing respect of me both publike and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall. And to whom should I rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this labour, than to you, who heard it preached with much gladnesse? some of whom haue often professed the
<pb facs="tcp:18777:6"/>
much comfort and content which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the hearing, and since haue been instant spurres and perswaders for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing, that you might haue it by you for a more continuall and constant direction. As I haue giuen way to your desires: so God giue a plentifull blessing vnto it, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to your whole gouernment and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that it may still bee happy in the Arke, and for the Arke. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>In the words consider, 1. A Preface, vers. 4.2. A Parable, 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>In the Preface,

            <p>The occasion was, the <hi>gathering of much people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> and <hi>comming vnto Christ out of all Cities.</hi> Christ had powerfully taught them, and with authority, not as the Scribes. He preached a strange Doctrine to them, who had been set so fast in the Rudiments of the Law. He had wrought many great and potent miracles, mightily declaring himselfe the Sonne of God. The course of his life was most innocent in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18777:10"/>
himselfe, most charitable and helpfull to others. Great was the fame of Christ in all the countrey: so as people came flocking and thronging vpon him out of all the Cities, by sea and by land. Multitudes came, all in the same action, but not with like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: some, to see his Person, some, to heare his Doctrine, some, to admire his Miracles, some (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) to picke or catch matter of accusation. But, what euer their intent was, our Lord, who neuer slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped any opportunity of doing good, apprehendeth the Occasion, and beginneth to teach them.</p>
            <p>Here something is to bee learned, both from the example of this people, and of our Lord himselfe.</p>
            <p>By example of the people, learne two things:</p>
            <p n="1">I. To prease with diligence to heare the voice of Christ. He is the welbeloued Sonne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Be diligent to heare the Word.</hi>
               </note> in whom the Father is well-pleased, Math. 3.17. therefore <hi>heare him,</hi> chap. 17.5. Reasons.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5.</note> 1. He speaketh the <hi>words of life,</hi> Ioh. 6.66. and without them we <hi>abide in death.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> He is <hi>the truth and the life,</hi> chap. 14.6. not the Author onely, but the publisher of it. 2. Consider the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence: Where Christ seeth multitudes of men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ready to heare, hee will present himselfe ready to teach: as here, he saw the willingnesse and diligence of the people out of all Cities, and hee spake vnto them. 3. It is a sound testimony to the truth, in good and holy manner, with zeale and delight to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> heare the Word of God. <hi>Hee that is of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 8.47.</note> 
               <hi>heareth Gods Word.</hi> And not to frequent the voice of Christ, is to <hi>withdraw ones selfe vnto perdition.</hi> And such,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> though they bee in the Church, yet are not of the Church. 4. All other seruice and deuotions are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:18777:11"/>
lost and vnfruitfull, if thou beest not a diligent and reuerent hearer. Prou. 28.9. <hi>He that turneth his eare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> from hearing the Law, his prayer is abominable.</hi> 5. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the future danger. If so many sorts of hearers be condemned, as three of foure, for want of a right and good manner of hearing, how great damnation abides such as will not heare? Math. 10.14. <hi>If any will not heare your words, shake off the dust of your feet against that person. Verily I say vnto you, it shall be easier for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Gomorra than for that City or person.</hi> Act. 3.23. <hi>Euery one that will not heare that Prophet, shall bee cut off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> See that ye despise not him who speaketh from heauen: for if they escaped not, which refused him that spake on earth; much more shall wee not escape, if wee turne away from him that speaketh from heauen, Heb. 12.25. <hi>Obiect.</hi> If Christ would speake from heauen, we would come and heare, and flocke together, as these multitudes did. But now we cannot heare Christs voice. <hi>Answ.</hi> Himselfe hath said, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth you, despiseth me,</hi> Math. 10.40. Ioh. 13.20. Malice against the seruant, proceeds from malice against the Master, and so the Lord accounts it, Act. 7.51, 52. The holy Ghost is resisted, when his messengers are resisted. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But we haue other businesse to doe, our Trades to follow,<note place="margin">Luk. 10.42</note> &amp;c. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. <hi>One thing is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:</hi> godlinesse is the greatest trade, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test reuenue. 2. This people left their trades and businesses, and flocked after Christ. <hi>Obiect.</hi> Then should we incurre slander, reproch, disgrace. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Thy praise shall be of God, if thou be a good hearer.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18777:11"/>
2. These feared not the breath of men, or the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates censure, or sentence as against Innouation, though after a most vnusuall manner they flocked by multitudes out of all the Cities. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But they be but a few poore meane men that flocke to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Here is Christs word true, <hi>The poore receiue the Gospell,</hi> Math. 11.5. 2. Neither Christ, nor his Word accepteth persons, but gladly teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and encourageth such.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In that the people came flocking together,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Be forward in hearing the Word.</hi>
               </note> with zeale and forwardnesse, we learne thus much: that we ought cheerfully and diligently to come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to heare the Word, and bee ready before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand when Christ is to speake. These were present before he began to speake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. This was prophecied of Beleeuers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> Esa. 2.3. <hi>Many shall goe vp to the Mountaine of the Lord, and shall say, Come, let vs goe vp.</hi> Psal. 122.1. <hi>I reioyced when they said, Let vs goe vp to the house of the Lord.</hi> Esa. 60.8. <hi>Who are these that fly like a cloud, and as Doues to the windowes?</hi> 2. God lookes not onely that the substance and matter of an action be good,<note place="margin">2</note> but the manner must be sutable. Hee cares for no carelesse seruice. 3. A good heart findes nothing so sweet as God and his presence:<note place="margin">3</note> and this is promised to true seekers. <hi>Dauid,</hi> in many wants,<note place="margin">Psal. 27.4.</note> desires but <hi>one thing,</hi> and that is, <hi>to dwell in the house of God all his dayes, to see the beauty of his face:</hi> and,<note place="margin">Psal. 84.1.</note> 
               <hi>Oh how ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are thy Tabernacles! my soule longeth after the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God: when shall I appeare before him?</hi> 4. These Iewes perceiuing some temporall good from Christ,<note place="margin">4</note> who filled their bellies, healed their bodies, raised
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18777:12"/>
their dead, &amp;c. did thus flocke after him, sea and land could not separate them. But he that findes the sweetnesse of the Sonne of God, bringing downe the bread and water of life to eternall life, healing all diseases of the soule, which no herbe or plaister could doe, but one made of his owne heart-blood, raising the dead and rotten in their sinnes, stinking in the graue, to a new and eternall life, must needs flocke after him, and follow him as cheerfully as euer did this people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> Let this shame our dulnesse, who are so slacke and heauie in the seruice of our God. If Christ will waite vpon vs, and our leisure, wee will sometimes heare him a piece of an houre. It is an vnconsciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sin of this place, that though you come at length, you come not flocking, or together, as this people, nor goe out together.<note place="margin">Act. 10 33.</note> 
               <hi>Cornelius</hi> (a great man) and his company were ready against the time of <hi>Peters</hi> comming. <hi>We are all now here before God</hi> (saith he) <hi>to heare the things that are commanded thee of God.</hi> Not that this attendance is due to the persons of your Ministers, but to their worke and office. But you cannot say when your Preacher comes, <hi>We are all here present</hi>; nay, scarce a few of so great a Congregation. Take heed; if you do any thing for God, do it cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, doe it freely: Let your prayers, and praises, and obedience waite vpon God in Sion. A reuerent heart affected with loue of the things of God,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.147.</note> will <hi>preuent the watches</hi> in Gods worship; that is, no watch shall quicken it, but it will bee before-hand: And as the two Disciples, hauing a desire to see Christ, did out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run one another toward the graue, and striue who
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18777:12"/>
might come first; so the true followers of Christ creepe not like snailes to Church, or striue not who shall come last in, (as many slip in, in the middle of Sermon, some almost at the end, most after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:) but run and striue who shall come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most. Oh that the warme affection of our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation would affoord vs this cheerfull expectance!</p>
            <p>Now out of the example of our Sauiour Christ,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apprehend all good op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities within thy calling.</hi>
               </note> who seeing the diligence and confluence of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, tooke occasion by that their thirst and desire to heare the Word, to teach them, we learne a speciall Christian duty; namely, to <hi>take all occasions of doing good,</hi> within the compasse of our callings; especially where we may receiue or impart the greatest good. If the Minister see his people about him, ready to heare the Word of God, let him imitate his Lord and Master. Now he hath a large field, and thereby strong hopes not to lose all his seed. Now hee hath before him an obiect of pity and compassion. What pity to see a flocke without a shepheard to feede and fold them? This Christ mourned for, Math. 9.36. What pity to see a whole field of corne white for the haruest, but rotting on the earth for want of a man to gather it?</p>
            <p>So if the Word of God be to be heard, beware of slipping that opportunity. Thou canst not absent thy selfe from the Word preached, no not once, but to thine owne great losse and damage. Ioh. 20.24. <hi>Thomas</hi> was absent from the Disciples, when Christ came and shewed himselfe to the rest. He was absent but once, and (perhaps) vpon some waighty cause. It may be he lurked and kept himselfe close for feare of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18777:13"/>
danger by the malice of the Iewes: or (it may be) he might be prouiding and settling his owne priuate affaires, now his Master was apprehended and slaine, and taken from him. But, what-euer the cause was, the effect was grieuous: for he was not onely depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the comfortable presence of his Lord, nor on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that grace which the rest, met together, had, and were confirmed in: but, when his fellow-Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were willing to communicate vnto him the grace of their Lords Resurrection, he not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued not their report, and made slight of such a cloud of most faithfull and eye-witnesses, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solues, not to beleeue them. To incredulity, he ioynes a wilfulnesse and obstinacy: Nay, he is so farre from beleeuing them, that if Christ himselfe should shew himselfe in person vnto him, and would not suffer him to see the prints of the nailes, and to put his finger into the prints of his wounds, hee would not beleeue.</p>
            <p>So, how-euer men make it not a rush-matter to absent themselues from the Word preached, once and againe; yet be assured thou slippest such an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of thine owne good, as (perhaps) thou shalt neuer haue offered againe. If thou absentest thy selfe of negligence, thou depriuest thy selfe of some grace and comfort, which the presence of the Lord amongst his people maketh offer of. If of worldlinesse, and to gather a little profit in that time, all thy gaine will not counteruaile thy losse. But if of wilfulnesse and contempt, (as many) thou not onely thrustest away grace and comfort offered, but pullest on thy selfe the wrath of God for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18777:13"/>
his gracious Ordinances, and the blessed meanes of thy Saluation.</p>
            <p>We see the occasion of our Sauiours Sermon.</p>
            <p>Now of the kinde of his Doctrine: <hi>He spake by a Parable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Parable in Scripture signifieth two things. 1. Some serious matter and of great moment: Psal. 49.4. <hi>I will incline mine eare to a Parable, and vtter my graue matter vpon my Harpe.</hi> Thus the graue and wise speeches of <hi>Salomon</hi> are called <hi>the Parables of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Prou. 1.1. or, prouerbiall sentences of <hi>Salomon.</hi> 2. Some darke or obscure speech, when a truth is wrapped vp either in some similitude and compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or in some hard and obscure words. Iohn 16.29. <hi>Now speakest thou in plaine words, and no Parable.</hi> Ezek. 24.3. <hi>Therefore speake a Parable to the rebellious house, and say, Prepare a pot, and powre water into it, &amp;c.</hi> in which obscure type is largely declared both the sinne and the iudgement of the citie Ierusalem. And thus it is taken here, for an obscure manner of propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the truth, vnder a continued similitude or alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie. And this is the most proper acceptation of the word <hi>Parable,</hi> taken from the Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>assimilare,</hi> and most frequently vsed in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament: as Luke 21.29. <hi>And he said a Parable, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the fig-tree and all trees,</hi> that is, he propounded to them a similitude. And a number of Parables begin in these words, <hi>The Kingdome of Heauen is like a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, leauen, a Marchant man, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 13.24, 31, 33, 44, 45, 47.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christ spake in Parables for foure reasons.</hi>
               </note> Why doth our Sauiour Christ speake in Parables, and darke comparisons? It seemes neither
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18777:14"/>
so fitted for the profit of his hearers, nor to his own office and function, who came from the bosome of his Father to reueale the mysteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This he did for the accomplishment of Prophecies of Scripture: for Christ did nothing which was not foretold, Esa. 6.9. Matth. 13.13, 14, 34. <hi>Therefore doe I speake to them in Parables: for in them is fulfilled the prophecie of Esaias, who saith, By hearing, ye shall heare, but not vnderstand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In respect of the manner of teaching: which being once vnderstood, doth delight the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, helpe the memorie, mooue and strike the will, by collating spirituall things with sensible, and winde themselues secretly into the heart to conuince modestly, but strongly, and to draw confession from euill-dooers against themselues: as <hi>Dauid</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced by <hi>Nathan</hi> in that Parable, 2. Sam. 12. And Matth. 21.40. our Sauiour askes <hi>what the Lord of the vineyard will doe to the vngracious husbandmen:</hi> they say, <hi>He will cruelly destroy them, and let out the vineyard to others:</hi> then he infers in the 43. verse, <hi>Therefore I say vnto you, The Kingdome of God shall be taken from you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">Difficilis in Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, magna ingenia exercent, <hi>Aug. in Psal.</hi> 140.</note>3. In respect of the Elect, 1. To stirre vp in them humility: for they seeing how Parables containe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties aboue their vnderstanding, are forced to conceiue lowly and submissely of themselues. 2. To worke in them diligence in the meanes of knowledge and profiting, and to goe both to God in prayer, and to others whom God hath made more skilfull then themselues, to get the vnderstanding of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18777:14"/>
it. For the kernell is in the reddition of a Parable, which lyeth hid till it bee explained. Therefore the Disciples euer came to Christ, and questioned, and asked him the meaning of the Parables; as verse 9. the Disciples asked him, demaunding what Parable that was. 3. To worke in them care of keeping that, which by so much study and labour they haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Hardly come by, highly set by.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In respect of wicked men: that the Pearle of the Kingdome should not be cast to Swine, nor the Childrens bread to dogges: for they must not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the chiefe prerogatiue of the godly, which is, to knowe the mysteries of the Kingdome. Matth. 13.10. When Christ had vttered this Parable, the Disciples asked, Master, why speakest thou in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables? and our Lord giues this answere, Because to you it is giuen to know the mysteries, <hi>to them it is not giuen.</hi> And why to them, not to others? <hi>Answ. To them,</hi> out of diuine grace and loue, especially, who were disposed by that grace to giue assent and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the truth; yea, with hungring soules and thirsty desires dranke in those holy and mysticall Doctrines. <hi>Not to others:</hi> not because God doth not truly offer the same grace, but because of their owne incredulity, and indisposition, who resist and oppose the grace offered, and wilfully put from themselues, and leaue to others the Doctrine of eternall salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Note a manifest difference betweene a godly man and the vngodly. <hi>The former</hi> will search out the truth of Gods Word, and will profit by any kinde of teaching. The Spirit of God, wheresoeuer
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18777:15"/>
hee is, is heroike. Obscurity and darkenesse in some poynts tyres him not, but only awakes drowsinesse, and whets diligence. Something he will get out of the darkest kinde of teaching. <hi>The latter</hi> bewray their negligence, will be at no paines in beating out holy mysteries, that all may see they haue no part in them: And yet are they made without all excuse, in that they may see as others doe, but shut their eyes, and will not: and by contemning this kinde of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, make themselues vnworthy of any other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Note what a price God sets on his Word: he thinkes it too good for a wicked man to vnderstand or know. For, will God giue such a pearle to him that wants desire of it, endeuor after it, a right vse of it if he had it, and a care of increase, yea or of keeping it; whose sloth and idlenesse would only extinguish the sparke, and neuer blow it vp to be comforted or directed by it? Was it fit Christ should speake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to Scribes, Pharises, Sadduces, who came only to carpe?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Note who it is that onely can open the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Scripture: the Disciples euer had recourse to Christ: he is the onely Maister and chiefe Doctor of his Church, Matth. 23.8. he is that true light that lightneth euery man, Iohn 1.9. Reu. 5.5, 6. No man was found worthy to open and reade the booke, saue only the Lyon of the tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi> Therefore come to Christ as the two blinde men, and say, O Lord, we desire our eyes may bee opened. Come to the word to bee <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>taught of the Lord,</hi> Esa. 54.13. Neuer rest in the teaching of man. Come not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prayer, that God would open thine eyes.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:18777:15"/>4. Note a brand of Gods iudgement vpon that man, who heareth plaine Doctrines as Parables. <hi>If our Gospell be now hid</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) it is hid to them that perish,</hi> 2. Cor. 4.3. If in such a light a man be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the principles and mysteries of Religion: If old men bee as yet babes in knowledge, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the things of God, their case is lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. A more fearefull sentence cannot be vttered in this life against a man, then to bee said as Christ said of some, <hi>Omnia ipsis in Parabolis fieri,</hi> All is spoken to them in Parables. He that seeth not the light of the sunne when it shineth, is a blinde man: and so is he, who sees not the shining brightnesse of Christ in such glorious meanes.</p>
            <p>See more fully the miserie of this man, who sits as a sott vnder the Word.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He reiects and despiseth the goodnesse of God in the gracious offer of meanes of Saluation:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The misery of a sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, in fiue things.</hi>
               </note> He is an vnhappie condemned man, that refuseth a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. As if the blinde man hauing receiued sight, should reuile Christ for it: or the dead being raised, should storme at him for offering to raise him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is made vnexcusable, and his mouth shut. He is prepared for iudgement, and iudgeth himselfe <hi>vnworthie of eternall life.</hi> He may see, but will not.<note place="margin">Act. 13.46</note> He may liue, but had rather chuse death.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the iust iudgement of God, the vnworthie or vnfruitfull hearer is more blinded, further hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and made more obstinate. He is filthy in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but more filthy by the Word; yet the Word no cause hereof, but his owne malice against it, and the dunghill that is in him. For Christ came to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18777:16"/>
into this world, that they which see, might be blinde. He is blind in himselfe, but the Word is a light that more blinds him, as the Sunne to bleare-eyes, in them onely is the fault. He is a dead man in himselfe, but more deadly by the Gospell: which in it selfe is a <hi>sauour of life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>6.</note> and to others, but <hi>the sauour of death</hi> vnto him: God as a iust Iudge, punishing sinne with sinne. Satan blindeth primarily and by himselfe, instilling malice. Wicked <hi>Pharaoh</hi> blindeth himselfe by yeelding to Satan, by reiecting the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit, and holy counsels, Exod. 8.15. And God blindeth,<note place="margin">Non im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertiendo malitiam, sed non impertien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> not infusing euill, but subtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his grace, and deliuering men to Satan, and themselues, 2. Thes. 2.10, 11. most iustly reiecting them that haue reiected his grace. And the Gospell blindeth, not as a cause, but as an occasion, stirring vp their malice and corruption against it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He is hereby branded <hi>not to be of God.</hi> Let him heare, and be ceremonially and formally as good as any, yea outstrip others in sembled sanctity: yet if he be a fruitlesse hearer, and the Word be as a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto him, he is <hi>not of God,</hi> Io. 8.47. So said Christ to the Pharises, who externally were holy enough: they heard not while they did heare, because they were not of God. And not being of God, they are giuen into the hands of the diuell, as Gods executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to blindfold them, and leade them at his will to destruction, 2. Cor. 4.4.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This hardning or execution by the preaching of the Word, is an infallible signe of future perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euen at the doore. When Israel was extremely hardened by the Prophets Ministery, they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18777:16"/>
into Assyria, and neuer returned. <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamin</hi> were also extremely hardened, 2. Chron. 36.13, 16. and were carried into Babylon. The Iewes were hardened by Christ and his Apostles, Act. 13. and were deliuered to the Romans. So of <hi>Elies</hi> sons, 1. Sam. 2. <hi>They heard not their father: for God would destroy them.</hi> So now in the time of the Gospell, the axe is laid to the root of the tree; the next thing is hewing downe. What else can we feare of our Land, and many our Inhabitants, to whom Gods Word is as a tale told to a dead man? no vnderstanding of it, no reformation by it.</p>
            <p>So much of the Preface. Now we come to the Parable it selfe.
<q>Behold, a sower went out to sowe his seed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To the right and true interpreting of a Parable, a speciall helpe is, to consider attentiuely, and finde out the proper scope and ayme of our Lord Iesus Christ in propounding it: and not too curiously presse other things, lest in stead of milke wee presse out blood.</p>
            <p>In this Parable, both in the whole, and parts, wee feare not to faile of the true and proper sense, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this, &amp; one more of the tares of the field, (Mat. 13.36.) at the request of the Disciples, are priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and graced with Christs owne interpretation, who best knew his owne meaning, and hath left the same as a sure direction to lead vs, that wee should not guesse at vncertainties, or lose our selues in fond coniectures, as many doe in other Parables; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of which he pleased not to leaue so assured from his owne mouth, as this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:18777:17"/>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The scope of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
               </note>The scope hereof is apparantly twofold. 1. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Sauiour saw a multitude of Hearers, but not all comming with the same intent, nor all hearing with the same fruit and profit: hee manifestly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth this Parable, to shew the diuersity of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. For the state of the Church and visible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations are mixt, resembling the Arke which was full of creatures, of diuers kinds, but most kinds vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane. So Christ and his Apostles found it, and so doe we after them. In the great concourse of people about vs, the Word hath not the same successe in all Hearers, nor the best entertainment and welcome in the most that heare it. Some come to heare newes, some to carpe, some to scoffe, some to runne to the Rulers, some to censure, some to correct, and sit as Iudges of the Word, which shall iudge them: onely a very few to heare aright, to faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. How plainly is all this set before vs in these foure sorts of Hearers, of whom onely one sort was good and approued in their hearing? 2. That eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man might enquire and make triall of himselfe, in which forme or ranke of Hearers himselfe is; and so frame himselfe for time to come, that hee may bee found in the number of them, in whom the Word of God, as good seed cast into good ground, may bring forth plentifull and abundant fruits of grace in his life and conuersation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold.</hi>] This here is a note, 1. Of certainty: and so is vsually set before promises and threats. 2. Of intention, or excitation, being set as a starre before matters of waight, that is, Let him that heares, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, remember, apply. 3. Of castigation, or checke
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18777:17"/>
to our dulnesse in beholding such materiall things. Elsewhere it is a note of admiration and great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note.</hi> Orators vse large prefaces to get attention, and winne the minds of their Hearers to that they would perswade. Christ ordinarily vseth but one lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle note of attention, <hi>Behold.</hi> For, 1. The least word from him is enough to binde the conscience, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the heart. 2. The lesse externall Rhetorike and pompe of words is vsed, the more it beseemes and is answerable to the simplicity of the Gospell. 3. All that perswasion of words is supplied by the gift of the Spirit inwardly, who <hi>openeth the care of the heart</hi> (as of <hi>Lydia</hi>) to beleeue the Gospell.<note place="margin">Act. 16.14</note>
            </p>
            <p>But what must we behold?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Sower went out.</hi>] Our Sauiour borroweth his comparison from easie and familiar things, such as the Sower, the seed, the ground, the growth, the withering, the answering or failing of the Sowers expectation, all of them things well knowne: And by all these would teach vs some spirituall instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For there is no earthly thing, which is not fitted to put vs in minde of some heauenly. Christ cannot looke vpon the Sunne, the Wind, Fire, Water, Hen, a little graine of Mustard-seed, nor vpon ordinary occasions, as the Penny giuen for the dayes worke, the Wedding garment, and ceremonies of the Iewes about it, nor the waiting of Seruants at their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters table, or children asking bread and fish at their fathers table, &amp;c. but he applies all to some speciall vse of edification in grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Wee must not content our selues with the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18777:18"/>
naturall vse of the creatures,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Translate the booke of nature into the booke of grace.</hi>
               </note> without the spirituall: for then the beasts enioy as much of them as we. But by them all, behold the Creators wisedome, power, goodnesse, and mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let vs take occasion to further our saluation by them, and not hinder it, nor hasten our perdition as many doe, by drunkennesse, riot, or couetous hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them in our hearts and hands.</p>
            <p n="3">3. No man can excuse his ignorance of God, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no man wanteth teachers. The rudest husband-man hath his seed, his earth, his seasons, as bookes to teach him. Euen these bookes of the creatures, leaue not God without witnesse: euen these bookes leaue men without excuse.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.28</note> Euery creature should leade vs, and further vs in the honouring of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gentiles that honoured not God according to that naturall knowledge, gotten by the booke of the creatures, were giuen vp to vile sinnes, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous punishments. How excuselesse then must igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Christians be, to whom Gods wisedome, power, and goodnesse, shineth seuen-fold brighter in the worke of Redemption, than of Creation? to whom God is more cleerly reuealed in the Booke of the Scriptures, than of the creatures? seeing the more excellent meanes of knowledge we haue of him, the greater is our sinne and punishment, to be carelesly ignorant of him.</p>
            <p>Now in the Parable are two things considerable in generall: 1. The <hi>sowing.</hi> 2. The <hi>successe,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the seuerall grounds on which the seed fell. These grounds, according to their condition, were either fruitlesse, or fruitfull. The bad and fruitlesse
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18777:18"/>
grounds were of three kinds: 1. <hi>Callosa,</hi> padled and high-way ground: 2. <hi>Lapidosa,</hi> stony and rocky ground: 3. <hi>Spinosa,</hi> thorny and choaky ground. The good ground was the fertile and fruitfull ground.</p>
            <p>The sowing is in the first words: <hi>A Sower went out to sowe his seed.</hi>]</p>
            <p>And here be three things to be considered: 1. The Agent, <hi>A Sower.</hi> 2. His Action, <hi>he went forth.</hi> 3. His Intention, or end, <hi>to sowe his seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The Sower is Christ himselfe, vers. 37.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Agent or Sower.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>He that sowes the good seed, is the Sonne of man.</hi> He is that good Husband-man, without whose labour the field of the whole world had layne in perpetuall barrennes. The labour of this second <hi>Adam</hi> was notably typified in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> dressing the garden, resembling the Church of God, dressed and brought to fruitfulnes by the infinite labour of Iesus Christ. This husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of Christ was alse resembled in <hi>Noah,</hi> the builder of the Arke, who was an Husband-man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Are not Ministers Sowers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ is the principall Sower, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sower: Ministers are rather the sowers basket, than the Sower: but yet they are taken in, as co-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers with Christ, and for their honour and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement called Sowers: as 1. Cor. 9.11.<note place="margin">

               <hi>If wee haue sowne vnto you spirituall things, &amp;c.</hi> But with these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences. 1. Christ sowes his owne field, which he hath dearely purchased with his precious blood: they sowe not their owne fields, but his, not being <hi>Lords of the heritage of God,</hi> 1. Pet. 5.3. 2. Hee sowes his owne seed: so in the Text, the Sower sowed <hi>his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:18777:19"/>
seed:</hi> they haue no seede of their owne, but fetched out of his Garner. Pastors and Teachers of the Church sowe not their owne seed, but his. Nay, the Apostles themselues haue it in their Apostolike Commission, to teach men to obserue no other things but whatsoeuer Christ himselfe commanded them, Mat. 28.20. Hence Christ vsed to say, <hi>Verily, verily, I say vnto you:</hi> but all other, whether Prophets, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> or Apostles, or Pastors, <hi>Thus saith the Lord.</hi> 3. They differ in the manner of sowing. Hee was the most skilfull Sower that euer was: he knew exactly what graine euery ground was fitted for: with him were treasures of wisedome. Wee that haue but drops from his fulnesse, are vnskilfull in comparison. Hee could speake to mens priuate and personall sinnes, as the woman at the Wel. He could answere to mens <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> thoughts and reasonings: We not so. 4. Wee dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in efficacy.

Person, Ministery.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In Spirit, by inward inspirations, and heauenly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> motions: And thus he sowed in the heart of <hi>Adam, Noah, Abraham,</hi> and the Prophets, who were, with other holy men, immediately inspired and acted by the holy Ghost, 1. Pet. 1.21. So with the Pen-men of Scriptures, and the Apostles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Person: according to his Humanity hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> commeth out from the bosome of his Father, and comes into the field of the World by his happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation; by which he was neerer vnto vs than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and in our owne flesh reuealed vnto vs the counsell of his Father; vnweariably preaching in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, Nazareth, Iudea, Galile, in Cities, fields, sea, and euery where.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the Ministery of his seruants he goeth forth: both the Prophets and Teachers before him, 1. Pet.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3.19.—<hi>by which Spirit hee preached in Noahs time</hi>; namely, in <hi>Noah</hi> himselfe, to <hi>the spirits now in prison.</hi> He saith to Prophets, as vnto <hi>Ieremy,</hi> chap. 1.10. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, this day haue I set thee ouer the Nations, to plucke vp, and root out; to destroy, and throw downe; to build, and to plant.</hi> And Ezek. 3.17. <hi>Sonne of man, I haue made thee a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore heare the Word at my mouth, and warne them from me.</hi> And since his owne Ascension, hee went forth in the Ministery of his Apostles, and still goeth forth in the Ministery of Pastors and Teachers <hi>to the end of the world.</hi> Math. 28. <hi>vlt.

Yet so, as looke what successe his own sowing found, the same might his seruants expect euen to the end: For the seruant is not greater then his Master: and, if the Word in the mouth of his Ministers proue fruitlesse, it is no maruell, seeing the same befell our Lord himselfe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3 <hi>His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</hi>
               </note>III. The Intention is, <hi>to sow his seed.] To sow:</hi> that is, to preach: for preaching resembleth sowing, as wee shall see through the Parable. <hi>His seede:</hi> the seed is the Word of God, contained in the writings of the Prophets &amp; Apostles, vers. 11. which by Christ and his Ministers is cast into the furrowes of the heart, as seed into the furrowes of the earth by the Husbandman.</p>
            <p>It is true, that he cast some seed among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: For the law of nature written in their hearts, (the summe of which is, that what wee would not another should do to vs, we should not do to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:) euen this was the seed of this Sower; for <hi>he enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,</hi> euen with naturall light, <hi>whosoeuer commeth into the world,</hi> Ioh. 1.9. But here is meant that seed, which he casts into the field of the Church; which is partly the Law Morall, written with the finger of God, and deliuered to the Church by <hi>Moses,</hi> who was faithfull in all his house, as a seruant: but especially the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospell, sowed in the hearts of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, both by himselfe and his seruants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His seed.</hi> This Seedsman sowed no fables, no tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, no vnwritten verities, no Canons of Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cels, or Decretals of Popes: which are but chaffe: nay
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18777:20"/>
he often condemned the decrees of the Elders, and traditions of Pharises, and all seede fetched out of mens Granaries: Ioh. 7.16. <hi>My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me:</hi> and chap. 8.26. <hi>The things that I haue heard of him, those speake I to the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Gods word preached, is the sowing of Gods seed into the earth of mens hearts: For sixe reasons, or resemblances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As seed is a small and contemptible thing,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Word preached, resembled to seed, in sixe things.</hi>
               </note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnlikely to bring such a returne and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease: so the Word preached seemes a weake and contemptible thing, 1. Cor. 1.23. We preach Christ crucified, a scandall to the Iewes, and foolishnesse to the Gentiles: Yet by the foolishnesse of preaching, God hath ordained to saue his, and not without it, as, without seed, without haruest.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the seede in the barne or garner fructifies not, vnlesse it be cast into the earth: so the Word, vnlesse cast into the eares and hearts of men, is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, regenerateth not, produceth no fruits of faith. Keepe the Word in thy Bible, or thy Bible in thy chest, and not in thy heart, couering and hiding it, thou abidest fruitlesse and barren. Rom. 10.14. <hi>How can they beleeue, vnlesse they heare, or how can they heare, without a Preacher?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. As the sower prickes not in his seede, nor sets it, but casts it all abroad, and knowes not which of his seede will come vp to encrease, and which will rot and dye vnder the clods, or comming vp into the blade and eare, will wither away: so the Minister (Gods Seedsman) speakes not to one or two, but casts the seede abroad to all in generall; neither
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18777:21"/>
knowes he which and where the Word shall thriue to encrease, and where not; but, where it doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, it riseth with great beautie and glory, as the graine of Mustard-seed becomes a tree in which the birds of heauen may build their nests.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As seed hath a naturall heat, life, and vertue in it, by which it increaseth and begetteth more seeds like vnto it selfe: so the Word cast into the good ground of a beleeuing heart, hath a supernaturall heat in it, being as fire, Iere. 5.14. and a liuely power to frame men like it selfe, to make them of fleshly, spirituall; of blinde, quicksighted; of dead in sinne, aliue in grace. And as one graine quickned brings sundry tillowes, and many graines in each: so one Christian conuerted, and receiuing this power in himselfe,<note place="margin">Act. 26.29.</note> gaineth many vnto God, desiring that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one were as he is, except his bands and sins. <hi>Philip</hi> being called findes <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> and brings him to Christ. And the woman at the well calls all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Ioh. 4.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As seed cast into the ground liues not, vnlesse it dye first, 1. Cor. 15.36: so the Word preached brings no fruite or life, vnlesse it kill first and worke mortification; yea and by continuall sense of frailty, and acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with the crosse, it keeps vnder such naturall pride and corruption as resist the worke of it. Ioh. 4. Christ brings the woman at the well to know him, by bringing her to the knowledge of her selfe. And the Conuerts, Act. 2.37. then bewrayed heauenly life, when being pricked at heart they cried out, <hi>Men and brethren, what may wee doe to bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:18777:21"/>6. As seed cast neuer so skilfully into the earth is not fruitful, vnlesse God giue it a body, 1. Cor. 15.38. so neither is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Word, vnlesse God adde his blessing. 1. Cor. 3.6. <hi>I haue planted, and Apollos watered, but God giues the increase:</hi> verse 7. <hi>Neither is he that planteth, any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giueth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.</hi> What would plowing, sowing, harrowing, or any husbandry on the earth auaile, if God should not by the raines, windes, and warmth from heauen prosper and cherish the seed?</p>
            <p>Thus haue wee compared the Word of God to seed, and preaching to sowing. But still remember,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Seede of Gods Word more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then all other seede, in foure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</hi>
               </note> that this seed of the Word is farre more excellent then all other seed, in foure respects: 1. That is from earth, this from heauen: My doctrine (saith Christ) is from aboue. 2. That serues to preserue naturall life receiued of God, this both to begin and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine spirituall life. 3. That is mortall and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible seede, this <hi>immortall,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.23. <hi>an eternall Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:</hi> Heauen and earth shall perish,<note place="margin">Reu. 14.6.</note> but the Word of God abides for euer. 4. The fruit is like the seede: All corruptible seede brings fruit corruptible like it selfe, but this brings Immortality and life, it is a seed sowne for continuance and eternitie, so is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This concernes Ministers, in whose function there is both <hi>honos</hi> and <hi>onus,</hi> Dignitie and Dutie. For the first: The Ministerie, though despised in the world, is a most glorious office,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The dignity of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</hi>
               </note> and an honourable function, which Christ came from the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to vndertake. The Sonne of God himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke to be a sower of the Word: and shall great

Or shall any man thinke his sonne too good, and of too high birth for that office, which the Sonne of God himselfe despised not?</p>
            <p>For the second; the burthen or charge. We reade not that Christ said Masses, or anoyled, or sprinkled holy water, but was all in sowing. Popish Priests are quite contrary, all in these, and seldome or neuer doe preach:<note place="margin">

               </note> As if our saluation consisted in ceremonies, or an haruest could be brought in by gestures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sowing. But our charge stands in foure things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Learne wee of our Lord Iesus Christ to <hi>goe foorth</hi> to sow:<note place="margin">1. <hi>They must goe foorth to sow.</hi>
               </note> Christ went foorth to labour; and hee that goes into the Lords field to loyter or stand idle, gets no thanke from his Lord. What need is there of a loyterer in seed-time, or in haruest? And Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters must consider: 1. That they are compared to such persons, as in whom is required the greatest care and paines: sometime to shepheards; What a painfull and carefull life led <hi>Iacob</hi> while he was <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> shepheard? what sorrowes by day and night did he sustaine and swallow? Sometime to watchmen; who must stand on the walles of the Citie of God night and day: Sometime to day-labourers, and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: All of them workes of extreme paines and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie. So as they mistake the matter, who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this function to set vp themselues in ease and idlenesse. 2. Let them set before their eyes this chief Sower, who did weare out himselfe in labours and sufferings, <hi>making himselfe of no reputation,</hi> Phil. 2.7.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18777:22"/>
and as a good candle, consumed himselfe to enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten others: Yea he swet at it that admirable sweat of water and bloud, and sorrowed to the death, and all to sow the seede of grace and saluation in the hearts of men. 3. Remember that counsell of the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Eccles. 11.6. <hi>In the morning sow thy seede, and in the euening let not thine hand rest: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, this or that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Ministers must sow <hi>his seede:</hi> not their owne,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but Christs.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Not any but their Lords seed.</hi>
               </note> Christ himselfe sowed onely pure and precious seede: so must his Seedsmen cleanse and picke their seed at home, that it be not blended with chaffe and darnell of mans braine; much lesse with corrupt doctrine, and deuices fetched euery where but out of Gods owne garners. Remember that law which holdeth here in force, Deut. 22.9. <hi>Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with diuers kindes of seedes:</hi> much lesse may the Minister of Christ sow his Lords field with mixt seed, false doctrine with true, or mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions with Gods pure Word and worship. As a man sowes, so he reapes. If any man sow huskes for seed, his haruest shall be huskes. If any sow words and phrases, without matter and substance, he sowes the winde, and shall reape nothing but wind and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. Accursed is that sower that sowes any other seed, suppose he be an Angell, Gal. 1.8.</p>

Lord, Ioel. 2.13. and <hi>plow vp the fallow ground of your hearts, and sow not among thornes,</hi> Iere. 4.3. Euery man knowes, that plowing must goe before sowing: So before the seede of grace can be sowne in the heart, the Law must be vrged, to breake the clods, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roote the weeds.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hearers must receiue this seed, and retaine it:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as the good earth receiueth into her furrowes the seed, and couereth it, and giueth it rooting.<note place="margin">

               </note> But with this difference: that the earth receiueth seede but once a yeere, but the heart must receiue the Word continually. 1. Ioh. 3.9. It is a note of one borne of God, that the <hi>seed of God abideth in him.</hi> And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to euery Christian is, that the Word of God <hi>dwell plentifully</hi> in him, that is,<note place="margin">Col. 3.16.</note> abide and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to increase; else slender will the expectation be in haruest. What returne expect they in the haruest, who affect the Ale-house better then the House of God? whose chiefe care and loue being set vpon the profits of the world, vtterly neglect the <hi>better part,</hi> and the <hi>one thing necessary.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 10.42</note> God offers to cast this seed into their hearts, but they will reape the world, euen for the present, and care not to receiue such seed as brings not in a present haruest. And, as these receiue not the seed of the Word, so others seeme to receiue it, but retaine it not, affoord it no rooting, but negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently lose it. This doe idle and negligent Hearers, who sleepe in Summer, slacke the seed-time, and slip their season; not greatly caring which end goeth forward, so they may not be counted Atheists.

Hee that <hi>sparingly sowes his seed, must expect a sparing haruest:</hi> so,<note place="margin">2.

He that refuseth to be sowed vpon, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to be found fruitfull in the haruest: and seeing the heart yeelds no good fruits of it selfe, needs must that heart bee an accursed ground, that refuseth the seed of grace, faith, and goodnesse to bee cast into it. An euill man, out of the euill treasure of his heart, bringeth forth euill things. 5. He that hinders the Word, or resists it either in himselfe, or others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18777:25"/>
the Lords Husbandry in his owne saluation, and in the saluation of his people: as those that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sowing, must needs hinder reaping and haruest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as he sowed, some fell by the way-side, and it was troden vnder foot, and the fowles of heauen deuoured it vp.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here begins the euent following the former acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Where first note, that hee saith not, The Sower sowed by the way-side: (for no Sower would doe so, because he knowes it were but lost, labour and seed,) but, in sowing, some seed fell by the way-side, beside the intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sower, who desires to lose none of his seed. Secondly, the same seed, in it selfe as good as any, fals by the way side; in it selfe as fit for fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse as any, but altogether fruitlesse by the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the soyle it fals into. As the heart is, into which the Word comes, so is the fruit. Suppose Christ the Seeds-man, and his owne Word from his gracious lips the seed, yet in many Hearers it shall not profit; and yet neither the Sower, nor seed is to be blamed, but the indisposition, or bad disposition of the heart.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore enquire, 1. What is the nature of this ground: 2. The reason of vnfruitfulnesse: twofold: one inward, the seed was <hi>troden vnder foot</hi>; the other outward, <hi>the fowles came and deuoured it vp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the kinde of soyle, it is the <hi>high-way side.</hi> Our Sauiour plainly interprets it, vers. 12. <hi>They that are besides the way, are they that heare, but the diuell comes and takes it away out of their hearts:</hi> and Math. 13.19. <hi>When a man heareth the Word, and vnderstandeth it not.</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:18777:25"/>
This first sort of Hearers is compared to an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, for these reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As an high-way lieth carelesse, neglected,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Some harts and hearers compared to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, for</hi> 3. <hi>reasons.</hi>
               </note> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, common, not seuerall; but is trodden and beaten with the feet of all sorts of passengers: so these Hearers hearts are not inclosed and made seuerall for the seed of Gods Word, &amp; for heauenly things, but lie common and open to all tentations and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions of Satan, to the couetous and carnall desires of earthly things, which eate vp heauenly; to vaine, wandring, idle cogitations, and thoughts; all which make a thorow-fare and beaten path in the heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As in an high-way if any seed fall, no man lookes to couer it, no man respects it, as looking for no good at all of it, but leaue it to be trodden of beasts, and eaten vp of birds: so with these Hearers: when the Word is preached they heare it carelesly, without all attention or affection, they care not to vnderstand it, neuer couer it by meditation, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it further than by giuing it the hearing; they expect no good from it; let errours and lusts come and tread it downe; let the diuell by suggestions and tentations deuoure it vp; they care neither to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, nor receiue, nor remember it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As high-way ground can neither receiue nor couer the seed; or if it should, it is so hard and pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it cannot affoord it the least rooting, at least to come vnto fruit; the crop will neuer fill a mans hand: Euen so these Hearers, like hard and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued earth, continually trodden and trampled with wandring thoughts, and fruitlesse cogitations, and tentations of the diuell, heare the Word sometimes,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18777:26"/>
but without heart, minde, affection: A little seed may lie on the superficies or top of their braine, or tongue, or may make a little shew on the outside, but nothing of it gets within them, nor takes any root, and consequently yeelds no fruit of faith, of Gods feare, of piety or Christian conuersation.</p>
            <p>Now for the causes of this vnfruitfulnesse: The former is in their owne disposition, <hi>they tread the seed vnder foote,</hi> that is, despise and vnderualue it. It is the carelesse hearer, who vnderstands not, nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Carelesse Hearers, the worst Hearers.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Doct. The carelesse hearer is the worst hearer of all:</hi> as this first ground is the worst ground of all. The other two are bad both, yet they giue the seed some couer, and receiue it in; but these hold it out, and leaue it where they found it. Both the other giue some regard, and bestow some affection vpon the Word: but this treads it vnder, as a most despised and dis-affected thing. Both the other, while in some sort they affect the Word, are drawne aside by some profit, pleasure, feare, or persecution; but these by the immediate worke and malice of the diuell, (at whose will they are giuen vp to be ruled) are so robbed of the Word and meanes of grace, as they will neither make nor meddle with it further than the hearing. Lastly, the other bad grounds are farre from salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the end; but the diuell suffers not these so much as set foot in the way; and therefore their case is most hopelesse.</p>
            <p>This carelesse Hearer is he that not only doth not vnderstand, but he that doth not attend, or apply his minde to vnderstand: for so <hi>Beza</hi> translateth the word <gap reason="foreign">

What haruest can they expect, who will suffer no seed to be sowne in their fields?

               </note>Lastly, what may wee say to Persecutors of the Word, and the Preachers of it, such as would (if they could) with a sword slay those that seeke to saue them? Like the Hearers at Nazareth, who would kill Christ himselfe, Luk. 4.28. <hi>Eliah</hi> shall bee counted a troubler of the State. <hi>Daniel</hi> shall be watched and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused in the matter of his God. <hi>Amos</hi> shall bee accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the King, as one whose words the whole Land is not able to beare. 1.

For who be they that stand against the Gospell, and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of it, but Swearers, Libertines, Gamesters, Drunkards, Ruffians, Couetous, Adulterous, and in their whole courses enemies to Righteousnesse, that they must needs bee good men, and deare to God, that are encountred with such aduersaries? 2. That Word which thou persecutest, and wouldest driue out of thy conscience, or wilt not heare, the same shall pursue thee, and follow thee as an Hue and Cry, and thou shalt heare it, and condemne thy selfe, because thou couldest not endure, it should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thy sinnes. 3. The time comes, wherein (if thou timely repent not) thou shalt see and say thou tookest the wrong end of the staffe, and didst kicke against hard prickes: and thy conscience shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince thee, that what thou didst against Christs ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and Gospell, (whatsoeuer thy pretence now be) thou didst it against Christ himselfe, who will pay thee home with thy owne coyne. <hi>Iulian</hi> that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Apostate, finding himselfe at last too weake, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>Vicisti, Galilaee, vicisti.</hi> Christ was far enough out of his reach, he persecuted his seruants and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,

            <p>Here is the second, the outward cause of fruitles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in this high-way ground, arising out of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the diuell: so vers. 12. <hi>Then comes the diuell, and takes the Word out of their hearts, lest they should beleeue, and be saued.</hi> Where are three things to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: 1. The description of this malicious person, both by his name, and by a similitude. 2. The exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of his malice: <hi>he commeth.</hi> 3. The end of his comming: threefold, 1. to steale the Word, 2. to hinder faith, 3. to bereaue men of saluation.</p>
            <p>In the person so malicious, we haue 1. his names: 2. the similitude.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> His <hi>names</hi> are three in the three Euangelists. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> calls him <hi>the euill one,</hi> chap. 13.19. <hi>Marke</hi> calls him <hi>Satan, or the enemy,</hi> chap. 4.15. and our Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list calls him <hi>a diuell,</hi> that is, an accuser of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Lay these together, and then obserue, 1. That being <hi>an euill one,</hi> he is full of euill in himselfe, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of much euill in others, and one that delights himselfe in the euill, both of sinne and punishment, in others. 2. In that hee is <hi>an enemy</hi> to vs, hee must

needs intercept all the meanes of our good, and tempt vs to fruitlesse hearing, by which he hinders vs of the greatest good that God offereth vnto vs. 3. In that he is a <hi>diuell,</hi> that when he hath preuailed against vs, and made vs carelesse hearers, he will then accuse vs for such hearing: A iust recompence of him, who while he pretendeth a seruice to God, yet performeth it to the diuell.</p>
            <p>The <hi>similitude,</hi> whereby hee is described, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> vs yet further with our danger:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reasons why wicked spirits are compared to fowles of heauen,</hi> 4. 2. Cor. 12.2</note> being called <hi>the fowles of heauen,</hi> that is, of the aire, the lowest of the <hi>three heauens.</hi> In these respects: 1. They are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and seeke to ouerthrow vs by multitude: there be not so many birds flying in the aire, as wicked spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: the Prince that beareth rule in the aire, Ephes.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 2.2. hath his troupes and <hi>legions</hi> to command into one man, if God permit him: as in that example, Mark. 5.9.

Their subtill, slie, and inuisible natures can easily ouer-match our grosse, heauy, and earthly mold; who can no way make party good against them, but by incessant

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> watch against them. 4. They be as the birds gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and deuouring: that look as hungry birds some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by whole flights follow the Seedsman, and, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept great care be taken, will picke vp and deuoure his seed well-neere so fast as he can sow it; euen so a whole flight of diuels follow Gods Seedsman, and frequent the Ministery, that where the Word is sowne, it shall presently be pickt vp, if present care be not had to couer it: Not a seed shall lye vncoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but one of these hellish birds or other presently deuoures it.</p>
            <p>We haue descried the malicious person: Now for the exercise of his malice, it is said, <hi>he commeth:</hi> which is obserued by all the Euangelists, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by vs.</p>
            <p>In this comming of Satan, consider 1. Whither, 2. When, 3. How he comes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whither comes hee? <hi>Answ.</hi> Hee comes to Church: he is no Recusant himselfe, though he make a number. He comes to Church diligently. He feares not the holinesse of the place. He feares not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of it to the worship of God. He feares no ringing of Bels, no Holy-water, no kinde of Crosses in the place, or in the face: Nay, he feares not the consecrated Hoast, nor Crucifix, no nor if Christs owne blessed presence were there. He presumes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>holy City.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 4.5.</note> He glides into Paradise. Nay, while our Sauiour is now preaching this Parable to this multitude, hee comes with his whole traine and flight of diuels. Let vs therefore expect and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to meete with foulest spirits in the holiest pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Fowles flocke not so fast after the Sower, as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18777:32"/>
to the place of the Ministery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When comes he? Answ.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Why Satan comes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men heare the Word,</hi> 3. <hi>reasons.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Whensoeuer any man heareth the Word of the Kingdom,</hi> Mat. 13.19. 1. <hi>When any man.</hi> Hee feares no person, nor spares him. Hee comes to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> in innocencie, when they had heard the Word of the Lord. Hee comes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> stands among the children of God, that is, the holy Angels. None so good, but Satan may hope to win him to heare vnprofitably. None so bad, but Satan thinks him good enough to waite on: for if he come to the Word, hee feares hee may lose him: for hee knowes, that as bad haue been wonne by it. 2. Hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> comes then when the <hi>word of the Kingdome</hi> is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is, such Doctrines as tend to bring men to the Kingdome of God: Oh this toucheth his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and makes him bestirre himselfe where Gods Word is soundly and sincerely preached. Let a man deliuer corrupt, erronious, or friuolous doctrine, the diuell makes no such haste, vnlesse to make way for it: But, come to a conscionable and fruitfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, be sure to finde him there, or he will be sure to finde thee. 3. Satan highes him to these places at this time, because he knowes, now being at so good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> an exercise, men least feare him, and thinke him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest off: but indeed now he is neerest: for he knows, that then is the time for an enemie to work his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test stratageme, when hee findes his aduersary most secure, and least expecting it. Therefore our text saith, <hi>Whensoeuer a man,</hi> that is, <hi>any man heareth,</hi> then comes Satan: he is busie with euery one, but so, as thou maist not conceiue him so busie with others, as that he will passe ouer thee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:18777:33"/>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> Take notice hereby of his diligence and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy, who is not onely busie and stirring in euill and wicked actions, to thrust them forward, but euen in the best actions; which if he cannot hinder, he will corrupt and depraue, if it may be. Most will confesse, being detected of some euill action, Oh it was the diuell who was busie with me, he ow'd me a spight: but few discerne how busie and spightfull hee is in good actions, to hinder God of so much glory, and the godly of much comfort in such actions as he cannot hinder.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How commeth Satan to take away the Word? <hi>Answ.</hi> The Word shewes, that Satan is not alwaies present, nor alwaies tempting. Not because he wants will, but because God suffers him not alwaies. But hovvsoeuer, he vvill sure be vvith vs in the hearing of the Word, aboue all other times. And so he comes, sometimes inwardly, sometimes outwardly.</p>
            <p>

                  <hi>Satan com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi> 3. <hi>wayes.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Inwardly:</hi> 1. In many rouing by-thoughts, which filling the phantasie, turne the minde quite from the businesse in hand. Hee casts into the minde some thoughts of profit, some of pleasure, or some vaine and idle cogitations, that runne vp and downe the minde, and all to draw the heart away from the Word. Now is the diuell come, and hath catcht the Word from thee: A iust recompence of him that in Gods seruice will not giue God his heart and mind, the diuell must haue them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In drowsinesse, sleepe, and heauinesse, which steale away the minde from attention: A fearefull snare of the diuell, in which hee hath taken many, who scarce sit downe to heare, but presently are cast
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18777:33"/>
on a dead sleepe, and we may as well speake to dead men, or the pillars they sit by, as to them; and say as the Apostle doth in another abuse in the Church of Corinth, <hi>Haue ye not houses to eate and drinke in?</hi> so,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.22.</note> 
               <hi>Haue ye not beds at home to sleepe in?</hi> See you not how the diuell hath cast you into a nap, lest you should heare, and beleeue, and be saued? or that you haue taken some graines too many of that hellish <hi>opium,</hi> which makes you sleepe vnto death?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But doe you thinke the diuell casts me asleepe? I am heauy by nature, and cannot helpe it, and I sleepe not long. <hi>Answ.</hi> If thou wert at some other exercise, as a Play, or a game at Cards or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or perhaps in thy Counting house, thou couldst wake well enough, or not be halfe so heauy: or if thou wert in the Kings presence, to receiue a charge from his mouth: though thou wert very heauy naturally. Assure thy selfe therfore, that Satan adds his weight, and workes with thy corruption: And it is not the sleepe of thy body he intends, but the sleepe of thy minde, and of thy soule vnto death.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He comes in many inward suggestions, which stirre vp naturall corruption against the Word: that if it must be heard, it may not be beleeued: as, 1. It is but a man that speakes; a simple, ordinary, weake, and poore man: and, if he speake well, I can speake well too, saith one. 2. Thou knowest as much as thou needest: and, what can hee teach me which I know not? Am not I as able to iudge what is fit, as he? Nay, I doubt not but I am as good as all the Sermons in the world can make me. Now the diuell is come apparantly: for Gods Spirit euer lets
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18777:34"/>
a man see his ignorance, his nothing. 3. What good is gotten by all this preaching? My father liued ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly without it: And what care many of our Noble men, and men of great account for it? And if I goe to Seruice, and obey the Kings law, and doe as my neighbours do, and as my forefathers did, what need more precisenesse? Here now the diuell is come: For no suggestion of Gods Spirit can extenuate the Word of God. 4. But this man (saith <hi>Ahab</hi>) neuer speakes good to me, I would heare any man but this <hi>Micah,</hi> 1. King. 22.8. But here the diuell is come; he that set foure hundred false prophets to deceiue <hi>Ahab,</hi> would haue him heare any, beleeue any but <hi>Micah,</hi> lest he should be saued. If thy heart were vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,<note place="margin">Mic. 2.7.</note> the words of God would be good vnto thee. But thou hast a path-way of lusts, and thou wilt walke to the end of them, thou must sweare and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, must drinke and swagger, must prophane the Sabbath, must be an Vsurer, must vse deceit in trading, lyes in selling, must scorne zeale and grace, and runne in the excesses of sinne after the fashion of the world, and the diuell within tels thee, Why maist thou not? who shall hinder thee? 5. But I know many good Preachers, and good men of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther minde, of another practice, and though this man be earnest against it, they would not doe thus, if it were so bad. Heere the diuell is come, who out of the opposition of corrupt Teachers, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine doctrines, which he by them broached, would falsifie the truth in thy minde: dealing as a cunning Fisher, who by one fish will catch another, that hee may feed vpon both. And hee would bring thee
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18777:34"/>
from a straite rule, to a crooked example.</p>
            <p>Thus the diuell comes <hi>inwardly. Outwardly</hi> hee comes three wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By drawing the senses to outward obiects;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Satan com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi> 3. <hi>wayes.</hi> Luk 4.20.</note> as the eye on this or that person, or obiect, to diuert the minde from the one thing necessary: which we must watch against, and (as Christs Hearers) <hi>fixe our eyes</hi> vpon our Teacher; which greatly helpeth atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the euill counsell of carnall Politicians: You are a man whose conuersation will be obserued, you are rich, you haue an Office, you haue respect; If you should be led away by Sermons, you will be noted for a Puritane, and a fauourer of such as will make little for your credit. But heere the diuell is come in one of his children: Act. 13.7. <hi>Sergius Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> called <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to him, and desired to heare the Word of God: but <hi>Elymas</hi> sought to turne the Deputy from the faith. <hi>Paul</hi> spyed the diuell now come, and said, O full of all subtilty and mischiefe, <hi>the child of the diuell,</hi> and enemy of all righteousnes, that ceasest not to peruert the straite waies of God!</p>
            <p n="3">3. By scoffes and reproches of wretched men, who scorne the Word and wayes of God: What, will you beleeue all that he saith? Nay, wee must not let him make fooles of vs: What hath hee to doe with such and such poynts, our gouernment, our callings? Let him meddle with his Text, and not with vs. Iust like the Epicures and Stoikes, Act. 17.18. who said of <hi>Paul, What will this babbler say?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> He will teach vs some strange things to day. And by such scoffes Satan comes to many, and hinders their faith &amp; saluation.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18777:35"/>
For as those Heathen Stoicks and Epicures counted that the strangest Doctrine, which taught Iesus Christ: so doe Christian Epicures that which most directly leads vnto Christ.</p>
            <p>The third generall thing proposed, is, the end of Satans comming: which (as we heard) is three-fold: 1. To steale the Word out of the heart: 2. To hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Hearers faith: 3. To rob him of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>End of Satans co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, to steale away the Word.</hi>
               </note>For the first. As birds follow the Sower, to picke vp the seeds and graines that lie vncouered: so the diuell haunts the Assemblies of Saints, to steale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Word preached, where it is carelesly heard. The Action of Satan is, to <hi>steale</hi> and <hi>carry away</hi> the Word, which is not his, but belongs to others. But not as other theeues, to conuert it to his owne vse, but onely that the right owners should not enioy it: not to profit himselfe, but to disprofit others. As for the <hi>manner</hi> of his Action, he <hi>stealeth,</hi> that is, closely and secretly takes it away. He is a slye and priuie theefe. As a theefe onely feares to be seene and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered: so Satan is loth to be seene, and therefore takes vs at aduantage, when we can least espy him. <hi>He that stealeth, stealeth in the night,</hi> as they that are drunke, are drunke in the night, 1. Thes. 5.7. He takes vs in the night of our ignorance, and in the sleepe of security, and spoyles vs most, when wee can least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne it. But whence doth hee steale the Word? <hi>Answ. Out of the heart.</hi> Because of his sly and subtill nature: who being a spirit, can easily and nimbly enter into the most secret closet of our brest. And although he cannot directly know our hearts and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18777:35"/>
thoughts, which is Gods priuiledge, yet by outward meanes he can giue a great guesse at the temper of them, and as birds can easily finde when seede is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, and as easily picke it vp: so Satan can easily see, where mens care is not to couer and hide the Word in their hearts, when they haue heard it. And, if he cannot by himselfe, and by violence take the Word away, if the owners will hold it: yet he can, and doth take it away by themselues, and with their owne consent and good liking: who neither were willing to giue it roome, or sinke it deepe into their hearts, nor to couer it with gracious affections; nor had any great loue to it to looke after it, as thinking themselues not a graine the worse, when all this seed is gone.</p>
            <p>And why <hi>out of the heart? Answ.</hi> 1. Because hee knowes, that the heart is the right furrow, in which the Word can become fruitfull; therefore hee vseth all his skill to keepe it thence, or fetch it thence. Hee cares not how much of the seede lie in the head, or on the tongue, so he can keepe it out of the heart. For as we say, <hi>The minde is the man,</hi> so the heart leades the whole man, and is the lodge either of God, or the diuell. 2. Because nothing but the Word puts him out of possession of the heart. The strong man holds the hold, till a stronger come. If the Word as good seede once roote in the heart, he must away. Where Christ by his Word takes the heart, the Prince of this world is cast out. The Disciples by their power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preaching saw Satan fall downe like lightening from heauen. It stands him therefore in hand to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirre him, and to turne himselfe to all his stratagems:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18777:36"/>
One principall whereof is, that if he cannot hinder thee from the Word, he may hinder the Word from thee: or, if he cannot hinder it from the eare, he may from the heart: or, if he cannot intercept it from the heart by catching it, he may defeat thee of it by stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Note this stratagem, and doe thy best to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>End of Satans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to hinder faith</hi>
               </note>His <hi>second</hi> end is, to hinder faith: <hi>lest they should beleeue.</hi> And why? First, he knowes the Word is the parent of faith: Ioh. 17.20. Christ prayes for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that they might <hi>beleeue through the Word</hi> of his Disciples. And the Iaylor and all his house beleeued by hearing <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 16.31. Secondly, he cannot but be an enemy to our faith, and therefore winnowes vs as the Disciples, that our faith may faile; because faith 1. Makes vs the sonnes of God, Gal. 3.26. 2. Marries vs to Iesus Christ, Hos. 2.20. 3. Makes our hearts temples of the Spirit, <hi>purifying the heart,</hi> Act. 15.9. 4. Makes vs free entrance to God by prayer, to aske what we will, and wee shall obtaine, Eph. 3.12. And 5. It is our shield to resist all the darts of the diuell: the gates of hell shall neuer preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. Thirdly, if hee can keepe vs from faith, the Word (he knowes) shall be altogether vnprofitable, Heb. 4.2. and, if he can keepe this weapon from vs, he easily foyles vs; and makes God also our aduersary, because <hi>without faith it is impossible to please God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. Hence hee layes all his engines against our faith, &amp; seeks by all means to root it out of the heart, and out of the world, if God would giue him leaue.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>End, to rob men of their salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </note>His <hi>third</hi> end is, to rob men of saluation, <hi>lest they should be saued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:18777:36"/>First, Satan knowes, that the <hi>end of faith is saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.9. and that <hi>by preaching, God saues them that beleeue,</hi> 1. Cor. 1.21. If hee can keepe thee from faith, he hath robbed thee of saluation. Therefore if he cannot hinder the Word, he will (if he can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) hinder faith. Secondly, Satan is a deadly enemy to euery mans saluation: 1. Out of hatred: for the euill angels by their fall lost the loue of God, of his glory, and of his Image, and now hate whatsoeuer belongs to God. 2. Out of enuie: therefore hee is called in the Parable, <hi>the enuious man:</hi> Hee repines and enuies, that man should stand in innocency which hee lost; and therefore set vpon <hi>Adam,</hi> and droue him by his tentation out of Paradise. And he enuies more, that any man should enioy the glory of heauen, which himselfe can neuer recouer; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he layes all the blockes in their way that hee can deuise. And as when Gods people were going to Canaan, he stirred vp many armies of the Heathen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, to make them fall short of that good Land: So now he raiseth armies of tentations, and impediments, to make vs fall short of that heauenly Canaan, which hee knowes to bee a good Land, and thinkes too good for vs. 3. Out of his contrariety to God himselfe. He sees God carefull of his Church and children, that (as a good shepheard) he vseth all meanes to saue and preserue them: therefore hee cleane contrarily seekes to kill and destroy them, and defeate them of that saluation which the Lord hath prepared for them. And this seemes to be the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles ayme, 1. Pet. 5.7, 8. <hi>He cares for you: but watch for the diuell, who as a roring Lion seeketh to deuoure.</hi>

               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. The diuell knowes, that faith is by heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and saluation by faith: 1. I would our Popish Recusants knew so much, so they would make a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vse of this knowledge, than to withstand both faith and hearing. 2. I wish our formall Protestants knew it, who will scarce step out of dores to heare, but in policy will heare so much as they may bee counted no Atheists, or Papists, but indifferent men, as they be too indifferent whether they heare or no. 3. I wish they knew it, who by reading at home will beleeue and bee saued by their eyes; which are vnsufficient to breed faith. For God hath giuen the sence of hearing this preeminence, Rom. 10.14. <hi>How can they beleeue, vnlesse they heare?</hi> The sight is a sence of discipline, but hearing, the sence of faith. 4. I wish our Atheisticall scorners, who think they know so much as they contemne the Ministery, that they knew as much as the diuell: then would they not barre and excommunicate themselues so wilfully from the meanes of faith and saluation: they would not turne away the eare, if they knew that faith were dropt in by the eare. 5. I would our carelesse and sleepy hearers knew it, who shut the dore of faith, lest they should bee saued. Neuer will God open their hearts as <hi>Lydias</hi> by the Word, who shut their eares. 6. I wish they also would learne a lesson from the diuell, who content themselues to liue in dry and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18777:38"/>
barren places, destitute of the meanes of faith and saluation; as <hi>Lot,</hi> who chose Sodom, for the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the ground, before Canaan; and delight in the hills of Samaria among idolatrous Papists, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in Sion Hill among true worshippers. I am sure thou wouldest chuse to dwell with the Lord hereafter; then chuse to dwell now where the Lord dwelleth. In a word:</p>
            <p>Let vs all perswade our selues of that, whereof the diuell himselfe doubts not: 1. That God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hearing for the engendring of faith: For as by hearing the diuels voice, we lost our faith and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse; so the Lord hath appointed by hearing his voice againe, as the most conuenient meanes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer our faith and saluation. 1. Cor. 1.21. <hi>It pleased God by the foolishnesse of preaching, to saue them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</hi> And he hath tyed faith and saluation to preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both by precept and promise, and tyed vs to them, though himselfe be free. We haue no other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes. 2. We would rate our selues, if we should carelesly or wilfully lose our money or gold, or slip the meanes of getting and encreasing them: But behold, faith is much more precious than gold, 1. Pet. 1.7. and saluation far more precious than faith. If it were a small thing to lose faith, yet it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to lose saluation, &amp; more, to lose it so wilfully.</p>

A man may heare the Word with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, receiue it with ioy, beleeue with some assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, grow vp to high place in the profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, bring forth fruits of commendable obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and all this while be bad ground, and in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable estate. See it more distinctly in these foure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Reprobates may be forward Hearers, hungry and desirous Hearers, so glad to heare, as, if they haue not the Word at home, they will with zeale and forwardnesse seeke it abroad. Ioh. 6.34. The Iewes hearing Christ speake of bread from heauen, and such as giueth life to the world, flocked after him euery where, and with earnest desire say, <hi>Lord, giue vs euermore this bread,</hi> and yet many of them fell away from him, vers. 66.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They may be ioyfull Hearers, <hi>receiue the Word with ioy,</hi> as our Text hath it. Act. 26.28. <hi>Agrippa</hi> hauing heard <hi>Paul</hi> deliuering the summe of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, and of the strange manner both of his owne conuersion, and of mans saluation, by Christs humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and glory, rauished with the excellency of it, cries, <hi>Almost thou perswadest me to be a Christian.</hi> And of <hi>Iohns</hi> Hearers our Sauiour saith, <hi>Ye reioyced in his light for a season,</hi> Ioh. 5.35.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They may be beleeuing Hearers for a time: so saith the Text, <hi>which for a while beleeue,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Matthew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> endure as beleeuers for a time.</hi> They are verily perswaded of the truth of the whole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of saluation, that euery word shall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished in the saluation of Beleeuers, and iust con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18777:43"/>
of vnbeleeuers. They beleeue, it alone teacheth the right way to heauen. Of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> it is said, Act. 8.13. that <hi>he beleeued,</hi> and was baptized: not that he had true faith, (for euen then <hi>Peter</hi> saw him in the gall of bitternesse, and band of iniquity:) but he yeelded to the doctrine of Christ which <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> taught, and behaued himselfe as if hee had belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued indeed, and had been a Disciple of Christ.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They may bee growing Hearers: 1. To a great measure of illumination: <hi>Balaam,</hi> a wretched sorcerer, was enlightned so farre as to see the blessed estate of Gods people, and desirous to partake of their happinesse, he cried out in great passion, <hi>Oh that my soule might die the death of the righteous! Iudas,</hi> a wretched Traytor, and sonne of perdition, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue preached the Gospell, without a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the illumination in himselfe. 2. They may grow to a great place in the profession; as <hi>Iudas</hi> to follow Christ himselfe at the heeles, and call him Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. 3. To a great measure of reformation of life, and obedience to the Gospell: being in the same pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures with the sheepe of Christ, hee is taken for a sheepe, when indeed he is a goat for a time in the same fold with the sheepe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. Men may be drawne to heare gladly, where faith is not, for illumination sake, or enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening sake. <hi>It is a pleasant thing</hi> (saith <hi>Salomon) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the light of the Sunne.</hi> There is a great force and power in the light, to draw all mens eyes after it: So is there power and force in the Word soundly taught, to draw mens affections of ioy and delight, at least for a time. And euen naturall men also, who
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18777:44"/>
are of quicke apprehension, can reioyce to heare deepe poynts learnedly and soundly opened, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Conscience, or questions of Religion sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discussed. Math. 12.37. When our Sauiour dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with the Scribes and Pharises, and <hi>put them to silence,</hi> it is said, <hi>much people heard him gladly.</hi> No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell then is it, if supernaturall illumination (although a common gift) bring men with much ioy to heare the Word: For is it not a ioyfull thing to heare of the way of saluation, and of so many promises, and an eternall happinesse after this life? Who would not come running, as gladly as the young man, to heare he should bee saued, who not liking the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, went away as heauily? So, who will not throng and thrust after a pleasing Preacher, or so long as he dwels in Promises? If a Preacher pipe, the profanest will dance. But if he come to the Law, oh they cannot abide to heare of damnation, and, He hath no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hing but condemnation in his mouth, I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A man may goe thus farre in Christian duties, and be bad ground, by a delusion, and mistaking his owne estate: namely, by <hi>a false conception of faith,</hi> or an vnfound apprehension of the excellency of Iesus Christ, and the blessed estate of Beleeuers vnited vnto him. An hypocrite may see what is the comfort of remission of sinnes: what a tranquillity and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen on earth it is, to haue a good conscience, washed and sprinkled in the blood of the Lambe: what an happinesse, to haue free accesse to God in prayer, to liue with God, and enioy him heere below. But he sees it in others, not in himselfe: and hee will
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18777:44"/>
goe a great way to haue part in them, and lay out something for them: but he will not bee at so much either cost or paynes for them as they are worth, and as he must pay before he haue them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A man may be carried a great way in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary faith, for temporary causes, and selfe-respects:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Temporary faith raised on tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary causes.</hi>
               </note> which respects as they faile, so also must his faith and hopes.</p>
            <p>One is curiosity and nouelty. A new Preacher, or some new strange matter, neuer heard of before,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> drawes a number of men to heare gladly: And now they professe they will keepe their Church, and not misse: For they neuer goe, but they know that they neuer knew before. So the Athenians (Act. 17.20.) will heare <hi>Paul</hi> preach, and enquire the meaning of his doctrine, because they say, <hi>he brought strange things to their eares,</hi> and their life was to <hi>heare and tell newes.</hi> But Athenians grow weary both of that matter and man, who ceaseth to be new. And vnthankfull Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, when Manna first commeth, admire it, reioyce in it, feed vpon it, grow strong by it: Why? Because it is a strange kind of meat. But afterward they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, and lothe it, because not new, tho it was eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day new.</p>
            <p>A second selfe-respect that may make a man dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the means, is pride and conceit. They desire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> knowledge, and reioyce to get it, not to edifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues (which were wisdome:) nor to edifie others (which were charitie:) but that themselues may be knowne to be some body, (which is meere vanity.) If the world honour the profession of the Gospell, they will share in that honour. If it will credite them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18777:45"/>
men to professe the Gospell, and line accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it outwardly, they will doe it. <hi>Iudas</hi> himselfe can fashion himselfe outwardly to the holyest Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. A Pharise can fast and pray, and giue almes, to be seene and praised of men. Many Pharisaicall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants can play on both hands, or (as wee say) fast and loose: In some company can speak good words, commend good men, speake of some good notes of Sermons, confesse and condemne many of his owne courses, and take hold on the better end of the staffe: But the same man (as if not the same man) in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company can be as loose, as scornfull, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly hatefull of goodnesse as euer before.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third selfe-respect is worldly profit. So long as men may hope to be gainers by Christ, so long they will follow ioyfully: as the Iewes, after that Christ had fed them with bread, hee could neuer bee rid of them, but they followed him from place to place, but neither for his Doctrine nor Miracles, nor for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but <hi>because of the loaues,</hi> Ioh. 6.26. Profit and preferment will make a man heare diligently, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse openly, preach painfully, at least till the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or profits choke both Preachers and Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. But Christ, if the bring no loaues, shall faile of much of his company. How far did <hi>Demas</hi> goe in his profession, that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> reckons him among the Saints who saluted the Colossians, chap. 4.14? but all this was for some preferment, which when he got,<note place="margin">2 Tim 4.10.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> changed his note, <hi>Demas hath forsaken me, and embraced the present world.</hi> If euer the complaint was iust,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.21</note> it is now of Christians, <hi>All men seeke their owne:</hi> and as <hi>Augustine</hi> in his time complained, <hi>Vix
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18777:45"/>
quaeritur Iesus propter Iesum,</hi> Scarce any seeke Christ for Christ his sake. But our wisdome will be to seeke Iesus for Iesus, that is, saluation. Seeke him for that end he came into the world; not to make thee rich in the world, or heire of the earth, but to enrich thee with grace, of iustification, and of sanctification, and make thee heire of eternall life.</p>
            <p>So much of the third Reason.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God seeth it fit, that hypocrites should go thus far in the way of saluation, and yet fall short:<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reasons why hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites goe so farre.</hi>
               </note> 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he will haue his owne wayes iustified, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by his very enemies: Euen they shall giue him witnesse, both by word and deed, that it is the best way, though they cannot hold it. 2. Hereby he cuts off all cause of iudging others before the time. Thou canst not iudge betweene a sheepe and a goat: only the chiefe Shepheard can. 3. Seeing it befals reprobates to be esteemed and goe for good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and be so like as none can discerne them, hee will haue vs hereby take occasion to iudge our selues, what ground we are, and goe to the ballance of his Word, and make iust triall whether we hold waight or no, whether we be sound, and differenced by true markes of Christianity from apparant Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. How may this doctrine dant and terrifie many of vs, who take our selues to be in good estate, when yet we are not comparable to this bad ground? whom yet if we come short of, we must needs come short of saluation. If the ground that goes thus far,<note place="margin">

               </note> shall bee damned, what damnation abides such as come not halfe way with them? More specially:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Doe wee see a stony heart receiue the Word
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18777:46"/>
speedily and hungrily? See wee heere a gracelesse ground and heart swift to heare, and painfull in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell to get the Word soundly taught? What then shall become of vs, that are in no readinesse, make no haste to receiue? to whom the small time of an houre in a weeke is tedious, while wee sit at our ease. Shall forward Hearers bee condemned, and the backward in hearing approued?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we see some that attend the Word, loue it, and finde sweetnes in it, yet shall be kept out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; how can contemners, raylers, persecutors, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they heare) hope to get in, where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that haue attended, remembred, and marked, yea and come to a great measure of knowledge by it, shall be shut out?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we see in our Text, that many who are much affected with the Word, who haue receiued the same with ioy, and delighted many times to confer of it by day, and meditate of it by night: (for who will not speake and thinke often on that which ioyes his heart?) if (I say) we see here a rocky heart, relenting and reioycing at the Word, yet shut out of heauen; what may wee thinke of many of our drowsie Hearers, who are no more moued, almost, than the seats they sit on, or the stones in the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? They are not terrified by denunciation of all the iudgements of God, which are their owne por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: not comforted with promises, though they falsly conceiue them their owne: but as the froward Iewes, Math. 11.17. are like froward children: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be piped or mourned vnto, they be all one, moued with neither.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:18777:46"/>4. See we in our Text a great many, who grow vp by the Word, and by their delight and diligence are furnished with a great measure of knowledge (that they can fruitfully conferre of the Scriptures, they can try Doctrines by Scripture, and iudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene truth and falsehood, yea they are growne vp to a glorious profession, with much zeale and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse: and not onely so, but to such a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they seeme throughly sanctified, make much of Ministers, and be at cost to any good purpose, and as forward as any:) and yet with more than all this be bad ground, and reprobate? Alas! what then shall become of a multitude of our carelesse and forgetfull Hearers, of our brutish and senslesse Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who are resolued to remaine so? What of those barren hearts, whose fallow grounds the Lord hath plowed vp, sowed on them the seeds of eternall life, watered them with continuall dewes of heauen, and lookes for the fruits of obedience, but reapes onely tares, and cursed fruits of ignorance, wilfulnesse, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of sincerity, scorne of his faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and contemning of his grace offered vnto them?</p>
            <p>Oh my brethren, if euer you were serious in any thing concerning your good, thinke seriously of this one poynt. And if God euer made me able to speake to your hearts, Oh that I could carry this poynt in, and reach the hearts of you all! Or rather let the Lord, who made your hearts, take this his owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and speake so as they may heare: That num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of you come short of these bad Hearers, and that multitudes of Reprobates in the Day of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18777:47"/>
Lord, shall rise vp in iudgement to condemne many of vs, who neuer receiue the Word so readily, so hungrily, so painfully, so ioyfully, so fruitfully, as they haue done. That numbers of cursed caitiffes shall be able to say more for their owne saluation then num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of vs: They shall be able to say, <hi>Lord, wee haue stept many a mile to heare thy Word; wee haue carefully attended, marked, remembred, meditated, conferred, and applyed it: It was our ioy and delight to gaine the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of holy things, and to our knowledge we ioyned zeale, forwardnesse, and reformation: We professed thy Name, suffered many things for our profession, loued thy House, reuerenced thy Ministers, and would haue parted with our eyes to haue done them good: Also we were liberall to the poore Saints, and to other good purposes.</hi> Canst thou say thus much for thy selfe? If thou canst not, thou commest behinde a Cast-away: If thou canst, thou art not yet before a Reprobate: And, if hee that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say more, shall neuer come to heauen, how shall he come there that cannot say halfe so much? Why should we not hence shame our selues, that Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and such as heauen shall be shut against, are so far before vs? Can we haue comfort or hope in such an estate, as is outstripped by hopelesse and damned hypocrites?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> What, doe you meane to driue vs all to despaire? Is this the way to reach vs the assurance of our saluation, to which you so often call vs? Can we be assured by such a desperate and vncomfortable Doctrine?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This Doctrine seemes harsh and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable to such as faine would presume of a

            <p n="2">2. This Doctrine directly intends the most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red comfort and consolation of Gods children, which will hold out in the day of triall, because it enforceth the Christian to soundnesse in his course, and to run his race of Christianity <hi>not as at vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie,</hi> 1. Cor. 9.26. which is indeed most vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.

            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">I. <hi>Jn holy desires. For,</hi>
               </note>I. Examine thy desires after God and his Word, in these particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Their ground.</hi>
               </note>1. In the <hi>ground</hi> of them: Then onely are they gracious and acceptable, first, when thou hast pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and discerned that the doctrine is of God, and yeeldest not to it in any other respect, but as to the authority of God: And secondly, when thou hast prized the thing desired aboue all that may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with it, and so taking thy heart from all other things, bestowed it onely on it as the chiefe good. This an hypocrite cannot doe: He may attaine a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, but it is altogether vngrounded. This stony ground desires, and receiues the seed immediately, indeed too hastily, (the desire being an <hi>heritage hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gotten:</hi>) Either out of simplenesse, and leuity, and lightnesse in beleeuing, as Prou. 14.15. <hi>The foole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues euery thing:</hi> and they yeeld presently, without any good warrant. Or out of policy and warinesse, for indirect and present respects, they so consent to the truth, as that they are as ready to consent to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, if it be deliuered with any shew, or vrged on them by superiours. The winde driues not the clouds about more vsually, then are these windy Professors with winds of doctrine.</p>
            <p>This therefore thou must doe in the first place: Looke that thy desire bee thus soundly grounded. It
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18777:48"/>
was the commendation of the Bereans, that they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Word with all readines,</hi> but so, as they <hi>search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Scriptures,</hi> and knew them to be so.<note place="margin">Act. 17.11.</note> And let vs doe in our way to heauen, as <hi>Peter</hi> in his way to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia, Act. 16.10. After he saw a vision, hee imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly prepared to goe into Macedonia, being <hi>assured the Lord had called vs</hi> vnto them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Examine thy desires in the <hi>matter</hi> of them:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Their matter.</hi>
               </note> which is twofold: 1. In respect of God the chiefe Good: 2. In respect of the Word, the meanes to it.</p>
            <p>For the first. An hypocrite may desire happinesse, as <hi>Balaam,</hi> for selfe-loue; but properly desires not the loue of God for it selfe. See therefore that thy desire be rather of reconciliation then saluation: rather to glorifie God, then be glorified of him: esteeming the light of his countenance better then life it selfe. This is a pure and holy desire after grace and fauour, aboue all things.</p>
            <p>For the second. 1. Thou must desire not the Word so much, as God in his Word: seeke after the liuing God in his Ordinances: loue him in the Word, who there shewes he loued thee first. Many professe loue to the Word, who loue not God. 2. Desire the <hi>Word of the Kingdome</hi> for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes sake. For an hypocrite may desire the Word of the Kingdome for feare of hell. 3. Desire the whole Word. An hypocrite may desire some part of it: the promises affect and rauish him, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are distastfull. Gods indulgences and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses please him wonderfully, but restraints and impositions are burdensome and tedious. Therefore see thou desire the conditions as well as the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18777:49"/>
and loue the worke of the Word as well as the wages, yea, if there were no wages: So cannot he.</p>

               </note>3. Examine thy desires in the <hi>end</hi> of them: thus: 1. An hypocrite may desire the Word for science sake, not for conscience; to puffe himselfe vp, not to humble himselfe; for discourse, not for direction. If thou desirest the Word to learne selfe-deniall, to yeeld conscionable obedience in all things, and to take the constant direction of it, as Israel by the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in all their iournies, thou art beyond any hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite. 2. Hypocrites may desire the Word to bee like the children of God in happinesse, but not in sincere obedience; to meet them at the end, and be saued, but not to ioyne with them in the meanes; or, if they doe ioyne in the meanes, it is by starts and fits for most part, and vnconstantly. See thy desire be to keepe the way as well as the end of it, though it be all strawed with crosses: and be as desirous of the means as of the end: Especially desire the Word as a constant light, direction, comfort, and strength: For such are the grones and desires of the Spirit. An hypocrite likes Heauen well, but not the way to Heauen.</p>

               </note>4. Examine thy desires in the <hi>companions</hi> and <hi>qualities</hi> of them. One is <hi>sence</hi> of want: They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> from a bruised heart, as in the Conuerts, Acts 2.37. and the Iaylor, chap. 16.30. True desires are the breathings of a broken heart. Another vndiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> companion of them is the <hi>Word</hi>; they alwaies set a man forward to the Word of the Apostles, to be instructed by them: as in the former examples: whereas an hypocrite will comfort himselfe, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18777:49"/>
rest satisfied without the Word, in blinde vngroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hopes. A third is <hi>vehemencie</hi> and feruencie: they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> must not bee light or slight desires, but a vehement thirst, as <hi>Samsons,</hi> almost ready to die; as the Hart chased pants for water: an hunger that would breake stone walls, and contemne fire and water, euen the vtmost perils: more eager then any worldling can desire siluer and gold. Hypocrites haue desires, but faint, not so earnest within as they seeme to be. A fourth is the good <hi>affections</hi> that attend it: as an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> desire to repent, to reforme both the heart and life, to abstaine from lusts, to keepe a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before God and man in all things. A fifth is <hi>constancy:</hi> as a thirsty man desires drink till his thirst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> be quenched: as <hi>Hannahs</hi> for a child till she had one: so is the Christians, till Christ bee formed in him, and then to be still knit neerer vnto him. An hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may desire by starts and moods, as <hi>Pilate</hi> desires to know <hi>what is truth,</hi> Ioh. 18. but stayed not to know it. He desires the good things of the Kingdome, but they are held at such a rate as deads his desires: as the young man: They are cooled and quenched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he attaines the thing he seemed so earnestly to desire. Doe thou see, that thy desire bee not satisfied before thou get the thing desired, euen Christ and his merits: The more true taste thou gettest, the more earnestly thou wilt desire him; no rate will be too deare; all things will be drosse and dung in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of him. The sixth or last is, <hi>growth in desires</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and endeuours: Spirituall life stayes not in begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, but riseth to a great measure of liuelinesse: as a graine of mustard-seed. 2. Pet. 3.18. <hi>Grow in grace,

            <p>Get these desires of the Word, thus qualified, for the ground, matter, end, and companions of them, and then know to thy comfort, that no Reprobate euer came so farre: no bad ground attaines such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.</p>

An hypocrite may know the story of Christs death and resurrection, and the merits of them: but neuer did any hypocrite know the vertue and power of his death and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> desired, Philip. 3.10. <hi>Obiect.</hi> Why, did he not know it, and preach it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time? <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, he knew well the death and resurrection of Christ, as also the vertue and power of them: but he would feele in himselfe that power more and more, standing in the death of sin, and the life of righteousnesse. This experimentall
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18777:50"/>
knowledge farre passeth the <hi>theorie,</hi> and is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but of a few. 2. An hypocrite may know in generall, that Christ is a Redeemer, and discourse excellently of the manner, meanes, and end: and this swimmes in the braine.

Therefore see thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be distinct. 3. An hypocrite may know Christ as God hath described him in the Scripture, but not as he is <hi>made of God vnto vs wisedome, and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and sanctification, and redemption.</hi>

Hypocrites may know much in themselues, but a little for others: as many content themselues to bee counted great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, but no man the better for all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundnesse; it is so farre to the bottome, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be come by.

neuer produceth his knowledge into sound practice, which is vniuersall: Tit. 1.16. <hi>They professe they know God, but in their deeds deny him:</hi> Whereas all sound knowledge is practicall. <hi>If ye know these things</hi> (saith our Sauiour) <hi>blessed are ye if ye doe them.</hi> And to such as know abundantly, so as they be able to preach po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully, but ioyne not practice to their knowledge, though they professe they know Christ, yet shall hee professe hee neuer knew them, Math. 7.23. <hi>Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity.</hi> Therefore I say vnto thee, as <hi>Dauid</hi> said to his son <hi>Salomon,</hi> 1.

And <hi>Simeon</hi> was neuer so ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; as when hee had Christ in his armes, because hee loued him. 3. Sorrow to see the Word not kept: Psa. 119.136. <hi>Mine eyes gush out with riuers of water, because they keepe not thy Law.</hi> And indeed sound ioy comes
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18777:53"/>
out of sound sorrow for sin. Ioh. 16.19. Ye shall sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, &amp; the world shall reioyce, but <hi>your sorrow shall be turned into ioy. Lots righteous soule was vexed</hi> with the vncleane conuersation of the Sodomites, 2. Pet. 2.7.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Holy graces, fiue.</hi>
               </note> there are certaine holy graces attending it: 1. <hi>Humility.</hi> It issues from true humiliation in the sence of his owne infirmity. The ioy of an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is proud, because he sees not sinne, or not all sinne: and promiseth, and assureth that to it selfe which the Word doth not. 2. <hi>Regeneration:</hi> The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ioy of an hypocrite is a ioy of illumination, not of regeneration; as a man reioyceth in the sight and light of the Sunne, but not in the sence of comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table heate, quickening, and reuiuing by it. The one reioyceth to heare of a Pearle, the other to haue it. 3. <hi>Faith</hi> attends the ioy of the regenerate: therfore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is called <hi>the ioy of faith.</hi> The hypocrites ioy is a ioy of affection, not of faith. He reioyceth to conceiue of rare nouelties, and deepe mysteries, but not as deeply rooted in himselfe. 4. <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> attends <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it. An hypocrites ioy is alwayes ioyned with the raigne and delight of some sinne. See thy ioy take righteousnesse for his companion, and dis-ioyne not them whom the holy Ghost hath ioyned, Rom. 14.17 Know if the loue of one sin raigne, if thy ioy marre not the taste of carnall ioyes, if it thrust not downe the rule of the loue of the world; yea if it imbitter not the rellish of earthly delights, thy ioy is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound. 5. The last grace is Constancy and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> it is an <hi>euerlasting consolation,</hi> 2. Thes. 2.16. And of this ioy Christ hath said, You shall reioyce, and, <hi>your ioy shall none take from you,</hi> Ioh. 16.22. Yea this ioy
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18777:54"/>
increaseth according to the increase of grace, and continuance of meanes. It holds in aduersity, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, in life, in death, and is most <hi>vnspeakable and glorious</hi> in heauen. But the ioy of hypocrites is a blaze at first, and soone out: it is suddenly and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerably lost: a little persecution or triall turnes all into sorrow and heauinesse: but at their death, and afterward, not a sparke remaines. So as <hi>Iob</hi> said truly, <hi>The ioy of the hypocrite is but for a moment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thou finde that thy ioy is thus qualified, no hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite falling from his ioy, need dismay thee, thou art beyond his farthest reach: Thou hast drunke of the Well of consolation, and shalt neuer thirst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.<note place="margin">Pro. 14.10</note>

               <note place="margin">1. <hi>The root.</hi>
               </note>First, an hypocrite springs from no root but onely the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>whatsoeuer is of flesh</hi> (saith Christ)
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18777:54"/>
               <hi>is flesh.</hi> But sound growth in profession or reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is from a new creation, <hi>a tree of righteousnesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa. 61.3.</note> 
               <hi>the planting of the Lord,</hi> transplanted out of the old stock of old <hi>Adam,</hi> and new rooted into the second <hi>Adam</hi> by spirituall regeneration: and from this Root all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable growth riseth, according to our Sauiours speech, <hi>First make the tree good, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, all the growth of an hypocrite is from an heart which at best restraineth some euill, but neuer changed vnto good. But sound growth is from an heart renewed, a soule mortified, <hi>a pure heart, and good conscience,</hi> 1. Tim. 1.5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Examine thy selfe in what fruits thou growest.<note place="margin">2. <hi>The fruits.</hi>
               </note> The best fruit of an hypocrite is in externall things, and by externall things. As first, by education he may grow in ciuility, and in morall vertue, which many thinke Religion enough. This was the righteousnes of the Heathens, of the Scribes and Pharises. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the meanes of saluation he may grow to an externall holinesse. v. c. hee may grow in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in hopes and confidence, in zeale, in many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward seemly duties, and rest in these, or in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, in stead of some inward graces, which would better bestead him.</p>
            <p>But a sound Christian, because hee knowes that <hi>without faith nothing is pleasing to God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> lookes especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to grow in faith. And knowing that pure loue must flow from <hi>faith vnfained,</hi> hee seekes to grow vp in feruent loue of God, of his Word, of his Image,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.5</note> of his children, and all holy things. And because hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is the foundation of all good graces, he layes a good ground there, and builds all vpon it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18777:55"/>
he cannot be zealous as <hi>Iehu,</hi> who still followed the vile sinnes of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> his father, he growes most in most inward hatred of his most inward and secret corruptions. Thus whereas a barren tree stayes in leaues and showes; hee, as a good tree, growes to bring the best fruits, euen the best, and most sound, and shining graces.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3 <hi>The measure.</hi>
               </note>3. Examine thy selfe in what measure thou grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est. A sound growth is filled with fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, laden with the fruits of the Spirit: Ioh. 15.8. Herein is the Father glorified, that ye bring <hi>much</hi> fruit. And sound growth is in euery part, in euery af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and in euery grace. But the growth of an hypocrite is two wayes peccant: 1. It is delicate. 2. It is partiall.</p>
            <p>It is delicate. He will professe and reforme so farre as he list, but will keepe a brothers wife, or spare some <hi>Agag,</hi> or hold some sweet morsell vnder his tongue. He may, and will amend many faults, but some one or other he reformes not, nor wil reforme. Whereas, were the growth sound, it would conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably <hi>respect all the Commandements:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119.6.</note> it would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reforme all sinnes: it would striue to bee <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable in spirit, soule, and body,</hi> 1. Thes. 5.23.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is partiall, and so the hypocrite deceiues himselfe two wayes: 1. Sometimes hee growes in the profession of faith, not in the grace of faith, as it is noted by Christ of certaine Disciples, that they beleeued not, Ioh. 6.64. Many pretend faith, when they are without feeling, without application. 2. Sometimes on the contrary, he rests in a supposall of faith, without the profession of faith: Now his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18777:55"/>
policy is his Religion. Against both these deceits, see thy faith and profession grow alike, and bee able to say with the Prophet, Psal. 116.10. <hi>I beleeued, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I spake:</hi> and with the Apostles, <hi>We cannot chuse but speake what we haue heard.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act 4 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed somtime the child of God may haue faith in the heart, and not profession in the mouth, but that is either in the beginning of grace, as <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> or in tentation, as <hi>Peter</hi> for feare, or Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, till Christ looke backe againe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Examine thy affection in growth.<note place="margin">4. <hi>The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
               </note> Growth in grace is vnlike the growth of nature. In nature the more a thing growes, the higher it is; in grace, the lower; the further thou growest, the more humble thou art. And why? 1. Because no grace outgrowes humility, which is planted before any other. 2. He that is more growne, sees more cleerly his want of growth, and is humbled in his want, as the poore man, Mark. 9.24. <hi>I beleeue, Lord, helpe my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe:</hi> and as the Apostles, Luk. 17.5. <hi>Lord, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease our faith.</hi> 3. This spirituall pouerty keepes him hungry, and he will grow still till hee be best at last.</p>
            <p>Contrariwise, vnsound growth sees not his vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in growth, and so is proud of that hee hath, and quickly growes to saciety, and security, and thinkes himselfe growne farre enough.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Dost thou continue in growth,<note place="margin">5. <hi>The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</hi>
               </note> euen in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to the conclusion? As 1. Doth grace grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst nature, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nature pleads peace &amp; profit, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> perswades it is no wisedome to be meddling, when flesh and blood saith, <hi>Master, pitty thy selfe?</hi> This
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18777:56"/>
is a signe of soundnesse, when nature takes one part, and the Word another: now the Commandement preuailes: for an hypocrite abides no thorow-morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Doth thy faith grow against thy feeling? An hypocrite may bee perswaded of Gods fauour for the present, while hee feeles a flash and sudden gleame; but if that flash be gone, his faith is gone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his feeling is. But faith is sometimes at defiance with feeling:<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> 
               <hi>It is the euidence of things not seene:</hi> and will hold his perswasion against sence. If <hi>Iob</hi> feele God killing him, yet his faith will trust in him: And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> will <hi>hope against hope,</hi> Rom. 4.18. 3. Doest thou grow in this frozen and wintrous time, so stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and blustering against sincerity? Doest thou flourish like a greene Bay-tree, in the winter of this age, in want of encouragements and example? This is necessary. For an hypocrite may seeme to grow in the Sunne, and peace of the Gospell, but hardly shares in the scorne and contempt of it. Some selfe-respect may hold him in a while, but hee hardly growes in the want of Discipline, and in termes of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> liberty. Lastly, doest thou continue in growth and fruits? A whistling winde makes rotten fruits come tumbling downe, though they seeme beautifull: so is tribulation to glorious Christians, it makes all the fruits of hypocrites fall off and come to nothing. But in sound growth of grace, not so much as the <hi>leaues wither</hi> or fall off, Psalm. 1.3. because there is a continuall supply of moisture of grace, a Well flowes in his belly to eternall life. <hi>Iob</hi> for all his trials will perseuere in his vprightnesse. And if Satan shall winnow as wheate, Christ shall pray
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18777:56"/>
that thy faith and fruits faile not.</p>
            <p>These are sure notes of triall, whether our growth be sound, and gotten beyond that of hypocrites no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Text. It stands vs all in hand to try our selues, whether we be sound in faith; and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selues with profession, or outward reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If Reprobates be before vs, where is our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort? what our portion? If <hi>Herod</hi> heare, and bee damned; if he doe many things, reuerence <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the like; and thou heare not, reforme little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, contemne the meanes, &amp;c. what canst thou thinke will become of thee? Lastly, what comfort can it be to come behinde the diuell, who beleeues and trembles; or <hi>Iudas,</hi> who confesseth his sin, makes restitution, and seemes to be gracious?

And therefore neither is this a withering of persons truly iustified, or a fall from iustifying faith, which they neuer had, (as Papists would haue vs beleeue) but from tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary faith of hypocrites, as the Text is most plaine, calling them <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> when they fall off the grounds of sincerity and truth, whereof they were once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded: as many who decline, and for by-respects are carryed from the truth which they once embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: such as <hi>Demas,</hi> who forsooke the truth, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the present world. Thus did the Galatians wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by little and little <hi>fell to another Gospell:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 1.6.</note> at first in part, and through weaknesse afterward in whole, and by obstinacy. Such were <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> who once held the truth concerning the doctrine of Resurrection, but in short time <hi>erred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the faith</hi>; saying that the Resurrection was already past, and destroyed the faith of many, 2. Tim. 2.18.</p>
            <p>As this was prophecyed of these latter ages, so our eyes haue seene the same abundantly verified in numbers, who in these later times haue departed from the faith, and giuen heed to spirits of errours, and doctrines of diuels, 1. Tim. 4.1.</p>
            <p>I will not speak of such learned men, as in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes fell from the truth of the Gospell, which themselues had professed and defended;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Instances of Apostacy or withering in sound iudgement.</hi>
               </note> such as <hi>Bonner, Gardiner, &amp;c.</hi> But numbers now in this Light are declined, and darkened in comparison of their owne light. As for example: 1. Our Doctrine a long time hath been, that our Iustification is by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> faith onely, without workes naturall, morall, yea or of grace: according to the Scripture, Rom. 3.28. But how haue many withered in this maine Article,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18777:58"/>
who now will haue workes <hi>dipt in the blood of Christ,</hi> come into the matter of Iustification?<note place="margin">

               </note> so that Christ is but halfe a Iesus, halfe a Sauiour. 2. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> iudgement was, that Gods Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation are absolute, depending onely vpon Gods will and pleasure: according to the Scripture, Ephes. 1.4, 5. But how generally are men withered, and gone from this truth, as if their wits were now to be refined by <hi>Arminius?</hi> concluding them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall, depending vpon mans willing or nilling to receiue the grace of God. How doth the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of vniuersall Redemption and grace creepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad euery-where as a Gangrene? teaching, that effectuall and sufficient grace is offered to all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one, by which they may repent and beleeue if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> they will. 3. The receiued truth was wont to bee, that the Pope is <hi>that Antichrist,</hi> and Rome Babylon, (as the Iesuites themselues confesse:) and therefore we haue done well to separate from them. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are withered from this truth, and are loth the Pope should bee <hi>that notorious Antichrist,</hi> but the Turke rather, (who neuer yet sate in the Temple of God?) and haue deuised a new Rome or Sea for him, onely discouered by Popish Geographers. 4. The common iudgement heretofore was, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Christ is present in the Supper sacramentally to the faith of the Receiuer. But now many are withered, and now Christ must be present there, after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner not to be questioned or disputed. 5. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> iudgement of Protestant Diuines was, that our Religion differed from Popery in substantiall and essentiall poynts. But many are gone from that, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18777:58"/>
now we differ but in circumstances, and there needs but a small modification in most poynts betweene vs: An English, yea or a Popish <hi>Cassander</hi> might bring vs together; though heauen and earth shall come as soone together, as these two Religions agree in the fundamentals.</p>
            <p>Time would faile to speake of the generall wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering in iudgement, in the doctrine concerning the strict obseruation of the Sabbath, which some thinke alterable and obseruable at the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Christian Prince; though it were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Gods owne finger in Tables of stone, as no alterable Law was. So concerning Christs locall descending into hell, in his soule. Concerning the restoring of <hi>Auricular confession,</hi> with separating some abuses onely in the manner. Concerning the needlesnesse of so much preaching: as if the honour of the Ministery were, to thrust downe the exercise of it. And lastly, concerning a mans falling wholly and finally from Grace, who is truly iustified and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</p>
            <p>Thus are numbers of men tost with the waues of contrary doctrines; to whom the truth is yea and nay, now this, now that, according to their occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: now they are resolued, now vnresolued.</p>

(as an vnthankefull Israelite,) loathes the sweete Manna, which at first was so precious. Others were wont to pray much and often, and that with such earnestnesse, as if they had been right Israelites, who were resolued to wrestle it out with God: but now much of that labour is remitted, the hand growes so heauie, and so ready to fall downe, that <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> haue much adoe to support them. Some were once diligent in instructing their families, in reading the Scriptures with them, in carefull watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer their behauior, as if they had meant to haue gone thorow with <hi>Ioshua</hi> his resolution.<note place="margin">Iosh. 24.15</note> But now more then halfe the allowance of the family is taken away.</p>
            <p>Thus as a man in decay casts off some of his traine, and sets himselfe at a lower rate: So, hee that is withering in grace, sets downe himselfe in iudgement, affection, practice, and diligence in the meanes.</p>

            <p>The third generall thing proposed, is, Notes of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> man withering in Grace. And these are sixe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A resting in a common and generall hope of a good estate,<note place="margin">6. <hi>Notes of a man wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering in Grace.</hi>
               </note> without desire or indeuour to seeke markes of certainty, or speciall assurance in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:18777:61"/>
As a foolish Trades-man hopes his estate is good enough, and beares his Creditors in hand it is so; but hee is loth to cast vp his bookes, or come to a particular view of it. No surer argument of a man decaying.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. An opinion of sufficiency: that hee hath Grace enough: Hee will seeke no more, because hee pleaseth himselfe in his present measure; and hee that careth not to increase his stocke, wastes of the principall. And not to goe forward, is to goe backward. Therefore alwaies displease thy selfe in the measure of Grace alreadie receiued, saith <hi>Augustine.</hi>

            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. A comparing of a mans selfe with those that are of lower and inferiour graces, or meanes. Our Fathers (say some) were saued with lesse adoe; they heard but few Sermons, and knew not what the precise fashion meant. But what saith our Sauiour, Luk. 12.48. <hi>Where men commit more, more is expected?</hi> Others come to Church as others doe, and liue ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilly and soberly, yea, haue as much knowledge as such and such of their ranke, and they hope, as much conscience too; and are not very ambitious to steppe before others in this course: But for the patternes of Scripture, and the example of Saints (registred for our imitation) they thinke concernes not them, because they cannot be Saints. Here is a marke of a man withering, and growing worse and worse; who will not be drawne beyond them that are but a step beyond the worst: because hee scornes the best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, as too singular.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. A shunning or slighting of Gods ordinances: a

And the plant that would not wither, must draw moisture dayly. Or, if vsing publike meanes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, hee neglect priuate, hee is on the withering hand. We cannot haue our ruinous hearts stand vpright, further then we dayly repaire them. The Word and Prayer dayly vsed, are soueraigne meanes to heale dayly infirmities. A sound Beleeuer, whose leafe shall not wither, is a tree standing by riuers of water.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

If men can run ouer these, or any of them dayly, and not humble themselues for them, yea and reforme them, they are withering apace: I feare, such a man will soone come to nothing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Hatred of Gods children, and the way of iust men, whether open or secret. How can they keepe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> their greenenesse, who cannot abide the greenenesse and graces of others, but can be wittie in priuy girds and scornes of such as endeuour to preserue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from withering?

            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> Seeing so many great Professors wither away so dangerously, <hi>let him that stands, take heede lest hee fall,</hi> 1. Cor. 10.12. See we men of so great illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, affection, &amp; reformation (as in this stony ground) wither quite away? How necessary then is that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of the Apostle, Heb. 12.15. <hi>Take heede that no man fall away from the grace of God,</hi> and Chap. 3.12. <hi>Take heede of the euill heart of vnbeliefe, to depart from the liuing God.</hi> A necessarie exhortation for all: the hypocrite, because he is in danger of finall withering, and shall perish in it; and the lesse hee feares it, his danger is not the lesse: As also the sound Christian, who, though he cannot fall quite away, because the Lord puts vnder his hand, yet by fearing to fall, he auoydes falling, and being falne, recouers himselfe againe.</p>
            <p>Let euery godly man looke hee stand on firme ground: for Reprobates may seeme to stand, and be greene for a while. Neither let any content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that he heareth good Sermons, or that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth therein for the present. For, as we read Ioh. 5.35. <hi>Iohns</hi> hearers esteemed him a burning &amp; shining light,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.35.</note> and reioyced in his light, but it was but <hi>for a season.</hi> And this Text of ours tels vs, that many heard our Lord himselfe, and that with ioy, yet withered away: and Ioh. 6.66. many that had heard Christ, and followed him for a time, as if they had beene

               <hi>Obiect.</hi> There is no feare, so long as we be Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and not Papists; so long as wee professe the truth, and denie the grosse points of Popery, which cut men from Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> There is a two-fold withering: one in iudgement, the other in practice. That in <hi>iudgement</hi> is two-fold: either totall, or partiall. <hi>Totall:</hi> when a man departs from the whole doctrine, as they that turne from the truth of Christ, and sup vp the whole filth of Antichrist. <hi>Partiall:</hi> when a man holds most truthes, but departs from the sincerity of it. And this ouerturnes many Protestants, who will neither be Papists, nor yet sincere Protestants, but so farre iudge Religion woorth holding, as they can gaine by it.</p>
            <p>Withering in <hi>practice,</hi> is either in profession, or in action. Thou mayest hold the profession of Religion, and yet by persisting in wicked manners, manifest, thou acknowledgest not Christ thy Lord, and that thy selfe art not of the truth. Doe wee thinke <hi>Demas</hi> cast off the whole profession of Religion, when hee forsooke the truth, and exchanged it for the world? Or did the Galatians turne Gentiles, and quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the profession of Christ, when they turned to another Gospell? Or did the Pharises, or such as sinne the sinne against the holy Ghost, wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the profession of Religion?

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Get sound iudgement, to discerne the truth from errour. And this is obtained in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Ministerie. If wee would <hi>not quench the Spirit,</hi> we must <hi>not despise prophecie.</hi>

Eph. 2.20.</note> If we would not fall, we must be grounded on the <hi>foundation of the Prophets and Apostles:</hi> by priuate reading, meditating, and conferring of the Scriptures, which notably begets and confirmes soundnesse of iudgement: And by prayer, which obtaines the Spirit, who is called <hi>the Spirit of iudgement.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa. 4.4.</note> The Lampe failes without oyle: And they that forsake the Assemblies, shal finde their light of iudgement and vnderstanding to grow dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer daily, till they be wholly put out.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Sound perswasion of the truth thou professest: that thou mayest not please thy selfe that thou hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest the truth from the mouth of the Preacher, or hast it in thy Bible at home, no nor content thy selfe that thou hast it in thy mouth or discourse, but that thou hast the experience of it in thine heart. How doth experimentall knowledge fixe it selfe in the soule? Let a man once taste the sweetnesse of Christ and his merits, he can neuer be a Papist in the point of merit, but he will detest his own works as drosse &amp; dung in comparison. Let a man once come to the experience of Gods fauour and loue through his Christ, it will be stronger then death, no water can quench it: hee shall not hang in a doubtfull suspence of his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or feare finall falling away; hee shall be farre from wauering, and much more from withering in these points. Let a man once get experience of the

sweetnesse of godly life, of Gods blessing accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it, of inward peace, and tranquillity of minde, of safety vnder the wing of God, and the many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges which goe with the carefull watch ouer the heart and life: This man shall not easily fall from his fruitfulnesse, nor be drawne to such sinnes as blast and ouerturne others by the rootes, and that sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly. Whereas hee that holdes his Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Prince holdes it, will runne with the time, and swimme with the streame; the times and winds are not more mutable than he: let the times change but a little, his Religion is withered and gone. Or if men hold holy Doctrines onely swimming in the braine, and attaine vnderstanding rather to furnish their discourse, than to guide their course; and want the experience of God, the sence of faith, the breath and motions of heauenly life, in the seate of life, that is, their hearts and soules; they shall easily bid truth farewell, if with conuenience they cannot hold it in their iudgement, or hold it forth in their practice.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

Experience tells vs, that wee may truly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> say of some great Professors, as Christ said of the figtree, <hi>How soone are they withered,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Hauing spoken of the withering of the seede in this bad ground, wee come now to the causes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as they are set downe by the Euangelists: and first to the inward, and positiue cause, <hi>stoninesse</hi> or <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> It fell among <hi>stones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence obserue, that <hi>the seed of Gods Word brings forth no sauing fruite out of an hard heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct. Seed of the Word not fruitfull to saluation in an hard heart.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>or stony ground.</hi> Now when I speak of an hard heart, I meane not euery heart that hath some hardnesse in it: for so hath euery mans heart, euen the most softened: but there is a threefold hardnesse of heart: 1. Totall and finall, as in the wicked and Reprobate. 2. Totall
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18777:65"/>
and temporary, as in one elect, but not yet called. 3. Partiall and temporary as in all the Elect, now conuerted. In the two former, because there is raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardnes, the seed of Gods Word is fruitlesse, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse by preparing one to condemnation, the other to conuersion. In the last it is fruitfull to saluation: where the worke of it is, daily to abate and mollifie the remaining hardnesse.</p>
            <p>Now for proofe of the poynt: Psalm. 95.10. The Iewes being <hi>hardened in heart, would not know his wayes.</hi> Zech. 7.11. They refused to hearken, stopped the eare, pulled away the shoulder, and <hi>made their hearts as an Adamant.</hi> Ier. 7.25. The Lord complaines, that euer since the day hee brought them out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, he sent all his Prophets, rising early, but they would not heare, nor encline their eare, but <hi>hardened their necke,</hi> and did worse than their fathers. Ezec. 3.7. The house of Israel will not obey thee, for they will not obey me: the reason followes, The house of Israel are <hi>impudent and stif-hearted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reasons hereof arise out of the similitude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Stones resist the stroke, and can endure a great strength of strokes before they will bee broken: so the stony heart resists the stroke of the Word: the hammer of the Law, with all the strength and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of its iudgements and curses, doe not a whit pierce it: as the <hi>Leuiathan</hi> described by <hi>Iob,</hi> chap. 41.15. his <hi>heart is as the nether milstone,</hi> and he accounts iron as straw: the stones of the sling are as stubble to him: he laughes at the shaking of the speare: he will not rise for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sword, or the speare, or the dart, ver. 17, 18. A notable resemblance of a wicked hard-hearted

man, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for example; hee heard the Word,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tot verba, tot verbera nihil profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>êre Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoni.</hi>
               </note> saw the miracles, and felt the mighty hand of God; but at the end of euery plague, the foote was, <hi>But Pharaoh hardened his heart, and would not let the people goe.</hi> Of the same inuincible hardnesse were <hi>Steuens</hi> aduersaries, Act. 7.51. <hi>Ye stif-necked and vncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of hearts, and eares, ye haue alwayes resisted the holy Ghost:</hi> as your fathers did, so doe you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To bring forth fruits of grace and saluation, the ground must be <hi>soft,</hi> and the soyle must bee mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for the seed. But what way can you make a stone soft? Let the Sunne shine, or the raine fall on it, yea cast it into oyle, it is a stone still. So the heart abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hard, no meanes can mellow or soften it: the comfortable heat and light of Gods gracious Spirit, which changeth other hearts, changeth not this: the raines of the Word, and dewes from heauen conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually distilled, soften it not: the oyle of gladnesse, or of Gods bountifulnesse, which leads others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, mollifies it not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Vnto fruitfulnesse in Grace is necessarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a <hi>change</hi> and conuersion in the ground of the heart. For all hearts naturally are so stony, as no fruit can be expected, no more than from an vnsteared ground. And therefore as the ground must first bee rent vp with the Plough, to soften the earth, and then laid euen by the Harrow and Rollers: So the ground of the heart must bee rent vp, and cut with the Plough of Gods Law, and laid euen againe by the Doctrine of the Gospell, before fruits of grace can be produced. Act. 2.37. The first preparation to fruits in those Conuerts, was the piercing and <hi>prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18777:66"/>
of their hearts.</hi> But how can you cut a stone, what compunction can you worke in it? how can you pricke and pierce it, while the natiue hardnesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines? Hence the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> 5.3. expressely makes this hardnesse of heart the maine let and hinderer of this conuersion and change, which is the first thing in this fruitfulnesse: <hi>They haue made their faces harder than a stone, and haue refused to returne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Vnto fruits of grace is necessarily required <hi>moisture</hi> of grace, as to the fruits of earth, moisture in the earth. But what moisture is in a stone? A stone indeed may be moyst on the outside, in moyst wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The walls and Marbles seeme to weepe, and drops stand on them in rainy seasons: not because moisture is in them, but moisture offers it selfe vnto them, but they hold it not, so as they remaine as hard and dry within as euer before. So with this stony heart, where hardnes of heart raigneth, no moisture of Grace, no relenting, or giuing within. Indeed in foule weather, when the storme of God is risen, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible hard heart, as hard as a Marble, may seeme soft: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> yeelds, and giues againe on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side. You may see drops of water standing in <hi>Esaus</hi> eyes, who wept when the blessing was gone. <hi>Iudas</hi> seemes moystened with repentance. <hi>Balaam</hi> melts a little, and wisheth to die well. <hi>Foelix</hi> moulders a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and trembles.</p>
            <p>But we must distinguish this from sound moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of grace. 1. These be flashes, and sudden mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and as seldome as the weeping of walls. 2. This moysture comes not from an heart softened, but
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18777:66"/>
from slauish feare, or present smart; euen from the present disposition of the weather, from without. 3. So soone as faire weather comes againe, the stones are as dry as euer they were: so these returne to their former lusts so soone as the foule weather is ouer; as <hi>Pharaoh, Foelix, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Doest thou heare the Word preached, without any great fruit? Then lay the blame where indeed it is. Some impute it to the difficulty of the Word. Others to the fault of the Minister, who pleaseth them not, either in the matter or manner. But it were far more commendable for thee to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute thy vnprofitablenesse to the hardnesse of thine owne heart, and so take thy sinne home to thy selfe: so did the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.14. when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that the Law of God was not so efficacious to him as he desired, he accused not the Law, but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned it to be spirituall, but himselfe as sold vnder sinne: He condemned himselfe, not the Word: so doe thou; for the Gospell is <hi>the power of God</hi> to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>it is spirit and life,</hi> and <hi>mighty in operation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.16. Heb. 4.12.</note> If it worke not so mightily on thy hart, then see thy hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, bewaile it, let godly sorrow and griefe,<note place="margin">

               </note> daily dropping, make this stone hollow, till it haue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. That of the Apostle, Hebr. 3.7. To day if ye will heare his voyce, <hi>harden not your hearts.</hi> All the seed cast vpon an hard heart, is lost, as if a man should sowe on a rocke, where is no place for root or moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture. Beware of an hard heart: there is no curse to that, almost no sinne to that. Better that all thy field were couered ouer with stones, than thy hart should.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18777:67"/>
Nay, it were better for thee to be a dead stone, than a liuing stone.</p>
            <p>Now the markes to know an hard heart, are these:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Six markes to know an hard heart by.</hi>
               </note>1. When Gods Word makes no impression, or gets not within the heart, to renew or reforme the man: though sometimes it may scratch the outside, and restraine him. When the Law is threatened, hee either blesseth himselfe, or turneth his eare from it, or applies it to others, not himselfe. And the Gospell enters not, because the Law hath not pierced, nor been as a needle to make way. Let all the mercies of the Gospell be shewed to the wicked, he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, nor learne to doe well.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neglect, or light ouer-passing the workes of Gods Mercy or Iustice, vpon himselfe or others. For <hi>mercies:</hi> when the <hi>goodnesse of God leades him not to repentance,</hi> Rom. 2.4, 5. Our Lord makes this a cause, euen in his owne Disciples, in whom the sin raigned not, that they forgat the matter of the loaues, <hi>because their hearts were hardened,</hi> Mark. 6.52. For the <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of God: his workes of Iustice doe moue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than Mercies, but nothing to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">Exod. 9.27</note> 
               <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when iudgement puts him to a plunge, could say, <hi>I haue sinned:</hi> here is a little scratch on his heart as on a Stethy, but the hardnes recoyles the stroke that should breake the heart to pieces: so as after all the strokes of God, there is no reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Vnfeelingnesse of hardnesse, and vnwillingnes to feele it: no mislike of it, no desire to vnderstand the danger of it: When men desire to sit quiet in sin,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18777:67"/>
and nothing so offends them, as to heare their sinne disgraced; when they <hi>turne their backes, and stop their eares,</hi> Zech. 7.11. Being as loth to bee drawne to a Sermon powerfull against sinne, as Israel to come neere the Mountaine. Whereas a soft heart is most sensible of much hardnesse in it, and counts no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then comparable thereto.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For the maintaining their estate, credit, and fauour in the world, or their lusts and pleasures, to oppose and dislike such Doctrines, courses, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as haue the Word on their sides. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> must not seeme to be ouercome by such meane people: and therefore, seeing euidently the Lord stand for them, he obdured himselfe. The Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, conuinced in their conscience of the truth of Christs Doctrine, and the innocency of his person, did out of hardnesse of heart euer oppose both his Doctrine and Person; because they must maintaine their credit in the world, and vphold their pompe and glory against him: though hee had truth, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and innocency on his side. The like of all har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened persecutors of the poore Saints.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Out of resolution of following a mans owne present course, whatsoeuer perswasions or Doctrines he heareth to the contrary, to fly occasions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies which might touch or worke vpon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Some cannot abide to heare strict Preachers that allow them no vnlawfull liberty, no not affoord them a looke on the forbidden fruit. Others cannot endure the society of a faithfull friend, that will truly tell them of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. No such string must be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This argues a soule or soyle settled in hardnesse.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:18777:68"/>6. Habits, and customable sins, which make the heart as a path-way. A soft heart smites it selfe for once sinning, and for small sinning. <hi>Dauids</hi> heart smote him for cutting off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment: How would it haue smote him for cutting off his head? But custome of sinne hardeneth exceedingly, Heb. 3.13. Take heede lest any be <hi>hardened through the deceitfulnes of sin.</hi> And by hindring repentance, it holds men in the trade of sinne: <hi>Hardnesse,</hi> and the heart that <hi>cannot repent,</hi> are ioyned together, Rom. 2.5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. As euer thou wouldest heare the Word to saluation, labour for a soft and melting heart, such as good <hi>Iosias</hi> had, whose soule melted to heare the words of the Law read. The greatest blessing heere below, is an heart flexible, and bowed to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God.</p>
            <p>And hereunto consider these Motiues: 1. That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it is a note of a child of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Motiues to labour for soft hearts.</hi>
               </note> to haue his natiue hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse mollified, and his naturall stubbornnesse cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and altered by the Spirit of sanctification, 2. Thes. 2.13. 2. It is one branch of Gods Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which he ratifieth to the Elect, and by which he begins his mercy, <hi>I will put a new Spirit within their bowels, I will take away the stony heart, and giue them an heart of flesh,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. 3. Neuer canst thou bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> framed to grace, no fashion of the Word can be seene on thee, till thou attaine a soft heart. You cannot cast a stone in a mold as you can metall, because it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not melt. 4. If thou bring an hard heart, the very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Word (a meanes of softening others) shall by thy malice be peruerted to thy further hardening. The
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18777:68"/>
same Sunne that softeneth waxe, hardeneth clay.</p>
            <p>Therefore vse all good meanes to get thee a soft heart. One is, the Word of God: the Law,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Meanes of a soft hart.</hi>
               </note> which is as a Plough to breake vp our fallow grounds; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Gospell, which is as the warme Sunne to thaw our hard earth. Be diligent in hearing, and reading: the continuall drops of this raine, by often falling, pierce the stone of the heart, and breake it. 2. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other meanes is, in outward prosperity to meditate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> much and often on our inward misery. For ease, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and prosperity harden the heart. Deut 32.15. and chap. 9.6, 7. <hi>Thou art a stiffe-necked people: remember, and forget not, how thou prouokedst the Lord.</hi> A third is, in time of affliction to set in seriously with God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> who now intends the softening of our hearts. Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply vnto thy selfe the afflictions not of thy selfe onely, but of others. See Gods displeasure in the cause of them, which is thine owne sinne. Be not as <hi>Esau,</hi> that lift vp his voice and wept, but still kept reuenge within: but put away a <hi>froward heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 101 4</note> giue sinne a bill of diuorce, hate it, and put it away. Fourthly, looke much and often vpon the death of Iesus Christ, and apply it to thy owne soule.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Incidit gemmas, at non incidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ipse: Hircino tantum sanguine mollis erit.</hi>
               </note> Goats <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> blood warme (they say) softeneth the Adamant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put in it. Get this Adamantine heart of thine broken, by serious application of Christs death to thy owne soule. The Gospell shewes sinne in a more ougly face, than the Law can: shewing it to bee the speare that went to Christs heart: and that God is now offended by me,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> whom he vouchsafeth in Christ to call a sonne. Lastly, pray often, yea continually, that the Lord would giue thee a soft heart, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:18777:69"/>
may be fashioned by the Word, to his owne liking and likenesse. Depend vpon the promise, Ezek. 36.26. And praise him, if thou hast receiued such a soft and sanctified heart, wherein the seede of Gods Word shall rise vp with abundant increase of grace heere, and of glory hereafter.
<q>Because they haue no roots.</q>]</p>
            <p>HAuing spoken of the inward <hi>positiue</hi> cause, why the seed (falling on this stony ground) withered, which was stoninesse, or hardnesse: now wee are to proceed to the inward <hi>priuatiue</hi> causes, both heere, and in the other Euangelists: namely, want of
<list>
                  <item>Moystnesse:</item>
                  <item>Earth:</item>
                  <item>Roots.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now all these proceede from the former hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. For the heart being rocky and stony vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, it cannot affoord either earth, or roots, or moysture to the seed. Which wee must not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, as if there were no earth, or roots, or moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture: (For wee haue seene this ground bring forth much hopefull fruit, which without all these it could not.<note place="margin">Mark. 4.5.</note>) But as <hi>Marke</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it had not <hi>much earth,</hi> but as a rocke couered with a little crust of earth aboue, all stones below. It wanted <hi>depth of earth,</hi> Mark. 4.5. So it had no roots, that is, <hi>no deepe roots,</hi> no roots to feede the stalke and blade that was come, no roots which could saue it from withering in time of heate. This is implied by all the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, who say, <hi>Because it wanted roots,</hi> it lasted but a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18777:69"/>
while. Againe, for the same reason it <hi>wanted moysture,</hi> that is, sufficient moysture. For the property of sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ground is, 1. To be hot and dry, and so drinkes vp moysture apace. 2. It suffers not the moysture to descend deepe, so as the externall heate soone drawes it and licks it vp.</p>
            <p>Hence note what it is that makes many goodly Professors fall short of saluation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct. The cause why many goodly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours fall short of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi>
               </note> after they haue gone a long time in a glorious profession: to wit, want of sufficient earth, roots, and moysture.</p>
            <p>By <hi>sufficient earth,</hi> I vnderstand a particular and distinct knowledge of the Word, and of their owne part in it. For they content themselues with a kinde of generall knowledge, and agree to it in their vnderstanding, that it is the Word of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that saluation is by these glad tidings, &amp;c. and reioyce in the taste of some sweetnesse of it: But they giue it not entrance enough, by applying their minde vnto it, nor receiue it as a distinct direction in all things, nor will trouble themselues with carefull examination of their whole way by it, and much lesse with application of the signes of faith toward God, or of Gods fauour toward themselues: And so are iustly guilty of their owne withering, for want of sufficient earth. All their graces at length become like seeds sowne on the top of a rocke, which sprout suddenly, but wanting <hi>depth of earth</hi> to feede them, wither as certainly.</p>
            <p>By <hi>rooting</hi> here I vnderstand stability, certainty, and sincerity of faith and other graces, which these Hearers want. For although there bee some earth on the top, yet it is but shallow: and the shallower the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18777:70"/>
root lies, though the blade may sprout more speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet want of depth makes root, and blade, and all faile together. So although there be some faith, and ioy for a time, with some other comely graces, yet are they superficiall, they giue not their whole hearts to the Word, there is no sincerity in the bottome, and consequently, no rooting, no stability. Their care is more for the blade, than for the root which beares it. Their vnsettled faith is set, not in sound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward apprehension, but on outward causes, which being changeable, so is their faith; themselues also carried about with euery waue of doctrine, and with wheeling of times, and at last led away with the sins of the times, of their callings, or of their owne hearts.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>former</hi> is a sound supply of sauing grace, which continually feedeth and cherisheth the root. For as the seed in the earth is brought to fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by continuall showres: so is the seed of grace in the heart, by continued and renewed acts of the Spirit: whose graces are compared to water, and said to be shed on vs, in regard 1. of mollification, 2. of ablution, 3. of refrigeration, and 4. of fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Now this sound supply of grace these Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers want, and iustly, though they want not all moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture: but they goe not to the fountaine, they draw from some spouts, or some streames, which are dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp in the summer heate: Whereas, were they by faith carried to the Fountaine it selfe, Iesus Christ, their waters would be indeficient, and could not be
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18777:70"/>
exhausted: for these waters would be a Fountaine in the belly, still springing vp to eternall life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The latter,</hi> namely, the moisture of <hi>compunction,</hi> is sound sorrow for sin, and the sound exercise of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.<note place="margin">Psal. 6.6.</note> The Saints vsed to <hi>water their couch</hi> with these waters of teares and repentance. Now these Hearers want not all sorrow for sinne, nor want not something like it: but, they neuer carried this water, nor admitted this moistnesse deepe enough: the hardnesse of the rocke, hindred the descent of these waters to the bottome: it was too much paines to afflict themselues seriously: their teares were soone dried vp, their sorrow slight, and themselues neuer truly humbled: And therefore faile, and come to nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> It is no certaine marke of a childe of God, willingly to heare Sermons, nor to delight in the hearing, nor to receiue the doctrine with ioy, no nor in many things commendably to practise for a time.

If thou giuest thy selfe to be taught by the Spirit of God, and leanest not to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thine owne counsels. For <hi>flesh and blood cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale this wisedome,</hi> but the Spirit of God, Mat. 16.17. If thou wilt not beleeue or receiue any doctrine, or opinion, but what the Spirit out of the Word teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, now thou hast sauing knowledge: Carnall and deceitfull knowledge is alway measured by the scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of reason, of humane lawes and wisedome, of praise and profit.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:18777:71"/>2. If thy knowledge be not onely speculatiue, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> directiue, leading not onely to vnderstand, but to vndertake thine owne way: when it is not onely a light in it selfe, but a Lanthorne to thy feete, and as a Sunne constantly shining for thy direction. Now know the soundnesse of it, if thou suffer it to leade thee against sense, reason, custome, and allow it for thy guide in the smallest things as well as in great, in secret as well as open.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If thy knowledge lye deepe, as hauing depth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of earth, not only lying in the head, or on the tongue, but in the heart. And therefore (Ierem. 31.34.) it is said to be <hi>written in the heart and bowels.</hi> Pro. 4.5. <hi>Let thy heart hold fast my words.</hi> And easily may a man know, if his heart hold this knowledge, by the change it will worke there. And that is the fourth note: thus.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Know sound and sauing knowledge by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> especially three. First, whereas generall and confused knowledge puffeth vp, and makes a man proud, this makes him more humble, by leading in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the further sight of God, and of himselfe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas an hypocrites knowledge leaues him as earthly as it found him, this changeth the man into it selfe, and makes him heauenly-minded, and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the things of God, as it selfe is from heauen, and from God; Hee is <hi>transformed into the same image,</hi> 2. Cor. 3.18. as meate is turned into the substance of him that eateth. Thirdly, whereas an hypocrites knowledge may worke some ioy, it seldome workes loue of God, feare of God, or trust in him. But this changeth all affections. It loues the Word as well
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18777:72"/>
as ioy. The feare of God is the beginning of this wisedome. And this knowledge carries the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all hypocrites in the affection of ioy in it, as the chiefest and most desireable good.</p>
            <p>Now get this knowledge, &amp; thou hast gotten depth of earth. This is constant, settled against all contrary blasts. This knowledge shall grow vp, and haue much assurance, when the frothy &amp; superficiall knowledge of hypocrites shal vanish as dew in the Sun, or smoke in the winde. Get this light, &amp; it shall be as the Star to the Wise men, to bring thee to Christ: as the clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and fiery Pillar to the Israelites, to bring thee to <hi>Canaan:</hi> as the lightsome Lamps to the wise Virgins, to bring thee into the Bridegroomes chamber.</p>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> How may I know my selfe soundly rooted in the gift of faith?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By fiue notable effects of it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>The notes and signes of it.</hi> 5.</note>1. Sound affection to Iesus Christ, prizing him aboue all the world, and counting all but dung in comparison: in so much as our life is not deare vnto vs, but (as <hi>Paul</hi>) wee dare dye for him. And this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is alway ioyned with affiance in Christ, or holding fast our assurance by him. For as God will still owne his people, euen <hi>in the furnace,</hi> in the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

trouble, so must they owne him, Zech. 13. vlt. yea when Christ may seeme to withdraw, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them, as the woman of Canaan. <hi>Abraham</hi> rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the naked promise, and beleeued <hi>aboue hope,</hi> Rom. 4. so must we: not hasting to euill meanes in the want of good, Esa. 28.16. <hi>He that beleeueth, shall not make haste.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If it purge and renue the heart from all kinde of sinnes, especially secret and inward. Till faith come, the heart is full of raigning guile, and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and hollownesse cannot hold out:<note place="margin">Act. 15 9.</note> but <hi>faith purifieth</hi> and garnisheth the heart as a Temple. So faith and inward purity grow together.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it keepe the heart humble, and hungring. For it is a light in the bowels, causing a man daily to see his sinne more cleerly, and to seeke pardon for it in Christ, casting it out daily by confession and godly sorrow: and still it hungers after righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse insatiably.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If it be ioyned with good conscience. These two goe vndiuided. Now a good conscience, being perswaded of Gods loue in Christ, first excuseth the man, that his sinnes are pardoned; and then in way of thankfulnes, hath <hi>respect to all the Commandements,</hi>

            <p n="5">5. If it be a shield enabling thee to withstand the tentations of Satan, and such as runne with thy owne naturall inclinations, now it is well grounded. That faith which shall stoutly withstand all sinne in time of prosperity, shall preuaile mightily against

all troubles in time of triall. But if thy faith giue thee vp to bee led away to vanity, or any ordinary preuailing sinne, now in the time of peace, suspect it, trust it not for time of triall. Such as fall from the Religion of God, when times of change come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led away either by the seduction of deceiuers, or persecution of Tyrants, are such as shall finde by examination, that the faith they pretended, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of power against some knowne sinne, and so was neuer strongly rooted in Christ.</p>
            <p>This faith, thus qualified, is strongly rooted. Cast it into the fire, it will come forth <hi>purer than gold,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.7. And when the best faith of hypocrites (forsaken of carnall helps, on which it stayed it selfe) shall proue drosse, and be consumed, this faith shall set the Christian on a rocke, safe in the middest of stormes, and waues of aduersity.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If policy or feare hinder thee not from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the profession of the truth by day.

pitty thy selfe, it shall not bee so vnto thee.</hi> Carnall friends easily perswade a man not to bee too busie. The feare of a chaine, or the wrath of superiours, quite blast it. 2. If by these cold and pinching <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> times thou abate not thy affection or loue to God, his Word, and his children. 3. If thou gettest cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> yea and aduantage by opposition: as a strong tree is stronglier rooted for shaking winds. Whereof we haue an example, Ierem. 36.32. When the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane King had burnt the Booke, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> caused the same to be written againe <hi>with many moe words.</hi> The more euill men oppose holy Doctrine, concerning holy life, and the worship of God, for matter, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, time, &amp;c. the more godly men will iustifie and maintaine it.</p>
            <p>This confession is an acceptable thing to Iesus Christ, and honourable: and Christ lookes for it, Math. 9.28. saying to the two blind men, <hi>Doe you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that I can doe it?</hi> Not that hee was ignorant of their faith: but, for them that were present, he would haue them confesse him: plainly shewing, that it is not enough to beleeue with the heart, but confession also must bee made with the mouth, and practice in the life. This is the fruit, by which wee know the roots of faith, though vnder ground.</p>
            <p>So much for sound <hi>roots,</hi> to stand by.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> thing for continuance in fruits,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>First, that of compunction, or humiliation. Not a scratch of the heart as with a pin, but a thorow breaking of it with the hammer of the Law, and piercing it as with a sword. And good reason: for,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18777:75"/>
1. The deeper the Well, the purer the water, and the more plentifull: so in deepe sorrow for sinne: whereas a slight sorrow, a sigh and away, is like an hasty raine, a little moystening the top, but soone dryed away. 2. Deepe sorrow stickes by the soule, and keepes it soft, and supple, and in a continuall fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for the practice of piety: whereas a slight sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row leaues it as dry, as hard, and as barren as before. 3. The water of true repentance is like a Spring-water that runs continually; not in publike onely, but in the priuate closet: the Fountaine issues still, and euery godly man mournes <hi>apart.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zech. 12.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This get vnto thee, 1. To be a note of godlinesse. A godly man shall still finde his heart a continuall fountaine of sinne, and therefore cannot but with <hi>Ieremie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 9.1.</note> wish his <hi>head a fountaine of teares.</hi> 2. If thou wouldest lay vp grace safe, lay it in a broken heart: a broken and humble heart will endure the brunt, where an vnmortified and proud professor will start backe at the mention of trouble. One vseth this comparison: Lay an egge, or a chesnut whole in the fire, when the fire begins to seaze on him, he flies and leapes backe: but breake them, or cracke them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they abide the fire till they be dressed. The same may be said of an heart not soundly broken, nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by sound humiliation.</p>
            <p>Now for thy sound humbling, behold the issue of thy corruption euer running, and let the issues of godly griefe runne as fast, as often.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Thou must be transplanted out of the dry and barren heath and wildernesse of this world, and become a member of the Church. For these wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters runne from vnder the Sanctuary. The fountaine is opened to the house of <hi>Iudah</hi> &amp; Ierusalem; which were types of the Church. This moysture is (as wee heard) sometime called <hi>milke,</hi> feeding the babes of Christ that hang on the brests of the Church: and sometimes wine, (<hi>Come buy wine and milke,</hi> saith our Sauiour, Esa. 55.1.) which is onely to bee had in Gods Vineyard, not in the Waste or Forrest of the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thou shalt not want moysture, if thou want not thirst and desire. The woman at the Well, (Ioh. 4.) wanted this Water, because shee had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, or desire after it. But the promise is, no sooner to thirst, than bee refreshed and satisfied, Math. 5.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thou must haue right to the Fountaine of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18777:76"/>
Water, which is Christ himselfe, in whom dwelleth all fulnesse,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.16.</note> and <hi>of his fulnesse thou must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue grace for grace.</hi> Members can want no life or sence, so long as the head is liuing: neither can riuers be empty, if the fountaine be not dry. He that drinks of this Water, shall neuer thirst more.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thou must prouide a Bucket to draw from this Fountaine.

            <p>Heere are two things to be considered:

            </p>
            <p>For the former. Persecution properly is a part of the Churches affliction, because of the Word. In which description wee haue it distinguished from
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18777:77"/>
other afflictions and sufferings: 1. In the kinde, 2. In the subiect, 3. In the causes. For these are not common troubles with other men in the World, which attend common nature, or common occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as sicknesse, pouerty, paine, reproach, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon corrections of sinnes: But proper and peculiar troubles, befalling only the members of the Church, either in truth, or in appearance: and that not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other cause then the Word, as here our Sauiour expresseth; or for righteousnesse sake, or for the Name of Christ, and well-doing: So as when either for profession of the Word of God (suppose, no more) or for confession and defence of it and such courses agree to it, or for the practice of it in conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, and keeping conscionably to the rules of it, a man is reproached, wronged, indures losse, pouerty, restraint, &amp;c. this is properly persecution.</p>

And lest weapons should be wanting in this warre against the Godly, the world is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels armorie, which by faire and foule, by promises and threats, loue and hatred, and a thousand wayes else, assaults the graces of the Godly, so as (<hi>if it were possible</hi>) the very Elect should be seduced.<note place="margin">Mat. 24.24</note>

In the eighth of <hi>Daniel,</hi> ver. 13. there is a Prophecie of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> that <hi>little horne,</hi> who cast downe some of the Host of heauen, and the Starres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and troad them vnder his feet, and extolled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe against the Prince of the Host, and tooke away the daily sacrifice, and cast downe the place of his Sanctuary, and cast the truth to the ground.

He was borne in an obscure place, liued despised among his owne, a man of such sorrowes as neuer was any sorrow like his; his pouerty such, as he had not water to put in his head, not a cottage to put his head in; his death painefull, shamefull, accursed.

Dreame not of a Religion pleasant to flesh, if we will be truly religious: for this is to deceiue our selues: but make account of hatred and trouble in the world, if thou meanest to keepe the Word. For the Church being seated in the world, which is the Kingdome of Satan, it cannot be other then a very AEgypt or Edom to the Israel of God; where that hellish <hi>Pharaoh</hi> raiseth all his power to pursue vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the red Sea of terrors, temptations, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand deadly dangers on euery side, if we indeed set forth to Canaan.

If ye be railed on <hi>for the Name of Christ,</hi> blessed are ye; for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth on you, and is glorified by you. Secondly, behold <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Christ a partner and companion in thy suffering. In all thy troubles he is troubled. Hence it is called <hi>the reproch of Christ.</hi> Thou helpest Christ to beare his Crosse, and he helpes thee.

Thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this fire of persecution may seeme to burne thee vp, but shall not consume thee, but onely purge and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thee.

From their fellowship and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints: for as they were neuer knit by faith vnto the Head, so were they neuer by loue to the members: nor are they further members of this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, than a woodden legge, which is no member but in appearance: For, <hi>Had they been of vs,</hi> (saith <hi>Iohn) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> they had continued with vs,</hi> 1.

So as persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes sound and vnsound fly off, but with great difference.

               <note place="margin">3</note>3. They are <hi>offended at the Word,</hi> (saith the Text) and so goe away: Math. 13.21. <hi>by and by hee is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:</hi> Two wayes: 1. When the Word puts them to this choyce, whether they will leaue Christ, or their temporals; whether they will forgoe their goods, liberty, friends, and life, or forgoe Christ. This choyce offended the young man, who rather than hee will part with his possessions, bids Christ farewell. This choyce offended the false apostles, Gal. 6.12. who would confound Law and Gospell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because they would not suffer persecution for the Crosse of Christ. This choyce offended many forward Professors in the dayes of King Edward the sixth, who in the dayes of Queene <hi>Mary</hi> were <hi>by and by offended,</hi> and fell off. And if times should turne, and this choyce should offer it selfe vpon many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ones, experience of former times sheweth plaine enough, what they would doe. They that the day before, while Christ rides in triumph, cry <hi>Hosan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Hosanna:</hi> the next day after, when hee is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, will cry, <hi>Crucifige, crucifige:</hi> so immediately are they offended. Persecution and affliction for the Gospell, is like the worme that smote <hi>Ionas</hi> his flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Gourd, and that so suddenly will put but a little time betweene their freshnesse and fading. 2. When the Doctrine pursues them within, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes them home to their consciences, and seekes to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:18777:82"/>
set in the light their inward corruptions, presently these glorious Professours are <hi>offended,</hi> Ioh. 6.60. When Christ powerfully taught the Iewes, that hee was the Bread which came from heauen, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ate of him, and themselues must feed on him to eternall life: this was an <hi>hard saying:</hi> What, are they all this while out of the way to heauen, vnlesse hee bring them in? Now they murmure, from thence goe to opposition, and from thence goe quite away, and refuse to heare him longer. Euen so not a few, that boast sometimes of their faith and loue to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; of their settlednesse and resolution to die with Christ, rather than denie him; of their reuerence and good affection to his Ministers: Let the Gospell begin to meddle with their <hi>Herodias,</hi> or bosome sin; let it call them from seruice of the world, and pull them from their lusts; let it be busie with their vsury, their pride, wantonnesse, malice; let it seeke to pull them from their disordered customes, their vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pleasures, their profane courses; let it lay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the yokes of Christ vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> professed Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; let it discouer to them their inside, and leade them to that filthy sinke which is within, and stirre a little in that mud: A wonder it is to see how many suddenly fall off by degrees; Now they are angry at the Word, and he is the greatest enemy that t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s them the truth: Now they distaste the Word, then picke quarrels, then begin to shake it off, and at last openly to resist it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Those must needs fall off, who neuer receiued the Word purely, for it selfe,<note place="margin">4</note> but for other sinister respects; as either of glory and praise, if they see the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:18777:83"/>
profession in credit; or for profit, so long as they may gather with Christ, and be gainers by him: they would stand on Mount Tabor with Christ, and while hee is in his glory,<note place="margin">Mat. 17.4.</note> 
               <hi>Oh it is good being heere:</hi> but are loth to goe with him to Mount Caluary. Or they receiue it onely so farre as may stand with their ease, delicacy, and slothfulnesse, but will put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to no hardnesse at all. Now all these that loue themselues better than their Religion, must needs faile when the ends faile, that put them on their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. He that professeth for praise of men, when the world being inconstant withdrawes her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause, he is gone: Gods Word shall haue no further credit with him, then it hath from men. If <hi>Demas</hi> for loue of profit shall professe, the loue of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent world shall cause his Apostasie, 2. Tim. 4.10. If they of Asia receiue <hi>Paul,</hi> onely because they may with ease and safety doe it, they shall turne away from <hi>Paul</hi> when he is in prison. And he that receiues a Religion without further ground then is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall custome of the world; (namely, to bee of that Religion, which the King and Parliament is of:) let this man goe neuer so farre, yet hee shall fall off, and his fall shall be great.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. See hereby the nature and end of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: it tries who are sound, and puts a difference betweene such, as peaceable and calme estate can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not distinguish. In a faire and calme day, Apples and Peares on a tree seeme all sound and good; but a blustering storme or tempest makes difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene those that are sound, and such as for want of moysture fall off: iust so it is in the stormes of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:18777:83"/>
Church. Persecution is like a mighty winde, which discerneth betweene wheat and chaffe, that before lay quiet together in the same floore: it shakes not the wheat, but blowes away the chaffe. And as the furnace consumes the drosse, but refines the gold; so doth the furnace of affliction. We are now all shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled together, the hypocrite with the sincere-hearted Christian: but (to end this poynt with our Sauiours instance) as the heate of the Sunne and summer dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couers barren, dry, and stony soyle, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good ground: so the scorching beames of persecution shall disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer barren, husky, and empty hypocrites, from good and fruitfull Hearers. And thou art that indeed thou art in triall. A man in peace may personate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise himselfe,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 14.2</note> as <hi>Ieroboams wife</hi> going to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, &amp; seeme another; but affliction for the Word will vncase him. <hi>Peter</hi> was not the man in triall hee vaunted to be when he would dye with Christ. And the winter-weather of affliction for the Gospell will discouer, who be the Swallowes that will take their summer in the Church, but in the winter of it take them to their wings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Let vs not take offence, when wee see for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Professors offended at Christ, and shrinke in triall; but make account, that some such must forsake vs. For all are not of the Church that are in the Church: Some are tyed onely by a thred of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall profession, to the members, that are not vnited to the Head by the band of faith: these must fall off and <hi>wither.</hi> Let <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> two great lights, fall away &amp; lose their shine in the firmament of the Church, yet <hi>the foundation of God abideth sure.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.19.</note>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:18777:84"/>
And, if we see some shrinke before the wetting, and in dayes of peace and protection of the Gospell white-liuer'd, and ready to deny their profession at the breath of a silly Damosell: that the frowne of a Superiour, a word of reproch, a feare of change, shakes off their leafie profession: let vs not maruell, if many of them would deny Christ in triall, rather than dye with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Let him that standeth, take heede lest hee fall. And the rather, because, 1. Our nature is prone to defection, or backsliding: 2. Neuer was there more defection, either in Doctrine or manners, then at this day: 3. When wee see others slide backe, we are too soone moued and offended. So as the best need continuall exhortation and admonition, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware they fall not away from the grace of God. Else would not our Lord haue still beaten on this poynt with his Disciples, who for all his warning of them, when it came to the poynt, forsooke him and fled.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>meanes</hi> to vphold vs in tryall from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, are these:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Meditate much and often of such Scriptures as foretell persecution for the Name of Christ:<note place="margin">7. <hi>Meanes to vphold vs in triall.</hi>
               </note> and call to minde the examples of such as haue valiantly endured the losse of temporals, and ioyfully suffered the spoyling of their goods, the forgoing of liberty and life for Christ, &amp;c. Especially reade diligently the whole 11. Chapter to the Hebrewes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Cast the costs of thy profession: Thinke it not enough to heare, and receiue immediatly, and reioyce, yea and beleeue, and grow: But know, thou must <hi>not onely beleeue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1.29.</note> 
               <hi>but suffer for his sake.</hi> The seed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18777:84"/>
that is immediatly receiued, must endure an hard and sharpe winter, before it can come vp kindly. He that forecasts onely the pleasure and ioy of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and not the sorrow, losses, and crosses of it, is like the foolish builder, that thinkes hee can finish a building with so little charge as will scarce serue to lay the foundation. <hi>Paul</hi> knew, and made account, that bonds and imprisonment abode him euery where: and so must thou.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Labour for soundnesse of iudgement, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in affection, in receiuing the Gospell. A sound iudgement in matters of faith, to beleeue firmely and distinctly the truth of Religion, must goe before vndanted confession: 2. Cor. 4.13. <hi>I beleeued, and therefore I spake:</hi> Rom. 10.10. Wee must <hi>beleeue with the heart vnto righteousnesse,</hi> before wee can <hi>confesse with the mouth to saluation.</hi> This is the rooting and stablishing in faith, which shall abide. Then for the second: sincere affection is onely blessed with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; when we bestow the chiefe affection of our heart vpon it, euen our principall loue, and our chiefe ioy and delight. For this is a cause why this bad ground failes; not so much the dislike of Religion, as the liking of other things better: and the not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of truth in the loue of it,<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2.10, 11.</note> is a cause why ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are giuen vp to beleeue lies.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Purge thy heart from the raigne of corrupt lusts. Weed out sinfull desires, labour in mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and selfe-denyall, get further power to dye vnto sinne, get out of the loue of the world and the things in it, resolue against selfe-loue, that in case of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession thy life may not be deare vnto thee: Else shall
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18777:85"/>
not all thy wisedome, or ciuility, or learning keepe thee from backsliding. For if the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, who professed they had left all to follow Christ, yet shrunke in tryall; how shall they stand, that come with hearts thrust full of the world and earthly desires?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Labour to finde full contentment in the good things of the Gospell. Thinke it full happinesse to enioy naked Christ. Esteeme peace of conscience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all worldly peace. Account the fauour of God, the ioy of the holy Ghost, the sweet hope of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Gods right hand, and the treasures of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter world, worth all thou canst giue in exchange, and aboue all that may be compared with them. This will make thee (with the wise Merchant) fell out thy selfe, and forgoe all for the Pearle, and goe away re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Examine thy heart, how it stands affected in lesser trials, now in the peace of the Church. If it shrinke in smaller trials, I must not looke to trust it in greater. If now it will not endure the threat of a Superiour, the feare of losse, the dread of dis-fauour: If it now shrinke from good men, because of their troubles and sufferings, which are their crowne: if thou canst ioyne with the times in disgracing men fearing God; assure thy selfe, if greater trials come, thou shalt be giuen vp to greater delusion and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Because to stand in persecution is a worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue naturall strength, and ascribed to the holy Ghost, to <hi>stablish</hi> men to this triall, and <hi>strengthen them to all patience with ioyfulnesse,</hi> Col. 1.10. We must
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18777:85"/>
pray the Lord not to leaue vs in tentation, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue vs constant both in peace and persecution. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume not of thine owne strength. None haue more boasted of their valour at home, then they that most cowardly lost the field. Remember <hi>Peter:</hi> and pray for the mighty power of the Spirit, to make thee of weake, strong, and altogether <hi>vnmoueable in this worke of the Lord,</hi> 1. Cor. 15. vlt. Alwayes remembring the great danger of falling away, both in the good things lost, and in the multitude of euils pull'd vpon thy selfe.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the <hi>second</hi> sort of bad ground:</p>
            <p>We come now by Gods assistance to the <hi>third.</hi>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Vers. 7.</bibl> And some fell among thornes, and the thornes sprang vp with it, and choked it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THat which our Sauiour taught his Disciples, namely, what an hard thing it is to be saued, wee haue euidently seene in the explication of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ground: wherein we haue discouered a number of Hearers, who haue gone so farre in the way of heauen, (as most of our Hearers come not neere them:) to be but reprobate ground, and lose all their labour and expectation. But yet we shall more cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discerne that truth, and haue more occasion seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to consider of it, when wee shall in this last ground, (the best of all the bad ones) make manifest, that they that step before and beyond the former, shall yet fall short of their ayme, and bee shut out of heauen as well as they. For there was nothing good in the former, which is wanting in this: but some
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18777:86"/>
further commendation in this, which was not in the former.</p>
            <p>Consider heere with me three generals.</p>

               <item>1. The kinde of soyle: some of the seede fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>thornes.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The successe of the seed in it: 1. commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, 2. lamentable.</item>

                     <hi>Method of this part of the Text.</hi>
                  </note>3. The reason, or the causes of failing.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the soyle, it is <hi>thornie ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the commendable successe: 1. It goes as farre as the former: in <hi>hearing,</hi> vers. 14. in <hi>receiuing</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Math. 13.20. and Mark. 4.14. and in <hi>growing,</hi> as our Text hath it. 2. It goes farre beyond it: for first, the ground is softer, the mould moyster, the soyle dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and so more hope: secondly, it springs beyond the other: the other growes, but this sprang vp, not onely to a blade, but to an eare, though not a ripe one; neither doth the stone hinder the rooting, while they are hearing; but, <hi>after they are departed,</hi> thornes choke it: thirdly, they hold on their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion still, which the other lose; they are not driuen off by persecution, but would obey still, did it not crosse their pleasures and profits.</p>
            <p>For the lamentable successe, it is set downe, ver. 14. <hi>they bring forth no fruit:</hi> that is, either no good crop, or no lasting fruit to the haruest, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, bring no fruit to the end, or to maturity: for fruit they bring, though not to perfection.</p>
            <p>The causes of this failing are set downe, 1. in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, to be <hi>thornes,</hi> namely, inward lusts, carnall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and corrupt desires. 2. In speciall, of three sorts: 1. <hi>Cares of the world,</hi> vers. 14. and Mat. 13.22.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:18777:86"/>
2. <hi>Riches,</hi> vers. 14. called <hi>deceitfulnesse of riches,</hi> Math. 13.22. 3. <hi>Voluptuous liuing,</hi> vers. 14. called by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Euangelist, <hi>lusts of other things:</hi> these <hi>enter and choke the Word,</hi> Mark. 4.19.</p>
            <p>Thus in one view you haue the summe and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Text, enlarged out of the other Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists. Now for the exposition of the first, consider, 1. Why lusts are compared to <hi>thornes.</hi> 2. Why these Hearers are compared to <hi>thornie</hi> ground.</p>
            <p>Carnall lusts are fitly compared to <hi>thornes</hi> in fiue respects: 1. There are some flowers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Carnall lusts compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with thornes, in</hi> 5. <hi>things.</hi>
               </note> and some shew on thornes, small fruits, and many pricks: So what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer appearance these lusts make, no good fruit ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth of them, but many pricks and sorrowes by them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in the end. Thornes pierce the body, lusts the mind. 2. Thornes are euery where armed, and ready to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> wound and teare him that meddling with them doth not carefully fence himselfe: So they that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the cares of the world, or addict themselues to pleasures, or profits,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.10.</note> 
               <hi>pierce themselues thorow with many sorrowes.</hi> 3. As a thorne held softly prickes not, nor hurteth, but when it is held hard, and crusht, it easily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> draweth blood:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.30.</note> So a man may vse this world <hi>as not vsing it,</hi> without danger, and hold softly the profits and pleasures of this life; but gripe them, and fasten on them, there is certaine hurt. 4. Thornes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> briers are the dennes and receptacles of Serpents, and poysonfull wormes and creatures: so are these vnmortified desires the harbours of infinite noysome sinnes, which shall creepe as thicke into the soule, as the Frogs into <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lodgings. As Israel not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with Gods daily allowance, but out of a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous

and distrustfull desire, against Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, saued some of the Manna till morning, but it was all full of wormes, and stunke: So doe fleshly mindes, by nourishing vnlawfull lusts, turne Manna <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> into wormes. 5. As thornes and briars are at last good for nothing but fewell for fire: so these thickets of lusts, and pursuit after the profits and pleasures of this life, are the proper fewell of the fire of the great Day,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.8.</note> and prepare the <hi>ground</hi> it selfe, (which all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are:) without timely repentance, as fewell for the fire of hell, which is vnquenchable.</p>

            <p>See it also in the examples of good men.

               <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Ill weeds (we say) spring apace: good seeds or herbes not halfe so fast. Wee shall see a Bramble grow more in seuen moneths than an Oke in seuen yeeres. So our text: the thornes grow vp with the seed,<note place="margin">2</note> but choake it by ouergrowing. 2. Our grounds are fit and prepared to produce thornes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than bring vp the good seed. Our hearts are the naturall mother to lusts, but a stepmother to seedes of Grace. For there lies in our nature a sea of euill lusts lurking: our owne originall lust is a fountaine, and an inordinate disposition to all euill. From which fountaine issue innumerable streames of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all lusts, which are the innumerable motions of the soule, contrary to euery Commaundement of God:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18777:88"/>
All which in their seuerall armies and bands issue out against God and his Word, as the Philistims still warred against Israel. Now our ground being so apt to weeds, they will soone ouergrow the Word, if but a little neglected.<note place="margin">3</note> 3. A part of the curse on mans sin, is,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.18.</note> that the earth should bring forth thornes and thistles. The earth should haue brought them forth, if man had not sinned; but they should not haue bin so noysome and hurtfull to man and the fruits of the earth. Euen so it is a part of the curse of our sinne, that there should grow vp such noysome lusts (as thornes) in the ground of our hearts, as doe farre more hinder the growth of grace in our hearts, and choke the Seed of the Word sowne in our soules, than all the weedes and thornes in the world can choke the seeds and fruits of the earth. Lusts are still remaining in the best, but not now as a curse, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Canaanites, to keepe them humble.<note place="margin">4</note> 4. The raigne of lust cannot but thrust downe the raigne of the Word: for first, that the Word may raigne, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> must be vnderstood;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Raigne of lusts thrust downe the raigne of the Word, many waies</hi>
               </note> but thornes hinder the light of the Sunne from the seed. How can a man see obiects, that hath a thorne run into his eye? So one thorne is enough to darken the eye of the vnderstanding. And therefore, 1. Pet. 2.1. The Apostle wisheth vs to lay aside <hi>all</hi> euill affections, not some, not a little, not the waste boughes, but the root and stumpe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that the Word may raigne, it must first renew: But there can be no new creature, till the old man be put off, with his lusts, Ephes. 4.22, 23. Till this bee, the truth of Christ cannot bee learned, as in Christ. Impossible it is to answere the heauenly Seed, or be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18777:89"/>
answerable to the meanes of diuine regeneration, vnlesse we put away the former prauity of nature: As a man can neuer set vp a new frame, till hee haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> remoued the old rubbish. Thirdly, that the Word may raigne, it must be obeyed when it commands, and be expressed in the fruits of holinesse: But lusts vnsubdued oppose themselues, and hinder the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when they should come into practice: and the Lords Plant becomes fruitfull onely on that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>the Father purge it,</hi> Ioh. 15.2. How can a man walke on cheerfully in his way, that hath a thorne sticking in his foote? No lesse doe these thornes cast men backe in their way of obedience: these superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of lusts and inordinate desires are as dead bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that must be lopped off before fruit can bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. See hereby the reason, why numbers haue either growne so slowly, or not at all, after much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the Lords husbandmen: namely, because their hearts are as thorny ground. Some came with minds stuffed with couetous desires, some with flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imaginations, or filthy cogitations, others with proud conceits of their owne knowledge and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, others alienated with contempt and hatred of the Word, which crosseth their lusts. Partial Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers heare with respect of persons, or degrees. Popish Hearers neuer profit, that come with obstinacy and preiudice of our doctrine. Where these or the like lusts sway, expect no profit: No planting, no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, can make seed prosper, where these thornes grow with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> One lust can doe no great harme: in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18777:89"/>
things we are honest enough, but onely in vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or gaming, or a little Oth, or Lye now and then. <hi>Answ.</hi> One thiefe is enough to betray an house; one diuell suffered to enter, brings seuen worse than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and let any come with purpose to continue in any one sinne, nothing shall moue him, nothing shall conuert him. One Swine spoyles a whole garden: One dead Fly, the whole oyntment: One hole in a ship, the whole vessell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. If we desire the Word should prosper in vs: doe as the good Husbandman,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Meanes to keepe our hearts, as good ground in good kilter.</hi>
               </note> who would keepe his ground in good kilter, on which his seed is cast, or to be cast. First, hee will bring in the Plough to prepare it, and lay it fallow both to rot, and vnroot the weeds that would choke the seed. For it is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> shame, and part of negligence in an Husbandman, to haue his fallowes lie full of weeds. So must thou see, that thou bring into thy heart the grace of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, which is a generall vnrooting of these thornes and weeds: Good husbandry contents not it selfe with some good seed springing vp, vnlesse it kill the weeds: No more content thou thy selfe with the rising and mouing of some good affections, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thou mortifie the bad and noysome. Ierem. 4.4. <hi>Plough vp the fallow ground of you hearts, and sowe not among thornes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the Husbandman ploughes it againe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that if any weeds peepe out, he may roote them vp: so carefull he is for his earthly commodity. No lesse carefull should wee be, if after grace receiued lusts will be still stirring, to root them out: Heb. 12.15. <hi>Take heed that no root of bitternesse spring vp, and trouble
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18777:90"/>
you:</hi> according to that in Deut. 29.18. <hi>Let there bee no root among you, that bringeth gall and wormewood.</hi> If there be any lust, be it neuer so secret and hidden as a root, or neuer so fixed and fastened, as a root is, spare it not; nip it not off, but plucke it vp by the roots: be not content to bridle lusts, but kill them: satisfie not thy selfe with an absence of fleshly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as if it were sanctification, but onely with a slaying of it: for if there be a liuing root within, it will shew it selfe when the seed springs, and soone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertake it too.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, if after all this there be any weeds grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp with the seed, the Husbandman will bring in his weeding hooke into the field; hee will not see a weed or thorne peepe, but he will weede it out: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would haue his corne grow alone. Wouldest thou haue the Word to thriue in thy soule? Let it grow alone. How speedily should a man rise towards heauen, if the Word had the onely roome in his heart! But 2. Because that is impossible, either in the earth, or our hearts, he will bee sure by his hooke to set the seed aboue the weeds: labour thou also to set the Word aboue thy lusts, and contrary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. <hi>Meanes to set the seed of the Word, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the weeds of lusts.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How shall I doe that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. By daily exercise in the Word, reading and meditating: this discouers the weeds &amp; thornes. 2. By daily prayer, and confession of knowne sinnes: this is a getting of the weeding hooke into our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> hands. 3. By Christian humility, and fasting: this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is the cutting off of lusts, by which they daily wither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and dry away: this crucifies the affections and lusts.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18777:90"/>
4. By auoiding occasions of sinne, and sinners: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> watching narrowly our owne inclinations. 5. Keepe vnder the lusts of the flesh by the lusts of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the Spirit, Gal. 5.17. <hi>The Spirit lusteth against the flesh,</hi> that is, both in curbing and restraining euill moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ingendring good cogitations, motions, and desires, agreeable to the will of God. Rom. 13. vlt. By <hi>putting on the Lord Iesus,</hi> represse the lusts of the flesh. Prou. 12.5. A godly man is said to haue <hi>right thoughts:</hi> and chap. 11.23. <hi>His desires are onely good,</hi> not that he is without euill desires sometime, but he resists and fights against them, and God imputes not that which he hates and repents of.</p>
            <p>We see the soyle: Now let vs see the hopefull suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of the seede in it,
<q>The thornes grow with it.</q>]</p>
            <p>Though there be a further growth of the seed in this ground then in the former, yet at length it is as fruitlesse. 1. Here are soft and tender hearts brought to the Word, better prepared for the seed than the former. 2. Here is a deeper rooting: a further mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of vnderstanding, a more vehement carriage of the affection vnto it, in motions of ioy, loue, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, &amp; a more settled purpose to follow the Word. 3. Here is a further shew of fruits: a standing in a glorious profession, an hopefull sprouting and springing in the fruits of good workes, and a longer hope thereby than before. Yet these so softned, so rooted, so farre growne aboue many zealous Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, are ranged in the ranke of bad and fruitlesse Hearers: for, as it is in vers. 14. <hi>Afterward they are choaked.</hi>

            <p>Many are the exhortations to <hi>lay fast hold on the Word,</hi> and to <hi>lay it vp safe in the midst of the heart,</hi> and to <hi>keepe it as a mans life,</hi> Prou. 4.4.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason</hi> 1. From the nature of the Word,<note place="margin">Reu. 14.6.</note> which is in it selfe a perpetuall truth, an <hi>euerlasting Gospell</hi>; Heauen and Earth are most stable, and firmely foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God; but not so stable as the least iot of Gods Word, which shall not fayle or fall to the ground for euer. And to vs it is a certaine rule, a constant law, and binder, not for the present only, but for all time future, yea and for all eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is a mayne difference betweene a godly man, and an hypocrite. Many things may affect an euill man for the present hearing of the Word. Sometime he may heare a noueltie with great affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but as children delight in a new toy for an houre, but presently contemne and lose it. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the power of the Word makes an hypocrite tremble, as <hi>Felix,</hi> and grow to some promise with himselfe, and perhaps to some purpose and resolution of amendment: So Israel hearing the Lord speake in so terrible a voyce, promise faire, <hi>All that the Lord our God saith by thee, (if he will no more speake by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) we will heare it and doe it.</hi> But the Lord saw there was <hi>no such heart in them,</hi> Deut. 5.27, 29. Sometime some affliction prepares them to heare, and now while the iron is in the fire, and the hammer vpon it, it may bee wrought to some fashion till it be cold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: so <hi>Pharaoh</hi> sometime will confesse his sinne, and acknowledge Gods righteousnesse and begge Prayers of <hi>Moses</hi>; but onely so long as the plague is vpon him. Sometime some naturall motion, or some
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:18777:92"/>
spirituall motion may stirre them, and for a flash they are earnestly resolued for Heauen: so the yong man comes hastily, and heares gladly, but not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing to doe all that is required, goes away hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily.</p>
            <p>The hypocrite in all these motions is like <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,</hi> whose goodnesse was <hi>as the morning dew,</hi> sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dried vp, Hos. 6.4. The Word comes into a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse heart, wherein is a bottomlesse gulfe of guile and deceit, and all is lost at length. But the godly man, by the Words dwelling plentifully in his heart, attaines the commendation pronounced vpon the Church of Thyatria, Reuel. 2.19. I knowe thy works, thy faith, &amp;c. that they be <hi>more at last than at first.</hi> He hath on him a marke of one that is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Lord in the House of the Lord;<note place="margin">Psal. 92.14.</note> he is <hi>more fruitfull in his age, more fat and fresh</hi> dayly, and exceeds his former times in feracity, and fruitfulnesse in good works and graces.</p>
            <p>In a word, whereas all other things are common to all, the Heauens, the Earth, the Creatures, yea, the Ministery of the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, and many common graces wrought by them; this alone is the speciall right of Beleeuers, incommunicable with hypocrites, to haue the Word of God euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly fixed in their hearts: Esa. 8.16. <hi>Seale vp the Law among my Disciples:</hi> now a seale is a meanes of secrecy from them whom the matter concernes not, and of assurance to them whom the businesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes.</p>
            <p>This is the second reason.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The best of Gods Word is after the hearing.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:18777:92"/>
Our Parable compares hearing of the Word to sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: now the best of sowing is long after, in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Elsewhere it is compared to food: and the best of eating is after eating, in the nourishment and strength. For let men eate and drinke with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, good taste, and much pleasure; yet if after the eating, bad humors in the stomake suffer it not to stay, or not to digest if it doe stay, it doth much hurt in stead of nourishing. So in the state of the Soule, where many wicked humors resist the worke of the Word heard.</p>
            <p>But to shew in speciall, that the Word is best after the hearing, consider,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gods Word is best after the hearing for</hi> 5. <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
               </note> 1. That it frameth a man to the life of faith, and vpholdeth that life. It is a means to make a man good, and continue his goodnesse. Because it both storeth a man with graces, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> him from vngracious courses, through all his life; which those that make no vse of the Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the hearing, are wrapped in. Prou. 2.10. When wisdome enters into thy heart, then shall counsell <hi>preserue thee,</hi> and vnderstanding shall <hi>keepe thee,</hi> that is, both in the good way, and from the euill way: so Psalm. 119.11. I haue hid thy Word in my heart, that I might <hi>not sinne against thee.</hi> 2. The Word <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> kept in the heart, makes a man a notable patterne of piety to others, and a fruitfull Christian, vpholding him in a readinesse to euery good word and worke. If the heart keepe knowledge, the mouth will <hi>speake of wisdome,</hi> Psalm. 49.3. He is fit and ready to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, exhort, rebuke, and comfort others. For the Word of God,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.17.</note> which is able to make <hi>the man of God</hi> ready and absolute to euery good worke, is much
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18777:93"/>
more able to fitte priuate Christians thereunto. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Our greatest businesse is behinde, to which the Word kept in the soule can onely fit vs; as namely, to fit our accounts, to store our lampes with oyle, to hold on our repentance, and finish the good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> worke begunne, with perseuerance. 4. Our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test sufferings and trials are behinde: dayes of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the day of temptation, the day of death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Sathan will bee most furious and raging, and the day of Iudgement. Now as <hi>Dauid</hi> said of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, If thy Word had not been my comfort, I had perished in my trouble: so if the Word be not thy sword in the day of temptation, if it be not thy health in sicknesse, thy life in death, if it pleade not for thee in iudgement, thou art euerlastingly lost, because thou hast wilfully lost thy part and portion of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> blessed Word. 5. Our marke is still before vs, euen that euerlasting happinesse, and great saluation, which the Word of God (faithfully retained in the heart) not onely reuealeth, but putteth vs in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of. Thus as the pillar of the cloud and of the fire neuer left Israel, till they came into Canaan: no more doth the Word of God cease to be our constant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for our motion or station, till it hath set vs into that heauenly Canaan; no nor then, it being a surer pillar then that of the cloude; for as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet saith, <hi>O Lord, thy Word endureth for euer in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> Psalm. 119.89. that is, although neuer so many things in earth seeme to cloude and crosse the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promises, that thou hast made to thy children, yet in Heauen shall they taste the sweetnesse of thy Word, more then euer they did in earth; when they
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18777:93"/>
shall enioy all the fruits of that eternall loue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, which they beleeued in this world. Besides that, the same Word of God, which now the Saints lay vp in their hearts, is the Law and Charter of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, by which being fully conformed to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, we shall walke eternally before God in the perfection of that obedience, which is heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. And thus it is our eternall direction in heauen also.</p>

            <p>Others heare, and the Word smites them, workes a little on their conscience, wounds them, and tells <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them as <hi>Nathan</hi> did <hi>Dauid, Thou art the man.</hi> Now were a fit season to worke with God:<note place="margin">2.

is not, but Satan and his Agents, and a whole troupe of tentations. And what hurt comes by mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, which naturally is profane, vnsauory, vncharitable? Besides, euen good men in bad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies acquit not Gods glory, nor themselues, as they ought; and in good company, either doe not, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not the good they should.</p>
            <p>This is the first reason.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In things lawfull, men are most secure, and thinke themselues safest: and there Satan is most, where he is least suspected. As the Serpent lyeth in the greenest grasse: so Satan lyeth in ambush against vs in our most lawfull liberties. As he laid his traine against our Sauiour Christ himselfe in the matter of meate and drinke, when he was hungry: so also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, chiefly in things, wherein God hath giuen vs allowance. Wherein was it that Satan ouercame <hi>Lot?</hi> was it first Incest with his two daughters?

            <p n="3">3. Whereas our nature spider-like, turnes our best and sweetest things to poyson, Satan to our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption adds his waight, putting vs forward to abuse good things, and lawfull; because this both hinders God of his glory in the meanes of our good, and our selues in the end for which God alloweth them. God hath giuen vs all our lawfull liberties, as helpes to heauen: we vs them as hinderances. His grace puts them into our hands as staues, to support vs in our way and wearinesse: we, by the abuse, make them burthens and clogs to cast vs backe. Hee allowes vs
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18777:98"/>
them as spurres, to prouoke vs to cheerfulnes in his seruice: we peruert them, and they become as thornes to choke vs, and hinder vs in his seruice.</p>
            <p>Well knowes Satan, that the best things abused, become euill to him that so vseth them. Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe shall be <hi>a Rocke of offence.</hi> The Word,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.8.</note> if it kill not vices, it killeth soules. And the Sacraments are ranke poyson to the vnworthy receiuer. He cares not how many gifts of nature, no nor of grace a man hath, so as out of them arise pride, ambition, enuie, &amp;c. which are as a Canker consuming them. And much lesse cares he how many gifts of Fortune, (as they call them) that is, wealth and honour, a man hath, so as they make him swell with disdaine, or vainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in his wealth, or secure in his course, or licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in the bold committing of sin. Let wealth flow in, as waters from a full fountaine, so they drowne the soule in perdition. Thus Gods glory is impaired, which he expects for his goodnesse, and mans sinne inlarged, which hath made himselfe so miserable by so great mercy.</p>

               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To let many a man see his sinne and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who neuer suspects hurt and danger in such lawfull things, as riches, and pleasures, and cares of the world: They wonder they should bee thornes, who neuer felt the pricking, but haue tasted much sweetnesse in them, and in nothing more. But our Sauiour well knew the nature of them, through the malice and infirmity of men abusing them. Hee well saw, that no thornes doe so choke the seed, as these the Word: and that many, who found such sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in them, haue falne short of saluation by them.

If thou haddest neuer eaten forbidden fruit, nor fed vpon stolne bread, the abuse of lawfull and allowed profits and pleasures, will keepe thee out of heauen. The Farme lawfully gotten, but vnlawfully affected, may make thee neuer to taste of the Supper: And the hauing and inioying the wife thou hast married, may make thee say flatly, <hi>I cannot come.</hi> Thinkest thou the diuell hath no baits but in his hellish tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?<note place="margin">Luk. 14.20.</note> Yes, his baytes lye euery where. If thou beest a rich man, hee hath deceitfulnesse of riches: If a poore man, he hath the cares of this life: If any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing affect thee, he hath lusts of other things, to make thee fall short of saluation. Say not with thy selfe, I am no adulterer, no murtherer, no theefe, and therefore am in a good way to saluation; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse also thou hast watched Satan, and carried thy selfe cleere and faire in thy calling, in thy wealth, marriage, recreation, company, meate, drinke, and apparell.

Neither say, I am a Professor of the Gospell, and am zealous against sinne euery where, and loue them that feare God: For when Professors reuolt to the world, and giue themselues to an vniustifiable liberty, in following the profits and pleasures of this life, they shall see grace thriue as corne among thornes; which as they eate the seede, so our hearts and liues are eaten vp

What an euill thing and bitter is it, to venture vpon sinne expressely prohibited, to reach out the hand for bread of deceit, to drinke in with greedinesse stolne waters, and with delight to feede vpon forbidden fruit? What is this but to walke vpon snares and thornes, which will sting the conscience, and wound the soule to certaine and speedy death? Luk. 17.28. <hi>As in the dayes of Lot they ate and dranke, bought, and sold, planted and built, &amp;c.</hi> Heere one askes, why our Sauiour makes no mention, nor chargeth the Sodomites with those far greater sinnes, of which we reade in the story, Gen. 19. as the contempt of the Word, their violence against <hi>Lot,</hi> their horrible and crying sinne of Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; but onely those which seeme light, or no sinnes in comparison. And the answere is; that wee might conceiue what a fearfull plague belonged to such fearefull enormious courses, when as euen lawfull things, and such as without which life cannot bee maintained, immoderately vsed, were punished with fire and brimstone.</p>
            <p>Thinke it too much to offend in thy lawfull liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, although thou venture not vpon vnlawfull. For if he that offends in the former, cannot but breake thorow a thorne hedge, not without pricking and tearing himselfe: How much more shall hee wound himselfe, that dares venture ouer that sharpe hedge of curses, wherwith God hath mounded &amp; hedged his Law! Oh that bold sinners, shamelesse harlots,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18777:100"/>
debosht drunkards, blasphemous swearers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Sabbath-breakers, would thinke on this!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Learne we to moderate our lawfull and naturall desires, as wherein so many snares doe lye: Desire no outward fauours, without inward grace to vse them; without which, Gods mercy proues but thy iudgement.<note place="margin">5. <hi>Rules of moderation in naturall and lawfull desires.</hi>
               </note> And for thy better direction in the right vse of lawfull things, take these Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Consider, that lawfull liberty vsed to the full, is exceeding dangerous, and restraint is necessary. Hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that will take all the liberty he may, will sometimes take that he may not. Hence it was, that the Iewes in punishing malefactors, were wont to giue but 39. blowes,<note place="margin">Deut. 25.3.</note> whereas <hi>they might giue forty:</hi> 2. Cor. 11.24. <hi>Of the Iewes fiue times receiued I forty stripes saue one.</hi> Let this be thy care also, to cut thy selfe somewhat short, euen in that which is lawfull: for, the more flesh is pampered, the more is the Spirit weakened and foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider the Author of all thy liberties: that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> while thou hast the sweetnesse and comfort of them, hee may haue the glory of them; <hi>of whom, and by whom, and for whom are all things, by Iesus Christ,</hi> Rom. 11. vlt.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. With the vse of naturall things, labour to ioyne a spirituall vse; and so while we cherish our bodies with them, we shall also refresh our soules. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: In the vse of meate and drinke, stirre wee vp our selues to labour for the bread and water of life. In putting on our clothes, labour to put on Christ as a garment. In marriage, see thou meditate much and often on that sweet contract betweene Christ and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18777:100"/>
the soule, and so in the rest. This one calls an holy Alchemy, to draw gold out of lead, heauen out of earth, grace out of nature.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Consider, that the right vse of peace and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is, to grow vp in the feare of God, in peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and the comforts of the holy Ghost: so the Church vsed her rest and peace, Act. 9.31. And that the more outward blessings the Lord affoordeth, and in them more time and meanes to serue him, the more seruice he lookes for. And how absurd is it, that while thou takest the Lords wages, thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest doe the worlds worke, or thine owne businesse altogether?</p>
            <p n="5">5. In our freer and more ioyfull vse of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of God, let vs carry an holy ielousie and suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ouer our selues, lest sinne creepe in, and so wee dishonour God. <hi>Iob,</hi> when his sonnes feasted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sanctified them, and sacrificed according to the number of them all, saying, <hi>It may be that my sons haue offended.</hi> Do thou the like for thy selfe:<note place="margin">Iob 1.5.</note> mingle none of thy ioy with sinne; for then it must end in woe.
<q>Are choked with cares.</q>]</p>
            <p>Now wee come in speciall to treate of the three kindes of thornes, which choke the Word, and make it fruitlesse, as they are laid downe in the Text.</p>
            <p>The first of them are <hi>cares,</hi> called by <hi>Matthew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The first sort of thornes are worldly cares.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>cares of this world</hi>; And this is to distinguish them from the cares of heauen, and of that better world, which are euery where commended to vs: Mat. 6.33. <hi>Seeke first the Kingdome of God, and his righteousnesse.</hi> 1. Cor. 7.32. <hi>The vnmarried careth for the things of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18777:101"/>
Lord, and how he may please the Lord.</hi> And for a man thus to place his cares and desires, is, to walke with God, and begin his heauen before-hand; euery where commanded, as the following and pursuing of his true felicity. Our Parable speaketh of another sort, of noysome and thorny cares for the things of this world, which are not allowed vs.</p>
            <p>Heere sundry pertinent questions come to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Whether no worldly care bee allowed vs; seeing the Apostle saith, Phil. 4.6. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Be carefull for nothing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Apostle doth not command vs to bee idle, or carelesse in the doing of our callings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in euery one must carefully abide. <hi>Adam</hi> in innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy must haue a care of dressing the Garden: and all the sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> after the fall, must eate their bread in the sweat of their browes. Else a man liues inordinately, and ought not to eate. Yea the Apostle himselfe confesseth, 2. Cor. 11.28. that hee was cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred daily, and had <hi>the care of all the Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

                  </gap>.</note>Neither doth hee forbid a necessary care for the things of this life, to the sustentation both of our selues, and others belonging to vs. For it is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lawfull, but necessary for euery Christian to haue a care, not onely of his <hi>vocation,</hi> but of his <hi>condition</hi> and state of life in this world, how hee and his may comfortably, and with the honour of God and the Gospell, passe thorow the world. And hee that hath not a prouident care for his family, <hi>hath denyed the faith,</hi> 1. Tim. 5.8. Such are a generation of debosht and vile persons, who cast all care away, and let the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18777:101"/>
world slide; let wife and children shift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; let debts and charge come on them; worse than the most vnnaturall brutes, they cast off all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and cares, and with them, all piety, honesty, and humanity it selfe.</p>
            <p>Thus we see both a diligent and a prouident care commanded: As a man in a iourney takes gold, sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, meate and drinke, to set him forward in his way; his care is not for these chiefly, but to finish his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: so we that are Christians, may take with vs the things of earth by the way, but must not set our care or affection on them, onely so farre as they serue for heauen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. How farre are these cares lawfull?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Cares of the world are twofold. The one,<note place="margin">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a doubtfull and diffident care, arising out of distrustfulnesse of God, and feare of wants, and so suffers not it selfe to be bounded within the rules of Piety and Christian moderation. That is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, this damnable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. How shall I know these vnbounded and distrustfull cares?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. They are cutting and distracting cares:<note place="margin">5. <hi>Markes of distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cares.</hi>
               </note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

chap. 4.8. <hi>There is a man, and there is not a second, there is no end of his trauell, &amp;c.</hi>

               </note> For in the duties of vocation are two things: 1. The care and labour of the worke of the calling. 2. The care of the successe and euent. The former is ours, the latter is Gods. A sober and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate care doth the duty, but leaues the care of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse vnto God. But this care enters vpon Gods right, and troubles it selfe about the euent of his businesse, and successe of his labours, and cannot rest in Gods issue, neither before nor after it is manifested.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 There is a distrustfull feare of future need, which by carking and cutting care they would preuent. Though they haue food and raiment, yet are they not content, but repine and vexe themselues, because they know not how themselues, their wiues, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren shall be maintained heereafter: yea, and toyle themselues out of their skinnes, and bring vntimely gray haires on their heads, for the next age, and next generation. <hi>Obiect.</hi> May we not lay vp for our selues, and our children? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Not with distrustfull care, nor with choking thorny care, which eates out better cares. 2. Though a Christian may enioy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, if God cast it vpon him, yet may hee not seeke abundance, aboue that which is necessary for his person, nature, and estate. Hee must bee content with <hi>daily bread,</hi> and pray for no more: nay, the King himselfe must not seeke superfluities, Deut. 17.16. <hi>Obiect.</hi> May we not care for the morrow, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour implies, Math. 6. vlt? <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ had a bag for his prouision, and for his Disciples. <hi>Ioseph</hi> proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18777:102"/>
for the seuen yeeres of famine: and the Church for the great dearth, Act. 11.28, 29. So may men in their youth prouide for age, while strength lasteth, and sight and sences are good: alwayes remembring, not diffidently, not distrustfully, or to crosse the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of faith, whereby we should daily depend on his hand and prouidence, who renewes our dayes and times vpon vs. For to this care our Sauiour op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth trust and confidence in God, vers. 30.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If a man by indirect and vnlawfull meanes ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> these worldly things together, let him bee sure these distrustfull cares haue stuffed his heart. Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and warrantable care rests on good and allowable meanes: But he that by lying, swearing, fraud, iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, deceit in measures or waights, by vsurie, or the like meanes, can helpe himselfe, his care and course is wicked and damnable.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is a choking care, if a man neglect the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of God, prosper not in grace, profit not by Gods Word, thrust the worship of God out of dores, or seldome, or slightly, or coldly, or formally performe these duties: or if a man fall backe from good motions, good purposes, good beginnings, he may iustly suspect himselfe, that inordinate and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour cares haue seazed on his heart, and waged warre, and preuailed against the cares of heauen and a better life. In a word: when a man more imployes himselfe about them, than will stand with keeping his heart vnto God, now they are chokers.</p>
            <p>These are the cares heere called <hi>thornes:</hi>

               <hi>The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of them is, to choke the seed of the Word.</hi> Where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider two things: 1. How they choke the Word.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18777:103"/>
2. The vse that is to bee made thereof.</p>
            <p>For the first. They choke the Word, 1. Before: 2. In: 3. After hearing.</p>

               </note>
               <hi>Before hearing,</hi> two wayes: 1. In that they hold men away, and keepe them from the preaching of Gods Word. Luk. 10.40. While <hi>Mary</hi> was set at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the feet of Christ, hearing his gracious words, <hi>Martha incumbred her selfe about many things, &amp;c.</hi> Her care and loue in entertaining our Lord Iesus himselfe, was excessiue and immoderate, and hindred her from hearing his Word out of his owne mouth. The same was the cause why those vnthankfull ghests, inuited to the Kings Supper, Luk. 14.18. they all made excuses; their inordinate care about Farmes, Oxen, and Families suffered them not to come when they were called. So now, especially on a weeke-day, numbers keepe away from this Exercise; because the desires after the world haue eaten out the desires and care of Gods Word: They cannot let their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and seruants would bee idle, and I know not what. Whereas a man might name some places of idle resort, where they let ten times so much in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> weeke. 2. If they doe come, yet these cares hinder their prayers, and preparation, and therefore their profitable hearing. They that cannot pray well, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not heare well. Now, prayer is a lifting vp of the hart vnto God: but these presse it downe, and are as so many heauie stones hanged on the wings of our prayers.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Jn hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, two wayes.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>In hearing,</hi> they hinder two wayes also: 1. When men bring their businesse in their brests with them; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they are casting and tossing with themselues, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:18777:103"/>
plotting their owne imployments: and this hinders both attention, and vnderstanding, and affection; without all which, the Word heard is vnprofitable. 2. These inordinate cares keepe out, and barre out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the chiefe duties of a Christian, that there can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee entrance for them, or at least, very shallow rooting. As we shall see in some instances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Word, in the daily preaching of it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</hi>
               </note> labours to confirme and increase faith and confidence in God: it bids vs beleeue, and trust in the Lord for all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> supplyes, Psalm. 37.3, 5, 7. But these cares lodged in the heart, choke all these precepts, will not suffer vs to trust God with our selues, but will take his care into our owne hands, and will beleeue and trust him no further than wee see him, or haue a pawne from him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The vse of Gods Word, as it is from heauen,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
so it is to draw vs to heauen, and lift vp the minde to heauenly things;<note place="margin">Col. 3.1, 2.</note> when it vrgeth vs to <hi>seeke things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue where Christ is,</hi> and perswades vs to pull our thoughts from things below, and set them on things within the Vaile. But these cares nourished in the heart, choke all such exhortations: for they wedge downe, and stake downe the soule into earth, and earthly things: they will care for heauen when they come there, but for earth while they are here.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Gods Word, in the powerfull preaching of it,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> opposeth and beateth downe the vnlawfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscionable seeking, and meanes of getting the things of this life: It condemnes to hell all vniustice, and fraudulent dealing, and all heaping and holding the least piece of wicked Mammon. But where these

thornes are nourished, all these denunciations are choked, they will set the tongue on lying and swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, the hands on coozening and deceiuing, the whole course on vsurie, oppression; and all is fish that comes to net.</p>
            <p>Thus where the world is taken in, the Word is shut out, or choked.</p>

               <hi>After hearing</hi> also, these thornes choke the Word: so the Text saith, <hi>and afterward,</hi> or after they are gone, the cares of the world enter in againe, and as a wedge driues out all before it. Many come from their earthly businesse, and heare with affection, and may hold it for a while; but at last, the throng of their businesse and cares of the world conquer the Word, and driueth it both out of their memory and practice.</p>
            <p>For the memory: see Exo. 16.3. When Israel was without food in the Wildernesse, and knew not how they should sustain the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, their wiues &amp; children, they begin to scorne and take on against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi>

Did not that promise yet sound in their eares, vers. 26? But these distrustfull and distracting cares choked presently the remembrance of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and of his great blessings bestowed on them.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Now there ought to be a great difference betweene the cares, studies, indeuours, and delights of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Heathens. For we haue not receiued the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the world, but of God, to sauour the things of God; <hi>And it is sufficient that we haue liued in such lusts; but now let vs walke no more after the will of man, but of God,</hi> 1. Pet. 4.3. Shall our Profession bee Christian, and our practice Heathen? What doe such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Heathens in a visible Church, whose heads, hearts, and hands are more stuft with cares, feares, and distractions, than the most Heathenish Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens? For men to follow the world with a full spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to place their felicity heere, and make it their chiefe ioy to increase their estate heere, is to liue
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18777:106"/>
like an Heathen: <hi>For after all these things doe the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles seeke.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Because the things of this life are not worth such distracting care, in the due estimate of them. For first, they are but for this present world, which is indeed a world of vanity, and a mappe of misery. Secondly, they are but for a mortall and changeable life, which passeth as a vapour: though men that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine them, vainely suppose they shall not dye, at least not yet. They are for a life common with vs to the brute beasts, which want vnderstanding and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and yet their life is passed without any such cares or distractions, by that generall prouidence that feedeth Sparrowes, who neither spinne, nor carry into the Barne.</p>
            <p>But there are cares for a better world, which as it is a Kingdome of glory and happinesse, so it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken, of perpetuity and eternity. There are cares for the life of the soule, which as it is more excellent than the body, so are all the good things belonging to it: And these cares are worthy of roome and place in a Christian heart. There is a life not common with beasts, but with the Angels, to bee cared for; nay, common with Iesus Christ: the care of which, our Sauiour hath commended to vs aboue all other cares in the world, when reprouing <hi>Martha</hi> for her too sollicitous and busie care in entertaining his own blessed Person; he told her, and vs in her, <hi>One thing is necessary</hi>; and, this care is of <hi>the good part which shall neuer be taken from vs.</hi>

            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. These distrustfull cares argue both impiety, and folly. <hi>The former,</hi> in that they would fasten vpon
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18777:106"/>
God, want of knowledge, power, or will, to relieue our wants. For if God take knowledge, and bee able, and willing to supply them, what need I vexe my selfe further? For his knowledge: Math. 6.32. Your heauenly Father <hi>knoweth,</hi> that you haue need of all these things. For his power: Goe into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, behold him feeding Israel forty yeeres without all earthly meanes, giuing them bread from heauen, which ordinarily comes out of the earth, and water out of hard Rocks, than which nothing is dryer; preseruing their clothes from wearing, while they were worne forty yeeres together. For his Will: Psa. 37.28. <hi>The Lord forsaketh not his Saints,</hi> they shall bee preserued for euermore. But these distractfull cares deny the Lord the honour of wisedome, power, and mercy, and so are expresse signes of an vngodly heart.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they argue a foolish mind, two wayes: 1. That when a little will serue a man in his way homeward, thorow a strange Countrey, he will lode himselfe with needlesse burthens. Nature is content with little, Grace with lesse. <hi>Iacob</hi> craues no more of God, but food and rayment. And wee are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>If we haue food and raiment, to bee therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> 1. Tim. 6.8. 2. What an extreme folly is it, when a man hath enough for the present, nay, and for his time, if he were to liue ouer two liues, yet to spend his dayes in scraping and gathering, not so much for himselfe, as hee knowes not for whome? It may be for a <hi>foole,</hi> Eccles. 4.8. It may bee for a waster and spend-thrift; it may be for a <hi>stranger,</hi> chap. 2.19. nay, it may be for an enemy, as <hi>Haman</hi> for <hi>Mordecai.</hi>

We professe our selues children of God: and therefore these distracting cares are most vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming vs. We must rather imitate children, who because they depend vpon their father, and rest on his allowance, they put off all care and thought, what they shall eate, drinke, put on, or what portion they shall stand to hereafter. And if we see a man drudge and droyle in the world, and making shift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, we will say, Surely such a man hath no father to care for him.</p>

               </note>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Riches are good blessings in themselues, and of themselues hinder not. For the promises of them are made to those that feare God, Psal. 112.2. <hi>Riches and treasure shall be in their house.</hi> And, as sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, basenesse, pouerty, saues none; so wealth, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, wisdome condemne none, in themselues. 2. The prophesie is, that the rich shall come to the people
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18777:110"/>
of God, and ioyne with the Church, Esa. 60.11. Psal. 22.29. 3. The Lord acknowledgeth of many rich men, that their <hi>riches are a crowne on their heads,</hi> by the many good workes they doe thereby, Prou. 14.24. Some there are, whose wealth lifts them not vp in pride, but exalts them in workes of mercy. As a crowne is an ornament to the head: so riches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the wisedome, and piety, and faith, and charity of a godly man. They cannot make a man good or euill, wise, or foolish, but onely manifest a wise man or a foole. So in Eccles. 7.11. <hi>Wisedome is good with an inheritance:</hi> it is good without it, but more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent with it, more conspicuous, more vsefull.</p>
            <p>Therefore for resolution of the doubt, note, 1. That our Sauiour saith not, It is impossible for a rich man to bee saued, but very hard. And the Apostle saith not, Not any, but, <hi>Not many.</hi> 2. Christ speakes not so in respect of the possession or vse of riches, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the abuse, as it is expounded, Mark. 10.24. when a man <hi>trusteth in riches.</hi> 3. <hi>With God</hi> (saith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour) <hi>this is possible,</hi> who made <hi>Iob</hi> exceeding rich, and fenced all about him that hee had; yet so godly withall, that there was not another so godly vpon earth as he, chap. 1.8, 10. And it is <hi>Augustines</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: <hi>Seruatur pauper Lazarus,</hi>

Great men haue great employments in their hands, and cannot bee at leisure for preaching: they may not let their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse one houre in a weeke. <hi>Felix</hi> hath no leisure now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to heare <hi>Paul,</hi> but will take another time. And <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> cannot let the time, to heare Christ himselfe.

But was not <hi>Martha</hi> reproued for so slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preaching of Christ? And what? Is not this losse of time (as some call it) the best redeeming of time?

What? great men, and rich men stoupe to so base a thing as preaching, and to so base persons as Preachers, all whose power is in their tongue? Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle will haue <hi>rich men charged,</hi>

               <hi>that they bee not high-minded.</hi> Riches commonly breede pride, and high mindes. Pride in a mans selfe breeds contempt of God, and his Word: as <hi>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord?</hi>

and the Prophet saith, <hi>Heare, and giue eare, and bee not proud,</hi> Ier. 13.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Great men haue a great happinesse in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> hands already, and hardly see any want in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: And, as he comes not to the Physician that feeles not himselfe sicke; so hee desires no supply of good, that feeles not in himselfe the want of it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of outward wealth, suffers not the heart to see his want of inward. And the good things of Gods Kingdome are not giuen but to them that want them, and can prize them: <hi>To the thirsty,</hi> Esa. 55.1.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Riches choke the Word <hi>in hearing.</hi> As thornes spread themselues, and occupy the roome where the seed should grow:<note place="margin">2. <hi>In hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi>
               </note> So the inordinate loue of the world stuffes the heart with worldly desires and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and takes vp the roome from all spirituall. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> his heart once taken vp for couetousnesse, there is no roome left for the gracious admonitions of Christ himselfe.

               </note> 1. They hinder the Word in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and confession of it.

               </note> but I haue many eyes vpon me, &amp;c. 2. They hinder the practice and obedience of the Word: as we shall see in some instances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Word perswades to humility, and lowe conceit of our selues: But riches doe swell vp the heart with lothsome pride, and make a man thinke of himselfe so much better than of another, as he hath gotten wealth (perhaps by wicked meanes) aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: wheras wealth well gotten, makes no man bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but ill gotten, farre worse. How contumeliously did <hi>Nabal</hi> vse <hi>Dauid,</hi> 1. Sam. 25? Because hee was wealthy, he was proud and haughty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Gods Word perswades to trust and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, who is our life, and the length of our
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18777:112"/>
dayes, onely of power to doe vs good. But wealth easily perswades the heart to make gold the hope. Holy <hi>Iob</hi> disclaimes this practice of a wicked man, Chap. 31.24. If I said to the wedge of gold, Thou art my confidence; If I reioyced, because my sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance was great, or because my hand had gotten much, &amp;c. it had been iniquity: for I had denyed God aboue. The rich mans riches is his strong To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in his conceit, hee thinkes himselfe well-walled and intrenched within his wealth, and rests vnder the shadow of the wing of his wealth; which hee is not content to haue, vnlesse it haue him, his heart and trust.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Gods Word perswades to workes of charity and mercy, and to be rich in good workes. But loue of riches choketh this Word, shuts vp the bowels of compassion against his brother, shrinkes vp the hand that should open and stretch it selfe to the necessity of the Saints, suffers not to honour God with our riches, nor to prouide for our selues any other wealth but that in earth. Thus the miserable man hath riches while he liues, and when he dies, they are goods, neuer doe good before.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Gods Word teacheth to leaue our riches for Christ, and that naked Christ is wealth enough. But loue of the world chokes that Word, and makes vs, for an handfull of the world, to forsake Christ, and the holy profession: as we see in the young man, who went away heauily, because hee had great pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions. <hi>Iudas</hi> must haue thirty pieces more than hee could gaine by his Master. The like of <hi>Demas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Gods Word teacheth, to restore ill-gotten
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18777:113"/>
goods, as by vsury, deceit, oppression, lies, &amp;c. <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi> so soone as he was conuerted, restored foure-fold. But the loue of the world choketh this Word, and hindreth obedience: worldly men part with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull profits, as with their ioynts, nay, will rather part with their soules.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Gods Word teacheth, that euery man should maintaine himselfe and his family in a lawfull and honest course of life, and not to esteeme that penny his, for which he may not praise God as the giuer. But this Word is choked in a number, both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of iustice, and Ministers of the Gospell, and Trades-men, that receiue a great deale of wealth from the diuell, and not from God; in a number of vnconscionable courses: And especially they that liue by wicked and vnlawful Trades, Dicing-houses, filthy houses, Play-houses, and such places of idle and hellish resort; which one not vnfitly calls, The diuels house of Office. And such Victuallers, Vintners, and Ale-sellers as suffer brutish creatures to wash away their reason and discretion, so they may licke away their money: as if it were not a foule sinne, to liue on the foule sinnes of others. Thus riches choke the obedience of the Word, and suffer not a man to serue God, or obey his Word, further than serues his owne commodity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Take notice of that vanity with <hi>Salomon,</hi> Eccles. 5.13. who obserued <hi>riches reserued to the hurt of the owners.</hi> Men haue giuen them the name of goods, as if there were no danger in them, or euill to the possessor by them; who yet (we see) may easily dispossesse himselfe of Christ, and saluation by them.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18777:113"/>
How many haue we seene, while they were in lowe estate in the world, humble, gentle, meeke, forward and zealous; who now in prosperity are growne fat, proud, disdainfull, and slothfull in spirituall things? How many in their lowe estate were diligent Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, profitable conferrers of the Word, carefull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruers in sanctifying the Sabbath, fruitfull instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of their families? But now the world is come in vpon them, and the businesse of it thrusts in, and the poore man that cannot serue two Masters at once, is gone backe, and growne lazie, yea and at length lothing that good Word, the sweetnesse of which he hath tasted, and decreased in the Spirit, as fast as he increased in the flesh. As the Moone neuer suffers Eclypse, but in the full; So these in their ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse suffer the earth to come betweene them and their Sunne, who in their wane were safe enough.</p>
            <p>Heere for our further instruction, we will consider two things: 1. The <hi>Markes</hi> of a man, in whom the world choketh the Word. 2. The <hi>Remedies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The Markes are fiue.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In his whole desires hee is more earnest after goods, than after grace. Psalm. 4.6.<note place="margin">5. <hi>Markes of a man in whom the Word is choked by wealth.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Who will shew vs any good?</hi> This is the speech of <hi>many.</hi> But a few say, <hi>Lord, lift thou vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs.</hi> The blessing of <hi>Esau,</hi> the fat of the earth, most men desire most: But the blessed dewes of heauen, and sauing grace in the meanes, are as refuse wares not asked after. Tell a man of a good bargaine, or a good purchase, he will giue you both his eares, he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirre himselfe, and his onely feare is, to bee preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Tell him of the bargaine of heauen, and of the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18777:114"/>
purchase of that <hi>inheritance among the sanctified</hi>;<note place="margin">Act. 26.18.</note> yea, (saith he) God send vs that inheritance aboue all; but if God send it not, he will neither bee at paines nor cost for it. If God should put many of vs to our choyce, whether we would haue wisdome, or wealth, or long life, or power ouer enemies; wee would scarce, with <hi>Salomon,</hi> chuse wisedome in the first place; but would either haue wisedome vvith an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, or an inheritance vvithout vvisedome.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His speeches vvill bevvray him, in vvhom the vvorld choketh the Word. For as he chiefly sauours the things of the vvorld, and affects them; so out of the abundance of the heart his tongue runnes chiefly on them. 1. Ioh. 4.5. <hi>They are of the world, therefore speake they of the world.</hi> Follovv this man from a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, you shall marke, that presently being out of the Church, he falls into discourse of vvorldly matters, and earthly things, as if the Word heard, vvere not vvorth speaking of: his earthly heart is carried natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to his center: Follovv him from a Play, or from the Market, you shall heare him tell the vvhole story accurately, and articulately, from poynt to poynt; or discourse as he comes home, of his penny-vvorths, of the chiefe commodities and prizes. But alasse! vvhen God sets open his Market, that all might buy vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, or money-vvorth, things of such high price, no man speakes of them, or for them, because they see no need of any such commodities.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In his calling, knovv him by clogging himselfe vvith too much businesse: an euident signe of an earthly heart, in vvhich the Word cannot thriue. <hi>Martha</hi> troubles and distracts her selfe vvith many
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18777:114"/>
things, and so slippes the opportunity of hearing Christ: so, when men surcharge themselues, and in hope of gaine, grapple in so much businesse, as they leaue from their affaires no conuenient time and leisure for the seruice of God, in publike or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, but God offers the meanes of saluation in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, they cannot intend it, hauing mo irons in the fire; the instruction and prayers of the family are interrupted, and no time is left for Gods Worship in the family: or the world affoords no time to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on what they haue heard; all the thoughts put into their hearts by a good Sermon, dye as a sparke for want of blowing. Heere is a sure note of the Word choked: Choke the worship of God at home, it is choked also in Gods House, and in publike.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Vniust getting or sparing of riches argue the choking of the Word: when men can dig downe to hell, or fall downe before the diuell for wealth. For, had the Word any place in mens hearts, they would not vse iniustice, or any vnlawfull meanes to get ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: knowing that the Lord will auenge all such things. So are they as wickedly couetous in sauing and sparing, when iust and reasonable causes in the Common-wealth, or God and good causes call for it: as numbers are prodigall enough, when the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell or their lusts call for pounds, that grudge at a penny parting for God, or any good purpose.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When a man, by reason of his wealth, growes either secure in his course, or licentious in his sinne, or scornefull of admonition, or hatefull of reproofe, or puts off duties wherein the Word is cleare euen to his conscience, that either hee will not vndertake
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18777:115"/>
all, or not yet, or not at all: This cleares to such a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that many thornes lye on his heart, and haue beset him to hinder obedience.<note place="margin">

            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">4. <hi>Remedies against cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thorns.</hi>
               </note>1. <hi>Consideration:</hi> that aboue all men, rich men should embrace the Word, and goe on cheerfully to heauen. For to whom God hath been more bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, they are bound to bee more dutifull.<note place="margin">Luk. 12.48.</note> 
               <hi>To whom much is giuen, of them much is required and expected.</hi> Besides, they are more free to good duties, not so straitly tyed to bodily labour for their present main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, are not burthened with so many distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons how to liue, as poorer men. And further, they must giue account for more time, more opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of well-doing, more ability to further the duties of piety, and workes of mercy, than others. How then will they answere it, if they seldomer heare, know lesse, obey lesse, and sinne more than others? Therefore in the first place consider seriously of the large reckoning thou art to make for all thy large both receits and expences.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Psal. 62.10</note>2. <hi>Circumspection</hi> is another helpe: <hi>If riches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, set not thy heart on them.</hi> Thou mayest haue ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in thy hand, not in thy heart: In thy hand, as a <hi>Steward</hi> in trusted to distribute; not in thy heart, as a <hi>Treasurer</hi> to hoord vp: In thy hand, to saue by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, what thou losest by reposing in thy heart: In
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:18777:115"/>
thy hand and power, so as the world be thine; not in thy heart, whereby thou becommest his: and yet the world so in thy hand thine, as still the euill of it bee his owne. Account it thine to dispose of, others to partake of.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Moderation of minde</hi> in hauing and inioying the profits of this life: 1. Cor. 7.30.—<hi>They that possesse, as if they possessed not, and they that vse this world, as if they vsed it not. Motiues</hi> hereunto. 1. Consider how much of all thou hast, thou hast deserued or art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of. <hi>Iacob</hi> confessed, <hi>O Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 32.10</note> 
               <hi>I am lesse than the least of thy mercies:</hi> and thou art lesse than <hi>Iacob.</hi> 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how little will serue nature, if a mans minde were not more crauing than his backe or belly. And yet grace is content with lesse. 3. He that desires but a little, cannot want much; and hee that wants not, is wealthy enough: as he is great enough that is his owne master, and can command his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. Consider <hi>Agurs</hi> request, Prou. 30.8. 4. If God giue thee not much, but scant thee in the things of this life, and it make it precious and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it is all one. A little box of Diamonds is more precious than a Mountaine of lead.<note place="margin">Pro. 17.1.</note> 
               <hi>Better is a dry morsell with peace,</hi> that is, of mind and conscience, <hi>than a stalled Oxe with contention.</hi> And if hee haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen this little as a pledge of a better inheritance, bee contented, yea thankfull, that thou art an heire in right, though not in possession. 5. Consider that it is an high poynt of Christian wisdome, if the estate and condition be not to a mans minde, to bring his minde to his estate:<note place="margin">Phil. 4.11.</note> as <hi>Paul had learned in all estates to be content.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:18777:116"/>4. <hi>Christian couetousnesse</hi> is a forcible meanes to draw out these thornes out of the heart: and hath these properties. 1. It makes God the portion, and accounts not him happy that hath wealth enough; but as <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psalm. 144. vlt. <hi>Blessed is the people whose God is the Lord.</hi> 2. It couets that which he may haue both heere and hereafter. It is best coueting of that, which a man may haue heere, and carry away with him. 3. Because it knowes it must leaue these things behinde, and cannot carry them away, it will bee sure to carry the comfort of them out of the world, by wise and prouident disposing of them to God, his Church, and seruants. 4. It is assured it shall be countable for all; and therfore is more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to giue a good account of a little, than to make it more. There is greater praise in managing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle well, than in getting much together, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so well.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. To checke the foolish conceit of carnall rich men: who thinke themselues the onely happy men, because of their wealth. To whom I say, (yet not I, but the Lord) If thy conscience can charge thee of deceitfull getting thy wealth, God is greater than thy conscience: and, as <hi>Iudas</hi> now thinkes his thirty pieces dearely earned; so shalt thou one day, which will marre all thy mirth. But if thou hast got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them neuer so fairely, if thou hast stucke thy selfe fast in this thicke clay, and hast laid for thy selfe of them a log in the way to heauen, goe and boast of thy happinesse, which hath made thee most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, proud, secure, licentious, and choked the good Word in thy heart. I say to thee, it had beene
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:18777:116"/>
good for thee thou hadst neuer seene penny of thy wealth, and that thou haddest liued in beggery all thy dayes. For that might haue drawne thee neere God, at least not haue driuen thee so farre from him. Thou shalt curse the day that euer thou haddest a penny in thy hand, or heart: that euer thou dotedst vpon so base pelfe, to make thee forget thy selfe and thy God so farre: that euer thou didst so ouerload thy selfe with wealth and wrath. For all thy present ioy in thy wealth, because it keepes the Word out of thy heart, will be as bitter to thee as wormewood, when thou shalt see the same wealth keepe thy soule out of heauen, which in earth kept the Word out of thy soule: and thou shalt bewaile thy lost estate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastingly, when thou shalt see, that had it not been for thy wealth, thou mightest haue been saued.</p>

For commonly the effect of affluence and abundance, is, to say with <hi>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord?</hi> As in Ierem. 5.7. <hi>When I fed them to the full, they rose vp like fed horses, euery one neighed after his neighbours wife,</hi> and committed most brutish sinnes.</p>

               </note> in three respects: 1. <hi>In regard of themselues,</hi> to thinke of them better than they bee; yea, to thinke basely of grace and the things of heauen, in respect of the profits of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18777:118"/>
this life. This was a brand of profanenesse in <hi>Esau,</hi> Gen. 25.32. <hi>What is this birth-right in comparison of the pottage?</hi> So of all profane men, who despise the blessing for the backe and belly, and things of this present life, and set more by an Oxe or two, than by the Kings Supper. A generall disease of most men, esteeming riches the greatest blessing that is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained on earth, and finding the sweetest content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in them. 2. <hi>In regard of our selues,</hi> and our owne estate. They commonly make a man thinke himselfe better than he is: Hee can perswade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe he is highly in Gods fauour, because hee is rich, and hold himselfe contented with a false felicity, which hinders him from seeking to better his estate. Whereas not being of themselues good in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they cannot make him better that hath them: and <hi>Salomon</hi> tels vs, that these <hi>outward things befall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to all,</hi> Eccles. 9.2. How many delude themselues, while they say, If I were not a good man, God would not blesse my labours, so blessing themselues in their riches? And many thinke they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their wealth of God,<note place="margin">Zech. 11.5</note> and thanke God <hi>for all,</hi> when God gaue them little or none of them, but a great part of it is the diuels wages, or the worlds wages for some seruice of iniquity. And, were not his iudgement blinded, hee could not looke on his wealth, but withall on his sinne and wretchednesse in getting and holding it: and so indeed esteeme himselfe so much the worse by his wealth, as he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but not any whit the better. 3. <hi>In regard of others,</hi> they deceiue vs of true iudgement and discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. They make vs thinke, such as inioy most
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:18777:118"/>
wealth, to be the happyest men, and they most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that most want it: Whereas wee cannot giue instance of more happy men, than those that wanted it: as <hi>Lazarus</hi> an happy Saint, which wanted crums; and the Apostles happy men, when they said, <hi>Siluer and gold haue we none:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 3.6.</note> and none more miserable than they that had most of them; as <hi>Nimrod, Ismael, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau, Saul, Ahab, Baltazer, Herod</hi>; And the greatest at this day against the Church, The Turke, and the Pope, with their adherents, haue the greatest part of the world in their possession. And surely if these things made men most happy, God would not cast them so liberally on the worst men. For wise men giue to swine but draffe, and swill, and huskes, but prouide better for their children and seruants.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Riches <hi>deceiue vs</hi> of our saluation:<note place="margin">5 <hi>Of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi>
               </note> according to that of <hi>Salomon,</hi> Prou. 10.16. <hi>The reuenues of the wicked tend vnto sinne.</hi> 1. While our corruptions make them snares to take and hold vs in manifold lusts: <hi>To transgresse for a morsell of bread,</hi> Prou. 28.21. To become instruments of cruelty, pride, iniustice, security, licentiousnesse, couering sinne with money. To catch at shadowes, and lose the things of the life to come: as our Sauiour implies in that speech, <hi>What shall it profit a man to win the whole world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16.26</note> 
               <hi>and lose his owne soule?</hi> Lastly, while they take vp the heart so, as the Word shall bee no further taken in, than shall serue for their commodities. 2. While they rob vs of many graces, they must needs also rob vs of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: as 1. Of faith: they make men say to the wedge of gold, <hi>Thou art my hope,</hi> the staffe of my life, and the stay of my posterity. 2. Of humility: before
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:18777:119"/>
wealth came, they were humble, meeke, and gentle; now they are proud, disdainfull, scornfull. 3. Of zeale: wealth in many hath beene as cold water to quench their zeale, who formerly were most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and forward. 4. Of patience: they make the minde soft, delicate, effeminate, that it cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly beare any thing for Gods cause. 5. Of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full expecting Christs comming to Iudgement: they make the remembrance of death terrible and bitter. 6. Of perseuerance: <hi>Demas</hi> will forsake the truth rather than his wealth. And most Apostates haue been rich men.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The other generall poynt proposed, is, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> or <hi>wherein</hi> riches without grace doe thus euery way deceiue vs. And that is by false promises, and false performances.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Riches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of</hi> 6. <hi>things.</hi>
               </note>1. They promise contentment, and saciety, but performe nothing but vexation and discontent. As a man hauing the Dropsie, drinkes still, but is not satisfied by drinking, but the more he drinkes, the more he thirsts: so the worldly minde, the more superfluity, the lesse saciety. And needs must that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire be infinite, which is not satiate with God, who onely is infinite: thinking none in worse estate than himselfe, if any bee better. The heart is larger than the barnes, or chests.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They promise peace and security, which indeed they neuer bring nor allow him that doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime warre against them. For they lay men open to all Satans snares, 1. Tim. 6.9. and to all the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of men: make them obnoxious to malice, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, and theeuery: and as his largenesse and thicknesse
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:18777:119"/>
of boughes makes euery one desire to lop him, so oftentimes hee falls downe by his owne waight; whereas without his wealth, hee might haue stood longer. 2. King. 25.5. The wealthinesse and stateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Ierusalem, did but toll on <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to spoyle it: and when it was taken, the King, and the rich men were led away captiue, but the poore were left in the Land, and liued better than euer. Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of wealth proues oftentimes but an halter, or a weapon of death for the owner.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They promise freedome and liberty, but make men drudges to the world, and slaues to wealth, yea, to sinne and Satan for wealth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They promise fitnesse and forwardnesse to doe good, that they will fit a man to duties of piety and charity. Many say, If they had wherewithall, they would relieue the poore, maintaine the Ministery, and doe more good with their goods, than they see others doe. But as the Mountaines, in the bowels of which is most gold, or siluer, are most barren: So they that abound in wealth, for most part are most fruitlesse and vnprofitable, in respect of fruits of grace or charity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They promise good wages for faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the world; but deceiue many with false wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. They pay <hi>Achan</hi> for his seruice, with losse of his Wedge, and life. <hi>Gehezi,</hi> in stead of wealth, for his lye, is paid with a Leprosie, that stucke to him and his posterity for euer. <hi>Saul</hi> with losse of all, for sauing a few beasts against Gods Commandement. <hi>Ahab,</hi> in stead of accesse to his Kingdome, for a small plat of <hi>Naboths,</hi> lost the whole Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:18777:120"/>6. They promise continuance, but are <hi>vncertaine riches,</hi> 1. Tim. 6.17. and haue wings to fly away, when a man hath most need of comfort. Men thinke they haue got a Fee-simple, and made sure for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity: but it is but a mouable, thou must leaue it where thou gotst it. No man can assure himselfe to hold his wealth till night: though the foole thinkes he layes vp for many yeeres. One sparke of fire may suddenly ouermaster a mans whole substance. One vnaduised word or action may confiscate his whole estate, and of an happy man in his owne eyes make him a begger, a prisoner, without hold of wealth or life. Prou. 23.5. <hi>Wilt thou cast thine eyes vpon wealth which is nothing? for riches taketh her to her wings, and flyeth away.</hi> What are these <hi>wings</hi> of wealth? <hi>Answ.</hi> Rust, moth, theeues, vsurers, fire, sword, oppressors, Lawyers, sicknesse and death: Other Eagles haue but two wings, this hath an hundred. And oftentimes it goes into the hand of strangers, yea very enemies: as a lost Hawke, hauing lost his Master, is taken vp by them whom he thought not of: Iob 27.17. <hi>Hee may prepare it, but the iust shall put it on, and the innocent shall diuide the siluer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus let a man serue an hard Apprentiship to the world, he shall be deceiued in his wages; as <hi>Iacob</hi> by <hi>Laban</hi>; and being deceiued of his expectation, must content himselfe, in stead of faire <hi>Rachel,</hi> with <hi>Leah</hi> for his labour.</p>

               <note place="margin">5. <hi>Rules to preserue vs from the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of riches.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Vse</hi> That riches may not deceiue vs of so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things with so faire promises, consider these Rules.</p>
            <p>First, esteeme them as they are, and as God and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:18777:120"/>
his Word esteemes them, and not as the world doth.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Esteeme them as they are indeed, not as in mens esteeme.</hi>
               </note> Worldly men put faire titles vpon them: as first, they call them <hi>goods,</hi> whereas indeed they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse to most that enioy them. Secondly, they call them <hi>substance,</hi> and those that haue them, <hi>Men of good substance,</hi> or <hi>Substantiall men:</hi> whereas Gods Word calls them <hi>shadowes,</hi> and the pursuit of them, the <hi>running after a shadow,</hi> Psal. 39.6. It calls them <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> Eccles. 1.2. that is, not onely subiect to vanity, as all creatures be, Rom. 8. but make a vaine shew of much good, which they doe not performe. Hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so are they called <hi>lyes,</hi> and <hi>nothing,</hi> without substance, Prou. 23.5. Psal. 62.9. Either take these things on our Fathers iudgement, or bee deceiued with toyes still. The iudgement of the world is cleane contrary to the iudgement of Gods Spirit, who is so farre from calling them substance, as that they are made <hi>non-ens,</hi> a meere nothing. Thirdly, men call them <hi>profits:</hi> but how vnprofitable are they! 1. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit not in grace, but are step-mothers vnto it: and therefore the poorest men are chosen to be richest in grace: And generally, are not the richest in wealth, poorest in good workes, poorest Christians? 2. They profit not in the day of sicknesse: Prou. 11.4. <hi>Riches auaile not in the day of wrath.</hi> No money will buy the fauour of a wrathfull King; nor buy out the paine of one tooth. 3. They profit not in the day of death: cannot buy one houre for repentance, not a quarter of an houre to set the house in order. 4. They profit not in the Day of Iudgement: a whole world cannot buy out one sinne vnrepented of. Lastly, men call wealth, <hi>gaine,</hi> as if all were gaine that is gotten:
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:18777:121"/>
But 1. What is the gaine of an handfull of earth, perhaps with the losse of the soule, and heauen? 2. Our Sauiour Christ, who best knew what riches are, oppos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th them to the true gaine, Luk. 16.11, 12.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if they could buy pardon of sin, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit eternall life, or make a purchase of heauen, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists teach vs, then were they goods indeed, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and profits, and gaine: but these titles which the Scriptures affoord them, shew vs plainely how farre they be from such effects.</p>

               </note>2. <hi>Rule.</hi> Take them from God in the right ends, for which God hath reached them to thee: Not to riot on lusts, or imploy them as a furtherance to sin; Not to lay them in thy heart, a roome reserued for better purposes; Not to make thee proud, and swell thy heart, to insult against others that haue not thy measure:<note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">Prou. 39.</note> in vpholding his seruice and glory. 2. For the necessary and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest sustentation of thy selfe; and thy family, in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, humility, and moderation. Thus Parents may lay vp for their children. 3. For the common good: to vphold the good estate of the Common-wealth, in publike payments, tributes, taxes, &amp;c. Rom. 13.6. 4. For the reliefe of the poore members of Iesus Christ: to bee <hi>rich in good workes, to doe good and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute,</hi> 1. Timoth. 6.18. And thus to become (as <hi>Iob</hi>) fathers to the poore, eyes to the blinde, feet to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:18777:121"/>
the lame: that the loynes of the poore may blesse vs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Rule.</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Looke on them as receits.</hi>
               </note> Consider seriously with thy selfe these three things: Who thou art that hast receiued wealth: What thou hast receiued: And on what condition thou hast receiued.</p>
            <p>First, Who art thou that hast receiued wealth? 1. Thou art not an Owner, but a Steward: the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and wealth is thy Masters: thou must not hold it to thy selfe, nor lay it out but at his appoyntment. 2. Thou art not a Free-holder, but a Tenant at will: thou sittest not in thine owne, but owest homage, rent, suit and seruice. 3. Thou art not a Citizen, but a stranger here, in a strange Countrey. If thy wealth were thy owne, and might stay with thee, yet canst not thou stay with it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what hast thou receiued? Goods, thou sayest. But I say, Thy wealth is not good in it nature, (as not euill) but in it selfe at the best, indifferent, and onely good in a good vse. A worldlings goods are neuer goods, till he come to dye: for then they are set at liberty to doe others good, though not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. They are not good to all men, but to good men onely: nor good, further than they are seruants to a further good, and helps to the chiefe Good, euen God himselfe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, on what condition hast thou receiued them? Namely, to be countable for them. And what account can hee giue, that hath defrauded both his Master, and his fellow-seruants? How dares a seruant bring that into accounts, which hee hath spent on whores, gaming, drunkennesse, Dice and Cards,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18777:122"/>
bolles and bowles, contentions, and friuolous suites of Law, &amp;c? Hence when at some time God calls the conscience to reckoning afore-hand, that which was so sweet a morsell, vpbraids him, and is ready to choke him, as <hi>Iudas</hi>; and as the Prophet saith, Ezek. 7.19. <hi>They shall cast their siluer into the streets, and their gold shall be cast a farre off.</hi> A worldly and wicked conscience once awaked, shall wish the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster cast into the sea, or vnder the bottome of the Mountaines, so it might escape the account and reckoning.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">4. <hi>Looke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them on true and substantiall riches.</hi>
               </note>4. <hi>Rule.</hi> Cast thine eye vpon true and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall riches. First, God in Christ is true riches: what can be wanting to make a man fully happy, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyes God as his portion? Secondly, Christ himselfe is the true Treasure, in whom all treasures are hid; and the Pearle, for which the wise Merchant selleth all, and <hi>Paul</hi> counts all but drosse and dung. What a world of wealth is in the blood of Christ, one drop of which redeemed a whole world? How rich is his prayer and intercession?<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.6</note> Thirdly, <hi>Godlinesse is the chiefe gaine</hi>; that is, the knowledge and profession of the Gospell: this hath the possession of the rich gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, Faith, Loue, Hope, Patience, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; in comparison of which, gold and pearles are but drosse. Fourthly, the Treasure of heauen is worth looking after: Col. 3.1. To <hi>haue the conuersation in heauen,</hi> Phil. 3.20. <hi>Sell all thou hast</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this wealth is <hi>vndeceiueable,</hi> performes all that it promiseth, contentment, perfect freedome, sound and stable peace, fitnesse to doe good, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant

               <hi>Answ.</hi> No: for 1. <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished aboue all men now liuing, with pleasures and delights in that Garden of pleasure. 2. Since the Fall, the Lord hath still deckt the earth with most delectable flowres, in their seuerall beauties, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of colours and smells, to delight the senses of man: And he hath filled the aire with sweet and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious birds. 3. The Lord that could now feed vs with one kinde of meate, as Israel in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, allowes vs much variety of the creatures for our honest delight: And though hee could preserue vs with water, yet he allowes vs more pleasant drink, and in our feasts giues vs wine in varieties.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:18777:123"/>
of Assur, Gen. 49.20. that hee should giue <hi>pleasures for a King:</hi> that is, his Countrey should abound with delicate fruits, acceptable and fit for Kings. In which phrase we see, that Kings haue more right to inioy pleasures, than ordinary men: and Deut. 33.24. <hi>He shall dip his foot in oyle.</hi> 5. The Lord himselfe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth some festiuities and solemne feasts, in which a more liberall and delightfull vse of the creatures is requisite: as Nehem. 8.10. <hi>Goe, and eate of the fat, and drinke of the sweet: for this is a day holy vnto the Lord.</hi> 6. The Spirit of God concludeth, (though some learned otherwise expound it, as the Atheists speech brought in by a <hi>Prosopopoeia:</hi>) Eccles. 3. vlt. that <hi>nothing is better, than that a man should reioyce in his affaires; for that is his portion.</hi> And who is worthy to enioy Gods blessings about him, in wife, children, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, calling and estate, that doth not reioyce in the same?</p>
            <p>So as the thing, which our Text, and this whole ensuing treatise condemneth, is not any lawfull and allowed pleasure, of any kinde, but that pleasure which choketh the Word of God, as thornes doe seed; whether vnlawfull pleasures, or lawfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures vnlawfully vsed.</p>
            <p>Which I would haue obserued by the way, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue a scandall cast vpon Religion and godly life, that it is altogether vnpleasant, and heauie, and strips a man of all delight. This is not so. But first, <hi>All the wayes of wisedome are wayes of pleasure,</hi> Prou. 3.17.

And in <hi>Herod:</hi> he heard <hi>Iohn</hi> gladly, reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, and did many things, Mark. 6.20. but the pleasure of his brothers wife made him cast <hi>Iohn</hi> in prison, yea and behead him too: which he added a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all his sinnes. Iudg. 16.17. <hi>Samson</hi> had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken a most sacred profession, of the Nazarites, in which he was a most eminent type of Christ.

But that impotent and base lust, and sottish attending his pleasure in <hi>Delilahs lap,</hi> how did it make him forget the Law of God, and so inslaue him, as hee must needs tell her all that was in his heart, till God was gone from him! 1. Tim. 5.6, 11. What made the widowes to <hi>breake their faith</hi> giuen to Christ, but <hi>wantonnesse,</hi> and <hi>liuing in pleasures?</hi>

How the loue of pleasant meate set the loue of good <hi>Isaac</hi> vpon him whom God hated, see Genes. 25.28. And <hi>Salomon</hi> tells vs the danger of prouing the heart with pleasures, Eccles. 2.2. they brought him to bee mad with them: these were honest and lawfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures:
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:18777:124"/>
but himselfe tells vs, that as they entred into the heart, so godlinesse decayed. For as theeues set vpon true men to rob and bind them: so pleasures assaulting good men, binde them, and rob them, yea often wound them, onely kill them not. And hence it is, that in the profession of Religion, some are found <hi>louers of pleasure more than of God,</hi> 2. Tim. 3.4. and holding a forme of godlinesse, and proclaiming a defiance of vain pleasure, are yet so moyled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with them, as they grow heauie in good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and drawne on with the perswasions of these pleasing Orators. Had not the Disciples renounced all for Christ? Yes; <hi>Master, wee haue forsaken all, and followed thee.</hi> But yet doe wee not see them long, who should be superiour, and contend for greatnesse one with another, and affect pompe and high place euen in the Kingdome of God, where the smallest is the greatest?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. Pleasures make,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reasons</hi> 7.</note> that men cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Word. Some are so carried away with sports, that neither weeke-day, nor scarce the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath can draw them away to any better duty. Their delights are so fastened in their hearts, as nothing can fasten on them. Their thoughts doe so attend vpon pleasures, that all other thoughts, tending to the bettering of their estate, are vnpleasing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They make, that men cannot conceiue the Word aright. The Word offereth pleasures at Gods right hand, which is an obiect of faith: But the man trampled on by pleasures, becomes sensuall, and iudgeth of all things spoken, by his corrupt sense, and carnall reason: For his desire is to heare, <hi>not
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:18777:125"/>
what is best,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Non quae optima, sed quae sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uissima.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>but what is sweetest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Pleasures, where they doe preuaile, make men securely contemne the Word. They cast the heart on sleepe, and make it vnwatchfull against the <hi>threats of God,</hi> Amos 6.1, 3. Woe to them that are at ease in Sion: that <hi>put farre off the euill day,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch to the seat of iniquity. Whence our Sauiour exhorts, to take heed lest the heart bee oppressed with these excessiue pleasures, and <hi>so that day come vnawares:</hi> as it did on the old world. And no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, seeing they can brawne the heart, and make it senselesse against <hi>the iudgements and scourges of God.</hi> Esa. 5.12. The Harpe, the Violl, and Fluit, and wine are in their feasts: but <hi>they regard not the worke of the Lord, nor consider the operation of his hands.</hi> Famous in this kinde is the example of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> the Lord sent him his Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> to expound his dreame, that he must be a beast for seuen yeeres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: yet within one twelue moneths hee forgot all, and said, <hi>Is not this great Babel, &amp;c?</hi> Dan. 4.25, 26.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Pleasures preuailing in the heart, doe make men hate the Word, as a bitter and deadly enemy. The Word of God is the sword of the Spirit, to cut off these lusts which are as deare to them as their eyes or hands: And therefore it is so despised and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They thrust out the Word, which reuealeth and offereth the pleasures of a better world. <hi>The heart of the foole is in the house of mirth,</hi> Eccles. 7.6. Yea, though God call to mourning, and fasting, or any occasion (whatsoeuer) come; hee hath set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18777:125"/>
on a merry pin, hee cannot abide to heare of change, so he may hold his pleasure heere still. Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon will be <hi>a Lady for euer,</hi> and set her minde on no other things besides, nor remember the end: Gods Phisicians would haue healed her, but she would not be healed; <hi>she laid none of those things to heart,</hi> Esa. 47.7, 8. therefore her end was vtter desolation.</p>
            <p n="6">6. These pleasures are seldome procured without sinne, being the ordinary baits of Satan cast before men; which while they play withall, and nibble at them, they are catcht in his snare: as <hi>Eue</hi> by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which seemed pleasant to the eye and taste. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> knew there was nothing of so much force to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure the Israelites to Idolatry, and to make a breach among them, and so set God against them, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sot them with vnlawfull pleasures with the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Moab: then was Israel presently coupled to <hi>Baal Peor,</hi> Numb. 25.1, 2, 3. Thus Satan (as a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Fisher) baytes his hooke with pleasure, and catcheth innumerable.</p>
            <p n="7">7. These pleasures are of great strength to hold men in sinne, against all the threatenings of the Word, and inuitations to repentance: will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the heart to thinke of death, and iudgement, and accounts to be giuen: yea, they make him maintaine a continuall <hi>warre in himselfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 4.1.</note> against his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, being carried headlong to such things as seeme pleasant, delectable, glorious, and profitable. And against others also: This man will hate his Preacher to the death, because hee condemnes his vnlawfull pleasure. If <hi>Iohn</hi> dare say to <hi>Herod, It is not lawfull for thee to haue her,</hi> it shall cost him
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18777:126"/>
deare. As for his poore neighbours: hee will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his pleasure by oppression, cruelty, iniury, any thing: he cares not how sorrowfull and vnhappy hee make many other mens liues, so hee may enioy his supposed pleasure. <hi>Iudas</hi> must haue his thirty siluer pieces, though it cost Christ his life, and himselfe his soule, and fill all his fellow-Disciples with much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse. Lastly, such a man is well content to indure any vassalage and slauery vnder Satan, so he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy a present pleasure: and Satan is well content on that condition to allow it him; dealing heerein as <hi>Cyrus</hi> with the Lydians,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Justi. lib</hi> 1</note> who hauing ouercome them, (to gratifie and gaine them sure to himselfe:) allowes them to eate, and drinke, to feast and play, with all kinds of sports, games, and gambals; but in the meane time takes away their horses, and armour, so as they are vnable euer to thinke of recouering their former liberty.</p>
            <p>And therefore, seeing these pleasures hinder men from attending and vnderstanding the Word, make them securely contemne and hate the Word, thrust out the pleasures of the world to come, are seldome procured without sinne, and are of such strength to hold them in sinne: we may well conclude with the Apostle, 1. Pet. 2.11. that <hi>they fight against the soule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse.</hi>
               </note>And seeing they doe so, wee must <hi>abstaine from them.</hi> The seruice of <hi>lust and diuers pleasures,</hi> is noted for a course of the vnregenerate, Tit. 3.3. And these two goe hand in hand, <hi>disobedient, seruing pleasures.</hi> Therefore beware of the preuailing of pleasures, and as thou meanest the Word should profit in thy hart,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18777:126"/>
and tendrest thy owne saluation, weed out this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousnesse, a meere choke-weede of grace.</p>
            <p>Heere for thy further helpe in so necessary, and withall so difficult a duty, I will set downe three things: 1. <hi>Motiues,</hi> to resist these pleasures. 2. <hi>Markes</hi> of a man, in whom they preuaile aboue the Word. 3. <hi>Meanes,</hi> or Rules how we may inioy them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out choking goodnesse.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Motiues,</hi> or reasons to disswade from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of pleasures, are sixe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Consider where thou art.<note place="margin">6. <hi>Motiues disswading the pursuit of pleasures.</hi>
               </note> We are now banished out of the Garden of pleasure: we are in this world, kept out of Paradise with the shaking of a sword: and doe we expect another Paradise in this Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>Baca,</hi> and valley of teares? Wast thou not borne weeping, into the valley of weeping? Shalt thou not dye, and go forth weeping? and canst thou liue in laughing and merriment? While thou art heere obnoxious to so many miseries, laden, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loding thy selfe with so many sinnes, conflicting with so many tentations, beset with so many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: canst thou bee so senslesse, or mad rather, to giue vp thy selfe to carnall pleasures and delights? Remember thou art now in Babylon, and sittest by the water-side of afflictions. A member of the Church, that now remembers Sion, and his owne Countrey, whence he is for the time banished, will rather sit downe and weepe, and mourne in the Countrey where they be strangers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The vigill must goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-day: the fast, before the feast.</hi>
               </note> and cannot sing the songs of God, rather than addict himselfe to carnall pleasures, and profane delights. This seemes to be the Apostles argument, 1. Pet. 2.11. <hi>As stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:18777:127"/>
and pilgrims,</hi> abstaine from fleshly lusts. Now a stranger lookes for no great matters in his iourney, nor expects pleasure till he commeth home.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider what little content or saciety there is in these pleasures. Let him try this conclusion who will, after <hi>Salomon:</hi> he shall finde hee shall sooner surfet of pleasures, than fill himselfe with them. One sweet morsell driues downe another, and still is the carnall heart vnsatiable. And it is with a man drunke with pleasures, as a man drunke with wine: his drunkennesse increaseth his thirst, but quencheth it not. Let a man compasse his pleasure in any kinde, he may thinke, the attaining of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire will quench his desire: but it prooues but as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the Smith casts on his coles; it seemes to abate and quench the fire, but it makes the inward heate and concupiscence more burning and raging than before.</p>
            <p>Besides, the eye of the wise is cleere to discerne how little of true pleasure a carnall minde is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of: and they themselues, who most enioy world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasures, can sometimes conceiue their owne ioy to be onely in the face, and not in the heart: and that their laughter is like to madnesse, from the teeth outward, and not so inward as it seemes.</p>
            <p>And seeing such pleasures as delight the carnall appetite, are seldome compassed without sinne, what true ioy can be there, where, in the heart, is fixed a sting of sinne, which marreth all the sport? Or, if the delight be sinfull, the conscience that smarts not for it in inioying it, is the worse, benummed, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and farre from true ioy or pleasure, though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:18777:127"/>
delights tickle him neuer so much: He laughs as a man in paine being tickled, but his vexation within is neuer the lesse.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As there is little content in earthly pleasures, so is there lesse stability or continuance: <hi>the time is short,</hi> 1. Cor. 7.29. One well saith of pleasures, that they <hi>come like Oxen, slow and heauily,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dolor &amp; voluptas innicem ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt: Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptas.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>but goe away as Post-horses, all on the spurre,</hi> and stay not. How long doth the pleasure of most delicate drinke stay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the swallowing, or of the most sweet musike beyond the hearing; or the most odoriferous smels, longer than the flowre is held to the nose? Spend whole dayes and nights in merry sports, Playes, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: doth the delight last longer than the present fruition? And then leauing vs empty, doe they not recompence men with some sorrow and griefe, that they seeme now robbed, either of their pleasures, or of their time spent in, and for them? How truly are pleasure and sorrow called twinnes; no sooner is one borne, but the other holds his heele? Yea, the fairest and sweetest earthly pleasure is as hardly found without some molestation, as a Rose without his thorne. Make the world thy Paradise, and thy belly thy god; thy Paradise shall cast thee out shortly, and thy god which thou seruest, shall pay thee the wages of thy seruice, and then thou shalt see it was but <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> which is foure-fold. First, a voluptuous life is a walking vpon snares and ginnes, which the wisest
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18777:128"/>
and most oculate man hardly auoids without being taken. Alasse, how vaine is the pleasure of birds, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding about the snare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> immediatly shall bring them into the Fowlers bag! How vaine is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sport of fishes, playing with a deadly bait! So dangerous and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe is it, to addict our selues to these alluring baits of worldly pleasures. Now goe a while into your owne hearts, and see whether in those worldly pleasures you haue most swallowed, you haue not sometimes smarted: if not so, whether if there bee any smart in sinne, you had not cause by them. <hi>Be not like the horse or mule,</hi> Psal. 32.8. yet the poore beast hauing once falne into a hole, will not fall into the same hole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if he see it: and poore silly birds will auoid the same nets and ginnes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aues vagae in easdem pedicas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaque non incidunt.</hi> Hieron.</note> which had beset them.</p>
            <p>A <hi>second</hi> danger is, the slaying of the soule, by the pampering of the body. 1. Tim. 5.6. <hi>Delicate widowes are dead while they liue:</hi> there is no way to reconcile the seeming contradiction, but to say, that the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate liuing of these widowes depriued their soules of the life grace, &amp; Spirit of God: and so being dead in sin, &amp; in soule, were vtterly vnprofitable, vnmoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in duties of grace &amp; heauenly life: This fearfull estate, the following of pleasures brought them into.</p>
            <p>A <hi>third</hi> danger is, the losse and refusall of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ioyes and pleasures. For God is not so prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall of his best blessings, as to bestow them where himselfe shall be sure to haue least thankes for them, or themselues are vnder-valued. Shall <hi>Esau</hi> haue the birth-right, that preferres pottage before it? And shall hee haue heauenly treasures, and lasting ioyes committed to him, and thrust vpon him, that prefers
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18777:128"/>
euery trifling vanity, and base pleasure before them? A carnall man is a naturall foole: he had rather haue a piece of painted glasse, than a Diamond: and would a wise man bestow a precious Pearle on such a foole? No, let him haue his choyce, and enuy it not to him, but pitty him, that with <hi>Esops</hi> Cocke, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnes a Pearle, and scrapes after a Barly corne. The misery of this man is, to be delighted with his misery.</p>
            <p>A <hi>fourth</hi> danger is, the indissoluble connexion of pleasure and iudgement, to them that are louers of pleasures more than of God or their duty. If thou wilt eate the forbidden fruit, and reach foorth thy hand beyond Gods allowance, to please thy senses, in the day thou so doest, thou shalt dye the death. If the Pastor will take his ease, and faile in his paines, the blood of his people shal be required at his hands. If the young man will take his pleasure, and walke in the sight of his owne eyes, he must <hi>remember,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 11.9</note> 
               <hi>that for all this he must come to Iudgement.</hi> Luk. 16.25. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable bids the rich man remember, Thou hadst thy pleasure here, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> paine: now therfore thou must be tormented, and he comforted. And woe to you that laugh now, for ye shall weepe and mourne, Chap. 6.25.</p>
            <p>Nay, not onely are these two tyed fast together, as with an Adamant chaine; but euery dramme of this sweet pleasure, shall be recompensed with a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of sorrow and griefe: As he that by a moments delight in meate and drinke, hath surcharged his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make, and surfetted himselfe, must recompence halfe an houres pleasure, with some moneths of deadly paine.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:18777:129"/>5. Consider the difference betweene godly and wicked men: One hath lusts and pleasures, the other serues lusts and pleasures.

            <p>The ordinary estate and condition of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is, to suffer aduersity, Heb. 11.25. The way to heauen is all strawed with crosses.

               </note> 
               <hi>Markes</hi> of a man, in whom pleasures preuaile aboue the Word. And they are seuen.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An vnder-valuing of better pleasures; as of Gods House in earth, or in heauen: when men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of no such pleasure, as that they enioy in earth and earthly things. This marke is giuen, 2. Pet. 2.13. They shall receiue the wages of vnrighteousnesse, as those who account it <hi>pleasure to liue deliciously for a season,</hi> that is, when men, as Epicures, place their feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in present pleasures, which is indeed the life fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for brutes, (whose soule, if it be not their sense, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not beyond their sense:) then for men, who are not onely reasonable, but Christians.</p>
            <p>Yet many such there are in the world:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-value better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, fiue wayes.</hi>
               </note> as 1. When men are heauie to the Temple: which argues no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in Gods presence, nor in the presence of Christ,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:18777:130"/>
who walkes in the midst of the seuen golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticks, Reuel. 1. Nor in the presence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who blowes especially there: nor in the presence of the Angels, who desire and stoupe downe to see the things handled, 1. Pet. 1.12. nor of the Saints, who are said to <hi>meet the Lord in Sion,</hi> Psal. 84.7. Now where could a good heart with more pleasure rest it selfe, than in Gods resting place, in Christs society, in the way of the Spirit, in the Ministery of Angels, and fellowship of Saints?<note place="margin">Psal. 84.10</note> Did not the Prophet count one day in Gods house better than a thousand else-where? And did he not professe, Psa. 26.8. Lord, I haue loued the habitation of thy House, and the place where thine honour dwelleth? And was it not prophesied of all Beleeuers, that they should assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as Doues fly to their windowes, and as clouds dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the winde, Esa. 60.8?</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the delight is more in temporall food, than in spirituall; and a man can bee more ioyfull at his owne table, than at Gods. Whereas <hi>Dauid</hi> found nothing so sweet to his taste, as the Word, &amp; prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it before his daily food; yea, before his sleepe, Psal. 119.148. Will not euery man say, that to taste how good God is, is the best taste? yet most men taste more sweetnesse in the white of an egge, than in him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When men haue more delight in the diuels bookes, than in Gods: and can be more iolly in tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and shaking the cards and dice, than in turning and reading Gods Booke. Or to speake of more lawfull recreations than they; If a man take more pleasure in any recreation, than in better exercises,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:18777:130"/>
his pleasure is sinfull and choking.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When men take more pleasure in their speciall calling, than in their generall: in gathering money, than in gathering grace: in worldly riches, more than in heauenly; now it is choking. <hi>Dauid</hi> esteemed the Word aboue thousands of gold and siluer. The wise Merchant esteemed the Pearle aboue all his estate. And a good heart (as <hi>Paul</hi>) esteemes all things dung and losse, for Christ. And according to the estimate of things, is the pleasure and delight in them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When men preferre an empty ioy, aboue ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of ioy: the pleasures of Gods left hand, before those of his right, Psalm. 16.11. a drop of pleasure, before a riuer; and a drop of life in misery, before the Well of Life in mercy and glory, Psalm. 36.8, 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Marke.</hi> When men make light account of Gods Call, in respect of the call of their pleasures; let them be otherwise neuer so lawfull, now they are sinfull. Gods Commandements must stand by, while their pleasures command them. 1. Sam. 15.3. <hi>Saul</hi> had an expresse Commandement to smite <hi>Amalek,</hi> and haue no compassion on man, woman, infant, suckling, Oxe, or Sheepe. But it pleaseth <hi>Saul</hi> to haue compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on the King, and the fat beasts: A good booty: Hee shall enrich himselfe with the Kings ransome, and such a large prey will spare his owne beasts, at least serue him for sacrifice a long time. <hi>Lots</hi> wife had an expresse charge and menace, on paine of death, not to looke behind her: But the care of her house and goods, with the loue of her friends, made
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:18777:131"/>
her forget the Commandement, to her owne destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. God commands, not to sweare at all, but passe the ordinary speech by yea and nay: Yet men ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily sweare, and accustome themselues to breake the Commandement: Why? for it is their pleasure, and custome, and they cannot leaue it. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to doe no seruile worke on the Sabbath day, nor to meddle with the duties of the calling, <hi>no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worke:</hi> Oh but now it would pleasure my neighbour, and aduantage my selfe to serue a custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Now a man is at the command of his owne pleasure, and Gods Law must stand aside. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, not to runne easily out of our calling on the weeke-day, or if any time be to be spared, to redeeme it to the generall. But games, or sports, or drinking-company calls day by day: now farwell the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, Gods Booke, and counsell: farwell both callings, nothing can call so forcibly as his play and pastime; nothing so necessary, nothing so pleasing. What other is the cause of all adulteries, slanders, reuenges, railings, murthers, and effeminate conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among men, but that they are as slaues to their owne lusts, and the command of them, and Gods Commandements can take no place?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Marke,</hi> When a man will not bee at so much charge for God, for good duties, and his owne salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as for his pleasures and lusts. When men can waste and riot out abundance of money in feasting, gaming, excesse of apparell; but to maintaine Gods Worship, to feast or cloath the poore seruants of Christ, they haue no will or desire: nay, their hawkes and dogs are more chargeable to many, than
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:18777:131"/>
God himselfe, his seruice, and all the poore members of Iesus Christ. Let pastime call, there are pounds and pieces ready: But let the poore call, let the Law, and good order call for them, there are not pence wrung out: let Preachers call, not good words.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Marke.</hi> When a man cannot bee at so much leisure for God and good things, as for his owne pleasures, and carnall desires. Hee grudgeth no time spent in pleasure, but all, or the most time in Gods seruice is but lost. Hee can waste out houres, and weekes, and moneths, in sports, can sit nights and dayes at Cards, or Dice, or other vaine exercises; but with much tediousnesse sit out an houre in Gods House. He hath sundry houres in a day for himselfe or his friend, to communicate and talke together, to order family-businesses, but very seldome takes halfe an houre to conferre with God priuately, in reading the Scriptures, in prayer, meditation, or instructing his family: one halfe houre in a moneth is too-too much, and may not be spared. How little is God and his Word beholden to these men, who are vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to their pleasures?</p>
            <p>Yea, some are so dogged, and such enemies to goodnesse, that as they cannot take any time them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, so will they not bee perswaded to allow any time to others about them, for any good exercise. No time that their seruants and children waste o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, is comparably troublesome to them, as that which they imploy in reading, hearing, or such like exercises. So malignant is the constitution of many, that although their seruants would redeeme the houre of a Lecture, twice ouer in a weeke, yet
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:18777:132"/>
like hard task-masters, they will not affoord it at any hand, but esteeme of Gods Word and seruice as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 5.4, 17.</note> 
               <hi>Ye are too idle,</hi> and <hi>Moses and Aaron make the people idle</hi>; and so hold them straiter on that Day, though they remit all the weeke after. Let <hi>Pharaohs</hi> strokes warne them betime. It was noted a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion in <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe, to spend seuen yeers in building Gods House, and thirteene in his owne: Yet our times spend seuen, and thirteene in their owne houses, none, or very little in Gods.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Marke.</hi> When men shunne all molestation, and the meanes which would set them free from their sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uishnesse, and seruice of pleasures. When in Gods house they cannot endure such teaching, &amp; teachers, as would pull them both from vnlawfull pleasures, and the abuse of lawfull: Such men as <hi>Micah</hi> neuer prophesie good vnto them: For who would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue his eye pulled out, or part with his lusts as deare as his eyes? Hence are all the stirres and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults against godly Ministers: they would preuaile against wicked mens pleasures: but they will not bee tormented before their time: they will rather ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from Gods House hereafter, ordinarily and wilfully.</p>
            <p>So when men at home shunne all gracious and sauory communication, driuing away all mention of God from their tables, from their discourses, and please themselues in following vnsauory and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull, if not hurtfull speeches, all the day long. Also, when they distaste godly and fruitful company, by whom they might helpe their soules out of the snares they are in: the man is an abomination to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:18777:132"/>
them, that hath good &amp; sauory words in his mouth. Oh this is to binde him for the time to his good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour: hee must not sweare, nor iest, nor scorne, nor be loose and corrupt in his speeches; and then must he sew vp his lips, and say nothing. But loose and libertine company, that will sweare, and drinke, and game, and raile against these strict fellowes as fast as he, these are his delight: now he can be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and iolly, and as a fish in his owne element.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Marke.</hi> Immoderate sorrow when hee cannot obtaine his pleasure, is a note of a man subdued by pleasures, in whom Gods Word hath no part. 1. Kin. 21.4. <hi>Ahab</hi> is sicke, and cast vpon his bed, for <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths</hi> Vineyard: for he cannot tell how to compasse it. All <hi>Hamans</hi> honour and fauour with the King pleased him not, because <hi>Mordecai</hi> bowed not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. 2. Sam. 13.2, 4. <hi>Amnon</hi> was vexed sore for his sister <hi>Thamar,</hi> grew sicke and leane. He that inioyes a thing moderately, can bee moderate in the forgoing of it: What I lightly loue, I can lightly leaue. But if <hi>Dauid</hi> loue <hi>Absalom</hi> too well, hee will grieue because he cannot dye with him, nay for him: <hi>Would God I had dyed for thee, O Absalom, my sonne, my sonne.</hi> Affections are so much the more impotent in the losse, as they are more potent in the fruition of any thing.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Marke.</hi> The immoderate feare of death, as the end of all pleasures and delights: the memory of it is bitter to a man ouer-ioyed in his pleasures, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching of it dreadfull, but the stroke of it most dolefull: because he hath no better, or other pleasure in his heart for the present, than that which the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18777:133"/>
world affoordeth, which hath gone with him as long as she could; and much lesse any expectation of any hereafter.</p>
            <p>These are sure markes of him that is ouercarried with pleasures against the Word.</p>
            <p n="3">

               </note>The <hi>first Rule</hi> concernes the person affecting plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, who must looke hee be a sanctified man. For (saith the Apostle) onely <hi>to the pure, all things are pure,</hi> Tit. 1.15. Neither is there any true peace or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, without peace of conscience, and the sence of remission of sinnes:<note place="margin">1. <hi>The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must be sanctified.</hi>
               </note> for sinne thrusts out true plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and here we say, as <hi>Iehu</hi> in another case, 2. King. 9.22. <hi>What peace, so long as thy sinne remaineth?</hi> And we reade in Scripture, that onely the <hi>godly and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> are commanded <hi>to reioyce,</hi> Psal. 32.11.

               </note>The <hi>second Rule</hi> concernes the choyce of our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, three wayes: 1. For the matter: 2. For the circumstances: 3. For the kinde of them.</p>
            <p n="1">

               </note>1. For the <hi>matter,</hi> they must not be <hi>pleasures of sin,</hi>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:18777:133"/>
which euery godly man must refuse, with <hi>Moses,</hi> Heb. 11.25. For to reioyce or delight in sinne, is the top of wickednesse: and all such end either in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or damnation. But for the matter, they must be in their nature either good, or at least not euill. Therefore they that passe their dayes in surfetting, drunkennesse, chambering, wantonnesse, lusts, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse, vnlawfull sports and recreations, haue made an ill choyce for themselues, of that which should bee hatefull to all Christians: see Esa. 5.22. Habak. 2.15. Math. 24.45.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppose our delights be good in their nature,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</hi>
               </note> &amp; matter, yet if they be bad in <hi>circumstances,</hi> we may not now chuse them, as indifferent. If any lawfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light haue some blot vpon it, or be become a fashion or guise of profane men, who are excessiue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate in it, if I may forbeare and chuse another, I must not meddle with that. The Apostle, Phil. 4.8. will haue vs delight in nothing but that <hi>which hath some vertue, praise, or good report in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Rule will make choyce of the best recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of best example, best vse, and least abused. It will chuse the best fashion of apparell, of the most sober and graue of our ranke, and shun such as haue the note of lightnesse, curiosity, vaine affectation, new-fanglednesse, and fashioning to the times. But how many cast off all consideration of aduised cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances? out of which, the inioying of lawfull pleasure is most vnlawfull. As for example: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose some kinde of Stage-playes were lawfull, were it not vnlawfull to play in a Church? Suppose dicing and carding were as lawfull as most men would haue
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:18777:134"/>
them, must therefore Ministers bee gamesters, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men dicers, children and seruants passe away their time in such games? Nay, because eating, drinking, and sundry games, as bowling, shooting, be lawfull, must I therefore, or may I doe these in all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies? May I sort my selfe with swearers, ruffians, rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous persons, without respect of company? were not this to ensnare my selfe, and offend others?

Thirdly, this kind of pleasures will make vs not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier onely, but better both in body and minde.</p>

For first, a man hereby returnes to his true pleasure againe. When man forsooke God, true pleasure forsooke man: and when men chiefly delight in God, they goe backe againe to the chiefe Good and pleasure. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, why doe wee loue or delight in any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing, but because of the beauty and pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it? But, can there be so much beauty or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santnesse in the creatures,<note place="margin">

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18777:134"/>
what a shame is it for Christians, not to bee able or willing to find so much ioy and delight in the Lord, as wicked men doe in forced merriments? Fourthly, is not that the perfect ioy, which ariseth out of the presence of that which is most perfect, and shall be most perfect in heauen, because of the immediate fruition of him who is most perfect? Fifthly, is not this the next way to perpetuate our ioy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to set it on him who is euerlasting and indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient?</p>
            <p>Besides all this, we all know, that the true pleasure of a Christian is, 1. For the present, in the fauour of God, reconciled by Christ: onely <hi>by his atonement,</hi> the soule is at sweet peace and repose in his loue, as the child in his fathers armes, Rom. 5.11. 2. For time to come, <hi>in his mercy and saluation,</hi> Psal. 9.2. and 13.5. 3. In his presence, when hee shall bee a <hi>Sunne</hi> vnto him, to refresh and reuiue him, Psal. 84.11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Iesus Christ; Phil. 3.3.

If we, as chaste Virgins, conceiue Christ in our hearts, and claspe him with the armes of faith, as <hi>Zachary,</hi> here is cause of sound ioy, and true pleasure indeed. Take delight in his Natiuity, but especially in thy natiuity by him.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:18777:135"/>3. In the testimony, and graces of the Spirit. First, in the testimony of the Spirit, that our <hi>names are written in the Booke of life; in this reioyce,</hi> Luk. 10.20. This ioy in the holy Ghost is <hi>vnspeakable and glorious,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.8. He is the great <hi>Comforter</hi> of his Church, an euerlasting Spring of ioy and pleasure, which no wicked man euer tasted of, Ioh. 14.16. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the graces of the Spirit are full of delight: faith hath a speciall pleasure, called, <hi>The ioy of faith,</hi> Phil. 1.25. Euen temporary faith hath great ioy, much more iustifying faith. Hope also hath his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, euen the expectation of pleasure at Gods right hand for euermore, Rom. 12.12. <hi>Reioyce in hope.</hi> What a sweet pleasure is it in the spring, to see our seeds and plants grow and come vp in our gardens? How much more pleasant is it, to see the buds of the Lord grow in our hearts, to the vn-rooting and ouer-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering of the weeds of sinne? Sweet is the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of grace: but the comforts of Gods Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewing the foule in the thirst of it, is like a shadow in a great drought.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the Word and Ordinances of God: Ps. 112.1.

               </hi> Rom. 15.4. There is the ioyfull tidings of saluation: there the doctrine of free Remission of sinnes, and Redemption by Iesus Christ, is proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: there are the pleasures of Gods House, and the Word which is food for Gods children; Cloath an infant with gold and pearles, and make it heire of the whole world, yet nothing pleaseth it but the

brest-milke: so heere. In the Word also are descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the wayes of wisedome, which are <hi>wayes of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> Prou. 3.17. and all thou canst desire, is not to be compared to her.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the testimony of a good conscience: that they walke in simplicity, and godly purenesse, and not in fleshly wisedome, 2. Cor. 1.12. and haue not willingly moyled their conscience in lusts and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, but haue cherished the lust of the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the lusts of the flesh.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In the communion of Saints; to enioy their fellowship, being present, and reioyce to heare of their well-fare being absent: To reioyce in the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the Church; as <hi>Iethro,</hi> when hee heard of all the good that God had done for Israel, Exod. 18.9. Yea, to preferre Ierusalem before our chiefe ioy, Psal. 137.5, 6. when the Gospell runnes with free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In Euangelicall obedience, both in action and passion for the Gospell. First, serue God with cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, Deut. 28.47. as Christs meate and drinke was to doe the will of his Father, <hi>in this he reioyced,</hi> Psalm. 40.8. Secondly, reioyce euen in afflictions for the Gospell, and for the Name of Christ, as wherein is greater pleasure then in the honour and greatest pleasures of the world. Gal. 6.14. God forbid I should reioyce in any thing but <hi>the Crosse of Christ.</hi> Heb. 10.36. the Saints <hi>with ioy suffred the spoyling of their goods,</hi> and would not be deliuered. Col. 1.24. <hi>Now I reioyce in my sufferings for you, &amp;c.</hi> For, is there not more true pleasure, in helping Christ (as <hi>Simon</hi>) to beare his Crosse, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ouerflowing pleasure of the world
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:18777:136"/>
to forget Christ and a mans selfe?</p>
            <p>Oh therefore let vs lay fast hold on these pleasures, what euer profit or pleasure we forgoe for them. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily pleasures are not so alwaies, but as the body is disposed to them: what can delight a sicke, pained, and dying body? But these pleasures, being in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues true and sound, are neuer irksome, neuer loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some as the other. And whereas bodily pleasures are at last fugitiues and runnagates, when their Master hath most need; these neuer forsake their Master, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer take their leaue, but are perpetuall, yea, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
            <p>That is the <hi>second Rule,</hi> for the choise of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> concernes the manner, and measure: in foure particulars.</p>

               </note>1. Vse them <hi>weanedly: reioyce, as not reioycing,</hi> 1. Cor. 7.30. Powre not out thy heart to pleasure, but be moderate and retyred. A wary Christian will euer be allaying his wine with water, and make a measure to his pleasure. Prou. 25.16. <hi>If thou hast found hony, eate not too much.</hi> We may soone take too much of these hony-sweet pleasures.</p>

            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Wisely.</hi>
               </note>3. Vse them <hi>wisely.</hi> First, not seeking, or not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to pleasures. It is no wisdome to be formost, or Instigators. Secondly, rather vsing pleasures than
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:18777:136"/>
inioying them. To vse a thing, is for some other thing: to inioy it, is for it selfe:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>August. de ciuit. Dei, lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 25.</note> whence <hi>Augustine</hi> speakes of some who <hi>inioy their gold, but vse their God</hi>; because they bestow not their money for Gods sake, but worship God for monies sake: So, many among vs may truly be said to inioy their pleasures, and vse their Religion. Thirdly, distinguish recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the vocation: both <hi>for instance in them,</hi> which is the sinne of our Gentry and their followers, who haue no vocation but recreation: and <hi>for the end</hi>; the vocation is to get meanes of liuing, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich a mans selfe, and get money, for his owne and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good; but God hath neuer set apart play to this purpose; and how fond are they that vse sport, to begger themselues and their Family? Fourthly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine wisely thy passions about thy pleasures, and vse them not as occasions of discord, impatience, swearing, or any impotent passions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Vse them <hi>Christianly:</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly.</hi>
               </note> 1. Maintaining the fight betweene the flesh and the Spirit: 1. Pet. 2.11. Lusts doe alwayes fight against vs, and therefore we must alwayes fight against them. 2. Manifesting, that we loue not the pleasures of our pilgrimage bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the pleasures of our Countrey: for no wise man will bee so delighted with the light of the Moone, as to contemne the light of the Sunne. 3. Fearing pleasure more than misery: because the bitter root of affliction (as the Fig-tree) brings of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes most sweet fruit, but the ordinary end of pleasure is bitternesse and sorrow.</p>
            <p>Now consider heere how great was the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of former ages, in regard of outward plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:18777:137"/>
How plaine and homely the ages before the giuing of the Law were, the whole story sheweth. Vnder the Law, how coorse was <hi>Eliahs</hi> mantle! how sparing his diet! that when he had eaten, the Angell came the second time, and bad him eate more: but our superfluity is such, as we haue need of an Angel to come daily and bid vs eate lesse. How coorse was the fare and diet of the new Testament, in <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist!</hi> how remote from the pleasures of this life! <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> so abstinent, as <hi>Paul</hi> bids him drinke no more water, but a little wine for his healths sake. But if <hi>Paul</hi> were to write to a number of our <hi>Timothies,</hi> who are so busie with health, he would charge them, if they loued their health or life, to drinke no more wine.</p>
            <p>Such was the austerity of former ages, some few hundred yeeres after the Apostles, as brought a great superstition and blinde deuotion, wherewith the Church and world hath been euer burthened since, and could not be deliuered. But now, so farre is the world degenerate, and gone to the contrary, as the excesses and superfluities of it haue brought in euery whit as much Epicurisme and Atheisme: and the true God was not more departed from in that blinde god, than in this belly-god. So hard it is to walke in a meane, in the offers of pleasures.</p>
            <p>Consider also what great losers they become, that dote vpon pleasures. As the foolish Fly, delighted with the light of a candle, regards not the heat of the flame, but burnes first one leg, afterward ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and still takes no warning, till it be wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed. So worldly pleasures make men, first, senslesse
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:18777:137"/>
to good things, then, dead and deafe to admonition, and senslesse of smart, till they lose Religion, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most said, reason it selfe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth Rule</hi> concernes the season of pleasures.<note place="margin">4. <hi>The sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
               </note> Eccles. 3.4. There is an appoynted season for euery purpose vnder heauen: <hi>a time to weepe, and a time to laugh:</hi> therefore there is a time, when it is vnseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. It is the Epicures fashion, at all times to haue his garments white, and at no time to haue oyle wanting to his head, Eccles. 9.8. And of the rich Glutton, to be arrayed in purple, and fare deliciously euery day, Luk. 16. He that followes pastime, is a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and scatterer, and a gamester is none of Gods creatures: God allowes him no place in heauen, or earth. To follow sport euery day, drawes a man to as much profanenesse as <hi>Esau,</hi> whose wantonnesse brought him to forgoe his time, the blessing of his father, the fauour of God, and his owne saluation.</p>
            <p>First therefore,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Foure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable times for pleasure.</hi>
               </note> the season of worldly pleasures must not be the time of our calling; in which euery man must abide. They are not so good as the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and duties of it, and therefore this must not bee hindred by them. Whence one aptly calls pleasure a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>parenthesis</hi> comming betweene our labours, which hinders not, but helpes the <hi>series</hi> and course of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the season of worldly pleasures, is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Sabbath. When our hearts should attend the Word, or be vpon it, wee must not suffer our mindes to wander after pleasures. When our tongues should be talking of Gods Word, and speake in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Canaan, it is vnseasonable they should bee
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18777:138"/>
walking and wandring about pleasures &amp; pastimes. And seeing our Text hath taught vs, that there is such a force in pleasures to choke the Word, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of pleasures on the Sabbath, when wee should be at holy exercises, must needs bee more dangerous to distract the minde, and driue out the Word, and dead all motions and affections stirred by it, than to worke in the calling: Whence a Father hath well said,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In Sabbato melius est arare quâm saltare.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>It is better to goe to plough on the Sabbath, than to goe a dancing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the season of worldly pleasures is not, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> when God layes an heauie hand on vs, or ours: when God afflicts the conscience with sence of sin; Oh this (with many) is melancholy and sadnesse; now call in carnall company, musike, gamesters, and merry companions: whereas now is the time for that counsell, Iam. 4.9. to cast our selues into sorrow for sinne; <hi>Suffer affliction, sorrow, and weepe; let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your ioy into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse; cast your selues downe before the Lord, and he will lift you vp.</hi> This is to worke with God, the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
            <p>So when men are afflicted with sicknesse, and God calls to sack-cloth; now must neighbours come in, and helpe him to passe the time, with cards, dice, drinking, swearing, and all carnall merriments. O miserable comforters! Is any among you afflicted? let him pray, saith Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> Chap. 5.13. Is any sicke? let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray, &amp;c. But these say, Let him play, and call the Elders of the Parish, and let them play with him. See how you comfort the sicke, Prou. 25.20. <hi>As
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18777:138"/>
he that takes away garments in a cold season, so is hee that sings songs to an heauie heart.</hi> And see how hee is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted! he thrusts mourning out of his house, when his heart remaines the <hi>house of mourning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the season of worldly pleasures is not,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> when Gods iudgements breake out against our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: Either when iudgement begins at the House of God, that it is not well with the Church: thus good <hi>Vriah</hi> refused comfort, 2. Sam. 11.11. and <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai,</hi> Hest. 4.1, 2. And <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Chap. 2.1, 3. And the sinne of the great men in Iudah (Amos 6.6.) was, <hi>They drinke wine in bolles, and stretch themselues on Iuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beds, and anoynt themselues, &amp;c.</hi> but, <hi>no man remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth the afflictions of Ioseph.</hi> Or when the hand of God lyes heauie vpon our neighbours, that are of the same flesh with vs: Rom. 12.15. <hi>Weepe with them that weepe.</hi> For we are all one body, and one members of another; and <hi>if one member suffer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.26.</note> 
               <hi>all ought to suffer by consent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are vnseasonable times for the prosecuting of pleasures: and therefore now wee must refraine from them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fifth and last Rule</hi> concernes the end of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.<note place="margin">5. <hi>The end of our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</hi>
               </note> The goodnesse of a thing is measured by the good end of it: and (we say) All is well that ends well: so heere. The end then of pleasure must not bee for pleasure: for then pleasure were the chiefe end, and the chiefe good. Nor to take pleasure in pleasure: onely wee may take our vse of some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and not powre out our hearts vnto them. For this infatuates a man, and puts out his reason and sences, that he can see no shame he puts himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:18777:139"/>
What a shame was it, (which yet <hi>Samson</hi> discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not:) that hee, who would not turne his face from a thousand men at once, should now become a slaue to a lewd woman that had vsed him most vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Nay, he that was strong enough to match a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is foyled by his lust, and sottishly vanquished vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the feet of an harlot. Looke on a man giuen to drinking, gaming, whoring, &amp;c. this man will sort himselfe with the basest companions in a Towne, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than sit out: euen great Princes, loded with Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons of wine, will <hi>stretch out their hands to scorners,</hi> Hos. 7.5.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Three ends which we must aime at in our pleasures.</hi>
               </note>This must not bee the end of our pleasures: but, 1. To make vs better, not worse: not more loose or dissolute, but more thankfull to God, more cheerfull in the duties of our callings, more able to pray, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> heare, and doe good to our selues and others. Therefore when our pleasures make vs heauie and vnfit for good things, (as the pleasures of Egypt made Israel loth and flow in going forward to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan:) now they are sinfull, though not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, yet in their end, and our vse, because they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> choke as thornes. 2. To put vs in minde of such heauenly pleasures as are reserued for the faithfull at Gods right hand: as the first fruits in the Law put the Israelites in minde of a full haruest. Now we doe but taste before hand how good and gracious the Lord is: then wee shall be satisfied with his fulnesse and sweetnesse. If hee prouide such things in our Prison, what in our Palace? 3.

            <p>So much of the three sorts of bad ground.</p>
            <p>We come now to the fourth, which is good.
<q>
                  <bibl>Vers. 8.</bibl> And some fell on good ground, and sprang vp, and bare fruit an hundreth fold.</q>

                  <hi>But that which fell in good ground, are they,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18777:140"/>
which with an honest and good heart heare the Word, and keepe it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>HEre consider, as in the former, 1. The soyle, <hi>good ground:</hi> where, first, how it comes to bee good: secondly, how it is knowne to be good, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by <hi>hearing with honest and good hearts.</hi> 2. The suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of the seed in it, fruitfulnesse: 1. For the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or plenty, <hi>an hundreth fold.</hi> 2. For the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, or constancy, <hi>with patience.</hi> Of these in their order.</p>
            <p>And first, how the ground doth come to be good. <hi>Answ.</hi> It is called <hi>good, non à priori,</hi> because the Word findes it so; but <hi>à posteriori,</hi> because by the Word it is made so. Euery mans heart by nature is a stiffe ground, a barren and cursed earth: <hi>The whole imagination of mans heart is onely euill continually: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man is a beast in his owne vnderstanding: Paul</hi> himselfe, now an elect Vessell, is <hi>by nature the child of wrath as well as any,</hi> Ephes. 2.2. But as stiffe and bad ground becomes good, by good husbandry and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring: so do our harts, by the husbandry of the <hi>good Husband-man:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 15.1.</note> He alone changeth the heart: He takes away the stones and stifnesse of it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Si debeo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum me pro me facto, quid debeo pro me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecto?</hi> Aug. <hi>Doct.</hi>
               </note> and makes it a soft heart. So the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, saith, <hi>By the grace of God I am that I am,</hi> 1. Cor. 15.10. He onely can <hi>create a cleane heart, and renew a right spirit in a man,</hi> Psal. 51.10. and <hi>put his feare into his heart, that he shall neuer depart from him,</hi> Ier. 32.40.</p>

                  <hi>Some ground which the Word falls vpon, is good.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Doctr.</hi> Some seed falls on good ground. Though there be but a small parcell of good ground, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the bad, yet some there is where the seed
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18777:140"/>
is cast. It is true, that where the Word is preached, it is to most in vaine; as here, three to one lose their parts in it: But yet some good there bee; the seed falls into some good ground; in some, though very few, it is successefull. When the whole world was a field of brambles, fit for the fire of Gods wrath, yet of <hi>Noah</hi> he saith, <hi>Thee haue I found righteous:</hi> and he being a Preacher of righteousnesse, shall make an Arke, if it be but for <hi>eight soules,</hi> Gen. 7. When all Sodome was as a cursed Heath, and a dry Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, yet <hi>Lots</hi> family was as a little pikle exempt, in which the Word became fruitfull, Gen. 19. In the Ministery of the Prophets, much of their labour was lost, as themselues lamentably complaine, Esa. 49.4. and 53.1. <hi>Who will beleeue our report? or to whom is the arme of the Lord reuealed?</hi> shewing, that very few will beleeue the doctrine of Christs humiliation and abasement: to which, that place leades vs in Ioh. 12.38. and yet there was <hi>one of a City,</hi> and <hi>two of a Tribe,</hi> and still a <hi>small remnant</hi> whom the Lord would saue.</p>
            <p>Our Lord Iesus, while himselfe preached the doctrine of the Gospell most cleerly, and confirmed it powerfully by many miracles, yet but one heere and there receiued it, scarce one of a thousand: so as himselfe laments their hardnesse of heart, and weepes ouer Ierusalem: and saith plainly, that few shall be saued, and that the way which leads to life is narrow, and the gate straite, and few finde it. But yet he hath <hi>a little flocke: Feare not, little flocke,</hi> Luk. 12.32. When many tooke offence at his doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the eating of his flesh, Ioh. 6. yet his Disciples
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:18777:141"/>
acknowledged that hee had the words of eternall life. Ioh. 10.20. When some said he was mad, and had a diuell; others said, These are not the words of him that hath a diuell, nor yet the workes: for, can the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell open the eyes of him that is borne blinde? When the multitude decreed to excommunicate whosoeuer should confesse him, yet the blinde man will iustifie him in the Synagogue, Ioh. 9. When the whole Councell and body of Iewes as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble against him, there is a <hi>Simeon,</hi> a <hi>Zachary, Hanna,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which adore him: yea, at his Crosse, his mother, his Disciple <hi>Iohn,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good women.</p>
            <p>The Disciples of our Lord, when they preached after him; some raised vp persecution, but some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued; sometimes one of a City, as <hi>Lydia,</hi> Act. 16.14. And sometimes a few more, as at Athens, Act. 17.32. some mocked at the Resurrection, but some claue vnto <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maris,</hi> and some other: see Rom. 10.16. And euer since, the smallest number receiue the Gospell; yet some doe, who are as the gleanings, to the haruest; and as the Grapes to the vintage, and but an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From the similitude in our Parable: such is the wisedome and care of the Husbandman,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> that he will not bestow his seed where is no hope, but that all the seed and labour will be lost: though there be many stones, and many thornes in a field, he will sowe, because all is not so; but if it were all so, hee would not lose his seed: so the Lord, the wise Husbandman of his Church, will much lesse bestow,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:18777:141"/>
his labour and husbandry on a soyle altogether hopelesse and fruitlesse: but hee will see some good ground intermingled, for whose sake he doth bestow his seed. Againe, doth the seed belong to any but good ground? or doth the Word properly belong to any but the true Beleeuers? No: it hath an effect in others, but it is the portion onely of these.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The proper end &amp; vse of the seed is,<note place="margin">2</note> to gather in an haruest: and the proper end of the Word is, to gather and preserue a Church vnto Christ. God hath sanctified a Ministery, <hi>for the gathering of the Saints,</hi> Ephes. 4.11. Christs owne Ministery in Ierusalem was, to gather them to life and safety, <hi>as the Hen ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers her chickens,</hi> Math. 23.37. and to worke faith in so many as are ordained to eternall life, Act. 13.48. And therefore, where God sends and continues his Word faithfully preached, there are some to gather, some to bee brought to the faith, one time or other. The grace of God hath appeared, bringing saluation, Tit. 2.11. And therefore ordinarily, where God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foords this grace, it brings saluation to some, though neuer so few: ordinarily the Word attaines euen this end in some.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the Lord, when hee will prosper a people, and maintaine their naturall liues,<note place="margin">3</note> blesseth the seed sowne, to increase, and thereof giues them an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest: but on the contrary, when hee will send a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to consume, hee affoords them no seed, or no haruest: Euen so, where hee hath a good purpose to preserue any to eternall life, hee sends the Word to this purpose. <hi>Paul</hi> must goe to Corinth, and stay there a yeere and sixe moneths, because the Lord
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:18777:142"/>
had much people in that City, Act. 18.10, 11. For their sakes it is sent, and for their sakes continued: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as the Apostle, 1. Thes. 1.4, 5. doubts not to make it a note of the election of some, where God sendeth a powerfull Ministery. And contrarily, where God hath no delight in a people, and none to call by the ordinary meanes, he sends <hi>a famine of the Word,</hi> Amos 8.11. When the Nation of the Iewes proues so barren, as the labour is not worth the while, then the Kingdome shall be taken from them, and giuen to a better people, Math. 21.43. As in the times of ignorance, and darknesse of Popery, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred yeeres together, when was no preaching, no ordinary meanes: which times God hath now o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-passed, and now admonisheth all to repentance. So as wee doubt not, but where Christ vttereth his voice, he hath <hi>some sheepe to heare him,</hi> Ioh. 10.27. see Act. 22.18.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">4</note>4. Those many epithites and titles giuen to the Scripture, shew the same. The Word is called, <hi>The ministery of the Spirit, of life, of righteousnesse,</hi> 2. Cor. 3.8. because it ordinarily findes out some, in whom it is effectuall, and vpon whom it bestoweth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and life, and righteousnesse. It is a <hi>Word of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, (subiectiuè &amp; effectiuè)</hi> it will finde out <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wisedome,</hi> who will <hi>iustifie</hi> their mother, Luk. 7.35.<note place="margin">Act. 20.32.</note> And the <hi>Word of Gods grace,</hi> giuen of grace, and giuing grace to some or other where it is sent.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <note place="margin">5</note>5. A reason hereof may bee taken from the extent of the Church, which is now stretched out into all Nations: so as <hi>the Gospell of Christ is the power of God
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:18777:142"/>
to saluation, to Iew and Gentile,</hi> Rom. 1.16. Now God hath some friends euery where, and in all places some that belong to his Election, and shall bee brought to the faith; some in Sodome, some in Egypt, some in <hi>Nero's house,</hi> Phil. 4.22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To comfort poore Preachers, and faithfull Ministers: that though most Hearers bee vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet some shall take good; there is a fourth part of good ground. No field so barren, but true paines will bring vp some seed, though but thin, and a little in comparison: So no Towne or people so bad, but the faithfull preaching of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> Oh I see no fruit: <hi>I haue laboured in vaine, and spent my strength in vaine,</hi> Esa. 49.4. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Seed comes not vp so soone as it is cast. Waite a winter, and thou shalt see it againe. 2. Thou losest much labour, and in comparison labourest in vaine: but it were hard, if all were lost: ordinarily some labour proues. 4. Thou mayest sowe, another may reape thy seed: and all the time thy labour hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to fruitfulnesse, and now produceth fruits. 4. Thou mayest not see any fruit of thy labour, and yet thy labour not lost. <hi>Elias</hi> was of a cleere sight, yet saw not one of 7000. that profited by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery. 5. If all thy labour were lost in regard of men, yet <hi>thy worke is with the Lord, and thy iudgement with thy God:</hi> with him it is not lost.</p>
            <p>Againe, the Minister hath no griefe to an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and wilfull people; that he seemes to sowe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Rocke, some on a path-way, and some on a thicket of thornes: He that was ignorant, is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:18777:143"/>
still: Hee that was Popish, is Popish still: the profane, the swearer, drunkard, contemner, mock-God, is so still. Thus is he disappointed of his end, being willing to saue all, and spoyled of his <hi>Crowne and glory,</hi> 1. Thes. 2.19.</p>

If thou canst not hope to saue all, yet seeke to saue some; as the Apostle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came seruant to all, <hi>that he might winne some:</hi> for hee knew he should neuer winne all, 1. Cor. 9.22. Rom. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 11.14. 4. If thou hast wonne some, reioyce in them, praise God for them. If thou hast wonne but one, there is more cause of true ioy in that one, than in winning the whole world. Refuse no paines to winne another: Bee couetous to winne all, but bee content if thou canst but saue some.</p>

               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Seeing of all the flockes and troupes that followed Christ, <hi>his</hi> flocke was a little one, <hi>his</hi> part the smallest; it teacheth vs, not onely to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Ordinance of preaching; but also to looke
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:18777:143"/>
to our hearing. A great number of people atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about the Poole, Ioh. 5. but onely one was cured at once; euen hee that stept first in, after the Angels stirring of the water. So numbers throng and flocke in populous Congregations, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Poole, but in very few it is effectuall to conuersion and saluation: it were happy if wee were sure one stept in, euery Sermon. Our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our tells vs, that <hi>many are called, but few are chosen,</hi> Math. 22.14. Rest not then in outward hearing, continuing in vnfruitfulnesse. <hi>Take heed how you heare,</hi> saith our Sauiour, Luk. 8.18. If three parts of foure lose their labour in hearing, and if not Hearers, but Doers of the Law shall bee iustified, then must wee so heare, as wee may beleeue, obey, and bee saued. And if many of them that vse the meanes of saluation, shall not bee saued, where shall wilfull Recusants, obstinate absenters, and carelesse contemners of the Word, appeare? Hee that vseth physike, may dye: but hee that refuseth, or wilfully scorneth physike, and Physicians, must dye, and that deseruedly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Not to define a Church by multitude: Leaue that absurdity to Papists. Heere are three parts of foure, bad ground, which reiects the truth, and chokes the Word. Some shall hold the truth, but a few in comparison; and three to one against it; nay, sometimes three hundreth, or foure hundreth to one; as all <hi>Baals</hi> Priests against <hi>Eliah,</hi> and 400. false prophets against <hi>Micaiah.</hi> Nay, not one voyce of foure, but all parts are against the truth: all cryed, <hi>Crucifie, crucifie Christ, let him be crucified,</hi> Math. 27.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:18777:144"/>
and not one voyce against the Calfe, Exod. 32. The triumph of truth must bee held and maintained in the world by a few, in one <hi>Enoch,</hi> one <hi>Noah,</hi> one <hi>Lot.</hi> Let none doubt of the truth, because it is held by a few: three parts of foure must reiect it: And this is sure, that the best things commonly haue not most voyces, but <hi>the greater part ouercomes the better.</hi>

Neither let vs be as many, who condemne the whole profession for some Professors that haue declined and shrunke in perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or haue been choaked with cares, riches, and pleasures of the world: for our Sauiour here teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that three to one, who seeme to receiue the Word, yea, many that rise vp into a blade, stalke and eare, neuer come to fruits and ripenesse: and the Apostle, 1. Ioh. 2.19. <hi>Some went out from vs, because they were not of vs.</hi> But let vs striue to be of this <hi>little flocke,</hi> these few that fructifie and perseuere.</p>

To stirre vs vp to thankfulnesse, when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple enioy this mercy, that God hath some good worke in some of them: and expresse our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in being of their number and company. <hi>Quest.</hi> How shall I know that? <hi>Answ.</hi> If thou be not onely called by a generall calling, but by a speciall. Why, what is the difference? <hi>Answ. The former</hi> is a bare
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:18777:144"/>
inuitation to Christ, by the preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, sounding in the eare. <hi>The latter,</hi> a drawing of the Elect vnto true faith, by the mighty worke of Gods Spirit in the heart. <hi>That</hi> brings men to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, profession, externall reformation at farthest, without inward change and renewing of the heart. <hi>This</hi> inlightneth the minde, distinctly to know the doctrine of saluation, as it is laid downe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and boweth the will to imbrace it readily, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, constantly; and to beginne to obey it vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly.</p>
            <p>Now, as there is some good ground, we are in the next place to inquire what it is, or how it may bee knowne: And this ground is called here <hi>a good and honest heart:</hi> Vsing a double Epithite, either by way of <hi>exposition,</hi> shewing, that by a good heart he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth an honest heart; or by way of <hi>collection,</hi> noting a double grace, both of inward purity, and of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fruits, and reformation.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is called <hi>a good heart</hi> in two respects:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The heart called good in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</hi>
               </note> 1. As emptied of bad qualities, 2. As well qualified by grace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is emptied of bad qualities, being cleane contrary to all the bad disposition of the three for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer kindes of ground. For the first ground negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the seed, and suffered birds to picke it vp: but this <hi>keepes</hi> the seed. The second receiued the seed, but the Sunne withered the fruite, that it continued not: but this <hi>brings fruit with patience,</hi> saith our text. The third brings fruit, but among thornes, and so is choaked: but this seed is cast in good ground, freed from such choak-weeds and lusts. So as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:18777:145"/>
to all the other, it receiues willingly, retaines constantly, and perseueres fruitfully vnto the end.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. It is well qualified by grace, as in our text: 1. God hath made it of a cursed and barren earth, <hi>good ground.</hi> 2. It heares the Word beyond the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the former heard it, but without desire: this heares with study to learne, and industry to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. 3. It keepeth the Word in memory, minde, and practice: the other heard, but kept nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was no fit place to keepe it in. 4. It brings fruit: in the other was some care to heare, but here is a care of fruitfulnesse. 5. It is carefull to proceed in grace, to double and increase the measure of fruits, from thirty to sixty, and so to an hundreth fold: but the other soone fall from their measure. 6. It hath obtained by grace an inuincible fortitude against temptations and trials, so as no feares or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces shall remooue them from the study of piety, and fruits of grace: for they bring forth fruits <hi>with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> as the other did not.</p>

               <hi>Ciuill</hi> honesty is inioyned, Rom. 12.17. <hi>Prouiding things honest before all men:</hi> that is, in such grauity, sobriety, equity, and comelinesse, as may beseeme your persons; auoyding lightnesse in speech and talke, in deeds and actions, in apparell and gesture, in gate and behauiour. For euen <hi>ciuill honesty</hi> is more than to be honest of a mans body: euen to <hi>minde
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:18777:145"/>
things honest</hi> and comely in the whole course, and to walke in all things gracefully and seemely, Phil. 4.8. It fights therefore against <hi>ciuill honesty</hi> and seemli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; to see a Magistrate running after playes and gamballes, like boyes: a Minister carowsing and quaffing among boone companions: an ancient man garish and light in attyre and youthfull fashions: an ancient woman tricking her selfe, and trimming like a wanton girle: a young man frequenting Tauerns, Innes, and Ale-houses, or lasciuious with the other sexe: a young woman full of talke, much in the streets, or familiar with others, than of her owne sexe.</p>
            <p>But that is <hi>ciuill honesty,</hi> when men in their places carry themselues before men, as may winne reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and grace to their persons.</p>
            <p>And yet that is the least part of the honesty heere meant. There is further a <hi>religious honesty</hi> of the heart, namely, the inward purity, integrity, simplicity and sincerity of the heart, when it is plaine and single, as <hi>Nathanael, A true Israelite, in whom was no guile.</hi> It is knowne by opposition to hypocrisie or guile: it makes not a shew of goodnesse, nourishing sinne within. And it labours to produce things honest, <hi>not before men onely, but also before God,</hi> 2. Cor. 8.21.</p>
            <p>From this ranke of honest-hearted persons, are excluded, 1. Debosht persons, who hauing shaken off the feare of God, and shame of men, care not for, but cast off all honesty, both before God and men: as the vniust Iudge, Luk. 18.3. 2. Ciuill honest men, who walke honestly before men, but care not for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:18777:146"/>
of heart before God. 3. Hypocrites, who will seeme to be honest-hearted before God, but neglect honest, equall, and approued carriage before men.</p>

               <hi>Doctr.</hi> The Lord esteemes the goodnesse of an Hearer, by the goodnesse and honesty of his heart.

               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. As in all other parts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, so in this, the Commandement calls for such an heart. Prayer must proceed from this good and honest heart, Psalm. 119.10. <hi>With my whole heart haue I sought thee.</hi> Praise must proceed from it. Psal. 86.12. <hi>I will praise thee with my whole heart.</hi> Repentance must be a turning with the whole heart, Ierem. 24.7. <hi>They shall turne to me with their whole heart.</hi> In a word, all duties performed to God or man (in the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and seruile subiection) must bee done <hi>heartily,</hi> Phil. 1.8. Col. 3.23.</p>

               <note place="margin">2</note>2. Both the promise of acceptance, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it selfe is with this condition. The promise is in Ier. 29.13. <hi>Ye shall seeke me, and finde me, because yee shall seeke me with all your heart.</hi> And of <hi>Iudah</hi> in the time of <hi>Asa</hi> it is said, that they had sworne to the Lord with all their heart, and sought him with the whole desire, and the Lord was found of them,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:18777:146"/>
2. Chron. 15.15. Acceptance also, and approbation from God, is, when the heart is single, entire, and true in good duties, and the intents of them: not reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after priuate ends, nor cunning in the secret car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and contriuing of sinne or hollownesse. Hee cannot abide a double heart, a varying, and a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart, nor a heart diuided betweene himselfe and the world: that rests satisfied with the deed done, but cares not whether it proceed from soundnesse, or no. One property of sinners, hatefull to God in their pretences, is, that they are <hi>double-minded:</hi> and Ezek. 33.33.<note place="margin">Iam. 4.8.</note> The Lord scornes the shew of hearing the Prophet, when the <hi>heart goeth after couetousnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This Hearer is onely approued of God,<note place="margin">3</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it must bee a good and honest heart indeed, that must yeeld to all the parts of Gods Word. It must bee a good and honest heart, that will indure mortification of all lusts, and suffer the very heart of his dearest sinnes to bee broken: that will for the Word indure cutting off of hands, and parting with eyes. It must be a good and honest heart, that with <hi>Paul</hi> can set vp the excellency of the knowledge of God aboue all aduantages: that can bee content to sell all, and buy the Pearle: that with the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples can leaue all, and follow Christ. It must bee a good and honest heart, that must yeeld obedience to the whole Law of God, without reseruations; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in difficult, costly, or dangerous duties. It must be a good and honest heart, that is not offended at the basenesse of Christ, and simplicity of his Gospel; but can for his sake suffer with ioy the spoyling of goods, yea and resist vnto blood. And (which is the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:18777:147"/>
chiefe goodnesse of it) to resolue to yeeld vniuersall obedience, not by starts and fits, but with constancy to the end.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">4</note>4. Onely this Hearer is approued of God, because this heart onely can mingle the Word with faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing specially the Word of promise with distinct and particular application, and affiance of the soule, drawing the man neerer vnto God: whereas any heart, but this, is an euill heart, and vnfaithfull, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man <hi>depart from the liuing God,</hi> Heb. 3.12. This heart only cleaues vnto the Word, and holds it fast, so as the Word of God abides in it, and lodgeth not as a stranger, but dwelleth in it: whereas a bad heart is like a bad stomake, which receiues meate, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines it not, and casts vp all againe, so as all is lost; as precious liquor put into a leaking vessell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To frame our iudgements to Gods, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them that are the best Hearers, to bee honest-hearted men. But our iudgement generally is cleane contrary: For if we see men addicted to the hearing of the Word, commonly they are esteemed a few hare-braind men, a packe of hypocrites, all alike, and neuer a good. Aske any man almost of the state of one of his neighbours, who is diligent in good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, frequent Sermons, &amp;c. you shall heare him say, Oh, he is a reasonable honest man, but that he is so forward to heare Sermons, and so precise, &amp;c. Thus, that which Christ made a marke of an honest man, is now a barre or hinderance to his honesty: hee were an honest man, if hee were not an honest man.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caius Seius vir bonus, sed Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus.</hi>
               </note> It was said of old by Heathens, Oh, <hi>a good man, wise, and learned, but a Christian:</hi> so in these dayes by
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:18777:147"/>
heathenish Christians, <hi>He is a good man, but a Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian, but a Puritan.</hi> What is this, but to giue the Son of God the lye, who saith here, that he is the honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est man, that heares the Word most carefully?</p>
            <p>And as we condemne the righteous, so how gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is it in our iudgements, to passe our voyces in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying the wicked? Inquire of such a mans estate, as cares more for a Pigge than a Sermon, a right Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daren and worldling: hee will tell you, He is a right honest man, a substantiall man, a iolly house-keeper, a quiet neighbour, a well-dealing man, and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of his neighbours, a man good to the poore, &amp;c. All this is well. But how loues he Religion? how followes he the Word, for hearing and practice? how affects he the Ministery, and Ministers? Oh, as for that, hee is well enough, giues the Church and Church-men their due, and payes his Tithes well: but he cares not for these runners to Sermons, hee is none of them: he keeps his Church, and heares Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and a Sermon, if there be any, and is a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man. Now you see a difference of honest men. Christs honest man runnes after and followes the Word: this honest man, so generally commended for honesty, is no such, and cares for no such. Such honest and substantiall men were they that put Christ to death; as good house-keepers; as good, and as iust Tyth-payers, euen in Mint and Anise: but they hated him and his Doctrine to the death. If he be an honest man, that loues a Play better than a Sermon; or he that affects a paire of cards or tables, aboue the Scriptures, our Lord verily was deceiued in describing honest men. But accursed be such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:18777:148"/>
men, and such as call them so, without timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. In comming to heare, looke most to that which God lookes most vnto, namely, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of thy heart. Thy care is to make thy selfe hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, to come honestly and seemely in apparell: But if thou commest with a foule, nasty, sluttish hart, God cares not for thy comming. God accounts him the best Hearer, that hath the best heart. Prepare therefore thy heart first, and then, and thence offer seruice to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Let euery man that would bee esteemed good ground, and get the commendation of a good and fruitfull Hearer, looke that his heart bee a good and an honest heart.</p>
            <p>Here for our further direction in so waighty a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, we will consider three things: 1. <hi>Meanes,</hi> wherby to attaine a good and honest heart: 2. <hi>Marks,</hi> to know when it is so: 3. <hi>Motiues</hi> to the attaining of such an heart.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Meanes to attaine a good heart.</hi>
               </note>The <hi>Meanes</hi> are generally two. 1. Let vs see our defect in nature, that our hearts are not good by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but stiffe and stubborne, as the stiffest ground; <hi>little worth,</hi> Prou. 10.20. So the Iewes (Ezek. 2.4.) are called, <hi>impudent, stiffe-hearted,</hi> and exceedingly voyd of all goodnesse. And (which is worse) they are stuft with deceitfulnesse and guile: <hi>All the imaginations of the heart of man are onely euill continually,</hi> Gen. 6. No ground so stony as our hearts by nature: no soyle so full of thornes as they: no ground vnder heauen carries such apparant markes of the curse of God, as our hearts doe. 2. Let vs therefore seeke a supply
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:18777:148"/>
by grace. This grace is twofold:

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>grace of Action</hi> is threefold:
<list>
                  <item>1. Preparation.</item>
                  <item>2. Of new Creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</item>
                  <item>3. Of Irrigation.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, there must be <hi>the grace of Preparation.</hi> Bad ground must be well prepared by the Plough, before it can become good. Our ground is prepared by mortification and repentance, being in it selfe as hard as an Adamant, vnmoueable by any meanes of God. Now by hearing the iudgements of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against sinne, and sinners, it growes more soft, and fitter to worke vpon: the Fallowes of the heart are plowed vp: The Law, as Gods Plough, rends vp hearts, and vnroots the weeds, and rots the stubble of our corruptions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there must be the <hi>grace of new Creation:</hi> Psal. 51.10. <hi>Create in me a cleane heart, O God.</hi> This is a worke of God, who onely can create, and a framing of something, where nothing was,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Creatio est motus à non ente simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer ad ens.</hi>
               </note> and a worke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, in all parts; here is <hi>a new Creature,</hi> 2. Cor. 5.17. as the old nature is a Leprosie spred ouer all parts. This <hi>Creation</hi> is a renouation of the whole soule and man, which for this worke absolutely depends on the Creator, as euery creature doth. And then God createth a good and honest heart, 1. When the holy Ghost creates in the soule sauing faith, by which a man is vnited as a member of Christ, to the Head, and applyeth to himselfe Christs righteousnesse. For thus Faith is said <hi>to purifie the heart,</hi> Act. 15.9. 2. When the same Spirit inwardly mortifieth all
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:18777:149"/>
corruptions in the soule, minde, will, and affections, and putteth, in stead of them, holy desires, and good motions, and renueth in the heart daily the Image of God, which is the goodnesse and honesty of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there must be the grace of heauenly <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and Irrigation.</hi> No ground can be good, which hath not a fauourable aspect from the heauens, so as both the shine of the Sunne, and the showres and dewes of heauen may cherish and water it. So our hearts are made good, when <hi>the heauens answere the earth,</hi> Hos. 2.21. that is, 1. When Christ the Sunne of righteousnesse darteth the beames of his grace and fauour daily vpon our hearts, to inlighten them with sauing knowledge, and to warme and cherish them with influence of grace: without whom wee <hi>can doe nothing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 15.5.</note> 
               <hi>nor haue any life in vs.</hi> 2. When the ground of our hearts is daily mollified and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened, by a three-fold moysture: First, of the blood of Christ daily sprinkled and applyed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. For as the blood of beasts applyed to the roots of trees, makes them more fruitfull: so the blood of this Immaculate Lambe, sprinkled on the roots of our hearts, makes vs fruitfull Christians. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the moysture of the Word of grace, which as the raine from the clouds, is euery way beneficiall to the ground of our hearts, to mollifie them, and keep them in fitnesse vnto fruitfulnes. Ier. 31.33. God makes our hearts good, by writing his Law therein. Thirdly, by the moysture of the Spirit of grace, whose worke alone it is to apply y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two former, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the vertue of Christs blood, and the power of the Word, to the conscience, for the clensing of the hart:
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:18777:149"/>
By which worke of his, the heart of a dead and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren heart becomes more fruitfull than euer Egypt did by the inundation of <hi>Nilus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because all this <hi>grace of Action</hi> is imperfect in this life; therefore that our hearts may become tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good and honest, there needs also the <hi>grace of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation.</hi> The best ground is good but in part, and, <hi>No man can say his heart is cleane,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 20.9.</note> but much euill and guile will cleaue vnto it. Yet where God hath begun a good worke, and beholds a constant purpose of good, resoluing against all sinne, and to please him in all things: he is pleased to behold onely the worke of his owne finger, and to see vs onely in our Head, in whom he beholds vs <hi>all faire</hi> and good,<note place="margin">Cant. 4.7.</note> imputing his goodnesse to vs, and couering our remainders of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in him. Thus hee esteemed <hi>Nathaniel</hi> (in whom great weaknesse appeared) <hi>a true Israelite, in whom was no guile,</hi> Ioh. 1.47. that is, none raigning, none imputed. And so hee esteemes vs also, according to that we are comming vnto, and shall attaine; not by that we haue attained.</p>
            <p>These are the <hi>Meanes</hi> whereby our hearts become good.</p>
            <p>Now of the <hi>Markes</hi> whereby they may be knowne so to be.</p>
            <p>And here, because <hi>the heart of man is deceitfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 17.9.</note> and euery one challengeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a good heart, which yet is giuen but to a few, scarce a fourth part, and a better gift is not giuen by God to the sonnes of men: therefore wee will insist the longer to <hi>anatomize</hi> a good heart, and discouer the seuerall passages and signes of it: which in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:18777:150"/>
thing will discouer it selfe one way or other: Turne it any way you will, it is good and honest.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Markes of a good hart reduced to</hi> 7. <hi>heads.</hi>
               </note>These <hi>Markes,</hi> because they are many, wee will in generall reduce them to seuen heads, and consider this good heart: 1. In respect of God: 2. Christ: 3. The Spirit of God: 4. The Ordinances of God: 5. It selfe: 6. Good duties: 7. Sinne and euill.</p>

            <p>First, it desires neerer vnion with God daily, and all things shall set it neerer vnto God. For it knowes, that euery thing is so much the more good, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth vnto the chiefe Good. <hi>Dauids</hi> heart was a good heart, and herein the goodnesse of it bewrayed it selfe, Psalm. 73.28. <hi>It is good for me to draw neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</hi> Whereas an euill heart flyes from God, and keepes aloofe from him, euen when it drawes neerest him in his worship, Esa. 29.13.</p>

               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Seeketh him with the whole heart.</hi>
               </note>Secondly, if it seeke God, it will <hi>seeke him with the whole heart,</hi> Psal. 119.10. which is a sound confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the inward and outward man, directed in the seruice of God according to the truth of his Word. And because it is hearty, hee will vphold the worship of God, and seeke him <hi>at all times,</hi> morning and euening, on weeke-dayes, as well as on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths; out of Lent, as deuoutly as in Lent; not only when he is sicke, but when he is well: <hi>In all places,</hi> in his owne house, as well as in Gods House, like <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> who was the same in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, as among Gods afflicted people: <hi>In all companies,</hi> a good heart is euer like it selfe, and stands to God with whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it conuerseth; <hi>Paul</hi> is a good Confessor and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:18777:150"/>
Christian, not only among the Disciples, but euen those that count Religion <hi>heresie,</hi> Act. 24.14. Nay, it seeketh and serueth God <hi>alone,</hi> if it can get no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as Ioshua, c. 24.15.</p>
            <p>Whereas a bad heart doubleth with God, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides it selfe betweene God and Mammon: It can pretend seruice to Christ, and blanch with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, as those Samaritans that feared the god of the countrey, because of the Lions, and the God of the nations, 2. King. 17.33. It cannot pray at all times, Iob. 27.7. but in affliction diligently, Hos. 5.15. nor in all places; neuer so kindly, as when it stumbles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Church, as the Samaritans thought God would onely be worshipped in <hi>the mountaine.</hi> It can frame and sort it selfe to all companies,<note place="margin">Ioh. 4.20.</note> entertaine all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, either of Protestants or Papists, please the most profane, speake for and against good men, and good things, as the occasion serues.</p>

               <hi>I am here this day, whose Oxe, or whose Asse haue I taken, &amp;c.</hi> But it lookes not to please man principally; the first care is to please God: nor to please man by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any euill, nor by leauing vndone any good it is bound to by the calling; it will not be afraid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from any good purpose or practice, for mens displeasure. Againe, it can set it selfe naked before
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:18777:151"/>
Gods presence, to whom it desires to stand: it <hi>desires liuing and dying to be acceptable vnto him,</hi> 2. Cor. 5.9. A true Israelite hath praise enough to bee <hi>praised of God,</hi> and to be a <hi>Iew within,</hi> and can more satisfie it selfe with Gods allowance, than a thousand witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Further, it dares appeale to God, and flie to his Tribunall,<note place="margin">Psal. 7.8.</note> when men accuse it; as <hi>Dauid, Iudge me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mine innocency</hi>; and <hi>Moses,</hi> when Israel would not heare, turned to the Lord, saying, <hi>I haue not taken so much as an Asse from them, nor hurt any of them,</hi> Numb. 16.15. Lastly, if men will condemne him timerously, vnheard, vnconuinced, if all his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carriage cannot obtaine a right iudgement and sentence, then out of sence of innocency, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of conscience, hee can contemne such vniust iudgement, and fearelesly expect the Iudgement of God,<note place="margin">Psal. 37.6.</note> who will <hi>make his innocency shine as the light:</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> against his scoffing and slaunderous <hi>Michol,</hi> 2. Sam. 6.22. <hi>It was before the Lord:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> against the carnall Corinthians, 1. Cor. 4.3. <hi>I care little to be iudged of any man.</hi> A good heart cares not for mans allowance, if God allow him.</p>
            <p>This is comfort for the seruants of God, whether publike or priuate: that the testimony of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science makes them care no more for the obloquie of profane men, than the barking of dogges. A little they may be moued sometimes (more than needs,) but much they care not.</p>
            <p>But an euill heart cannot abide the presence of God, but flies as <hi>Adam,</hi> and sets him out of sight. It dreades the Iudgement of God, and trembles like <hi>Felix.</hi> It lookes asquint, and dares not stand in a
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:18777:151"/>
good cause for feare of men: as Ioh. 12.43. <hi>Many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, but durst not confesse: for they loued the praise of men.</hi> And, if it cannot be approued of God, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with <hi>Saul</hi> to be <hi>honoured before the people.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15.30.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, a good heart resteth and reioyceth in God, as in the best and onely portion: Psalm. 73.25.<note place="margin">4. <hi>Resteth and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in God as his onely portion.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Whom haue I in Heauen but thee, or whom in Earth in comparison of thee?</hi> It holds all other things as moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uables, vsing them as not vsing them, and is onely comfortable, that it wants not him in whom is no want. It knowes, the Lord hath designed his porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and maintaines him out of his owne fulnesse, as out of his portion: both for his spirituall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall estate.</p>
            <p>Hence his ioy in his presence is the greatest, and so is his sorrow in his absence, stepping aside and clouding his presence; now the good heart mournes after him, and thirsts for his presence as the Hart for water: And as the losse of the whole world is nothing to this, so the whole world cannot make it vp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God himselfe satisfieth it. And, seeing God hath made himselfe his portion, he is carefull to make himselfe Gods portion, by entring couenant with him, as the Israelites, Deut. 32.10.</p>
            <p>But an euill heart affects God in his gifts more than himselfe: Professing him the best Benefactor, and thanking him for all; indeed it mindeth earthly things: And his <note n="*" place="margin">Psa. 17.14. 5. <hi>Aymeth directly at Gods glory in all his</hi>

               <hi>portion is in this life,</hi> or else hath none.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, a good heart aymes at the glory of God in all things. <hi>In all his parts,</hi> 1. Corinth. 6.20. in his body, because it is his; and in his spirit, because he is
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:18777:152"/>
a Spirit. <hi>In all his actions:</hi> whether <hi>naturall,</hi> as eating, drinking, 1. Cor. 10.31. or <hi>spirituall,</hi> the parts of his worship: He will cleaue to the Word, to know and obey it; in prayer giues him the glory of hearing; and so in confession, Iosh. 7.19. and in praises, Psalm. 50.23. and in beleeuing, Rom. 4.20. and a reuerent vse of his Name and Sabbath. Yea, he will glorifie God, what-euer it cost him: nothing is so deare to him, as to lay it in the scoales with Gods glory: And if there be an opportunity, he will shew it euen in difficult commandements, as <hi>Abraham</hi>; and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as <hi>Daniel</hi>; and costly, as <hi>Zacheus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas an euill heart maketh shewes of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying God in spirituall actions, but not in naturall: or in his actions, not in spirit; neither God nor his Word get any of his thoughts. As for duties of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, danger, or cost, it casts them quite off, as <hi>Saul,</hi> and the young man.</p>
            <p>Thus a good heart behaues it selfe toward God.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">II. <hi>Jn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Christ, a good heart hath fiue properties.</hi> 1. <hi>Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Christ aboue a thousand worlds.</hi>
               </note>II. In respect of Christ it hath fiue other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent qualities.</p>
            <p>First, it preferreth Christ before a thousand worlds: All other things, all aduantages whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, are but <hi>losse and dung</hi> in comparison of Christ, Phil. 3.8. The Church esteemes her Welbeloued <hi>the chiefe of ten thousand,</hi> Cant. 5.10. Why, what seeth she in Christ aboue other? what is thy Well-beloued aboue other well-beloueds? <hi>Answ.</hi> She seeth in him such purity of nature, such power of merit, such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of loue, such freedome in promises, and such truth in performances; as nothing in the World can so affect her: Shee seeth him euery way <hi>more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:18777:152"/>
then the sonnes of men,</hi> Psalm. 45.3. therefore she sels all for the Pearle: as the Disciples left all, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ.</p>
            <p>But can an euill heart espy such beauty in Christ? or can it thus affect him? Is not a Pigge better to a Gadaren, or a messe of pottage to a profane <hi>Esau?</hi> Who almost preferres not the riches of the world, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the riches of Christ? Nay, Christ and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession are generally esteemed the greatest losse.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Reioyceth in Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all worldly ioyes.</hi>
               </note> a good heart reioyceth more in Christ and his loue, than in all worldly ioyes: Cant. 1.3. <hi>We will reioyce and be glad in thee: thy loue is better than wine.</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> will make the <hi>Lord his song all the day long. Quest.</hi> Why, what cause of ioy is there in Christ? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. A good heart seeth in Christ a full redemption from wrath, and pardon of sinne: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>reioyceth in God his Sauiour,</hi> as <hi>Mary,</hi> Luk. 1.46. Esa. 61.10. I will greatly reioyce in the Lord, saith the Church: <hi>for he hath clothed me with garments of saluation.</hi> 2. It seeth in Christ Gods fauour retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, a new couenant and league of friendship made with God; himselfe, of an heire of wrath, made an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opted sonne, an heire of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.17.</note> and <hi>co-heire with Iesus Christ.</hi> 3. It seeth by Christ the Spirit put into his soule, sealing vp Gods loue, chasing away ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, being the Spirit of light, working faith, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the prayer of faith, sending it boldly to the Throne of grace, and making it cry, Abba Father, with assurance that we can but aske and haue, and that we are not so ready to knocke as he to open. It feeles the vertue of Christs death, killing corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and perfecting his sanctification. 4. It sees in Christ
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:18777:153"/>
a blessed future estate of glory prepared for it selfe, in which he shall behold the face of God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,<note place="margin">Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But can an euill or carnall heart thus reioyce, which hath no part in Christ, no portion among the sonnes of God, no spirit, but that which ruleth in the world, no portion but on earth? No, their ioy is lower than so: in their wisdome, wealth, strength; in their Wiues, Children, cattell; in honour, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, lusts and sinnes. <hi>The stranger enters not into this ioy,</hi> Prou. 14.10.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3 <hi>Giueth it selfe wholly to Christ, who hath giuen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lfe wholly to it.</hi>
               </note>Thirdly, a good heart seeing, that Christ hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen himselfe wholly to it, giues it selfe wholly to him. For by vertue of the mutuall couenant made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Christ and the beleeuing heart, and the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall contract and marriage, Christ the true and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing husband of his Church, giues himselfe and all his substance to the faithfull soule: And she being allured by his louing and faithfull promises, giues her selfe wholly to him in duty and affection: Cant. 6.2. <hi>My welbeloued is mine, and I am his. He is mine:</hi>] not in common graces, or generall fauours, but in speciall and sauing graces, by an inward and secret presence, by a most neere and vndiuided coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For two persons to say they are man and wife, onely because of some common fauours passed, He did me a good turne, gaue me such a gift, &amp;c. is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd. It is the chamber and bed-presence, secret and inward company, that is a signe of marriage. So say, Christ is thine, not by common fauours, but when
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:18777:153"/>
hee meets the soule with sweet refreshings, and comes and lodgeth in thee by the faith of thy heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I am his.</hi>] His Spouse and wife, and haue giuen my whole selfe vnto him: for heerein I see all my happinesse placed. He communicates his nature to me, euen <hi>the Diuine nature,</hi> 2. Pet. 1.4. and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth mine: he makes his wife <hi>glorious,</hi> Ephes. 5.27. <hi>Moses</hi> marryeth an Ethiopian, and cannot change her colour: But he makes me, of a sinner, a Saint; of a Saint in earth, a Saint in heauen. He aduanceth my estate euery way: hee being rich, I cannot bee poore; he communicates with me all his goods; his righteousnesse, his life, his glory are all mine. And he euer commiserates my estate, as a louing husband doth his wiues: <hi>in all my troubles he is troubled.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa. 63.9.</note> And therefore well said I, <hi>I am his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But an euill heart contracts it selfe to the world, to the seruice of lusts, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> followes after <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny louers,</hi> Hos. 2.5. committing spirituall harlotry with all base suters, and estranged from Christ. And Christ not being thine, thou canst not say thou art his.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a sweet roome in it selfe for Christ to dwell in.</hi>
               </note> a good heart prepares a roome in it for Christ to dwell in. It knowes, that in spirituall contract, cohabitation is most necessary: Ephes. 3.17.—<hi>that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi> It knowes, that Christ will dwell there, not onely as a Master in his house, ruling, preseruing, prouiding; but as a Lord in his Temple. It knowes, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon man will not dwell in an hog-sty, much lesse will the holy Lord in any but an holy place. It
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:18777:154"/>
knowes also, that Christ hath prepared for it a sweet roome in heauen. And therefore it will fit it selfe as a sweet lodging for Christ: still repairing the ruines, and proceeding to full sanctification: still beating out more lights, because the light abides not darke corners: sweeping out daily with the besome of mortification, all lusts both of heart and life, and watering the chamber with teares of repentance: It receiues nothing in, that may offend him or grieue his Spirit: And, as the Lords Temple, perfumes it daily with the morning and euening sacrifices of Prayer and Praise. Finally, it trimmes and decks it selfe with graces, that Christ may take delight to dwell and content himselfe there.</p>
            <p>But an euill heart cares not where Christ lodgeth, so he lodge not in it: in the mouth or hand he may. Neither cares it how nasty it lye; it is alwayes sweet enough for the diuell and lusts, and lookes for no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ghests: like a Tauerne dore, open to all ghests.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it selfe wholly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ.</hi> 1. Ioh. 2.6.</note>Fifthly, a good heart conformes it selfe to Christ, and will <hi>walke as he gaue example.</hi> For it knowes, the Scripture hath set him out, not as a Redeemer only, but as a patterne of good life and imitation: And that there is almost no Christian duty, vnto which we are not vrged by his example; as humility, Phil. 2.5. patience, 1. Pet. 2.21. loue of the brethren, Eph. 5.2. forgiuenesse of others, Ephes. 4.32. fidelity in our function, Heb. 3.1, 2. beneficence to poore Saints, 2. Cor. 8.9. and obedience, both actiue and passiue, Heb. 12.2. and constancy in profession, 1. Tim. 6.13. Hence it is, that as a seruant, it striues to doe as his Lord, according to his Lords own precept, Ioh. 13.15</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:18777:154"/>Whereas a bad heart will haue Christ a Sauiour, not a samplar: takes what benefit it can by his death, but neuer lookes to his life, to tread in his steps: and protesteth he beleeues in Christ, and he is his Lord, but neuer conformes it selfe to his practice. But, no direction by the life of Christ, no saluation by his death.</p>
            <p>This is the disposition of a good heart toward Christ.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It lookes vnto the Spirit of God;<note place="margin">III. <hi>In respect of the Spirit of God.</hi> 4. <hi>Kindes of notes of a good heart.</hi> 1. <hi>Kinde, spirituall assurance, from</hi>

            </p>
            <p>For the first: Because this heart is in vnion with Christ, it hath the Spirit of Christ working the <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of his adoption. This is the heart, into which God sends the Spirit of his Sonne, crying <hi>Abba</hi> Father, Gal. 4.6. that is, hee assureth vs that wee are actually sonnes by grace, who are no sonnes by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>assurance</hi> is, first,<note place="margin">1. <hi>The wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Spirit.</hi>
               </note> from <hi>the witnesse of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.16. which is a secret information of Gods loue and fatherly affection, and a still voyce from heauen into the heart, that God in Christ is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thy God: And is euer met with a motion of the soule, inspired by the same Spirit, stedfastly resting it selfe in the fauour of God, now a Father in Iesus Christ. This being witnessed by the Spirit to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, we know, his testimony is true, being a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth</hi> that cannot lye, Ioh. 14.17. and being the <hi>searcher of the deepes of God,</hi> 1.

               </note>Secondly, this <hi>assurance</hi> commeth by the <hi>first fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.23. These <hi>first fruits</hi> are the sweet graces of the Spirit, which wee receiue in small measure in comparison, an handfull of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, peace, ioy, &amp;c. But as by the first fruits in the Law, the Lord, who had giuen them beginnings, assured to put them in possession of the whole: so the Lord, for our comfort, deliuers vs presently first fruits: And as hee dealt with Israel in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, caused the Spyes to bring clusters and fruits of the Land, partly to put them in possession, partly to prouoke an earnest desire in them by tasting, and partly to refresh them in so wearisome a pilgrimage: Euen so the Lord Iesus, who is gone into heauenly Canaan, not to view, but take possession, hath sent downe other manner of fruits, not by Spyes, but his blessed Spirit, for our comfort and confirmation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>The seale of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
               </note>Thirdly, this <hi>assurance</hi> commeth by the <hi>seale of the Spirit,</hi> Ephes. 1.13. <hi>Ye are sealed by that holy Spirit of promise.</hi> Letters and Deeds are sealed, that they may be ratified and authenticall: so God hath not onely giuen vs his word &amp; promise, but <hi>sealed</hi> for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation: Implying foure things: 1. A Writing, which is the promise of adoption, or inheritance of Saints. 2. Inke, namely, the Spirit of God exciting
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:18777:155"/>
faith. 3. The Table or parchment, the beleeuing heart. And 4. The seale by which it is ratified, and that is the gift of the holy Ghost, which, as a seale, leaues an impression of it selfe, sanctifying the heart, and renewing it to a new creature: All these in 2. Cor. 3.2.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this <hi>assurance</hi> comes by the <hi>earnest of the Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. <hi>The ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest of the Spirit.</hi>
               </note> Ephes. 1.14. <hi>which is the earnest of our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance:</hi> 2. Cor. 1.22. <hi>Who hath sealed vs, and giuen vs the earnest of his Spirit.</hi> Now where an earnest is, there is, 1. A contract or bargaine: namely, the couenant betweene God and vs, of our adoption and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. 2. The <hi>earnest</hi> confirmes the seller, that hee shall receiue the whole price as certainly as that: so the gift of Regeneration confirmes vs, that wee shall receiue whatsoeuer is promised in the Couenant. 3. The <hi>earnest</hi> is a part of the price, and reckoned in the payment: so the worke of grace begun, is a little part of eternall life, and of that great summe, which being promised and earnested in this life, shall bee fully paid in the other.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, this <hi>assurance</hi> comes by the <hi>liberty of the Spirit,</hi> called euery where a <hi>free Spirit:</hi>

Psal. 51.12</note> freeing the minde from ignorance, and bringing in a new light to know God and Christ as ours: freeing the heart from hatred, and working new sparkles of loue to God and our neighbour: freeing the will from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and working new motions, to fly and auoyd sinne, and to imbrace righteousnesse and holinesse: freeing the affections from slauish feare and terrors, which kept them from the Throne of grace, and sending them before God as children, with child-like
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:18777:156"/>
affections, of boldnesse and assurance to speed in their prayers: Also from the slauish feare of men. Finally, freeing the conscience and conuersation from dead workes, and bringing forth sweet and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly motions, with much assurance and settling in the grace receiued, so as no water can quench the sparke of life and loue breathed in by this Spirit of the Lord. And freeing the members, to be weapons of righteousnesse: Rom. 6.18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>I haue been the larger in this Note, because heere is a most essentiall difference of a good heart from a bad; and to meet with the errour of Papists, and profanenesse of Protestants, who reiect so sweet <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,</hi> as not possible, or not needfull.</p>

In respect of assistance: A good heart sees his owne weaknes, and in entring any holy duty, to which it is most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt, labours to get the Spirit to <hi>helpe his infirmities,</hi> Rom. 8. For as wee know not what to pray, so wee know not how to turne our selues to any <hi>spirituall worship,</hi> vnlesse the Spirit helpe vs. The Disciples cannot pray, vnlesse they bee taught.

voyd of guile and hypocrisie, voyd of raigning sinne, offering his worship, not for shew and ostentation, not couering deceit and hollownesse with a shew of holinesse.

Our tongues naturally are tyed, or frozen, and cleaue to the roofe of our mouth: but the Spirit makes vs speake with new tongues, with <hi>fiery tongues,</hi> with heat and feruency, in prayer, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and all the parts of Gods worship.<note place="margin">Act. 2.3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thus is God onely and truly worshipped from a good and honest heart, which onely is the Temple of the holy Ghost. In this Temple, the Arke of the soule keepes the Manna, the Word of God. In this Temple the sweet Incense of praises is daily offered vpon the Altar of a pure heart. In this, prayers are preferred, which are the breathing of the Spirit, not onely for vs, but in vs, crying, Abba Father. In this, the candle of faith euer burneth before God, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer goeth out. In this lastly, wee haue the Oracle of God counselling vs, and his Mercy-seate couering vs.</p>
            <p>But an euill heart cannot performe <hi>spirituall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:</hi> cannot pray, or praise, or confesse, because it wants the Spirit.

It can content it selfe with the deed done, and neuer care for the Mouer or manner: whereas no sacrifice did euer please God, without fire from heauen kindling it. It can performe bodily worship, <hi>offer a thousand Rammes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mic. 6.7.</note> 
               <hi>and ten thousand riuers of Oyle, yea and the first borne of his body:</hi> but cannot of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his heart, nor part with his deare sinnes. It is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheerfull and heauie in such parts of Gods seruice, because there wants an internall mouer: he is driuen from without, not drawne or led by the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and is as a Fish out of his element. Prayer and Sermons are too long, too many, and euery thing too much this way. It can pretend zeale and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but it is in some superstitious and formall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions: and in the meane time bee most zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the power and sincere practice of true piety. In a word:</p>
            <p>Of all the seruice and sacrifice of wicked men, <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, Prou. 15.8. <hi>It is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> For 1. The sacrifice is an vncleane beast, and hatefull, Tit. 1.15. <hi>To the vncleane, all is vncleane.</hi> 2. They lay it not on the Altar, that is, tender it not in Christs mediation. 3. They want fire and feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, zeale and affection, to put to it. 4. They lay not their hands on the head of the Calfe, confessing in the sense of sinne, their owne vnworthinesse, and guiltinesse. How can God accept a seruice, wanting these foure things?</p>

Againe, it sees that a broken and contrite heart is a <hi>sacrifice of Gods delight,</hi> Psalm. 51.17. It sees Gods eye euer vpon it, and hath an awfull sence of his presence. It sees the method of the Lord, who first smites, and then heales; who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer comforts such as neuer mourned, nor promised a ioyfull haruest but to a sorrowfull seed-time.<note place="margin">Ps. 126.5, 6</note> It sees the Lord ready to <hi>dwell in a contrite soule,</hi> Esa. 57.15. <hi>to grace it,</hi> 1.

In that it mournes not so much for offending God a terrible Iudge, as a mercifull Father: not so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> much for feare of hell, as for loue of God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. There will be smitings of heart for all sins: small sinnes as well as great; <hi>Dauids</hi> heart will smite him for cutting <hi>Sauls</hi> lappe, as if he had cut his flesh: and for numbring the people, as if he had murdred them. It will startle at vaine oathes, as at periury: at adulterous words, as actions: for secret sinnes, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.13.</note> because <hi>all are open to him whom we deale withall:</hi> yea for faylings in good duties, as well as for open <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and foule euils. 3. Seeing tendernesse of heart is a notable meanes to preserue the goodnesse of it, the good heart is soone awakened after sinne commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Iosiahs</hi> heart melted at hearing the Law read. One word of <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>Dauid,</hi> brought him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. And it is no sooner awakened than hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and not raised but by serious repentance.</p>
            <p>But is an euill heart thus humble? or rather is it not hard,<note place="margin">Exod. 5.2.</note> senslesse, proud, as <hi>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord?</hi> 1. It suffereth not it selfe to be scratched or pricked, much lesse beaten to pieces: for it hates the meanes to be pulled out of sinne, as he did <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi> Prou. 1.21. <hi>They hate knowledge, they chuse not the feare of the Lord.</hi> Yea, they <hi>resist the holy Ghost</hi> in the Ministery, as the Iewes, Act. 7.51. 2. It cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:18777:159"/>
to looke into his debts, because it knowes his estate not good: or will not be at the trouble, to hunt out all sinne, nor at leasure to seeke out small sinnes: what? God will not be so strict, nor wee need so to be. 3. It counts sorrow and mourning for sinne, a womanly and impotent passion, not fit for men of courage. 4. It is so farre from sorrow for fayling in good duties, that it is vnmoouable as a pillar, and can scorne iudgements denounced against his open and monstrous sinnes: And therefore an euill heart is noted, that being <hi>smitten, it seekes not after God,</hi> Ierem. 5.2.</p>
            <p>The second spirituall grace is <hi>illumination,</hi>

               </note> by sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and fruitfull knowledge attained in the means. It knoweth, 1. That there is a dungeon of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse within, further than the beames of heauenly light dart in thorow the narrow chinkes of it: and that <hi>without knowledge the minde is not good,</hi> Pro. 19.2. and that the day is not more necessary for worke, than knowledge is for saluation, Rom. 13.12. 2. That it cannot offer to an <hi>vnknowne God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 17.23</note> but knowledge must direct holy worship, and further holy life. 3. That onely true knowledge is able to discerne things that differ, and enables a Christian to hold the grounds of faith and holy life, against all decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and carnall counsellers. 4. That the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the good things giuen vs of God, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streth the comfort of them: for there is no comfort of grace, that we know not whether we haue, or no. 5. That by it is attained a store and riches of grace: whence it is called <hi>a rich knowledge,</hi> Col. 2.2. Yea, and of glory, euen for the present: whence our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:18777:160"/>
calls it a part of <hi>eternall life,</hi> Ioh. 17.3.</p>
            <p>Now a good heart knowing all this, doth search for knowledge, as men doe for siluer and gold, and prizeth the knowledge of holy things most highly.</p>

Cor. 3.18. iust as a Pearle, by the beames of the Sunne, and celestiall bodies continually beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it, is made light and shining as they. This knowledge will make thee resemble the light and holinesse of Christ, and grow both in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and in the image of Christ. 4. This good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> heart not onely knowes the things of the Spirit, but sauours them: not onely feeles his motions within it, but cherisheth and obeyeth them: not onely heares his stil voyce within, but is led by him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his course you shall see him ioyne with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and iudgement in matter of faith, wisedome and discretion in practice of life; in which, not a forme onely, but the power of godlinesse appeares, 2. Pet. 1.10.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It busieth it selfe in getting distinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of his owne particular happinesse, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed by God: without which, all other knowledge is folly. And as in a Furnace, the metall or Glasse, when it most glistereth, is nighest melting: so all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge, in ciuill and Diuine things, let it be neuer so shining or glistering, without this, shall melt away, and come to nothing.</p>

            <p>Now (as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith) this knowledge resteth not in the heart of fooles: it is too high a knowledge for them. An euill heart cannot prize true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: it soone knowes enough, without searching Gods Booke, or viewing his workes: it is too wise to heare, reade, meditate, or pray for knowledge; and saith, What needs all this knowledge and preaching? It neuer saw the riches of wisedome, and knowledge; and saith, that running to Sermons, and studying the Scriptures, will make men beggers. It runnes at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and walkes by any rule but the Word; that is an intolerable yoke. It heares many spiritual things, but sauours none. It least busies it selfe in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his owne happinesse, as most vnseasonable, vnprofitable, impossible. It saith it knowes God, but keepes not his Commandements, 1. Ioh. 2.4. or heares not his Ministers, chap. 4.6. or walkes not in the light; or professeth not; yea, professeth against it, and persecuteth the bringers of it, Ioh. 16.3.</p>

               </note>The third spirituall grace is <hi>iustification,</hi> or the grace of iustifying faith: which a good heart cannot want: Because it knowes, 1. That only faith espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth vnto Christ, and the assurance of marriage is in the contract, Hos. 2.19. 2.

soule of obedience: as without which nothing can please God, Heb. 11.6. No action, speech, almes, prayer, hearing, preaching; all without it, is defiled, and sinne, and the labour lost. 4. Faith is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and strength of Christian life: no loue, no ioy in Christ, before he bee beleeued and apprehended, 1. Pet. 1.8. No hope for hereafter, if faith beleeueth not: <hi>no peace with God, till wee bee iustified by faith,</hi> Rom. 5.1. No boldnesse in prayer, till by faith wee can <hi>call God Father:</hi> no strength in tentation, no ioy in affliction, no comfort in death, till faith haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Christ his victory, his strength, his life; then the bands of tentations, afflictions, and deadly things dismay him not. 5. Faith opens heauen, and makes way to see things within the Vayle: to obtaine by the prayer of faith, the wealth of heauen; yea and the glory of heauen: for the <hi>end of faith is saluation.</hi> Whereas an vnbeleeuer shuts heauen against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, Reuel. 21.8. <hi>Without shall bee vnbeleeuers.</hi> If weaknesse of faith shut <hi>Moses</hi> out of earthly Canaan; much more must want of faith shut men out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Canaan.</p>

Thus in euery thing the good heart may say, <hi>I liue not now, but Christ liueth in me,</hi> Galat. 2.20.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As euery life must bee maintained in naturall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> things; so also must this life of faith: Therefore a good heart will bee very diligent in the meanes of preseruing and increasing faith.

It cannot bee brought to labour seriously in the application of Christs merits and righteousnesse: thinkes not application to be of the nature of faith; or onely applies it for saluation, not sanctification, or change of the heart and life. 4. It can talke of faith, not liue by it: cannot beleeue for lesser things, as meate, and drink, but vseth vnwarrantable meanes, much lesse for greater &amp; higher things: ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thank God for prosperity, but makes too much haste in aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 5.

                  <hi>No good heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this grace.</hi> 4. <hi>Reasons.</hi>
               </note> 1. That as an Infant new-borne, if it cry, it is aliue; if not, it is still-borne: so, to send out strong cryes to the Throne of grace, is a note of Gods Childe, and a signe of the new-birth: Rom. 8.26. Zech. 12.10. Therefore it comforts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it selfe in crying. 2. That it is bound by the <hi>Morall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Law,</hi> (besides the Commandement of Christ, and his Apostles) to performe continually this part of worship to God; namely, by the affirmatiue part of the second Commandement: which duty, euen <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in innocency, free from sinne, performed, and needed to pray for perseuerance in the grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he stood, and else had he not kept the Law. But a good heart seeing it selfe seazed on by sinne, and the curse of the Law, sees much more need in it selfe to performe this duty to the Lord, and to it selfe. 3. That this grace excellently vpholds the sweet so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety betweene God, and a beleeuing soule. For as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> strangenesse alienates and cooles the affections of friends, whereas company and conference kindleth
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:18777:165"/>
and inflameth them: Euen so heerein (as <hi>Iob</hi> saith, chap. 22.21.) wee <hi>acquaint our selues with God,</hi> and grow into familiarity and fellowship with him. He delights in vs, while wee acknowledge him a God <hi>hearing prayer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 65.2.</note> 
               <hi>to whom all flesh must resort.</hi> And the beleeuing soule hath exceeding comfort in his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious answeres and supplies, who is so ready to heare, before we call; and esteemes it no small grace, that the Lord should not only admit it into his presence, but set so easie a condition vpon his promises; as for asking, we shall obtaine them. 4. It knowes, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> prayer being one of the chiefe Christian sacrifices, the Lord will euer returne one token or other of his gracious acceptance. For as the <hi>Legall sacrifices,</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Gods Institution, were answered with a speciall signe of Gods approbation, of the fire from heauen to consume them: So will the Lord some way manifest his delight in these <hi>Christian sacrifices,</hi> which himselfe compares to sweet <hi>Incense,</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume</hi>; yea, to <hi>drops of honey,</hi> dropping from the lips of the Church, as from an honey-combe, Cant. 4.11. And how can he but returne a comfortable answere on that, which is so delightfull vnto him?</p>
            <p>Therefore a good heart is carefull and frequent in this duty. But not so much for the doing of it, as to doe it well: and therefore is carefull, 1. for the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer</hi>: 2. the <hi>matter:</hi> 3. the <hi>manner</hi> of his prayers.</p>

               </note>1. The <hi>mouer</hi> of prayer is not nature in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it is in the wicked. Nature teacheth, that what we conceiue to be God, is to be prayed vnto; and the Heathen could pray to God as a Creator and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour: But the <hi>mouer</hi> in a good heart, is <hi>the Spirit,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:18777:165"/>
by which it cryeth, Abba Father,</hi> Rom. 8.15. True prayer is a proper action of the <hi>sonnes of God:</hi> therefore Christ commanded vs in the entrance of prayer, to say, <hi>Our Father.</hi> And it is the breath of the Spirit of God. For he alone can leade vs into the sence of our wants. He makes vs see the goodnesse of things that we craue. He bends our affections, and kindles our sacrifice, without whom is no light or heat. Let the Spirit remit but a little, and the holyest men, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Peter, Iames, Iohn,</hi> shall bee fitter to sleepe, than watch, or pray in the very houre of tentation, Math. 26.38.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the <hi>matter:</hi> A good heart,<note place="margin">Zech. 12.10.</note> moued by the <hi>Spirit of supplication,</hi> is most frequent and earnest, 1.

            <p>This prayer forceth the Lord, that hee craues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, Exod. 32. Genes. 32.26. where the father saith, <hi>Domine, quis te tenet?</hi> Lord, who holdeth thee, that thou canst not get away?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>An euill heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray.</hi>
               </note>Now thus an euill heart cannot pray. For first, it cannot pray in the Spirit, because the Spirit is not there. It can draw neere with the lips, when the heart is remoued. It cannot pray in humility, because a proud heart neuer saw his wants. It can say words of prayer, and doe the action, but without faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affection. And it is regardlesse of the promises, and leanes on second causes. Secondly, the heart and tongue are at variance; the prayer of the lip, and the practice of the life at discord. It can say, <hi>Hallowed bee thy Name,</hi> but sweare vainly, falsly, ordinarily, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely. It can say, <hi>Thy Kingdome come,</hi> but persecute Preachers and Professors, and abet Popery or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanenesse. It can say, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> but not by it selfe; and, when God hath reuealed his will, it can be impatient, fretfull, &amp;c. It can say, <hi>Giue vs this day our daily bread,</hi> but be couetous, vniust, lye, sweare, depend on vnlawfull meanes, not Gods allowance. It can seeme to pray for <hi>pardon of sinne,</hi> but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the practice of sinne, nor with repentance: yea, when they meane to liue and dye in sinne. It can say, <hi>Leade vs not into tentation,</hi> but runne into euery snare, all companies, &amp; courses: no corrupt fashion,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:18777:166"/>
but it soone can become a leader in it. But the prayer of the Spirit is no such thing: it will indeed practise what it prayes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, an euill heart either prayes not, or speeds not. What swarmes of Atheists are there, who out of a gracelesse contempt of all Religion, neglect this duty? that whereas godly men are denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>such as call on the Name of the Lord,</hi> 1. Cor. 1.2. <hi>these call not on God,</hi> Psalm. 14.4. And, whereas the godly are such as <hi>thinke on the Name of the Lord,</hi> Mal. 3.16. these seldome or neuer thinke on his Name, but in oathes, blasphemies, and cursing. Or if they will needs bee said to pray, yet they speed not: for first, their persons are not acceptable: Psal. 34.15, 16. His eares are open to <hi>the righteous,</hi> but his face is set <hi>against the wicked:</hi> yea, their <hi>prayer is turned into sin,</hi> Psalm. 109.7. Secondly, they turne their eare from hearing the Law, and so it is abominable, Prou. 28.9. And they make no conscience of other duties, or not ordinarily: as if all the promises belonged to one duty. Nay, they pray, to serue their owne turne, not to returne duty of any kinde vnto God. And if the subiect will not heare the Prince, iustly doth the Prince reiect his suites. Thirdly, such a man prayes sometimes, <hi>not continually: in affliction diligently,</hi> Hos. 5.15. In time of Lent, superstitiously:<note place="margin">1. Thes. 5.17.</note> Lectures and Church-prayers are nothing so good out of Lent. Or it can pray at leisure times, but cannot set all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side for prayer, to waite vpon it. For some things it can pray, <hi>Nimis ardenter,</hi> (saith <hi>Augustine) too fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently:</hi> that is, for temporals; as corne, and wine, and oyle, onely, or chiefly, Hos. 7.14. But in spirituall
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:18777:167"/>
things, it is neither frequent, nor feruent, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant. Fourthly, the voyce of prayer is drowned with the voyce of sinne. The voyce of <hi>Abels</hi> blood cryed downe the voyce of <hi>Cains</hi> prayer. The voyce of Sodoms sinne, the voyce of <hi>Abrahams</hi> intercession. So of the voyce of couetousnesse, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, iniustice, drunkennesse, filthinesse. Fifthly, it can wish for pardon of sinne, and reconciliation with God; but speeds not, because it will not be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with his brethren,</hi> Math. 5.24. <hi>Leaue thy gift before the Altar, goe thy way, first bee reconciled to thy brother.</hi> A wicked heart can send out of the same mouth, both blessing, and cursing: can pray for bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on himselfe, and the plague of God on his neighbour. Papists can be at their Beads and Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or prosperity, while they call for fire from hell to burne Parliaments. Yea, roughnesse and pride of spirit doe often preuaile against good men, that they are disordered in their families, &amp; their <hi>prayers interrupted,</hi> 1. Pet. 3.7. Lastly, he can seeme to pray, whiles he is an enemy to prayer. Hee cannot abide these long prayers, and constant course of holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise in families. Oh beware of despising any of Gods graces: especially this of prayer in any of his children. Their prayers keepe Gods vengeance from off thee, esteeme them as basely as thou canst.</p>

                  <hi>The fourth sort, in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall growth.</hi>
               </note>The <hi>fourth sort of Rules</hi> concerning the Spirit of God, is for <hi>spirituall growth.</hi> Wherein a good heart is knowne by many excellent qualities.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It knowes, that something in grace is still wanting, and all is not giuen at once, and so still humbleth it selfe in the measure receiued: Phil. 3.13.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:18777:167"/>
2. It knowes, that without growth, that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, decayes: the one Talent, not increased, is taken away, Math. 25. 3. Seeing the bitter fruit of decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the wofull example of many that fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it is carefull not to bee plucked away with the errour of the wicked, but grow in grace, 2. Pet. 3.17, 18. 4. Because the good heart, being one of the Lords plants, is fruitfull in euery part of the life, but <hi>more fruitfull in the age,</hi> Psalm. 92.14. It prouokes it selfe more forward, more forcibly. 5. Because sound grace cannot rest in beginnings, but growes to perfection, and is crowned with perseuerance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like to the <hi>light of the Sunne,</hi> which increaseth in brightnesse till high noone, Prou. 4.18. Therefore it is most carefull to grow in sound grace: the <hi>sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> of which growth is discerned two wayes:</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">

Righteousnesse is reuealed <hi>from faith to faith</hi>; that which was a graine of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard-seed, riseth to a tree: that faith which is weake and lowe, riseth to a talnesse and fulnesse. It growes vp from present things, to future, Psal. 23. vlt. ascends from the meanes, to the promise: growes to affiance in Christ, as well without meanes as with them; yea, against meanes, Rom. 4.18. wherein <hi>Abraham</hi> was a father of many beleeuing children. <hi>Iob</hi> can trust, when God is killing him: as our Lord called God <hi>his God,</hi> when he felt himselfe forsaken.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In loue,</hi> both of God, and men: As for God, the more sins are found out and forgiuen, the more loue abounds. <hi>Many sinnes were forgiuen her, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she loued much,</hi> Luk. 7.47. The weake loue of the Disciples before Christs death, afterward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued strong, that they who fled from him, could dye with him. A little sparke of this Diuine loue, growes to a great flame, and much water cannot quench it, nor flouds drowne it; it is <hi>stronger than death,</hi> Cant. 8.6, 7. It growes to a great diligence in his seruice, to great hatred of what hee hates, and great liberality for his sake. Againe, loue of men growes in a good heart, and <hi>aboundeth</hi> more and more, 2. Thes. 1.3. It growes from louing of friends, to louing of enemies; from couering one or two offences, to couer a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forgiuing small offences, to forgiue

It growes from louing their bodies, to louing their soules most dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and from compassion to the body, to mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the soule, in helping it out of sin.

Cor. 7.30. And it growes to seeke first the Kingdome of God, and then other things: yea, from desires of the world, to desire deliuerance from it. Secondly, it growes from seeking honour among <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> men, to seeke the honour from aboue, Ioh. 5.44. and to loue the praise of God, more than of men, chap. 12.43. Thirdly, from speaking of things below, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> speake of things aboue, 1. Ioh. 4.5. Now according to the abundance of a new heart, they speake with new tongues, in a new language of heauenly Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: as Christ, after his resurrection, <hi>spake of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to the Kingdome of God,</hi> Act. 1.3.

from earthly wisedome, to heauenly: he was wise in his trade, or in a good bargaine; now hee growes wise in the matters of God, and his Religion; a wise Merchant, who will purchase the best commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity: Hee growes also in wisedome, to discerne the season of grace, and day of saluation. Fifthly, from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> seeking Gods fauour, to seeke his presence: Psa. 27.8. <hi>My heart said, I will seeke thy face.</hi> It is now of the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of them that seeke the face of God,</hi> Psalm. 24.6. Lastly, from seeking his presence in grace, to seeke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> his presence in glory: desiring, preparing, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the appearance of Christ: <hi>The Bride saith,</hi>

            <p>An euill heart may make a little shew, but growes not, like a body in an <hi>Atrophy,</hi> feedes and eates, but prospers not, is in a consumption still. For 1. it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settled and vngrounded, not rooted or stablished in the faith; but as children, carried away with euery toy, so these, with euery waue, or winde of doctrine: any seducer, or libertine teacher may take away his Crowne: A very easie thing, to make him esteeme the Doctrine of godlinesse, and the practice of it, but singularity and precisenesse; and make him stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger betweene Popery, and true Religion; yea, to possesse him with a wicked opinion and conceit, that
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:18777:170"/>
Popery is better. 2. As a good hart to grow, growes in the powerfull vse of the meanes of saluation; knowing, that hee who must retaine strength, must eate daily; so the euill heart neglects the meanes of grace and growth. A good hart, the more it growes, the more it is humble; but this growes proud of what he knowes, and is soone at a stand, not needing more: Whence else are such speeches as these, <hi>What need all this preaching, so many Sermons, so much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi> From pride, it growes to idlenesse in the vse of good meanes, and shall assoone grow rich in grace, as an idle fellow that casts vp his Calling, and makes euery day holy-day, shall grow rich in the world.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A good hart carefully imbraceth the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Reasons.</hi> Cant. 2.9.</p>
               </note> stands in these reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because a good heart cannot heare God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe speake, nor enioy such neere and immediate fellowship with him as it desires, it is most glad to enioy him <hi>through the grates</hi> of the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; to heare him speake by his Messenger, to reade his letters, and be enriched with such pledges of his loue, which therein he includeth to his sonnes and daughters. Thus doth a faithfull Spouse to him absent, whom her soule loueth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because these Ordinances proceed from the holy Spirit of God, and are meanes appoynted for the sanctification of the Elect, a good heart will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:18777:175"/>
heare or reade the Scriptures, nor speake of them but with great reuerence. It dares not profane the sacred Scriptures, vsing them vainely or wickedly, as in iests, playes, charmes: neither dares it come to the Sacrament without due examination, preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, instruction, correction, or strength and consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the course of Christianity, 2. Tim. 3.16.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because the good heart sees his continuall need, it is carefull in the continuall vse of the means of grace. It sees hardnesse of heart still stealing on it. It discernes spirituall weaknesse, and fainting of soule. It feeles many conflicts of the flesh against the spirit. It is acquainted with the thrusts, and temptations of Satan. It sees the health of the soule stand in these refreshings, and the strength of the heart decaying without them, as the body doth without repayre. And therefore it still relieues it selfe by the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, and the like: Psalm. 119.28. <hi>My heart melteth for heauinesse: raise me vp according to thy Word:</hi> vers. 92. <hi>Had it not been for thy Word, I had perished in my trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 4.24.</note>4. Because it conceiues <hi>God a Spirit,</hi> and his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances spirituall, therefore in performing these, it neuer contents it selfe with the outward deed alone, but especially aymes at soundnesse and sincerity in the manner of doing: Psalm. 119.80. <hi>Let my heart be vpright in thy statutes.</hi> All is out of sence, and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jt makes great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the Word preached.</hi> 3. <hi>Reasons.</hi>
               </note> not for shame, fashion, custome, law, or vaine ostentation.</p>
            <p>But now in speciall, for the Word preached: A good heart makes great conscience of it, as is great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> reason: 1. Because it sees the Word preached, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:18777:175"/>
able to bruise a stony heart; to tame, melt, and cause to tremble a secure heart, as <hi>Felix:</hi> Esa. 66.2.— <hi>that trembleth at my Word.</hi> Acts 16.24. The Iaylor came trembling and shiuering, as hauing a strong Ague in his conscience. Also it is of power to open a shut conscience, as <hi>Dauids</hi> by <hi>Nathan.</hi> 2. Because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the preaching of the Word reueales the <hi>vnsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches of Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reu. 3.20.</note> Ephes. 3.8. and brings into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him. This is the hammer, by which Christ <hi>standing at the dore</hi> of the heart, knocks, and <hi>if any open, he comes in, and suppes with him:</hi> Christ not onely inuites him to a feast, but feeds him with his owne flesh and blood: <hi>and he with Christ</hi>; that is, a fruitfull Hearer of the Word entertaines Christ, calls him (as the Church, Cant. 4.16.) to a feast in his Garden, <hi>to eate of his pleasant things.</hi> Christ is fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, when he tastes the sweet fruits of repentance, faith, mortification, and obedience, wrought by the preaching of the Word. Nay, it makes vs of neere kindred with Christ, his <hi>father, his mother, his brethren and sisters,</hi> Luk. 8.21. 3. Because the Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched brings in the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ministeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Verbi, vehiculum Spiritus.</hi>
               </note> with his sauing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> graces: being <hi>the chariot of the Spirit,</hi> by which hee rides gloriously into the hearts of Beleeuers; God who can giue his Spirit without it, ordinarily doth not. He could haue taught <hi>Cornelius,</hi> without <hi>Peters</hi> so tedious a iourney: but <hi>Cornelius</hi> must attend <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Ministery, <hi>and while Peter was yet speaking, the holy Ghost fell on them all,</hi> Acts 10.44. But see it in <hi>speciall</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sauing graces: first, illumination is by preaching,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Speciall sauing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wrought by the Word preached.</hi>
               </note> Acts 8.31. The Eunuch cannot vnderstand without an <hi>interpreter</hi>; he must ioyne himselfe to <hi>Philip.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>faith comes by hearing,</hi> Rom. 10.14. and <hi>by the foolishnesse of preaching, God will saue them that beleeue,</hi> 1. Cor. 1.21. Neither can actuall faith be without some measure of actuall knowledge. Thirdly, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> feare of God is wrought by preaching: Rom. 8.15. the spirit of feare is wrought by the Ministery of the Law; shewing sinne distinctly, the curse due to it, and our owne guiltinesse: And by the Gospell is wrought that childlike feare, by the spirit of adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which now we feare to offend God, as before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to be offended and reuenged on by him. Fourthly, peace of conscience, and a sweete ioy in God is wrought hereby: Psalm. 51.8. <hi>Let me heare the voyce of gladnesse, that the broken bones may reioyce.</hi> Lastly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the Word preached brings in, not onely this life of grace, but that of glory: Act. 11.14. Send for <hi>Peter</hi> to Ioppa,<note place="margin">Act. 13.26.</note> and he shall speake <hi>words, whereby both thou and thy house shall be saued.</hi> And therefore is it called the Word of <hi>life and saluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearing in fiue things.</hi>
               </note>In these and other regards, a good heart is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable Hearer:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It prepares it selfe as a fit casket or storehouse to lay the Word in, conceiuing it the most precious iewell, and richest pearle in all the world. <hi>Dauid hid the Word in his heart,</hi> Psalm. 119.11. 2. In sence of it owne want, and the worth of the Word, it preserues an appetite and hunger after the preaching of it. <hi>As the babe</hi> sucks greedily the milke:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.2.</note> so it will feed hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily on this Bread of life. It will be at paines for it, as a babe will cry after the brest. It will heare dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, without omission, intermission, or delay. It will waite at the gates of wisdome, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> for
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:18777:176"/>
               <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 10.33. <hi>We are all heere ready to heare what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is commaunded thee of God.</hi> 3. Because God speakes not to the eare onely, but to the heart, this heart will heare as well as the eare. If God say, Seeke my face, the heart will make eccho, and <hi>answere, Thy face, Lord, will I seeke,</hi> Psal. 27.8. 4. This heart makes the whole man heare and receiue the Word: first, <hi>the inner man</hi> shall delight in the law, Rom. 7.22. The iudgement shall esteeme it aboue thousands of gold and siluer: the minde shall attend it: the heart shall beleeue it: the memory shall keepe and treasure it: the affections shall cleaue to it, and the conscience submit to it: secondly, <hi>the outward man</hi> shall be as conformable. The eare shall heare it with reuerence: the mouth shall speake and professe it: the hand shall practise it, and the whole man be submitted to the obedience of it: as in sound health, the nourishment is carried to all parts. 5. This heart embraceth the whole Word, saying of all, as the Prophet, Mic. 2.7. <hi>Is not my Word good to him that walketh vprightly?</hi> First, it <hi>loues</hi> the Word which reuealeth sinne, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and condemneth it; both because it discouers sinne, to be repented of, and forsaken; as also because it leades the sinner to Christ, and sets him faster to him. Secondly, it <hi>applies</hi> the whole Word to it selfe, as well for conuiction as consolation. You shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer see a good heart more smitten with the sharpe threatnings of the Word, than they to whom they belong. Meate that must nourish, must goe into the stomake and bowels: so must the Word, that must profit vs, passe thorow our affections, either to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or direct, or comfort vs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:18777:177"/>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>An euill heart sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth fiue waies in hearing.</hi>
               </note>By this triall, many that bragge of the goodnesse of their hearts, may see themselues farre off. For first, an euill heart cares not how farre it bee estranged from God: As it flies his presence and eye, so his Word also, which passeth sentence on him, and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him afore-hand; desires no acquaintance either with God or his Word. Many say as the people to <hi>Ieremy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 6.17.</note> 
               <hi>The Word of the Lord in thy mouth we will not heare.</hi> The Popish Recusant stops his eare, and will heare no voyce. The Atheist, as hee denies God in his heart, so hee denies his presence to the meanes: Both of them refuse fellowship with God, barre out the Spirit of God and his sauing graces, and wilfully debarre themselues of faith, which is dropt into the heart by the eare, and of the life of grace and glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, an euill heart can come to heare, but brings not an <hi>hearing eare:</hi> But it brings, 1. an <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie eare,</hi> or deafe rather; as many who cast themselues asleepe, who would be ashamed to sleepe, if a man but a little better than themselues should speake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. An argument of a sleepy, and dull heart: And can we thinke God will open that mans heart, who will not open his owne eare? Or 2. it brings an <hi>itching eare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.4</note> that cannot abide wholesome doctrine: Hardly can any Minister please them; hee is either too <hi>Legall</hi> in his threats, or too <hi>Euangelicall</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall promises, or his life too austere, or too remisse. <hi>Iohn</hi> fasts, and hath a diuell: Christ eates, and is a glutton. Or if the doctrine be quicke and powerfull, then inquire if he bee not a Puritan: for if impure wretches once so stile him, then may hee be aduised better, than to trouble himselfe with such a mans
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:18777:177"/>
doctrine. Or 3. it brings a <hi>stopped eare,</hi> when in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the heart goeth after lusts, or is stopped with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant conceits; as, that no such good is to bee got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Sermons; or, it were pitty all should bee true that the Preacher saith; or, the world was better when was lesse preaching; or, few great men loue preaching, or frequent it much; or, it is no great wisedome to bee so forward as some, and none are worse than such as runne after Sermons. Cares also, and lusts, and pleasures choke and stop the passage of the Word into mens hearts, that they heare it as a story, or a tale, but are no more moued with it, than if they were stockes and stones: the most dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full threats of vengeance pricke them not at heart.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, an euill heart can heare sometime with diligence and delight, but will heare to know, not to practise: delights in contemplation, but <hi>hates refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:</hi> delights in the promises of the Gospell,<note place="margin">Psa. 50.17.</note> not in the precepts of the Law; or if it doe, yet not in an vniuersall practice, inward, and outward: For it is an vnfailing rule, An euill heart cannot delight in the Law of God, touching <hi>the inner man.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.22</note> Oh how hard it is to binde the thoughts to conformity with Gods Law! Nay, a loose heart cries out of too much precisenesse.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, an euill heart can heare sometimes care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, but neuer truly apply. For the promises and comforts of God, it is readyest to apply them to it selfe, which belong not to it: for God feeds the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent with iudgement: this is the part of such an heart, but it lets that alone. As for rebukes, it heares or abides none: it is loth to bee drawne to a
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:18777:178"/>
Sermon, that rebukes his darling sinnes, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Israel was to come neere the Mount, Heb. 12.19. While it heares, it is filled with wrath and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, Luk. 4.24. saying, <hi>Physician, cure thy selfe:</hi> yea, it is ready to <hi>burst for anger,</hi> as <hi>Stephens</hi> aduersaries, Act. 7.54. And for afterwards, they <hi>hate him to the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath that rebukes sinne in the gate,</hi> and <hi>abhorre him that speaketh vprightly,</hi> Amos 5.10. Hee is their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that tells them the truth: as <hi>Ahab</hi> said of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah, I told you he neuer prophesied good, but euill:</hi> and to <hi>Eliah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemie?</hi> And if Christ himselfe should neuer so wisely rebuke them, they would lay hands on him, or runne to the Rulers, as <hi>Ioshua</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 11.28.</note> 
               <hi>Master<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> forbid them to prophesie.</hi> In one word: An euill heart pretending sound loue to preaching, is an vtter enemy to sound preaching. To whom I say, Is Gods Word an aduersary to thee? So is God himselfe. Doth the Word iudge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee? So shall the Lord for euer condemne thee, except thou timely repent. And thou that canst not endure the threatning of iudgement, goe on in thy sinnes, thou shalt indure the iudgement threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, eternally: stop thine eare against the cries of Gods Word against thy sinnes, this Word shall take hold on thee, and thou shalt cry out for euer against thy sinnes and selfe, and thy cry shall not bee heard, pitied, nor ended.</p>
            <p>Lastly, an euill heart can heare, but not pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, and so loseth all the power of the Word, and the blessing which depends on prayer: for <hi>Paul</hi> planteth, <hi>Apollos</hi> watereth, but <hi>God giueth the increase,</hi> 1. Cor. 3.6. And <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching was fruitfull to <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:18777:178"/>
because <hi>the Lord opened her heart,</hi> Act. 16.14.</p>
            <p>The second meanes, whereby true Religion is maintained, are the <hi>Sabbaths and assemblies.</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect whereof, a good heart hath many markes and qualities.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It knowes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>A good hart is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable for the Sabbath.</hi> 6. <hi>Reasons.</hi>
               </note> God hath appoynted both a certaine time and place for the publike exercise of Religion; both for the preseruation of his worship, which else would speedily run to ruine: as also that the Church might be knowne and discerned, as a City on the top of a Mountaine, by the meeting of his people: and that such as forsake it, might iustly, and inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably be damned, it being so visible and sensible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Now this being a morall and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Commandement, written in Tables of stone, a good heart dares not bring the guilt of violating it vpon it selfe, by forgetting what God would haue vs remember, or profaning what hee commands to keepe holy, or vnhallowing the time or place which he hath blessed to holy vses: Leuit. 19.30. <hi>Yee shall keepe my Sabbaths, and reuerence my Sanctuary: I am the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It knowes, that the strict keeping of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, is a fashioning of vs to Gods Image, who did all his worke in the six dayes, and rested the seuenth: To the Image of <hi>Adams</hi> holinesse in his innocency, who obserued the seuenth day holy vnto God: And to the image of the second <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 2.28.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> who most absolutely kept the Sabbath, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling all righteousnesse. And the good hart, though it cannot attaine this perfection, yet striues to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this Image.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:18777:179"/>3. It knowes, that as it is the Pale and preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of Religion, and the heart of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (as it is placed betweene the two Tables:) so it is <hi>the triall of Religion.</hi> Whence it is vsuall in Scripture, to put keeping of the Sabbath, for the whole worship of God; and the Prophets mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the decay of all Religion, say, <hi>the Sabbaths are polluted,</hi> Lam. 1.7. and that hee that is an ordinary Sabbath-breaker, is a man of no religion, without God in the world. The Iewes could say, <hi>If this man were of God, he would keepe the Sabbath,</hi> Ioh. 9.16. And enemies and hinderers of sanctifying the Sabbath, are called, <hi>vnbeleeuers, vagabonds, and wicked fellowes,</hi> Act. 17.2, 5.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It knowes, that fearfull iudgements linger and waite vpon that person or people, that negligently or wilfully profane Gods holy Sabbath. Neh. 13.18. <hi>Did not your fathers thus, and our God brought all this plague vpon vs? Yet ye increase the wrath, in breaking the Sabbath.</hi> Ezek. 20.13. God thinkes on such, to <hi>powre out indignation vpon them.</hi> Which is <hi>a fire that cannot be quenched,</hi> Ier. 17. vlt. The bodily death, for the breach of the Ceremoniall part, did figure the death of the soule, for the breach of the Morall part: See Exod. 31.14. and 35.2.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It knowes, that God showres downe blessings, spirituall and temporall, of this life, and a better, on the heads of conscionable obseruers of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: Esa. 56.2, 5. <hi>Blessed is the man that doth this, that keepeth the Sabbath, and pollutes it not:</hi> Chap. 58.13, 14. If thou make the Sabbath a delight, thou shalt <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Lord:</hi> that is, in the sweetnesse of his

Here are blessings internall, externall, eternall.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It knowes, that the carefull sanctifying of a Sabbath heere, is the beginning of that euerlasting Sabbath hereafter, when we shall be gathered vnto the Congregation of the first borne, written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and enter into that eternall Rest, of which this is a shadow: which who so begins not here, <hi>God hath sworne he shall neuer enter into his rest.</hi>

                  </gap>.</note>Secondly, a good heart will keepe <hi>the whole Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> day: which is the seuenth, in respect of the sixe following: namely, <hi>the first day of the weeke,</hi> as the Iewish was the seuenth, in respect of the sixe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, namely, the last of the weeke. If thou hirest a seruant or labourer to worke a day, doest thou not meane a whole day? When God allowes thee sixe dayes, are they not whole? and is not the seuenth so too? When God rested the seuenth day, was it not the whole? Therefore a good heart thinks not, it hath sufficiently kept a Sabbath, to heare Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, or a Sermon, in the fore-noone, or after-noone, and all day else doe what hee list: No, it will giue him the morning, and giue him the euening too, Psal. 92.2. It selfe would not accept of another the labour of one or two houres for a dayes worke, and dares not offer it to God, but will keepe the whole Sabbath, either in Gods House, or it owne, in duties publike, or priuate: Ier. 17.22. <hi>Ye shall doe no worke, but sanctifie my Sabbath.</hi>

               <note place="margin">3 <hi>With the whole man.</hi>
               </note>Thirdly, a good heart will make <hi>the whole man</hi> keepe the Sabbath. For as man stands of two parts, body, and soule, so the sanctifying of the Sabbath is twofold; inward, and outward; which a godly heart is carefull not to diuorce: and therefore, 1. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:18777:180"/>
the outward man from seruile workes of the calling, but specially from committing sinne, which is the most seruile worke, and most contrary to the sanctification of the Sabbath: the Lord cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the Sabbaths, when the <hi>hands are full of blood,</hi> Esa. 1.13. But the Sabbath that he chuseth, is, <hi>to loose the bands of wickednesse.</hi> 2. It bindes the tongue to holy speeches: If <hi>euery idle word</hi> must bee answered for, much more idle speeches on the Sabbath,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.36.</note> which is a double sinne. A good heart must not speake his <hi>owne words,</hi> nor a <hi>vaine word,</hi> Esa. 58.13. It cannot giue reines to the tongue to direct worldly busines, to make reckonings, to prattle of other mens busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to busie it selfe in the world, or worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, to talke of newes, as the Athenians, or sports and pleasures, nor things lawfull on other dayes. A good heart, out of a better store, will speake of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things. 3. It watcheth ouer the inner man: rests his affections in Sabbath-duties, and makes it his delight: suffers not his thoughts to roue, Esa. 58.13. <hi>Thou shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Will see it kept by others.</hi>
               </note> it will not onely keepe the Sabbath strictly it selfe, but see it kept of all within his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: A Magistrate of a good heart will compell all within the gates of the City thereunto, Ier. 17.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:18777:181"/>
sell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by suffering others: nor drinke, and sweare, or play away the Sabbath, by suffering others: all whose sinnes become his, by his conniuence, Neh. 13.15. A father of a good heart will <hi>command</hi> and compell all his children,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.19.</note> as <hi>Abraham:</hi> He will not suffer them to play and sport, when they should be at diuine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; but, where he is taught, they shall bee; when he prayes, they shall; when he heares, they shall; and to him they shall giue account of their hearing. A Master of a good heart will see his seruant serue his Master in heauen, as he serues him the sixe dayes: He cannot send him on errands, and trifling businesse, running and riding to serue his owne turne, and leaue God vnserued; but, as hee will not haue him neglect his affaires in the sixe dayes, so not Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice on the seuenth, but keepe him in, to the duties of that Day. <hi>Obiect.</hi> We cannot keepe in our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and children that Day. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. You can finde meanes other dayes to hold them to your owne bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse. 2. If they will haue liberty this Day, giue it them for all the rest: for <hi>Dauid</hi> would not haue a <hi>wicked person</hi> in his house, Psal. 101.4, 5. but, hee that is a seruant of God, shall be my seruant.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. <hi>Wil ioyne with the Assemblies in Gods House.</hi>
               </note>Fifthly, a good heart holds it selfe bound to ioyne with the Assemblies of Gods people, to frequent the House of God, and serue and seeke him, to come on that Day to Church, the Schoole of God, to heare and learne his will; and the Market of God, to make prouision for the soule for all the weeke following. It dares not <hi>forsake the fellowship, as some,</hi> Heb. 10.25. It mournes when vrgent occasion absenteth it: lookes toward the Temple, hungers, and earnestly
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:18777:181"/>
desires the fruition of such a blessing, Psalm. 42.2. It esteemes <hi>one day in Gods House, aboue a thousand</hi> else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, Psal. 84.10. such sweetnesse it tasteth in his Ordinances, Word, and Sacraments. Lastly, being sensible of Gods presence according to the promise, <hi>where two or three are gathered together in his Name,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 18.23</note> it comes not, but first <hi>puts off his shooes,</hi> because this is <hi>holy ground,</hi> and <hi>lookes to his feete,</hi> Eccles. 4.17. that is,<note place="margin">Exod. 3.5.</note> prepares his affections, to come with feare and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, with ioy and cheerfulnesse, heed and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, faith and holinesse, before that great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
            <p>Now an euill heart, first,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>How an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill heart carryeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t selfe to the Sabbath, in fiue things. Parasceue.</hi>
               </note> neuer prepares for the Sabbath: though it will not bee vnprouided for a Market-day: yea, it can dispatch his businesse, to set it selfe loose for any lust. The Iewes had a <hi>preparation</hi> to the Sabbath: and <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> came the day before the Sabbath, and begged the body of our Lord, and buried it before the Sabbath, to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the action and care of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it can defraud the Lord of his Day, or the greatest part of it; and holds it selfe loose after euening exercise, to what it list; as if himselfe would giue his seruant leaue after that time to cast off his seruice.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it makes no conscience of profaning the Lords Sabbath; many wayes: 1. Doing his owne will, not the Lords; his owne worke, not the worke of the Sabbath: selling wares within the shop, and without, running vp and downe with them; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther workes of the calling; whereas the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is, <hi>Thou shalt doe no manner of worke.</hi> 2. Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:18777:182"/>
               <hi>the Lords Rest</hi> into idlenesse; as the fruitlesse spending of it both within dores, and abroad in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vaine exercises. 3. Profanely, turning it into the plaine seruice of the diuell, by Ales, gaming, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and accursed riots, in exercises heathenish and hellish. Is it a sinne to open a shop window, and none to game, swill, and sweare? Is the Sabbath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to cleanse thy soule from sinne, and darest thou most soule and moyle thy selfe that day aboue other? 4. Iangling away the day in company with idle chat: any words are ready but of God, and to God: or, if alone, holding profane and vnsauory <hi>thoughts free</hi> enough, to driue out the meditation of God, his Word, and workes. 5. Profaning it in their children or seruants, whom they suffer to bee vaine and idle, or force them not to Gods seruice, or (which is worst) force them by commandement, or example, to pollute it: for some Masters and fathers are like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who laid the heauiest taskes on the Lords Day, aboue all the weeke, and then increased the burthens, when Israel spake of going to serue the Lord.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, an euill heart can easily withdraw it selfe from the Assemblies, as seeing no beauty, no presence of God; without all reuerence of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary: whereas the Iewes might not tarry at home, from the Synagogue; nay, some Fathers say proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that Christ himselfe came still to the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, that he might obserue the Law, which hee came to fulfill. But this wilfull excommunication, (without repentance) goes before casting out of the great Congregation in heauen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:18777:182"/>Lastly, it can vpbraid others for precise, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who are strict keepers of the Sabbath, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go with their neighbours, drinking &amp; reuelling, and vsing profane pastime. It can obiect great, and learned, and rich, and noble, that like not such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisenesse in keeping the Sabbath. But we haue God going before vs in precept, and his owne example sanctifying the Sabbath. If we follow example, he is most vn-erring, and aboue them all in wisedome, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The third meanes, wherby true Religion is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, are <hi>Ministers and Pastors.</hi> In respect of whom, a good heart hath many eminent markes, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent qualities: For sundry reasons.</p>
            <p>First, it considers aright who they be. Why, who be they? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. They are <hi>spirituall fathers,</hi>

               </note> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get men to God by the preaching of the Gospell: 1. Cor. 4.15. These Fathers giue vs a being in Christ, being instruments, by whom, of children of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, we are begotten to be <hi>new-borne babes</hi> in Christ.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.2. Gal. 4 19. 1. <hi>It knowes who they be.</hi>
               </note> 2. They are <hi>spirituall mothers,</hi> that trauell in birth of vs, <hi>till Christ be formed in vs,</hi> sustaining great paines and sorrowes, to bring vs forth to Gods Kingdome; Other mothers beare children into a miserable world; these into a happy estate. 3. They are <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall nurses,</hi> to feede, preserue, and bring forward with much care and tendernesse: 1. Thes. 2.7. <hi>gentle, as a nurse cherisheth her childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Other nurses are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary: but these are nurses to their owne children, more affectionate toward them. 4.

others in the light of doctrine and good example in this life; and in the life to come shall <hi>shine as Starres in glory,</hi> Dan. 12.3. 5. They are <hi>Stewards of Gods House,</hi> Luk. 12.42. to whom are committed the <hi>keyes</hi> of the Kingdome, to open, and shut, Math. 16.19. 6. They are <hi>sauiours</hi> of men, 1. Tim. 4.16. <hi>Saue thy selfe, and others. Obiect.</hi> Christ onely saues vs. <hi>Answ.</hi> True, by merit and efficacy: but none are actually saued, to whom this merit is not communicated and applied, namely, by the Ministery.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Whence they be.</hi>
               </note>Secondly, a good heart considers whence they bee: 1. <hi>Embassadours sent from God in the stead of Christ,</hi> 2. Cor. 5.20. called hence by a speciall prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 9.6.</note> 
               <hi>Men of God,</hi> not in the old Testament onely, but in the New, 2. Pet. 1.21. 1. Tim. 6.11. 2. Tim. 3.17. 2. Bearing on them an image of Gods authority, commanding in things spirituall, binding Kings in chaines, forcing the conscience. Magistrates haue power to binde and lose mens bodies: but the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster saith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.5.</note> 
               <hi>Tradatur Satanae, Deliuer such a one to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> and hath power to binde or lose the soules of men, and what he doth in earth, is ratified <hi>in heauen,</hi> Math. 18.18. 3. Not onely from God, but in their office and Ministery are called <hi>co-workers with God,</hi> 1. Cor. 3.1. God forgiues sinne properly, and they are said to remit sinne. God properly saueth, and they are said to saue: God himselfe communicating his owne worke vnto them; and so farre honouring them, as he not onely calls the Angels their <hi>fellow-seruants,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reuel. 2.1.</note> but them by the name of <hi>Angels.</hi>

               <note place="margin">3. <hi>To what end they be.</hi>
               </note>Thirdly, a good heart considers to what they are appoynted: 1. In the stead of Christ, to seeke and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:18777:183"/>
saue what is lost: not the health lost, as Physicians, nor wealth lost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Lawyers, but the lost soule; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by applying the meanes appoynted by Christ: Iob 33.14. <hi>To deliuer the man, that he goe not into the pit:</hi> not by working the meanes, but applying them, and pronouncing him absolued.<note place="margin">2.

They are <hi>earthen vessels</hi> that carry an heauenly treasure, to dispose the secrets of God, set ouer men by the Lord, and for the Lords businesse; beseeching, exhorting, correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and instructing: by whose Ministery, as by Gods owne arme, men are drawne out of hell, sinne, the world, to turne to God, and beleeue in Iesus Christ, Esa. 53.1. Act. 26.18. and whereby, being naturally voyd of the Spirit, without faith, and destitute of grace, they attaine the Spirit, and faith, and other graces: And hence they are called <hi>Ministers, by whom we beleeue,</hi> 1. Cor. 3.1. and <hi>Ministers of the Spirit,</hi> righteousnesse, and grace, 2. Cor. 3.6, 8, 9. 3. They are faithfull shepheards ouer the flocke of Christ: to feed his sheepe in greene pastures: to call them backe from their wandring; and to refresh them with the waters of consolation, healing the brused and afflicted soule, as hauing a <hi>tongue of the learned, to speake a word in due season,</hi> Esa. 50.4. 4. They are powerfull intercessors betweene God and vs; to speake from God to men, whom wee cannot heare in his owne voyce and liue; and to speake from men to God, as Mediators rising vp in the gap, able to lay open their wants, to confesse their sins, to craue pardon for them, to giue thankes in their names of mercies, and to offer vp all their spirituall sacrifices to God for them: as <hi>Samuel</hi> professeth, 1. Sam. 12.23.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:18777:184"/>
               <hi>God forbid that I should sinne against the Lord, in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way.</hi>

               <note place="margin">4. <hi>That God will see all their word-fulfilled.</hi>
               </note>Fourthly, a good heart considers, that all their word shall be fulfilled, and God will see to that for his owne faithfulnesse sake: Esa. 44.26. <hi>He confirmeth the word of his seruant, and performes the counsell of his messengers:</hi> that their worke shall not bee in vaine, <hi>nor their word fall to the ground</hi>; as of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1.

Hence are those swarmes of haters of Gods Word, who in stead of <hi>singular loue for their worke sake,</hi> swell like Toads with poyson and wrath against their Preachers for their worke sake: as <hi>Ahab, I hate Micaiah, he neuer prophecyeth good vnto me:</hi> so when a powerfull Ministery discouers the filthinesse and hypocrisie of a wicked heart, crosses his corruptions, as a fretting corrosiue to his conscience, torments
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:18777:185"/>
him before the time, suffers him not quietly to inioy his sin, his <hi>Herodias,</hi> now saith <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemie?</hi> Now is <hi>Paul</hi> become an enemie, for telling the truth. For sinne is so incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, and become almost themselues, that a man cannot be an enemy to their sins, but (as they thinke) to themselues also. Now he pryes and watcheth him narrowly, and takes hold of his least infirmities, if so be by casting some shame on the Preacher, he can hide his owne. Now he <hi>deuiseth against this Ieremie:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 18.18.</note> he is a spy-fault, a troubler of the State, a factious Preacher, or (as <hi>Festus</hi> said of <hi>Paul,) Too much learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or singularity, makes him mad,</hi> while hee speakes <hi>words of sobriety and wisedome,</hi> Act. 26.24, 25. And this is the <hi>double honour</hi> wherewith hee loads them. Dealing most vnthankfully, as <hi>Saul,</hi> who when <hi>Dauid</hi> was playing with his Harpe, to ease his distracted minde, cast a speare at him, 1. Sam. 18.10. So while the Preacher seekes by playing on the heauenly Harpe, to solace and comfort them, and to driue euill spirits and lusts from them, they cast darts, and speares, and arrowes, of reproches and slanders against them: And now the most sauory salt, if they can doe withall, must bee cast out and trodden vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From this contempt of the Word and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters it is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>An euill hart hateth the Word first, and then the Preacher.</hi>
               </note> that many will not come to heare the Preacher; as the deafe Adder refuseth to heare the voyce of the Charmer, charme hee neuer so wisely; and so shew themselues not to be of God, 1. Ioh. 4.6. <hi>He that is not of God, heareth not vs.</hi> Some heare sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and for shame: businesse of greater inpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:18777:186"/>
stayes them: and if they chance on occasion to heare any thing that displeaseth them; Oh then, as <hi>Corah</hi> said to <hi>Moses, Ye take too much vpon you, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Aaron,</hi> Numb. 16.3. and are like them that <hi>contend with the Priest,</hi> Hos. 4.4. Wherin the Prophet expresseth the outrage of euill in the Iewes. This is their subiection, to resist the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>As for the comfort and maintenance of their Preacher, further than Law forceth, neither consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor shame, nor example, nor perswasion mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them to maintaine the worship of God. But, if they can liue of slanderous and scornfull speeches, of hatefull and iniurious actions, they will not suffer them to want maintenance. Thus did <hi>Herod</hi> returne <hi>Iohn</hi> euill for good, and <hi>Demetrius</hi> to <hi>Paul. Obiect.</hi> Though we heare not some, yet we heare some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and wise men: and therfore this is not hatred of the Word. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. A wicked heart will heare and receiue doctrines and persons, so long as hee is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: and so long the diuell himselfe is good: But let him meddle with thine eyes once, or deare sins, now there is nothing but storming and raging, as a diuell incarnate. 2. A wicked man may heare a man, because he is learned, yet learne no good from him: And it is hatred of goodnesse, that makes him refuse good Sermons, vnder pretence they bee not learned; he meanes not, indeed, that all the learning in the world should make him better.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> Oh but wee loue the Word, and if God himselfe, or Christ would teach vs, wee should say more: But what are Ministers more than other men?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:18777:186"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. He that loueth God, will not bee wiser than God, who hath described his owne meanes: but would obey them that haue the ouersight of soules. 2. It is false, that thou wouldest obey the Lords immediate voyce, who wilt not obey this voyce. Did not the Lord speak to <hi>Cain</hi> immediatly, to reclaime him from his sinne? but, did hee repent at the voyce of God himselfe? Did not Israel heare Gods owne voyce, in giuing the Law, with dread? and yet did they cease to murmure and rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him? What was <hi>Iudas</hi> and the Iewes better for Christs owne voyce? No, no, this is like the Iewes, Math. 27.42. <hi>Let him come downe from the Crosse, and we will beleeue in him.</hi> Which had he done, they would not haue beleeued: for, did hee not rise from the graue, which was more, Luk. 16.31? <hi>If they will not beleeue Moses and the Prophets, neither would they beleeue, though one should rise from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore we conclude against all pretences, that an euill heart hates the Word first and principally, and then the Preacher of it.</p>

               </note>The fourth renewed affection, is <hi>zeale, &amp; feruency:</hi> Before, it was most zealous against zeale, now it is truly zealous, 1. In earnest and affectionate desires after Gods glory, his House, his worship: the zeale of Gods House <hi>consumed Dauid,</hi> Psalm. 119.139. 2. In thorow-hatred of the corruptions of his owne heart, against which hee wrestles and cries out, as <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.24. Vehement fire soone ouermasters drosse and stubble. 3. In contending and warring against the profanenesse and wickednesse of the world and corrupt times: <hi>Paul</hi> earnestly grieued to see men fall from God, Rom. 9.2. and <hi>Lots</hi> righteous soule was vexed daily with the vncleane conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sodomites: and Christ mourned for rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Ierusalem, Luk. 19.41. Which is alwaies ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with an endeuour by all possible meanes to <hi>bring them backe againe,</hi> as <hi>Elijah</hi> prayed for Israel, 1. King. 18.37. Matth. 18.12. 4. In an ardent loue and defence of such as feare God, delighting in things and persons that are sincere, and most affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the most grace: Matth. 12.48. Psalm. 16.3.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I giuen a taste of the <hi>newnesse</hi> of a good heart: which is his first property.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Softnesse, in</hi> 3. <hi>things.</hi>
               </note>The second is <hi>softnesse:</hi> a good heart is soft and sensible. The best heart indeed hath some hardnesse, but it is sensible of it: for 1. It sees still a burden of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sinne, and an heauy load of corruption within left:
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:18777:188"/>
nay it sees more euill in it selfe, then in all other. Grace within, as a straite line, is the measure of it selfe and that which is crooked. 2. It sees to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the hardnesse and distemper of it selfe, with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> much bitternesse, and sorrow, and many complaints: Esa. 63.17. <hi>O Lord, why hast thou hardned our hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thy feare? Ah miserable man that I am, who shall deliuer me from this body of death?</hi> These are the common complaints of the godly, how they are toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with their <hi>slownesse</hi> of heart to beleeue, with <hi>earthlinesse</hi> of heart, finding themselues chayned to the loue of earth, with <hi>frowardnesse</hi> of heart, when they cannot <hi>heare, or beare reproofes,</hi> Prou. 17.20. And in all these, they are more seuere, because they are more sensible of their owne lusts, than any other. 3. It still striueth against this hardnesse, and prayes for a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> soft heart: Esa. 63.17. <hi>Why hast thou hardened our hearts? Oh return, &amp;c.</hi> And the poore man in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <hi>I beleeue, Lord, helpe my vnbeliefe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 9 24</note>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas an euill heart goeth on, neither seeing, nor suspecting, nor willing to see the euill of it, till it be growne to the hardnesse of a stone, to which it is compared, Ezek. 11.19. because there is no life, no humour, no aptnesse to softnesse, more than in a stone: And so going on in hardnesse, comes to bee <hi>Adamantine,</hi> which is the hardest and inuincible stone, Zech. 7.12.</p>
            <p>The third property of a good heart is <hi>cleannesse:</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Cleannes, in</hi> 2. <hi>things.</hi>
               </note> euery good heart is a pure and cleane heart: Psalm. 51.10. <hi>Create in me a cleane heart, O God.</hi> Math. 5.8. <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart. Obiect.</hi> Can any man say his heart is cleane, seeing in many things we sin all,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:18777:189"/>
and if we say we haue no sin or foulenes, we lie, and our owne clothes will defile vs? <hi>Answ.</hi> The best heart hath much foulenesse and frailty: (What a heape of sins of vnsuspected filthines lyes within, see Mark. 7.21, 22.) But first, this is a <hi>beleeuing heart,</hi> and so comes to be cleane; both by <hi>imputation</hi> of Christs purity, apprehended by faith, and by <hi>incoation</hi> of actuall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in part. The former is by the Lauer of Christs blood; the latter by the waters of the Spirit of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification: The former clenseth the guilt of sinne; the latter, the filth and corruption of it: Both wayes, faith is said to <hi>purifie the heart,</hi> Act. 15.9. Secondly, this heart, when it doth foule it selfe by sinne, 1. pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth and resolueth not to defile it selfe, but sinnes against his purpose: 2. lyeth not moyling it selfe still, but is troubled and strucke, as <hi>Dauid</hi> for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the people, and <hi>Peter</hi> for denying his Master: 3. hath speedy recourse to the Lauer of Christs blood, renewing his faith, and to the tear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of godly sorrow, renewing his repentance; and so returnes to his cleannesse.</p>
            <p>But an euill heart is an vncleane heart, because <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing, departing from the liuing God,</hi> Heb. 3.12. It can desire, yea purpose sinne, as <hi>Absalom:</hi> Can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it habitually, hungrily, greedily: Can reioyce in sinne and foulenesse, and sometimes glory in it: And so is held vnder, &amp; neuer riseth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder vncleannes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. <hi>Single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in</hi> 5. <hi>things.</hi> 1. <hi>Jt is plaine.</hi>
               </note>The fourth property of a good heart, is <hi>singlenesse,</hi> or <hi>sincerity:</hi> which is knowne thus. 1. It is plaine, simple, open, not crafty to contriue or conceale sin, not cunning in the methods of sinne, but <hi>simple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning euill,</hi> Rom. 16.19. It is good, seeing we must
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:18777:189"/>
sinne, yet to bungle in sinne, not as traded and expert in it. Of all vertues, Satan would <hi>beguile vs of this simplicity in Christ,</hi> 2. Cor. 11.3. The world also scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it as sillinesse, and sheepishnesse, to be so simple as to sticke onely to the reuealed will of God.</p>
            <p>A wicked heart can be witty to plot and deuise, to excuse and defend his sinne. The hasty furious man, told of his cursing, swearing, blaspheming, will tell you it is his nature, he is of a cholerike constitution, euery man hath his fault, I cannot mend it. Heere he hath deuised a strong argument to strengthen his grossest corruption. But beate him out of his plea, tell him hee must resist corrupt nature; and, where grace is, there would be no such outragious behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; Oh then he tells you, hee was prouoked and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or, it would haue angred a Saint, or made an Angell sweare, to be so prouoked; or else, we cannot be Saints, or so strict, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Tell a drunkard of his swinish sinne, how disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and scornfull hee made himselfe to very boyes; Oh it is his infirmity too, his braine is weake, or hee was in company, and vrged by company, or custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers whom he must respect, he cannot doe withall: and presse him hard by Gods Word, his last answere will bee with the Vine in <hi>Iothams</hi> parable, I cannot leaue my wine, nor my good liquor: leaue my drink, leaue to liue.</p>

               <hi>Loue the Lord with all thy heart:</hi> not double, not diuided: the Lord abides not an heart, and an heart, but reiects <hi>double-minded men,</hi> Iam. 4.8. A manifest note hereof is, to frame it selfe to the whole Word of God, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:18777:190"/>
not onely that God is a Soueraigne Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as well in one thing as another, but that there is no part of his Word, which is not worthy both to be knowne, and brought into vse: all the <hi>Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> for direction of the whole man; all the <hi>threats,</hi> for humiliation: all the precious <hi>promises,</hi> for incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and consolation; all <hi>examples</hi> of vertue, for imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; of vices, for caution and preuention; of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, for terrour.

Cor. 3.20. their speeches vnsauory, as out of a sinke within, vniust, vnfaithfull; golden promises, leaden performances: their actions and fruits like the trees, most wicked, at the best, vaine or worldly: Truly said <hi>Salomon,</hi> Pro. 10.20. <hi>The heart of the wicked is little worth</hi>; and as worthlesse are his speeches and actions; the most of them wicked, the best, vaine and friuolous.</p>
            <p>Labour therefore for such an heart as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the seed-time and season, and in this season is

diligent in sowing and dispersing: seeing the surest way to keep seed, is to sowe it, not to saue it at home: and such as is fruitfull in euery season, as ground re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing blessing of the Lord.</p>

            <p n="2">2. It watcheth against sinne, both before, and in, and afterward.</p>

How carefull are they that haue Gun-powder in their houses, that no fire or candle come neere it? yet our nature is as Gun-powder to the sparke of tentation. 2. It will preserue his watch in occasions of sinning: Gen. 39.6. <hi>Ioseph</hi> was faithfull,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:18777:192"/>
when no account was taken. No difficulty for him to be true, that was neuer trusted: to be sober, where is no drinke: or for a woman to bee chaste, whom none lookes after. But, to withstand euill, when it is offered, vrged, forced vpon him, this is strength, this is Religion. If any sinne assault the good heart more strongly, he flies to the Antidote, as we for our heart against poyson, because the life is shut vp in it. 3. It will watch against sinne, though good men doe it: will not be drawne to sinne for any mans pleasure, but <hi>reproue them rather,</hi> Ephes. 5.10. as <hi>Paul</hi> reproued <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe for the dissimulation, Gal. 2.14. 4.

               <hi>After sinne,</hi> it watcheth both to rise by repentance, as <hi>Dauids</hi> heart smote him for numbring the people; and to auoyd the like snares for time to come, lest it become a slaue againe.</p>

               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:18777:193"/>
to be <hi>filled with the fruits of righteousnesse,</hi> Phil. 1.11. Thirdly, that it becomes the Gospell, and adornes it, to <hi>shine as lights in the midst of a crooked generation,</hi> Phil. 2.15.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he will not doe them without light and direction, knowing the light necessary, as for naturall and ciuill actions, so for diuine also: The Word is the light and lanthorne, and all actions of Christian obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is but the <hi>holding forth of the Word:</hi> without which, he shall heare that expostulation,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.16.</note>

It cannot content it selfe in doing a good worke, out of this good manner of doing: first, because it knowes, the beginning of acceptable obedience must be the heart, which must quicken all our duties, or else they are dead: secondly, if seruants must doe to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters <hi>euery thing heartily,</hi>

               </note>VII. Markes of a good heart in respect of sinne.</p>
            <p>It knoweth, first, that nothing is properly hated of God, but sinne, as being directly against his Law, and his Image, who is a God hating iniquity; and as God himselfe is the chiefe and absolute Good; so
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:18777:196"/>
onely sinne is the chiefe and absolute euill. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the proper effect of hatred being reuenge, he is not more sure to sinne, than God to reuenge, one way or other; yea, <hi>vnto the third and fourth genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them that hate him.</hi> Thirdly, that all and euery sinne is vpon record: there is an hand-writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst euery sinner, and an obligation in euery sinne binding the sinner, who hath not one farthing to pay for an infinite debt, or infinite forfeit, Col. 2.14. Fourthly, that all and euery sinne lies in the way, betweene God and vs, and <hi>separates</hi> from him,<note place="margin">Esa. 59.2. Ier. 5.25.</note> and <hi>holds good things</hi> from vs; shuts heauen, curseth the earth, and burthens all the creatures. Fifthly, that it exposeth to all misery within vs, without vs, both here and hereafter. <hi>Within vs,</hi> the destruction of all Gods Image, the corruption and guilt of the whole nature; all euill inclinations against God, and our neighbour; especially an euill conscience, where sinne lyes at the doore, either vexing and galling it, or dogging and watching it; which is a very hell before hell. <hi>Without</hi> a man, all the calamities of this life, sicknesse, pouerty, madnesse, shame, death and corruption; all the proper effects of sinne: Gen. 2.17. <hi>In the day thou sinnest, thou shalt dye the death.</hi> And <hi>hereafter,</hi> the extreme misery of sinne in all not deliuered by Christ, is that eternall death which is <hi>the wages</hi> of it: the vnsupportable curse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced on <hi>all that continue not in all things,</hi>

In which repentance is, first, <hi>confession against it selfe,</hi> Psal. 32.5. It will not flatter it selfe, but cast the first stone against it selfe, and will say more against it selfe, then all men can: as <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing numbred the people, before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Gad</hi> came, cast the stone against himselfe, saying, <hi>I haue exceedingly sinned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Of all sins knowne.</hi>
               </note> 2. Sam. 24.10. Secondly, confession of <hi>all</hi> the sinnes it knowes: as 1. secret and hid corruptions: for the good heart knoweth, that <hi>God loueth truth in the inner parts</hi>; which made <hi>Dauid</hi> complaine of his originall corruption,<note place="margin">Psal. 51.6.</note> and brooding sinne, which none tooke notice of but himselfe; and the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> of the law of euill rebelling against the law of his minde: 2. Small and lesser euils; it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuates no sinne as little, esteemes none as Gnats, Moats or Mites, which Gods Law takes order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst: It lookes not so much on the matter, as on the forme: It is burdened, and takes notice of the least sinnes, omissions, failing in good things, falling from the first loue, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in repentance there is <hi>remorse,</hi> or biting: A good heart cannot commit sin without remorse;<note place="margin">3. <hi>Remorse.</hi>
               </note> not secret sinnes, because it knowes, nothing is secret
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:18777:197"/>
in respect of God, with whom it hath to deale; not most naturall and inbred sinnes, to which it selfe is most inclineable, because it knowes, the more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar the sinne, the more dangerous; not small sinnes: <hi>Dauids</hi> heart smote him for <hi>Sauls</hi> lap, as for his head; the eye feeleth the least moat. And this by small meanes: as soft wax is soone impressed, so is a good heart because of his softnesse. It will melt and resolue more at the very hearing of Gods Iudgements de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against others (as <hi>Iosiah,</hi> 2. Chron. 34.27.) than an euill heart at the feeling of Gods most dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Iudgements, as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 7.23. <hi>Peter,</hi> when Christ onely lookes backe vpon him, gets out and weepes bitterly. It is true, that a good man may lye a while without sound remorse, as <hi>Dauid</hi> nine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths after his adultery; though not that time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grudgings: but that time the euill and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it preuailes, and the Spirit will not suffer it to lye still, but awake it must, and no sooner wakened then humbled.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in repentance there is <hi>reuenge</hi> on it selfe,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Reuenge.</hi>
               </note> with holy <hi>indignation,</hi> for playing the beast before God, 2. Cor. 7.11. Thus the Publican <hi>knocked his brest:</hi> and <hi>Iob abhorred himselfe in dust and ashes,</hi> Chap. 42.6.</p>
            <p>And all this a good heart will doe, both secretly, and constantly. <hi>Secretly,</hi> because hee is a Iew who is one within, and hee is praised whom God praiseth: And it knowes, that euery sound action of grace, as mortification, repentance, humiliation, must begin within, and flow from thence;<note place="margin">

knowes all are hatefull to God, all preiudiciall to the soule, as one hole in a ship, or one Swine in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or one Fly in the Apothecaries box, is enough to spoile all; therefore it watcheth all. Secondly, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing small sinnes are commonly Harbingers to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it dares not venture on the smallest. Thirdly, it knowes that the way to auoyd finall defection, or back-sliding, is, to feare staying a little. Fourthly, it feares the shew, the taste, the occasions, the first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of sinne, lest from the broth, it easily fall to the flesh. Fifthly, it feares and hates his owne sins, more than all other mens: and not as it is said of <hi>Anthony, He hated the Tyrant, not tyrannie.</hi>

Seuenthly, it hates and feares the <hi>repetition</hi> of sinne, and much more shakes off the habite of it, lest hee should suddenly grow to expertnesse in the trade. Lastly, it hates and mournes for other mens sinnes, and stops them when he can: Psal. 119.136. Phil. 3.18.—<hi>and now tell you weeping.</hi> Yea, the sinnes of others against God, more smite a good heart with sorrow, than their owne sinnes can an euill.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It retaines and still renewes a full purpose of not sinning, so as though it sinne,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of not sinning.</hi>
               </note> the conscience can testifie that it is carried against the setled purpose of it. <hi>Dauid</hi> sweares and vowes he will keepe the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous iudgements of God: and, Away from mee ye wicked, for I will keepe the Commandements: Act. 11.23. <hi>with full purpose of heart cleaue to the Lord.</hi> Psal. 119.2. <hi>Surely they worke no iniquity:</hi> they doe sinne,

but not as workemen, they cannot plot it, but are <hi>simple to doe euill,</hi> Rom. 16.19.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deceit of an euill heart in the businesse of repentance.</hi>
               </note>Now an euill heart may be humbled and grieued for some sinne, but rather for some actuall sinne past, than the sinne of nature, and that not as sinne, or an offence of God, but either for some iudgement fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: so <hi>Ahab</hi> put on sack-cloth, 1. King. 21.27. or some already executed, Exod. 9.27, 28. Or, if there be any release, and the iudgement be a little ouer, it returnes afresh to the old course, <hi>as a dog to the vomit,</hi> 2. Pet. 2.21.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It can make shew of repentance, yet is but as a cloud without raine, his teares are soone dryed vp, he goes away, and forgets he was washed; he can be bold enough to sinne, and is onely ashamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse his sin; or if he doe, it is in grosse, in the lumpe, with excuses and extenuations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will be at little or no paines for the pardon of sinne: the assurance of it, it thinkes either impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, or vnnecessary. It cannot throughly resolue to leaue sinne, and therefore cannot bee so earnest for forgiuenesse.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

This plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and contriuing of sinne is a sure signe of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked heart.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It can repeate sin remorslesly, till it can trade, and come to bee expert by often committing ouer the same sins, and let them grow to customes, habits,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:18777:199"/>
natures. 6. It can defend and pleade for sinne, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king bad actions, with good pretences, or good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. <hi>Saul</hi> saues the fat for sacrifice. <hi>Absalom</hi> will be King, to doe iustice; and he will begin to execute iustice with rebellion and treason, against his owne indulgent father. 7. It can glory in sin: Phil. 3.19.— <hi>whose glory is their shame</hi>; which is true of drunkards, swearers, proud persons, &amp;c. all of them farre from grace, farthest from a good heart.</p>
            <p>These are the Notes of a good &amp; an honest hart: of which I will say to you, as the Lord himselfe sometime said of the Israelites, Deut. chap. 5. vers. 29. <hi>Oh that there were such an heart in you, to feare your God, and keepe his Commandements alwayes, that it might bee well with you, and with your children for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now hauing spoken, 1. of the <hi>Meanes</hi> whereby the heart becomes good, 2. of the <hi>Marks</hi> whereby it is knowne so to be; we come in the third place to the <hi>Motiues,</hi> which is the last thing in the descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this last soyle.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Onely such an heart keepes the Word to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Motiues to get this goodnesse of heart.</hi>
               </note> Fusty vessels are not fit for the precious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of sound and sauing knowledge, and the graces of the Spirit. The Law is spirituall, and the place where the Lord layes it, is in the spirit, and heart of his Elect, in whom onely he hath wrought a care to keepe it: Psal. 119.11. <hi>I haue hid thy Word in my heart, that I might not sin against thee.</hi> The Lord hauing writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his Law in Tables, made choyce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Arke, to lay vp the same safe, Exo. 25.16. <hi>Thou shalt lay in the Arke the Testimony, that I shal giue thee.</hi> Now this Arke must
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:18777:200"/>
be ouerlaid with pure gold, both within, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: signifying, that the godly heart, which must keepe the Word, must be sincere within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: and euery other heart but the good and honest, will shake the Word out, one time or other: hence <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth, Psal. 119.80. <hi>Let my heart bee vpright in thy statutes, that I be not ashamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. God esteemeth the goodnesse of our works, by the goodnesse of the heart: Ier. 17.11. <hi>I the Lord try the hearts, to giue to euery man according to his work.</hi> Hence many workes of ciuill men, glorious and beautifull to the eyes of men, are hatefull to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they flow from the filthy puddle of a corrupt heart. For as an euill action for matter can neuer bee made good by a good intention of the heart; so a good action for matter can neuer be good in accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, from an euill and deceitfull heart. If the spring be corrupt, so are all the streames.</p>
            <p>Hence also God esteemeth good duties perfect, when the heart is sincere: because, what is wanting in the manner and measure of obedience, is supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by soundnesse, and made vp by the goodnesse of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>art: and therefore in Scripture, vprightnesse and perfection are put one for another. The wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes mite was in it selfe very light, but putting her heart to it, made it ponderous: Adde thy heart to thy mite, and it shall be accepted as a Talent.</p>
            <p>Hence the Scripture saith, <hi>God iudgeth not as man:</hi> we iudge from without, God from within: we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the effect to the cause; hee, from the cause to the effect: wee iudge the heart by the worke; hee the worke by the heart: we looke first to the sacrifice,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:18777:200"/>
and then to <hi>Abel</hi>; hee first hath respect to <hi>Abel,</hi> and then to his sacrifice. Hence we see a mite in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity accepted, and a Talent from hypocrisie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Without this good and honest heart thou losest all thy labour, all thy graces, all thy hopes, all thy expectation. If they come not from a pure heart, he that is pure, &amp; looks with pure eyes, reiects them all. If thou <hi>beleeue not from the heart,</hi> Rom. 10.10. it is vanishing and temporary. If thou liftest not vp <hi>pure hands</hi> in prayer; that is, the prayer of a pure heart,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.8</note> suppose thou diddest weare thy tongue to the stumps, and thy knees horne-hard, thou losest all thy labour: therefore <hi>Paul</hi> describeth true worshippers, 2. Tim. 2.22. to be <hi>such as call on the Lord with a pure heart.</hi> If thy loue be in word, and tongue, and not <hi>in truth,</hi> thy heart cannot assure thee that thou art <hi>of the truth,</hi> 1. Ioh. 3.18, 19. If thou doest not <hi>from the heart obey</hi> the forme of doctrine deliuered, Rom. 6.17. all thy obedience is lost, without recompence, without acceptation, yea abominable. Finally, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer we doe, doe it <hi>heartily</hi> vnto the Lord, and not vnto men, Col. 3.23. The kernell of all duties lyeth within, in the true disposition of the heart: without which, all is as an empty shell, which when it comes to cracking and opening, the hypocrites hope fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. See we not in the Day of Iudgement many shall pretend great matters done in preaching, or prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying in the Name of Christ, and casting out diuels in the same, frequenting Christs presence, <hi>Wee saw and heard thee in our str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ets,</hi> and so expecting some great reward, for so great and glorious workes? But,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:18777:201"/>
not being sound at heart, all these things are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter esteemed then working of iniquity, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced as hatefull sinnes; <hi>Depart from mee, ye workers of iniquity:</hi> for all the sacrifices of an hypocrite are abominable, his very prayers abominable, Esa. 1. <hi>Bring no more sacrifices, but wash you, clense you, and then come, let vs reason together.</hi> Esa. 58.3. The Iewes vrge God with their fasting, and yet are sent away empty.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. A good heart is the essentiall difference or distinction betweene a godly man and an hypocrite: whosoeuer wants it,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.51</note> shall receiue his <hi>portion with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</hi> The Pharises make cleane the out-side: A good Christian heares his Master say,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.26</note> 
               <hi>Thou hypocrite, first make the in-side cleane.</hi> As the hypocrites religion is made but a couer or cloke, so he vseth it as a cloke to cast on and off as hee list: And as men make their clothes, so doth hee his religion; so it be some fine stuffe without, they care not what base lining they put in: But the sound Christian is as the Kings daughter, Psal. 45.13. <hi>all glorious within,</hi> like a late fashion of great men, lining russet or base Clokes with Taffatie or Veluet cleane thorow; or like the hangings of the Sanctuary, without, course Badgers skinnes, within, fine linnen embroydered, Exod. 26.1, 14.</p>
            <p>The hypocrite desires to seeme, either onely or principally: the sound Christian <hi>desires to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5 9.</note> 
               <hi>Saul,</hi> when hee knew Gods minde in reiecting him, yet <hi>honour me</hi> (saith he) <hi>before the people,</hi> 1. Sam. 15.30. the sound Christian, knowing the minde of God in electing, iustifying, and sanctifying him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:18777:201"/>
both liuing and dying to be indeed accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto him. An vnfaithfull and euill heart, that departs from God, hath faire showes, goodly greene leaues, a kinde of faith, ioy, profession, and will giue God euery thing but a good heart, which gift he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls for: which because hee with-holds, hee shall neuer speed so well as a sound Christian, who can giue nothing but true desires of a changed and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere heart.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The whole comfort of a Christian vnder God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Goodnesse of heart a full sea of comfort.</hi> 1. <hi>Inward.</hi>
               </note> is in a sound, honest, and good heart. As first, all inward comfort, 2. Cor. 1.12. <hi>This is our reioycing, euen the testimonie of a good conscience, that in all simplicity and godly purenesse we haue had our conuersation.</hi> This ioy is the ioy of Gods people, which the stranger en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not into: and of it our Sauiour saith, <hi>None shall take it from you:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh 16.22.</note> It is like a little veine or spring which euer runneth: whereas the ioy of an hypocrite, which makes a greater show and noise then the other, is like a great pond, cleare at top, muddy at bottome, dried vp in Summer when is most need of the waters of comfort.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in outward opposition, when men who cannot abide sincerity,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Outward opposition.</hi>
               </note> obiect to vs that all is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, and scorne vs for the things we doe, when <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maels</hi> scoffe vs for the blessings sake; that from the world we haue small comfort and encouragement in our godly way; now wee may finde comfort and peace in the sound constitution of our hearts: 2. Sam. 6.21. <hi>Dauid</hi> being scorned by <hi>Michol</hi> for dancing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arke, and called foole for his paines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned that contempt: for <hi>he did it in the vprightnes
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:18777:202"/>
of his heart, and would be yet more vile. Paul</hi> teaching the strictnesse of Christian Religion, to bring Christ into the hearts and liues of men, was counted an <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 14 14.</note> but professed, <hi>After the way which ye call heresie, doe I worship the God of my fathers.</hi> Apply wee this to our selues. A good conscience as a brazen wall, feares not the arrowes of scorners and aduersaries. <hi>Iobs</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie will beare his aduersaries booke of accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Iob 31.36.</note> on his shoulder.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Personall affliction.</hi>
               </note>Thirdly, in personall affliction, this good heart ministreth great comfort:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In inward temptation,</hi> when Satan shall obiect, as against <hi>Iob,</hi> that thou art an hypocrite (then which, no temptation more assaulteth or infesteth the poore Christian:) looke what way thou canst, not hearing, not praying, not fasting, reading or almes can answere it, but onely the sincere and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward disposition of an honest heart in all these; He is molested with hypocrisie, but not subdued by it. So when Satan shall obiect the weaknesse of thy faith, or the defects of thy obedience, and that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accept so broken and sinfull performances; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can answere this dart, but sincerity of heart, manifest in true desires and endeuours, which God accepteth, beholding mercifully <hi>what a man hath, not what he hath not.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.12</note> Sincerity makes light things massie and ponderous, where hypocrisie makes talents lighter then feathers. So if he obiect thy heauinesse and vntowardnesse in prayer, that thou prayest cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and distractedly, the only answere is, God regards not the tune of the voyce, the phrase of speach, the sound of words, or eloquence of tongue, but the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:18777:202"/>
affection of the heart, as in <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 14.15. and <hi>Hanna,</hi> 1. Sam. 1.17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In outward affliction,</hi> onely a good and honest heart beares a man vp. <hi>Iob</hi> in all his troubles had no other comfort, Chap. 27.5. <hi>Vntill I dye I will neuer take away mine innocencie from my selfe.</hi> When <hi>Abimelech</hi> was threatned for taking <hi>Sarah,</hi> it was happy and comfortable to him that hee could say, <hi>With a good and an vpright heart I did this,</hi> Gen. 20.5. What a strength is it, when afflictions take a man in his way, and while with a good heart he goes about his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? But if crosses come, while a man is wandring, or his heart rouing after vanity, this disposition adds a sting to the affliction, when the heart shall smite it selfe, that it suffers as an euill doer.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in respect of perseuerance in good, a good heart onely ministreth comfort.<note place="margin">4. <hi>For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance in good.</hi>
               </note> For as an Apple rotten at core must faile and perish, seeme it neuer so beautifull: so all graces shall wither, that are not soundly fixed in a good and honest heart. It is not leaues and showes without, but soundnesse of sap and iuice within, that makes the tree continue in fruitfulnesse. One time or other the Word of God blasts the hypocrite, as the fruitlesse Figge-tree, and then <hi>how soone is it withered?</hi> Inquire after his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, his zeale, forwardnesse, diligence, ioy, faith, loue; his place cannot be found, his place in the profession shall be as empty as <hi>Dauids</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> asked after him. He that builds on the sand, and in soundnesse of heart settles not himselfe on Christ the corner stone, as our Sauiour said of the stately buildings of the Temple, so may wee say of this man who held a
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:18777:203"/>
beautifull place in the Church, and shined in many graces, <hi>See you all these things? the time comes, when a stone shall not be left on a stone: the fall of his house shall be great:</hi> and of the ruines of his graces wee may say as the Merchants of the riches of Rome, Reuel. 18.17. <hi>In one houre shall so great riches come to desolation.</hi> But the vpright of heart shall neuer be ashamed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. <hi>In the life.</hi>
               </note>Fiftly, in the life time, <hi>the Lord will doe them good that are true of heart,</hi> Psal. 125.4. Hee will be <hi>mercifull to his defects, that prepares his heart</hi> to seeke him, though hee be not clensed according to the purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sanctuary, 2. Chron. 30.19. Hee will <hi>shew himselfe strong with the vpright heart,</hi> chap. 16.9. Let them be neuer so weake in themselues, Gods strength shall perfect all their weaknesses. Let all the world condemne them, yet he will iustifie them as true <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniels,</hi> in whom is no guile. In a word, prosperity is their portion in this life, 2. Chron. 31.21. <hi>Hezekiah in his workes sought the Lord, and prospered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">6. <hi>In death.</hi>
               </note>Sixtly, in his death, this comfort shall neuer be shaken out of his heart: when death shall sunder his soule and body, it shal neuer seuer his heart from the soundnesse of it; <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when sentence of death was passed against him, the conscience of his honest and sincere heart comforted him, Esa. 38.3. <hi>O Lord, thou knowest, I haue walked with an vpright heart, &amp;c.</hi> At this time it will not comfort a man, to haue done neuer so excellent workes, but the manner of doing, and his true endeuour shall comfort him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">7. <hi>In the Day of Iudgement.</hi>
               </note>Lastly, in the day of Iudgement, onely the good and honest heart shall lift vp the head before the Iudge of the world. As a faithfull companion, it will
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:18777:203"/>
goe with vs before the Iudge, and plead, where no other Proctor can be admitted, no other friend can appeare for vs. But how dare an hypocrite, who hath nothing but chaffe, and straw, and stubble, stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fire of that great Day, which nothing but golden soundnesse and sincerity can abide? No matter how thou canst gild thy selfe; if thou beest not golden, the fire shall consume thee. But be thou the meanest creature, that the whole earth can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent before the Iudge, with an honest heart, that hast been faithfull and sincere in a little, in the basest cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and estate that euer was any; that Day shall preferre thee aboue hollow-hearted professours, Preachers, yea Princes. For then it shall be better (to vse <hi>Augustines</hi> comparison) to be a little small fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that can doe no such seruice in the body,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Better a sound fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than a dimme eye.</hi>
               </note> if sound, than to bee an eye of admirable quicknesse, and vse, for the guiding of the body, if vnsound, darke, or ready to fall out of the head.</p>
            <p>HAuing thus largely shewed the nature of this soyle of good ground, and therein both how it comes to be good ground, and how it may be so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, with <hi>Motiues</hi> thereunto; we proceed now to the successe of the seed in it, which is said first to <hi>bring forth fruits,</hi> which fruits are in the second place described, 1. by the plenty, <hi>an hundreth fold:</hi> 2. by the continuance, <hi>with patience.</hi>

                  </list>
               </note>Here, for the explaining of the Doctrine, consider three conditions of these fruits: 1. for the <hi>kinde:</hi> 2. the <hi>season:</hi> 3. the <hi>meanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>kinde:</hi> in generall, they are the power of the Gospell in the whole man, Phil. 1.27. and, as all fruits comming of seede, are of the same kinde and nature with the seed. Not fruits of the flesh, which are so ripe and rise euery where: Nor fruits of ciuill righteousnes, in dealing with men, from which many conclude themselues good ground, being voyd of piety, knowledge, and the feare of God: Nor fruits of illumination, by which men are able to vnderstand and speake sensibly of matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but care not how little they practise: Nor fruits of the externall profession of Religion, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall reformation, which are as faire leaues, and greene blades, that shall wither and faile. For all these fruits wee haue found on the former bad grounds. But these fruits are <hi>fruits of grace,</hi> resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Author, the Spirit of grace; and thence called <hi>fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.22. and the seed, the <hi>Word of grace,</hi> Act. 20.32. and <hi>fruits of righteousnesse</hi> to the praise of God, Phil. 1.11. and <hi>fruits in holinesse,</hi> Rom. 6.22.</p>
            <p>In speciall: these fruits are either inward, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: for a good man is first fruitfull within, and as all other fruits, so these come from a root within.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inward fruits</hi> are, 1. righteousnesse of nature, by sanctification of the spirit, soule, and body: 2. good thoughts, and motions, and purposes of heart:
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:18777:204"/>
these counsels of heart make a man <hi>praised of God,</hi> 1. Cor. 4.5. 3. Good desires, longings and faintings after God and his graces, Prou. 11.23. <hi>The desire of the righteous is onely good:</hi> 4. Good affections; as sorrow for sinne, loue, feare, zeale, patience, compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and tender-heartednesse, and many such like, in Gal. 5.22, 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Outward fruits</hi> are, 1. good words, sauory, edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pure and wholesome: therefore in Prou. 10.31. the mouth of the iust is said to be <hi>fruitfull in wisdome,</hi> and his <hi>lips to feed many,</hi> as fruits do: 2. good works are good fruits; because they issue from the root of faith and charity; because they please God, as fruits the palate; because they witnesse the life of faith, as fruits the life of a tree; and lastly, because they profit others, who are relieued and comforted, as with most pleasant fruits.</p>
            <p>Now wee may not thinke, that onely building of Colledges, Churches, Hospitals, &amp; great and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Almes, which a few can performe, are good workes, as is defined by the Church of Rome: But those are good workes, which euery Beleeuer can and doth performe within the compasse of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, both generall and speciall; such as mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sinne, faithfulnesse, diligence in the duties of Christianity, and of the speciall callings, merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the poore Saints, or whatsoeuer else is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Word, or approued of God as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable fruits, yea and rewarded, be they neuer so meane and base in the eyes of men: A cup of cold water shall not lose his reward.</p>
            <p>For the season: these fruits are ripe and timely,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:18777:205"/>
differing from the blasted and withered fruits of the former grounds. Wee haue seene sudden fruits as sudden flashes, in the three former grounds, and great Professors like <hi>Ephraim,</hi> whose <hi>goodnesse was as the morning dew,</hi> Hos. 6.4. We haue heard of them, not whose leafe onely hath failed, but the stalke, and blade, and all that made shew aboue ground, or fed it within. But this fruit giues not ouer till ripenesse, and the soundnesse of it is discerned by the constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and maturity.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For the meanes: these fruits are produced to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by keeping the Word; so the Text saith, <hi>They keepe the Word, and bring forth fruits.</hi> Lose the Word, and lose all fruits. The former grounds kept the Word, but not long enough: they admitted it to lodge as a ghest for a night, but not to dwel in them. But <hi>Dauid</hi> voweth to <hi>keepe the Word euen to the end,</hi> Psal. 119.33. and he would not keepe his life, but to keepe the Word, vers. 17. This ground keepes the Word, in the eare, by hearing it, in the memory, in the heart, Prou. 6.20. <hi>Binde it on thy heart:</hi> in the hand &amp; practice, in meditating and thinking on it, in praying for blessing, that it may bee a fruitfull Word, and in constant striuing in new obedience. And by these meanes it holds out, and brings fruits to perfection.</p>
            <p>Now euery good heart is thus fruitfull, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing fruits answerable to the Gospell, in due season, vnto ripenesse, by meanes of keeping the Word, Act. 16.30. The Iaylor, assoone as euer hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, what a number of good fruits produced he? Now hee cries out of himselfe, would faine know
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:18777:205"/>
what he might doe to be saued: Now he brings the Apostles forth of prison, who had laid them in: He washed the stripes that he had inflicted: he set meat afore them, brought them into his house, heard the Word, was baptized, and reioyced that he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and went to the Gouernours, and got them quite released. The like of <hi>Lydia,</hi> vers. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>Nay, a good heart, let it haue neuer so small meanes, or opportunity, it will shew fruits. The theefe conuerted, of a barren malefactor, is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a fruitfull Professor. The ground euen now ouergrowne with cursed weeds and brambles, of hainous sinnes, is now in an instant, and almost for an instant fruitfull, in confession of his sinnes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking the sinnes of his fellow, in giuing a sound te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to Christ, aboue all the Scribes and Iewes, yea, when his Disciples durst not, and in earnest prayer to Christ for a little remembrance of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. Because the person is set into so liuely a stocke,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4.</note> that he must needs bee incontinently fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Whosoeuer is set into Christ, were hee as dry as <hi>Aarons</hi> withered rod, he shall presently bee changed into a flourishing and fruitfull tree. Rom. 7.4. <hi>So yee brethren are ioyned vnto him that is raised from the dead, that ye should bring forth fruit vnto God.</hi> And because the Beleeuer is not onely set into Christ, but abideth in him; therfore he continueth <hi>fruitfull to the end,</hi> Ioh. 15.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because the Beleeuer is now become Gods worke-manship, in Christ Iesus created to good workes, which God hath ordained for him to walke in, Ephes. 2.10. And the Lord cannot faile of his end
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:18777:206"/>
in his actions. But, as he commanded man created at first, <hi>Bring forth fruit and multiply,</hi> so now creating him againe in Iesus Christ, he begets them, that they may goe forth, and bring fruit, and glorifie him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because the Beleeuer is now <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> who is not barren or idle in him,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.14</note> but fruitfull in all variety of fruits of grace, as they are described, Gal. 5.22, 23. A tree must liue before it beare fruit: Now we are quickned by the Spirit. The same spirit plants vs in Gods House, and adds his blessing to that plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Psal. 92.14. The same Spirit waters vs with the waters from vnder the Sanctuarie, Ezek. 47.12. and so makes vs fruitfull by a spring of liuing waters. The same Spirit purgeth vs to be a peculiar people, <hi>zealous of good workes,</hi> Tit. 2.14.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is the same reason of the parts, and of the whole. But the whole field, the whole Church is a fruitfull ground: Cant. chap. 4. vers. 13. The Church is compared to the goodliest Garden that euer was heard of, stored with the most precious plants vnder heauen, most delectable fruits, and the chiefest spices; shadowed by <hi>Pomegranats, Camphire, Spikenard, Calamus, Saffron, Cinnamon, &amp;c.</hi> It is not a Waste, an Heath, a Wildernes, but a new Paradise of God, planted by his hand: A Garden of greatest pleasure, and God takes pleasure no where else: A Garden in which <hi>the Tree of life,</hi> that is, Christ Iesus is to be tasted and fed on to eternall life: A Garden, in which a Riuer runnes foure wayes from the same Fountaine, that is, the Gospell runnes freely, stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the foure Euangelists: A Garden, in which man was placed to til and dresse it, so in the Church,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:18777:206"/>
men are gathered to exercise duties of piety and loue; A garden furnished with all manner of trees for fruit or delight, Cant. 7.14. <hi>A Vineyard, in which are all kindes of sweet fruits, old and new.</hi> Whence euery member being a part of the whole, must also abound and flourish in all holy vertues, and the sweet fruits of faith and loue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Let vs try (as men doe) the goodnesse of our ground, by the fruitfulnesse of the crop it yeelds. If it be good ground, it brings fruits answerable to the seed. The <hi>Rules</hi> of triall are these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If barrennesse be a signe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Triall of sound fruits by</hi> 4. <hi>rules.</hi>
               </note> and a true informer against bad ground, how many that haue long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Christ, and been long Hearers, are conuinced to be bad and cursed earth, because of their barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and fruitlesnesse? Numbers of carnall gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers content themselues with a forme of godlinesse, denying the power, like the cursed Figtree, they haue leaues, but no fruit: vnder the meanes, they liue voyd of faith, voyd of Gods feare, voyd of loue to the Word, voyd of obedience: scorne to reforme any thing, are as loose and disordered as at first, as hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and scornfull of the meanes, as euer: Are these good ground? No, no, their fruits bewray them what they are. Let them beware in time at their own perill: This barrennesse in the Gospell is accursed with cutting downe, and with euerlasting fire, Math. 25.41.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Rule.</hi> If good ground bring <hi>timely fruits,</hi> so soone as euer the seed falls on it, are they good ground that are so slowe and heauie to any good fruits, as somtime they are, resoluing seuen and seuen
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:18777:207"/>
yeeres to giue vp some vnwarrantable lusts, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake some commendable duty? Nay, some neuer resolue to doe good till they die; but, then they will repent and be better, &amp;c. But what? darest thou liue so neere the curse of God, as that ground on which the raine often falleth, Heb. 6.8. which yet is not seen on thee? Diddest thou marke in the Theefe conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, what a number of excellent fruits presently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared? Seest thou not the commendation of the Colossians, chap. 1.6. that the Gospell was fruitfull among them <hi>from the first day</hi> they heard it, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew the grace of God? (For thou neuer truly knewest the grace of God, who abidest vnfruitfull, &amp; takest dayes with God.) Considerest thou not what a singular praise, yea and mercy of God it is, to haue the Word worke speedily, and to hasten our fruits (were it possible) from the day that we heard it? How many sinnes should then be cut off? how many good duties vndertaken, and the reckoning furthered? Oh heare at length Christ knocking, &amp; resolue presently to open: If thou hearest his voyce this day, harden thy heart no more. How long shall he be with thee? how long shall he suffer thee? Take heed of that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, Pro. 1.24. <hi>Because I haue called, and you would not answere, behold, it shall come to passe, that you shall call, and not be heard; yea, I will laugh at your destruction, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Rule.</hi> Good ground bringeth fruits in kinde answerable to the seed: and the fruitfulnesse in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, is a godly conuersation <hi>beseeming the Gospell,</hi> Phil. 1.27. It bringeth not weeds, not Thistles, not brambles. But how comes it, that the seed being so pure, holy, yeelding, the fruits are so contrary? Did

Whence, I say, are they? Are these fruits beseeming good ground? Or are they any way like the seed? I dare say, a man may finde as good fruits as these, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Turks, and barbarous Heathens, where the seed neuer came; nay, in hell it self, where is no other ground but such as this. Let no man deceiue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: such rotten fruits argue rotten hearts: God wil reape no such haruest, he will owne no such ground.</p>

Labour to be fruitfull Christians: content not your selues with leaues, and the <hi>forme</hi> of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as trees of righteousnesse, shew forth your Grapes and Figges, and sweet fruits: Let God and man gather them, and taste them. For, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is in a fruitlesse condition, by which a man must know, first, that the Word of God for all his hearing was neuer rooted in his soule? for then it had beene fruitfull in grace. It is no barren seed, where suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to root. Secondly, that he is an vnbeleeuer, while he professeth all the Articles of Christian faith, and liues among Christians. For <hi>faith worketh by loue,</hi> and is fruitfull. Thirdly, that hee is destitute of the loue of God, which affection if it swayed the heart, it would vnite it to the thing loued in all duties of piety: If it loued God, it would <hi>keepe his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Ioh. 14.15. It would <hi>constraine</hi> him to fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, 2. Cor. 5.14. Fourthly, that hee is lyable to that deadly and irrecouerable fall that hypocrites come vnto; whose foundation being in the sand, the fall of that house is great: such are the fruitlesse Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who <hi>heare and doe not,</hi> Math. 7.24. Lastly, that hee is euer vnder that heauie curse, which is neuer farre off him, Heb. 6.8. <hi>The earth that drinkes in raine, and brings bryers and thornes, is neere vnto cursing, and the end is to be burned.</hi>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> But beware you deceiue not your selues with leaues for fruits, as all this is in many. It is with many Christians, as the Fig-tree cursed by Christ, so flourishing, as it deceiued Christs owne expectation; whereupon it receiued sentence, <hi>Neuer fruit grow on thee henceforth.</hi> Therefore looke to thy selfe, and to thy fruits: 1. See thou bee a branch of the Vine. 2. Know the truth <hi>as the truth is in Christ,</hi> to cast off all sinne, to resist all lusts, to forsake all knowne euils. 3. <hi>Walke as Christ walked,</hi> 1. Ioh. 2.6. Is thy life, thy actions, speaches, yea, and thoughts squared to the Word? Endeuourest thou to know further, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise the whole will of God reuealed? Doest thou all duties in true purpose and constitution of heart? bringing euen thoughts (which are thought so free) into conformity with the Word? This is to be a fruitfull Christian. All other blazes and showes will but bring thee to the end of an hypocrite.

               <hi>Quest.</hi> Doth euery good ground bring increase an <hi>hundreth fold?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No: as this Euangelist shewes, that there were three sorts of vnfruitfull Hearers, so the other compared with this, shew, that there are also three sorts of fruitfull Hearers: for <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> say, that the good ground bringeth fruit, <hi>some an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, some sixty, and some thirty fold.</hi> Therefore all bring not an hundreth fold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Why doth our Sauiour mention three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of fruitfull ground?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Some of the Fathers, as <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Ierome,</hi> say, it was to note a difference betweene <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, widowes,</hi> and <hi>married persons:</hi> some, as <hi>Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact,</hi> apply it to Anchorites, Monkes, and Laickes. An idle conceit: as if any outward estate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended a man to God, more then other, who is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>no respecter of persons:</hi> or as if <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Lot, Moses, Peter, Iohn,</hi> both married, and some of them secular men, did not as well bring forth <hi>an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth fold,</hi> as any of their Vestall Virgins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Rhemists in their Annotations on Math. 13 haue a brainlesse deuice, applying it to the difference of merits in this life, and of rewards in the life to come; that virgins merit here, and shall obtaine
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:18777:209"/>
there an hundreth fold, widowes sixty, married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons thirty. As if any estate or person could merit at all: Or as if our Sauiours intent had beene to shew the difference of the Saints glory in heauen, and not of Hearers in earth. But</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Sauiour of purpose in the other Euangelists mentioneth the 3. degrees of fruitfull Hearers: for 3. reasons. First, to note the free disposition of Gods grace and powerfull working, who euen in such, as in whom the Word is fruitfull, tyes not himself to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain measure, but distributes to euery one according to his good plesure. For as in the same field, the soile, the Sun, the ayre, the seed, the seasons are the same, yet in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruitfull seeds some bring more tilloes, some fewer, some but ten graines, some 40. some 60. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the blessing of God: So in this spirituall hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, wherein the Lord is (as in all other things) a most free Agent, bound to no lawes or obseruations. Secondly, to comfort &amp; encourage himselfe, his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, &amp; Ministers, who, though they lose much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in the 3. bad grounds, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good ground makes amends, in which none are fruitlesse, but if they bring not an hundreth fold, yet they may 60. or 30. and, if there be but a few that bring an hundreth fold, they shall abundantly recompence the barrennes of many grains. Thirdly, to comfort &amp; strengthen such as haue not, nor can attaine this <hi>hundreth fold,</hi> though their endeuours be true and earnest. Those that haue not attained the highest measure of grace, but are in the middle sort of Christians, nay, suppose them in the lowest formes who bring thirty fold fruits, are not to bee despised. Christ neuer quenched smoking
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:18777:210"/>
flaxe: Himselfe here honours them with the name of good ground, as well as those of the hundreth fold: And as the Husbandman, if hee see a graine bring an eare that hath neuer so few cornes in it, farre vnder 100. or 60. or 30. hee reiects not, nor scornes it, but is glad of it, and carries it into the barne: So the inferiour Christian, who hath sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with the smallest measure, is esteemed of Christ, and much set by: Hee that had but two talents, and gained but two, heard as well <hi>Euge, bone serue, Well done, good and faithfull seruant,</hi> as hee that had gayned ten, Math. 25.23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But why doth our Sauiour here speake only of the <hi>hundreth fold,</hi> the highest degree of fruits? <hi>Answ.</hi> To set before vs the ayme and scope of euery good Hearer: teaching vs, that</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Christian man must not content himselfe to be a fruitfull Hearer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct. Aspire to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth fold measure of fruits.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>but must striue to the greatest measure of grace, rising, if it be possible, from thirty to sixty, from six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to an hundreth fold.</hi> Phil. 1.9. the Apostle prayes they might be <hi>filled with the fruits of righteousnesse:</hi> as a vessel that cannot hold a drop more: which though we cannot attaine, yet euery godly man must ayme at it. None will denie but that we should doe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously, and doe good workes in this present world: But that is not enough, vnlesse we be <hi>filled with fruits of righteousnesse,</hi> and be <hi>rich in good workes.</hi> Col. 1.9. the same Apostle for another Church prayes, not onely that they may be fruitfull Christians, but <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all good workes, and increasing in the knowledge of God</hi>; yea, <hi>fulfilled in all knowledge, wisedome, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vnderstanding:</hi> that as a full vessell hath no
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:18777:210"/>
emptinesse or vacuity in it; so no part of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans life or conuersation be barren or empty of good fruits. 2. Pet. 3.18. <hi>Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ:</hi> comparing Christians to trees, which flourish to a goodly stature, but herein vnlike them: Ordinary trees haue their seasons to grow, but these <hi>trees of righteousnesse</hi> must euer grow,<note place="margin">Esa. 61.3.</note> euery time and age is their season, and most in their age, when other decay. And againe, whereas they may grow to bring a great measure of fruits, euery one of one kinde, these must not onely bring abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant fruits in <hi>measure,</hi> but in <hi>variety</hi>; euery one tree must be abundant in all the fruits of the Spirit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, Gal. 5.22, 23. as might be shewed in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. A great measure of grace makes greatly for the glory of God: Ioh. 15.8.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>Herein is the Father glorified, that ye bring much fruit.</hi> Papists thinke there is no vse of good workes, vnlesse we say they merit, iustifie, and saue vs. But they set out of sight Gods glory, the mayn end of them, to aduance themselues. For as it is the praise of the Husbandman, when his field, Orchard, or Garden is fruitfull aboue other mens: Euen so we being his husbandry, a part of his Garden and Paradise, branches of his Vine, planted, tilled, sowne, and set by his hand, care, Word and Spirit, doe then commend his husbandry, when we are <hi>laden with fruits of the Spirit, which are to the praise of God.</hi> 2. Thess. 1.12. The Lord <hi>fulfill the worke of faith</hi> with power, <hi>that the Name of God may be glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The striuing to a great measure of grace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth vs, 1. to the image of God,<note place="margin">2</note> who is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:18777:211"/>
Ocean, and an immense Sea of grace and goodnesse, and the more fruitfull and full of grace the creature is, the liker it is to God, and the neerer to his nature: 2. to the image of his Word, both the Law which requireth perfection of grace, and the Gospell, which is the wisedome from aboue, <hi>full of good fruits,</hi> Iam. 3.17. 3. To the image of Iesus Christ, making the members like the Head, who was <hi>full of grace and truth,</hi> Ioh. 1.14. 4. To the image of our first estate in innocencie, where was no defect: and 5. of that blessed expectation which wee are to frame and aspire vnto, in which, the Saints already gathered to God, haue put off all defects, and, being full of the glory of Christ, doe see him as he is, and see him to be like him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The being of a Christian stands in truth of grace,<note place="margin">3</note> but the well-being in strength of grace. His acceptation is for truth of grace, neuer so small; but his commendation is in strength and further mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of grace. Christ quencheth not, but accepteth a small measure of grace, but commends grace in great measure. Nay, where sometime he reproues a small measure of faith, <hi>O ye of little faith,</hi> hee mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a greater measure, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith:</hi> and of the Centurion, <hi>I haue not found so great faith, no not in Israel.</hi> Not loue, but <hi>louing much</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, Luk. 7.47. Many sinnes were forgiuen her, for <hi>she loued much.</hi> It was the great commendation of <hi>Stephen,</hi> that he was <hi>full of faith and power,</hi> Act. 6.8. and of <hi>Dorcas,</hi> that shee was <hi>full of good workes and almes which she did,</hi> Act. 9.36.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">4</note>4. The abundant measure of grace, is the maine
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:18777:211"/>
strength and comfort of a Christian: First, in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for Satan assailes the weakest, when and where the weakest; so doe seducers and deceiuers. Now a strong faith is a strong shield, great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as a strong wall and trench, great loue of God, a strong binder. Secondly, in persecution or afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for well-doing: strength of faith and patience will make them grow as the Palme and Camomile, vnder that burthen which sinketh and oppresseth weaklings. <hi>Iacob</hi> persecuted by <hi>Esau,</hi> flyes to God, and by strength of faith and prayer wrestles with God, and preuailed with God, and men. The Canaanitish woman ouercame Christ himselfe by strength of faith. Thirdly, in death he can be bold, fearelesse, and ioyfull, the conscience testifying of his fruitfull life. Faith clasping Christ fast to the soule, maketh him depart in peace. Fourthly, in iudgement it shall hold vp his head, when he can bring in an increase of fiue or ten Talents; at what time, according to the measure of fruits, in grace shall bee the measure of glory, fiue Talents, fiue Cities, ten Talents, ten Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Christian must striue to <hi>an hundreth fold</hi> measure,<note place="margin">5</note> because he that labours not in addition to his fruits, is on the losing hand, and at last shall lose them all. To sit downe, and not perseuere, is to lose all his labor. <hi>He that continueth to the end; shall be saued.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> A sound Christian therfore expects not his Sabbath or rest here, nor to cease from his labour, till he come into heauen; which makes him with <hi>Paul forget things behinde, and presse still forward,</hi> Phil. 3.13. And the commandement is, to <hi>finish</hi> our saluation with
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:18777:212"/>
feare and trembling, Phil. 2.12. And the end (wee say) crowneth all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To reproue such as stand at a stay in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as hauing grace and Religion enough, and they need no more: Who are to know, that they may suspect the truth of that grace which flatters it selfe, and conclude those beginnings to bee deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which are not followed with constant increase. Againe, they mistake true grace, which is not so soone attained as they thinke, being as a graine of Mustard-seed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Straite-neckt ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels are long a filling.</hi>
               </note> which neither roots, nor growes, nor spreads to a tree suddenly, but by degrees, and is dead further than growing: and the Lords Talent, which thou must <hi>occupie to increase till he come,</hi> Luk. 19.13. And, giue vp thy Trade once, thou must needs proue bankerupt and beggerly. Lastly, euery man would conclude thus in naturall things: If he see his corne in the field stand at a stay and neuer shoot forward, he will soone conclude, hee shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer receiue a comfortable haruest of it: And if he see his childe stand still at a stature, and neuer increase, nor grow stronger and bigger, hee will easily say, Surely he will neuer come to bee a man. So may I say truly of those that will still bee children in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith, obedience; They shall neuer attaine the <hi>measure of the age of the fulnesse and talnesse in Christ,</hi> Ephes. 4.13.</p>
            <p>Yet those are in more fearfull estate, who in stead of growing to an <hi>hundreth fold,</hi> fall backe from the measure they once had: as the grasse or corne that growes on the house-top, which was greene and flourished a little while, but incontinently withers

away, and falls to nothing. Bee it knowne vnto all these: 1. That they neuer had a graine of true grace; for that would bee rising, if not to an hundreth fold, yet to sixty, or thirty. 2. Let them be assured, that no man euer went to heauen backward; but, whom God hath a good purpose to saue, hee bringeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. 3. <hi>If any withdraw himselfe, the Lords soule hath no pleasure in him,</hi> that is, hates and abhorres him.</p>
            <p>Therefore looke to it, and awaken thy selfe in time, who haddest begun to set thy hand to the Plough, but hast looked backe, and haddest set out of Sodom, but hast looked behinde thee, and out of Egypt, but runnest backe againe. Thou couldest and diddest see and sorrow for sinne: now thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is feared. Thou couldest and diddest pray priuately, and in thy family: now hast giuen vp this duty. Thou diddest reade the Scriptures, redeeme the time, durst not sweare, nor breake the Sabbath, nor neglect the preaching of the Word: now Cards and Tables eate vp thy time, thou canst sweare, and swill, and drinke, and scorne the preaching of Gods Word, on the Sabbath day, or on other dayes, canst disdaine and wrong the Preachers and Professors of the Gospell. To thee, I say, Better thou haddest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer seene the light of nature, or grace, than haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued such an Apostate, such <hi>a dog,</hi> such a <hi>swine,</hi> 2.

               </note>1. Consider thine owne weaknesse and wants. Thou that knowest most, knowest but in part, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest but in part, &amp; the most holy is holy but in part; and, one of the first and best effects of faith, is, to see the weaknesse of faith. It lets thee see how farre thou art from the perfection of Gods Law and Image, from the marke and high calling, from the pitch and stature of the Saints, whose praise is in the Scriptures. It sees naturall fulnesse a step-mother to the desires of grace, for increasing it. And if thou hast not attained a sence and strife against imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, thou art not yet in the way to Christian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider the <hi>nature</hi> of true grace, the least taste whereof is so sweet, as hee cannot but desire a full draught: as the taste of the fruits of the Land of Canaan quickened vp Israel in the wildernesse to go forward, to take full possession; so the sweetnesse of the first fruits in grace exciteth an earnest desire for the full fruits in glory. Our Sauiour compares true grace to a Leauen, which a woman hides in meale <hi>till all be leauened,</hi> Math. 13.33. It will season euery part, and the least fulnesse in parts desireth and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth to fulnesse in degrees. He that findes a small measure so sweet and ioyous, assures himselfe, if he can attaine a greater measure, he shall attaine grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ioy, and out of a full measure, a full ioy, as Christ promised.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Consider the <hi>worth</hi> of grace, how precious a thing it is. If men could see the worth of it, as of gold, and siluer, they would as eagerly desire it, and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:18777:213"/>
be as restlesse till they had a large measure of grace, as of wealth, wherof no man saith he hath too much. Or if they were of <hi>Pauls</hi> minde, to esteeme all the world drosse and dung in comparison of the least drop of faith and holinesse, wee should see them lay about them otherwise than now they doe. But till this time, they will content themselues with a small shew, and lay aside this heauenly couetousnesse.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Consider the <hi>effect</hi> of true grace, which is as the most precious liquor, the more of which thou canst attaine and containe, the more honourable a Vessell thou becommest for the Lords vse. 2. Tim. 2.22. <hi>If any man purge himselfe, he shall be a Vessell of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:</hi> that is, not onely be so, but knowne so to be: both separated from the common vses and courses of the world, and sanctified to an holy vse; as also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly furnished and enriched with grace, as base earthen vessels, that is, wicked and earthly men are not.</p>

               <pb n="403" facs="tcp:18777:215"/>
Thou art daily proceeding to that measure, when all sorts of sinne, secret or open, gainfull or profitable, are forsaken, resisted, and in part conquered. 2. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> highest pitch of perfection is, similitude and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with Christ, (not parity, or equality in degree, but) to be a perfectly-holy member of so holy an Head. Then thou proceedest in degrees of grace, when (as the fulnes of Deity dwelt bodily in Christ, so) thou art daily made <hi>partaker of the Diuine nature,</hi> 2. Pet. 1.4. that is, by the inhabitation of the Spirit of God, vnited vnto Christ, thou growest daily like him in spirituall life, sense, and motion, in the graces of faith, loue, humility, obedience, patience, in the powerfull and constant resisting of tentation, in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to sinne, in rising from sinne, in ascending after him, and walking as he walked, 1.

            <p>Here for our further direction, we will consider, 1. What this vertue of patience is, 2. Why it is so necessary, 3. The vse of all.</p>

The <hi>obiect</hi> of it is griefe, and passion: take away passion, there is no vse of patience; as, where no enemie, no vse of weapons; where no disease, no vse of Phisick.

               </note>And because <hi>patience perforce</hi> is no vertue, I adde the manner of Christian suffering, that it is <hi>willingly, quietly, and constantly. Willingly,</hi> because there must be correspondence betweene our wills and Gods, in things so greatly making for our good. The Patient willingly submits himselfe to the bitter Pills, and tastlesse Potions of Phisicians, because hee hopes for good by them. But here is more assurance, that God will turne all to the best. <hi>Quietly and meekely:</hi> Psal. 39.9. <hi>I held my tongue and said nothing, for thou Lord diddest it.</hi> And herein our Lord hath gone before vs in example, who <hi>was dumbe before the shearer, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not his mouth,</hi> Esa. 53.7. <hi>Constantly:</hi> A good Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple must take vp his crosse <hi>dayly,</hi> not startling at the greatest afflictions, as <hi>Paul,</hi> he is <hi>ready not onely to be bound, but to dye for the Lord Iesus,</hi> Act. 21.13. nor fainting vnder the heauiest burden, seeing it is but for a moment, and the burden shall not be aboue our strength, and in the issue we shall see, <hi>The light afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this life are not worthy the glory that shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed,</hi> Rom. 8.18.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>necessitie</hi> of patience in the Christian
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:18777:217"/>
course, appeareth by these reasons:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reasons for the necessity of patience, fixe.</hi>
               </note> 1. The scope of the Gospell is, to make men fruitfull Christians. But this can neuer be, without the persecution of the world. For Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his crosse are inseparable:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and it is a ruled case, <hi>Whosoeuer will liue godly in Christ Iesus, must suffer persecution,</hi> 2. Tim. 3.12. No Disciple can expect to auoid or shunne the crosse, but expect that entertainment which our Sauiour fore-told, Math. 10.22. <hi>Ye shall be hated of all men for my Names sake.</hi> The shadow doth not more vndiuidedly follow the body, then persecutions and trials follow the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Gospell. This necessity of suffering af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, implies and inferres a necessity of patience. For as he that is to stand vnder an heauie burthen, must haue strong shoulders, or else hee must needs sinke: so, vnlesse patience beare such burthens as doe ineuitably follow the profession of the Gospell, the godly cannot but sinke vnder them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is necessary in respect of the manuring and preparing to fruit. The best ground brings no fruit,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> vnlesse it indure the Plough, the Harrow, the cold, the frost: Euen so the Lord prepareth his children to fruits of grace, by patient induring many trialls. The Wall-nut tree is made fruitfull by beating, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile by treading vpon, the Palme by pressing, and the Christian by suffering: while the Lords ouer-ruling hand brings out of the eater meate, and out of sowre sweet, as the most seasonable Summer-fruits by the sharpest Winter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In respect of the producing of fruits, there is great neede of patience: seeing there is no fruit of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> grace, which Satan seekes not to kill in the very
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:18777:218"/>
sprouting and first appearance; as the child in his birth, Reu. 12.4. And the wicked world seekes to blast them with the East-winde of reproches, yea to nip and pinch them, out-face and destroy them, with strong and violent persecutions: so as without pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>enduring the crosse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> 
               <hi>and despising the shame,</hi> this thirty fold cannot be expected, much lesse an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth fold. As a woman brings forth no fruit of the wombe, vnlesse shee patiently endure her sorrowes: no more can the Christian any fruit of grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his sorrowes. Thus Christ himselfe brings forth to vs all his blessed fruits, not without the greatest patience, proportioned to his greatest sufferings: and after the same manner must wee also bring forth our fruits to him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is necessary, in respect of the growth and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ripening of fruits. The seed sowne comes not vp all at once, but by degrees; <hi>first, the blade, then the eare, then ripe fruit,</hi> Mark. 4.28. So all our graces and fruits are small at first, and receiue increase by little and little. And therefore as the Husbandman expects with patience his fruits, and plucks not vp his corne, because it is small and weake at first, and comes not vp full corne: So the Christian must patiently waite for the growth and increase of his fruits, euen till they come to some perfection.

               </note> if patience preuented not: as first, the smart of present afflictions; for euery af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is <hi>grieuous for the present,</hi> Heb. 12.11. the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:18777:218"/>
thereof oftentimes makes vs shrinke, and startle, and grow out of heart, because of the roughnesse of our way. But now <hi>by patience we shall possesse our soules,</hi> the present remedy of the Disciples greatest perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, Luk. 21.17, 19. whereas by impatience wee lose our selues, and lessen our fruits. Secondly, the common crosses which accompany our mortall life, will make vs weary enough, vnlesse patience supply some strength, and vndershore vs. But by patience we giue glory to God, and his soueraignty, and right in disposing of vs, and to vs according to his good pleasure: Iob 1.20. and 2.10. Patience makes vs say, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done</hi>; If I must <hi>drinke of the cup, I will drinke of it.</hi> Thirdly, inward temptations, and disquietnesse of conscience, <hi>the wounds of spirit,</hi> are so intolerable, that the violence of them often shakes off many fruits, and makes the Christian walke weakely many dayes. Now patience alone keepes the soule at peace and quietnesse, waiting for God vnto succour or issue. It holds the heart in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the accomplishment of Gods promises, and our happinesse in Christ. Though the vision tarrie, yet it waites for the appearing of Gods face, and the healing of the soule, and is not disappointed. Fourthly, there are enemies without, which hazard our fruits. How easily and suddenly are wee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of euill, and drawne to returne iniurie with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, &amp; being prouoked, follow our owne reuenges? But now Christian patience steps in, holds the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and turnes the course. Now the Christian can blesse, being cursed, and do good for euill, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come euill with goodnes; which is a singular fruit of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:18777:219"/>
grace. Fifthly, infirmities of brethren with whom wee conuerse, were a great meanes to shake off our fruits (as <hi>Barnabas</hi> lost his sincerity for a time by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> dissimulation:<note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note>) if patience did not vphold to discerne and <hi>beare the infirmities of the weake,</hi> Rom. 15.1, 2. <hi>and not please our selues.</hi> But this will put an hand to helpe them vnder their burden, and from vnder it: as 2. Tim. 2.24. <hi>The seruant of God must be gentle to all, suffering euill men patiently, prouing if at any time God will giue them repentance:</hi> And much more it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, and (if it can) couers, and cures the infirmities of brethren.</p>
            <p>That is the fift reason.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. Patience is necessary, in respect of the Haruest of fruits, the gathering and full reaping of all the seed sowne. And thus the good ground brings forth <hi>with patience,</hi> that is, with patient expectation of the full fruits, the first fruits whereof are already attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Rom. 8.25. <hi>It patiently abides for that it seeth not.</hi> And in this respect, the Apostle saith, <hi>Wee haue neede of patience,</hi> Heb. 10.36. <hi>that after we haue done the will of God, we may receiue the promise.</hi> And thus we now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the promises, as did the Saints, namely <hi>through faith and patience,</hi> Heb. 6.12. How strong the expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the recompence of reward is, to vphold the heart vnto fruitfulnesse, see in <hi>Abraham,</hi> Heb. 11.10. and in <hi>Moses,</hi> vers. 26. And that this Haruest is only promised to patient enduring, our Sauiour noteth, Mat. 10.22. <hi>He that continueth to the end, shall be saued:</hi> And the Crowne is giuen only to the Conquerour, not to him that forsakes the field.</p>

                  <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> For generally men professe a faith seuered from patience. For what? Haue they suffered for Christ or good conscience any thing all their life long? Nay, they resolue to suffer nothing: not a word of disgrace, not a frowne of a Superiour, not the least trifling losse or inconuenience for Christ: but rather farewell Christ, and his profession. Let these men know, 1. that sound grace neuer comes without a sound burden of crosses to bee taken vp dayly: 2. Refuse to suffer with Christ, refuse to raigne with Christ: Reu. 1.9. <hi>Iohn a companion in the Kingdome, and patience of Iesus Christ</hi>; neuer expect to be a companion in the Kingdome, if not in the patience of Iesus Christ; He need no such compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as flie away when hee hath most need of them: 3. Refusest thou to suffer a Flea-biting in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, a blast of words, a frowne of bad times, now in dayes of the peace of the Gospell? what wouldst thou doe in the stings of Scorpions, and the fiery trials of former times, but shame both thy Lord and thy selfe? 4. Didst thou euer look so high as the <hi>hope of the high calling,</hi> Phil. 3.14. or euer poyze the <hi>eternall weight of glory,</hi> 2.

Lastly, shal Christ suffer so much for thee, &amp; wilt thou suffer nothing for him?</p>

            <p n="1">1. The act of suffering for Christ, is an higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:18777:220"/>
of Christian excellency, then beleeuing onely) Phil. 1.29. First, because it aduanceth the glory of God, whose power can make Christians as <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,</hi> not onely liue, but thriue and be glorious in the fire of persecution and suffering. The same power is dayly put forth in his seruants, by which the three children walked in the midst of the fire, and onely their bands were loosed. Secondly, because it conformeth vs vnto God our Father, who in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable patience endureth wrongs at mens hands, which men and Angels could not put vp: vnto Christ our Head, while we follow him in his sufferings, and by bearing his crosse, goe on to the Crowne: and to the blessed Spirit of God, who for his meekenesse and patience is resembled by the Doue.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Patience strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Christian</hi> 3. <hi>wayes.</hi>
               </note>2. It is a maruailous great strength to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian: first, for the setting and ripening of his fruits; for how comes it, that sinne wastes in him, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption abates, yea consumes, which still raignes and swayes the most? or that grace thriues and prospers in him, which is scorned and trampled by the most? but because he is patient to haue his lusts mortified, so are not they; he is patient to endure the labour of faith, and loue, so will not they. An heauie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, when he is to goe about duties of mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or sanctification, is soone discomfited, as were the <hi>ten spyes</hi>; there were so many enemies, so high walls to scale,<note place="margin">Num. 13.31.</note> so many Lions in the way: But where patience preuailes, it comes in like the two hearty spyes, <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshua:</hi> Tush, it is nothing to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come these Canaanites, why, they be but men, in Gods displeasure, the Land is ours already, and,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:18777:220"/>
what if we abide a brunt or two, or endure some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty? the good Land is worth it. Secondly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nulla an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps lucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in it virtute sine ista Virtus: nam vidua est quam non patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia firmat. Prudent. in Psychoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia.</hi>
               </note> what great strength doth it fortifie our faith withall, then which no one, nor all graces are more assayled? Patience as a shield steps in, and beares off such thrusts, and blowes, and shot, as otherwise would foyle Faith vtterly. It is a preseruing vertue, and is for the conseruation of the soule, Heb. 10. <hi>vlt. Cyprian</hi> in his booke <hi>de bono perseuerantiae</hi> saith, that as Faith is the foundation of Christianity, so patience is the roofe and couer, that keepes the whole worke whole and dry; and therefore is said to hold our soules fast to our selues, as Faith holds them to Christ. Hence it is called <hi>the Anchor of the soule,</hi> without which, Faith and all graces in the soule, as in a ship, doe totter and reele, as a ship without an anchor. Thirdly, what great stability affords it to a Christian,<note place="margin">3</note> when it makes him, and holds him constant, and himselfe, in all the changes of his outward condition, and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall occurrences? Let what stormes can bluster abroad, he possesseth his minde at home: His heart is settled by patience, which frameth his minde to his estate, when his estate is not to his minde. He is the same man in prison as at liberty, in sicknesse as in health, in trouble as at rest. Where others goe for currant Christians, till triall come, and the whist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling windes rise which blow off their leafie professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but then are proued counterfait, because they stored not vp patience, to part with deare things, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than with Christ and his Religion: these are constant to Christ, and themselues, seeing Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an patience supports them in doing and suffering
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:18777:221"/>
for God and good conscience.</p>

               </note>Great are the sweet and comfortable fruits of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, euen aboue peace. First, a Christian heereby may try the sincerity of his faith, Iam. 1.3. <hi>The triall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of your faith brings forth patience:</hi> for faith is such as it is in triall. Hence did the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> (1.1, 7.) tell the Iewes, that <hi>by patient enduring of affliction, their faith was tryed to be much more precious than gold.</hi> Wouldest thou try the sincerity of thy faith? Haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> recourse to thy patience, not to thy peace. Secondly, Christian patience makes a man a liuing Martyr, without fire or sword: makes him not onely dye li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, but liue dying for Christ and good causes: to which, being a speciall seruice of honour, belongs a speciall recompence, Reu. 2.10. <hi>Be thou faithfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death, and I will giue thee a Crowne of life.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer patience layeth out for Christ, Christ hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <hi>assumpsit</hi> to repay <hi>an hundreth fold,</hi> Mark. 10.30. And the Lord takes speciall notice of it, to approue and testifie vnto it, Reuel. 2.19. to the Church of Thyatira, <hi>I know thy faith and patience,</hi> that is, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and accept, and commend it. Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> patient bearing of trialls, is a good argument wee are in the right way,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.14.</note> which is <hi>narrow and straite,</hi> all strowed with crosses, difficult and vnpleasing vnto flesh: Act. 14.22. <hi>By many tribulations wee must enter into the Kingdome of God:</hi> and hee shall not enter, who will not be at the paines to seeke, and finde, and enter. Fourthly, it makes the whole life, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> yet comfortable: Outward peace often turnes our good things into euill and hurtfull: as, <hi>Dauid in his peace and prosperity said,</hi> that is, craked
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:18777:221"/>
and vaunted <hi>he should neuer be moued,</hi> Psalm. 30.6. But patient induring of affliction turnes all euils into good. Be any thing neuer so euill in it selfe, it is not so to thee, but by thine owne default. If thou hast patience, so many crosses will be so many comforts: Thou shalt sucke sweet out of sowre. Misery cannot make thee miserable, whose patience turnes all poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons into medicines: Thou hast by thee a soueraigne remedy for all sores. And in the end, the issue is bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and immediatly after the combate, comes the Crowne.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This serues to reforme our iudgements, who are so ready to mistake the sufferings of godly men.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> The world esteemes them most miserable, that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer most persecution: as Christ himselfe in the dayes of his flesh was <hi>despised of men,</hi> and therfore thought also <hi>reiected of God,</hi> Esa. 53.3, 4. But this Treatise hath declared, that the better the person is, the more is his suffering; and the better the fruit, the more need of patience. <hi>Pauls</hi> worke was holy, himselfe an happy man; yet bonds and afflictions did abide him in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery place: he was twice in prison before <hi>Nero,</hi> and at last put to death by him. Yea, the more holy and innocent our Lord himselfe was, the more heauenly and powerfull his doctrine and miracles, the more was his suffering, and so the more vse of patience; that in him the Head, we might see the estate of the members. His fore-runner <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> the friend of the Bride-groome, and greatest of the Prophets; was not his worke good, in seeking to draw <hi>Herod</hi> from his Incest? yet what was his wages, but wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full imprisonment? and at the suite of a dancing
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:18777:222"/>
Damosell, he was vniustly beheaded, without course of Law. What other fruits did the Apostles beare thorow the world, but the sweet and comfortable light of grace, both in their doctrine and conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And what other cup did they drinke, but the cup of affliction, persecution, and death it selfe? Now who dare conclude vs vnhappy for suffering, who in suffering haue the same cause, and such part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in our griefes, who haue with vs the Head of the Church, and the whole Church either going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or accompanying, or following after vs?</p>

                  <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note>4. This teacheth vs, <hi>not to be ashamed of the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Gospell, but to be willing partakers of the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ,</hi> as <hi>Timothy</hi> is exhorted, 2. Tim. 1.8. <hi>Heere is the patience and faith of the Saints.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reu. 33.10</note> 
               <hi>Moses</hi> esteemed the rebukes of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt. And as the sufferings of the Gospell are the wealth of a Christian, so indeed a chiefe honour: What needs Christ our witnesse, who hath so many witnesses in heauen and earth, Angels, creatures, yea diuels in hell? But yet hee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth vs, to giue testimony vnto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How may we willingly and patiently take vp the Crosse, and indure the shame of our Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as our Lord did?</p>

               <note place="margin">6. <hi>Helpes or meanes to the patient induring of the Crosse.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By these meanes. 1. Consider how inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably the Lord hath ioyned persecution with the profession of the Gospell. He might, if it had pleased him, haue seuered affliction from the Gospell: but for sundry ends hath ioyned them together: first, for his owne glory, who will erect and preserue a Church in the world, in despight of the world, and
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:18777:222"/>
of the diuell, and his wicked instruments. Christ will rule and shew his power in the middest of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Secondly, hee will haue the light manifest it selfe by discouering and chasing away darknesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which a continuall fight must be maintained. Thirdly, to stop the mouth of Satan, who would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse vs, as <hi>Iob,</hi> that we did not serue God but for ease and outward prosperity. Now cleauing vnto God in so many trialls, wee make the diuell a lowd lyer. Fourthly, to try his children, who will abide with him in affliction, and to make their rest sweet after so many conflicts, &amp;c. Therefore wisedome will pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently beare what is hopelesse to auoyd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider we the goodnesse of our cause, which is better than the best thing wee haue: and this will incourage vs to defend it with the losse of the best thing wee haue. Consider, that Christ suffers with thee, and that <hi>the Spirit of glory rests vpon thee:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet 4.14</note> Cast thy selfe vpon the hand of thy God, as <hi>Hester,</hi> saying, <hi>If I dye, I dye,</hi> and his power shall bee perfected in thy weaknesse.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Consider there is no cause wee should be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the afflictions of the Gospell. 1. Nothing is a iust cause of shame, but sinne: not that which helpes vs out of sinne. 2. There is no shame in wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing to a truth, especially a diuine truth from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. 3. Christ was not ashamed of thy crosse, and wilt thou bee ashamed of his? 4. Compare thy shame now from wicked men, with theirs at the day of Iudgement. 5. All thy shame for Christ is san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and seasoned in the shame of Christ for thee. 6. He that is ashamed of Christ while he was in his
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:18777:223"/>
lowest abasement, Christ will be ashamed of him in his glory. And besides, thou that oughtest not to be ashamed of him in his abasement, darest thou now in his glory and aduancement?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Meditate much and often on the comforts of another life; and that Christ makes it a signe of <hi>blessednesse,</hi> when wee suffer persecution for well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and Math. 5.12. <hi>Reioyce and be glad, for great is your reward in heauen</hi>; euen so great, as the afflictions of this present life are not worthy the glory that shal be reuealed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Accustome thy selfe to conquer thy lusts: as, 1. ignorance, which hinders from seeing the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Gospell: 2. pride, lest the disgraces of Religion cast thee off, as we see in men vnmortified: 3. passion and head-strength of naturall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which makes men impotent and impatient: see Heb. 12.1. 4. earthly and couetous desires, that thou maiest still be easily weaned from the world, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and vse of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Labour for the helpes of patience: as, 1. sound iudgement in the truth, allow it a deepe rooting: 2. sound faith; which ministers boldnesse, Psalm. 116. <hi>I beleeued, therefore I spake:</hi> 3. true hatred of sinne, to indure any sorrow rather than sinne, and admit the greatest sorrow, rather than commit the least sinne.</p>
            <p>So much of the first Doctrine. The second is this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. <hi>True grace is blessed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>The blessing of the fruitfull Christian is, because hee brings forth fruit with patience, hee shall perseuere vnto the end:</hi> Or, <hi>Truth of grace is blessed with continuance.</hi>
               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:18777:223"/>
Wherein this good ground is distinguished from all the three former, whose best fruits at last came to nothing. Esa. 40.31. <hi>They that waite on the Lord, shall renew their strength as the Eagle: they shall runne, and not be weary; they shall walke, and not faint.</hi> Psalm. 112.6. <hi>The righteous shall neuer be moued.</hi> Hence the Scripture compares the faithful to <hi>trees planted by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of water,</hi> whose moysture being indeficient,<note place="margin">Psal. 1.3.</note> their leaues fall not off: which liuing Water is Christ, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by faith, of which whosoeuer once drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he neuer thirsteth more, because there is in him a Fountaine springing vp to eternall life, Ioh. 4.41.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine being both of old, and of late op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, we must, 1. open the nature of perseuerance, which the Aduersaries at this day would obscure: and 2. confirme and prooue it by arguments, which they would elude.</p>

               </note>
               <hi>By which the sauing grace of Christ is preserued in the heart of the true Beleeuer.</hi>] Where are three things considerable: 1. The obiect, <hi>sauing grace:</hi> 2. The subiect, <hi>a true Beleeuer:</hi> 3. The meanes of perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>preseruation</hi> of grace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>obiect</hi> of perseuerance is <hi>the sauing grace of Christ:</hi> for the question is not of <hi>seeming</hi> graces, or <hi>common</hi> graces; as illumination, externall reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, temporary faith, and the like; but of true and sauing faith, loue, holinesse, fruits of election, and of effectuall vocation; wrought by the Spirit, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining, but renewing. Arminians denie, that Gods Election is any cause or foundation of perseuerance, yea or of calling to saluation: they denie any such principle of heauenly life by effectuall vocation: they denie that there is any substantiall difference betweene the faith, holinesse, righteousnesse of them that shall be saued, and that temporary which dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Apostates had, but onely induration and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. Quite contrary to the Scripture, which tells vs of <hi>semen manens,</hi> 1. Ioh. 3.8, 9. <hi>seed remaining in vs:</hi> of an <hi>ingraffed word,</hi> Iam. 1.21. of an <hi>oyntment which abideth,</hi> 1. Ioh. 2.21. of an <hi>immortall seed,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.23. and a <hi>fountaine of water springing to eternall life,</hi> Ioh. 4.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>subiect</hi> of perseuerance is <hi>the true Beleeuer,</hi> one truly iustified and sanctified: for looke what
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:18777:224"/>
grace soeuer an <hi>hypocrite</hi> hath, he may, and shall lose it totally and finally. We doubt not but hypocrites may fall from the whole profession of faith, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward persecute it, as <hi>Iulian:</hi> But the question is of <hi>true Beleeuers,</hi> and all the examples of hypocrites fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away, touch not the question.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>meanes</hi> of perseuerance is, that sauing grace is <hi>preserued</hi> in the heart of the true Beleeuer.] Wee denie not but grace in respect of it selfe, as in <hi>Adam,</hi> and in respect of the subiect, the Elect, is subiect to change, and may as easily be quite shaken out of the heart, as the grace of creation out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams.</hi> But, this sauing grace is <hi>preserued</hi> (not by the Beleeuer himselfe, by his owne watch and care, though not without it, but) <hi>partly</hi> by the priuiledge of spirituall life, flowing from Christ, who is risen from death, and dieth no more: <hi>partly</hi> by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God, who is faithfull in his whole couenant, Ierem. 32.40. <hi>partly</hi> by the protection, ayde, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody of God, whose <hi>power preserueth his to saluation,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.5. <hi>partly</hi> by Christs intercession and prayer: and <hi>partly,</hi> by meanes appointed to preserue that sparke of heauenly life, the Word, Ministery, prayer, exhortation, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For these are certaine rules: 1. That neither the promise of perseuerance on Gods part, nor the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it on mans, doe hinder the meanes, or make exhortation and prayers vnfruitfull, (as Arminians teach vs:) but rather imply and include them. Luk. 22.46. Christ had told <hi>Peter</hi> hee had <hi>prayed his faith should not faile,</hi> but yet exhorts him withall to <hi>watch and pray:</hi> who dare say it was idle, though <hi>Peter</hi>
               <pb n="422" facs="tcp:18777:225"/>
might be certaine of perseuerance? Marke the same argumentation in 1. Ioh. 2.27, 28.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conditions hinder not the certainty of the promise. For the Lord will vphold them to all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions requisite: Hee that makes them perseuere to the end, makes them perseuere in the meanes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conditions hinder not the absolute both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and performance: For the same thing may be both <hi>absolutely</hi> promised, because it shall certainly be accomplished, and <hi>with condition,</hi> that it shall not be accomplished but in such meanes, as wherein mans care and will commeth in, which being made to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuere, perseuereth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Much lesse can this assurance stand with a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate purpose of sinning, or cause any such boldnes: Because it is begotten and nourished by godly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, and begetteth also and nourisheth them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That hee falls not wholly and finally.</hi>] 1. That the Elect may fall, and sinne often, and foulely, we deny not, nor is that the question. That they may admit grieuous euils, with their will and consent, appeares in <hi>Peter, Dauid, &amp;c.</hi> That they may by their sinnes deserue the sentence of eternall damnation, and (so much as in them lyeth) incurre the sentence denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on them that continue not in all things written in the booke of the Law, is out of question. But that they may sinne to death, wee denie: that they doe sinne with whole consent of will, that any of these sinnes are euer imputed to their damnation, or to cast them quite out of fauour,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Non dicit nullu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabile, sed nulla con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnatio.</hi>
               </note> or the right of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we deny with the Apostle, Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:18777:225"/>2. That true grace may be not weakened onely, but quite lost, that is, such as serue to their well-being in Christ, as ioy, peace, cheerefulnesse, &amp;c. is yeelded on all hands. But true grace, which serues for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Christ, as faith, loue, holinesse, cannot bee quite lost, because the member of Christ is insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the Head.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That true sauing grace, seruing to our being in Christ, may be lost in part, in some degree, in the measure, sence, and comfort of it, we affirme: The Church of <hi>Ephesus falleth from her first loue.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reuel. 2.4. <hi>Perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistentiam infert, non fructuum et foliorum omnium.</hi>
               </note> But to be quite lost in all parts and degrees, we denie: because he that begins a good worke in the Elect, will also finish it, Phil. 1.6.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the act of true faith and grace, and the worke of it may be stopped, and lost for a time, we yeeld; euen as it apprehends Christ a louing Lord and Mediator, which is the proper act of faith; and also in respect of outward fruits it may bee stopped and interrupted, and contrary fruits taken in. But that the habit of grace, or grace it selfe should euer be lost, wee denie: for, though the faith of the Elect may be lost, according to his degrees and act, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer according to his essence and habit.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Wee deny not but that Satan may plucke at them, and violently assault them euery way to seduce them by errors and heresies, within, and the strength of lusts; and outwardly, by terrors and persecutions: And that by the violence of such temptation, their faith and graces may be sore shaken and shattered, yea hide themselues as a small sparke of fire vnder a bushell of ashes; and themselues by their improui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:18777:226"/>
vnwatchfulnesse, and yeelding to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may get many knockes, and take many grieuous falles, to the breaking of their bones. Yet, that though they be plucked at, they shall <hi>not bee plucked away,</hi> appeares, Ioh. 10.28. Heretikes may assault and stagger the Elect, but it is <hi>impossible</hi> they should se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, Math. 24.24. Tyrants may preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their persons, not against their faith, Mat. 16.18. Their building may be shaken, not ouerthrowne, because it is founded on a Rocke, Mat. 7.24. Though they may bee cast downe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lapsus est, non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsio.</hi>
               </note> yet not cast off. Though they may fall, yet the Lord puts vnder his hand, Psalm. 37.24. So as the conclusion is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All the Elect perseuere in the state of grace vnto the end.</hi>] And whereas the Arminians hold, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect doe perseuere by a discontinued perseuerance, and shall at length bee saued, though sinne driue them quite out of the state of grace, and driue all grace away: We plainly affirme, that the Elect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuere in the state and habite of faith, by perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance continued, and not interrupted; and in the act or exercise of faith sometimes discontinued, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter returnes to it, and holds it on (though with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate) vnto the end.</p>

               </note>Thus haue wee seene the description of Perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in the seuerall limmes of it: Now let vs see some grounds or reasons out of the Scriptures, and the fewer, because we will cleare them from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the Aduersaries, as briefly and plainly, as my best art could contriue.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Ground: drawne from the promise of the Lord, whose promises being sealed and ratified by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <pb n="425" facs="tcp:18777:226"/>
the blood of Christ, are all faithfull, <hi>Yea, and Amen,</hi> 2. Cor. 1.20. But God hath promised, the faithfull shall perseuere, Ierem. 32.39, 40. <hi>I will make an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Couenant with them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect. Thompson</hi> in his <hi>Diatribe,</hi> chap. 12. answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that such promises especially concerne the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, and so would slightly auoid them all. But, if they be made to the whole, then to the indiuiduall parts, which are Beleeuers: for the whole consists of all his parts, and euery member hath right in that, which the whole hath right in.</p>
            <p>Hence seeing how insufficient his answere is, hee would afterward mend it, in saying, This, and such promises belong to the Kingdome of glory. But, 1. hath God so great care to preserue them from falling and departing from him, there where is no such danger of falling, where is no possibility of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from him? where <hi>Adams posse non peccare,</hi> in this lower Paradise, shall be turned for euer into <hi>non posse peccare?</hi> 2. Who would haue thought a man (who would seeme so acute) would giue so sudden an answere, not reading the place? for reade the next verse, 41. The Lord saith plainly, <hi>I will plant you in this Land, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Arminians in their Remonstrance to the States of the Low-Countries, answere to this place, thus, that God indeed by his motion offereth to conuert men, so much as is in him, and yet a man may bee not conuerted: as if a Master (say they) should say to his Scholler, I will make you another boy, I will teach you another tongue, &amp;c. and yet failes, because the Masters indeuour is not well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:18777:227"/>
So God doth all hee can to conuert, and to containe in grace, but we faile hereof, and so the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise also.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It seemes God promiseth not to doe any thing, but to indeuour to doe his best: which cannot stand with vers. 27. <hi>I am the Lord of all flesh: Is any thing hard to me?</hi> 2. It is all one to say, that the heart of man is not in the hand of the Lord, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it as he pleaseth, contrary to Prou. 21.1. 3. If the Couenant, which they say on Gods part is true, may by our default bee frustrate, then is it not the <hi>New Couenant,</hi> but that <hi>Old</hi> one which the Iewes brake and made void: For that was firme on Gods part, but frustrate by their sinnes. But this is another manner of Couenant, Ier. 31.31. not a couenant of workes, but of grace, including faith, repentance, perseuerance, and all conditions to bee obserued on our part; and this, our sinnes cannot frustrate: else hath it no priuiledge aboue the other. 4. The simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude is absurd and vnreasonable, vnlesse they will say, that God hath no more power ouer a man, than a Master hath ouer a boy: He may say what hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe, and intend what hee cannot performe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he cannot giue the boy a disposition, which God can, who cannot say more than he can doe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, they will not denie, but the Lord can, and doth put out another manner of power in conuerting, and containing in grace, than the Master can in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and informing a Scholer: for, the Master doth but stirre vp naturall faculties, God createth super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall. Lastly, it were happy if Schoolemasters were so happy in their teaching, among whom, all
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:18777:227"/>
that are taught, learne not; But here, <hi>all that are taught of God, doe come vnto Christ,</hi> Ioh. 6.45.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Ground: taken from the straite coniunction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or marriage-band betweene God, and his people; betweene Christ, and the Christian soule. This ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily inferreth perseuerance in grace. Hos. 2.19. I will marry thee <hi>for euer</hi> vnto my selfe, in truth, in mercy, and in faithfulnesse. The Lord marries vs, neuer to depart. This espousall is twofold. One by the outward couenant: so all and euery of the Iewes were espoused to God. The other, by inward and powerfull operation: so, not all the Iewes, but the Elect among the Iewes, are espoused to him, as Rom. 9.24. These espousals cannot bee dissolued, but those may.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1. The Lord marries himselfe for euer: but the bond is broken on our part. <hi>Answ.</hi> Then is it not for euer, if the bond be broken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2. <hi>Thompson</hi> answereth the place, that all such promises <hi>habent annexas conditiones, quibus sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penduntur, &amp; quarum praestatione determinantur:</hi> so the <hi>Arminians, That is onely promised, which on Gods part is to be performed, but on our part the condition is required, that we repent and depart not from him. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere</hi> 1. Contracts of marriage vse not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall, but simple and absolute; else it is no binder. 2. It is true, this condition is implied and required of vs, that wee beleeue, repent, and neuer depart: for, who can perseuere in faith, or repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that wants them? But 1. this condition is not an antecedent or cause of the contract, but a fruit and effect of it. 2. It is the Lord himselfe that
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:18777:228"/>
maintaines this condition in vs: As he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from vs, so hee puts his feare into our hearts, not to depart from him: And, in that hee will not depart from vs, wee shall not depart from him. For then wee depart, when his grace first departs from vs. Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth, <hi>Vphold mee, O Lord, and I shall bee safe.</hi> In a word: Christ alone performes all this condition to his Church, Ephes. 5.25, 26. he <hi>makes her, formes her, cleanseth her, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 3. To auoyd this place, they adde, that these promises are of temporall things, not spirituall, not eternall. <hi>Answ.</hi> Vnder temporall things, spirituall are promised, as we see in vers. 20. I will marry thee, <hi>that thou maiest know the Lord:</hi> And so the Apostle applyeth it, Rom. 9.25.</p>

Ground: taken from the coniunction of Gods Power and Will, which is a strong ground of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance. 1. Pet. 1.5. <hi>Wee are kept by his power vnto saluation. Obiect. By faith,</hi> saith the Apostle, not in the faith. <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, therefore in the faith: the Israelites were led thorow the Wildernesse, therefore were kept in the Wildernesse: <hi>Noah</hi> was saued by the Arke, therefore both the Arke, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the Arke were saued.</p>
            <p>Esa. 63.1. <hi>The Lord Omnipotent, mighty to saue.</hi> 2. Tim. 2.12. <hi>He is able to keepe that which I commit vnto him.</hi> 2. Cor. 1.21. <hi>It is God who stablisheth vs. Obiect.</hi> True, God cannot bee ouercome, hee is <hi>able to make vs stand,</hi> Rom. 14.4. but wee are weake and quickly ouercome. <hi>Answ.</hi> That God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ouercome, yet wee may, is false: for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

he is able to make vs stand, <hi>wee shall bee esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,</hi> Rom. 14.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect. A posse ad esse non valet argumentum:</hi> It is no argument, He can, therefore it shall bee so: Hee can make Christs body in mo places at once, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is so. <hi>Answ.</hi> It is weake indeed, where Gods Power is abstracted from his Will and Decree: But ioyne his Will to his Power, and it is a sound argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: What God can doe, and will doe, shall bee done: From both which resulteth that strong Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke of this cause, Ioh. 10.28. <hi>My Father is stronger than all, and none shall plucke his sheepe out of his hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arminius</hi> answereth, <hi>Quamuis rapi non possunt dum sunt oues, non sequi tamen, eos non posse desinere oues esse, aut è manu Patris transfugere per peccata:</hi> They may cease to be sheepe, and wander away by sinne. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is an idle begging of the question: for, what doth Christ promise in all that place, but because they heare his voyce, and follow him, and none shall plucke them away; therefore they shall neuer cease to be sheepe? And, if they bee neuer plucked away while they are sheepe, they shall abide long enough, euen <hi>till Christ haue giuen them eternall life:</hi> so long shall they be sheepe. 2. If the power of the Father be superiour to all power of the Enemie, as the Text affirmes, then it is aboue all tentations, and suffers no power to make them of sheepe no sheep. 3. Though the sheepe be weake and straying, of themselues, yet they haue a good Shepheard, whose office is to keep his sheepe, and rescue them from the Lion and Beare, as <hi>Dauid:</hi> and to <hi>leade them in the paths of righteousnesse,</hi> that they erre not from the Fold, Psal.
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:18777:229"/>
23.3. Therefore vainly say they, they may slinke out of the Fold, and out of the Fathers hands, though none can plucke them. Besides, though these sheepe be in themselues mutable and foolish, yet by Gods power they are preserued from totall mutation or change.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Ground: Rom. 11.29. <hi>The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</hi> Where first the explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the replication.</p>
            <p>By <hi>gifts,</hi> are not meant corporall, naturall, morall, not all spirituall, common to good and bad, no, not all speciall gifts proper to the Elect; for some not being of the essence of faith, and vnion with Christ, may be lost. But heere are meant the gifts of Election, and of effectuall calling; such as faith, hope, charity, remission of sinnes, iustification, repentance, perseuerance in grace, and glorification. These are irreuocable gifts.</p>

            <p>And this is the intent of the place: namely, to shew, that though the Iewes became enemies of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and vnworthily abused the gracious blessings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them by God, yet the Election and promise of God, of calling many of them, and leading them to saluation, is stronger than to bee made voyd by such their vnworthinesse: and the reason is, because these gifts which belong to Vocation and Election, are such as God cannot repent of.

            <p>Now for the reply: This exposition meets with two errours of <hi>Arminius.</hi> First, that this place is not meant of Gods immutable Decree of Election, nor of the gifts of faith &amp; perseuerance, but of the Iewes restitution, and calling to the communion of the Gospell: whereby they take in the effect, and quite iustle out the cause. Secondly, that these gifts and calling proceed not from Election: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verse of that Chapter, <hi>Hath God cast away his people whom he knew before?</hi> and to the 5. verse. <hi>Euen so now a remnant is reserued through the election of grace:</hi> and to the 7. verse, <hi>The election hath attained.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="432" facs="tcp:18777:230"/>
               <hi>Thompson</hi> hath two answeres to this place. 1. He saith, These gifts are so called, in respect of the euent and end, eternall life; but so, as in the meane time God may repent againe and againe. Cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the constant nature of God, and the constant tenor of grace, the characters of which are indelible. 2. They are (saith hee) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in respect of God promising, not of man receiuing. Vaine man, who will make the gifts according to purpose, to reele and stagger according to the wauering and flexible will of man. What? Shall Gods stable counsell depend on the leuity and temerity of mans will?</p>
            <p>The Remonstrants answere, that though God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent him not <hi>doni sui,</hi> of his gift, yet man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent <hi>doni accepti &amp; retenti,</hi> of the gift receiued and held: besides, that God doth repent of his gifts, if man abuse them: as Gen. 6. 1. Sam. 15. so as though God take not away his gifts, yet man may cast them away: though God reuoke not, yet man may reuolt, and scatter those gifts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Thus Gods mighty power is made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the power of the creature. 2. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God faileth: for the tentation exceedeth their strength. 3. Gods wisedome giues not such gifts to such as will cast them away, or to none but such as know the excellency of them. The new name is not knowne but to him that hath it, and hee that hath it, knoweth it. 4. God not onely not takes away the gifts he thus giueth, but preserueth them: for this is the difference between the grace of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Regeneration. God frames our will, and makes it willing to perseuere, that all the glory may
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:18777:230"/>
be his: <hi>Nothing is ours, therefore boast of nothing.</hi>

It is true, that all conditions required, are easily broken on our part, our worthinesse being like <hi>Israels,</hi> Deut. 9.6. But the Lord worketh all conditions for vs and in vs; Psal. 61.7. <hi>Hee shall dwell before God for euer: O prepare mercy and faithfulnesse, that they may preserue him.</hi> Which may better be seene by comparing these places together, Exod. 19.5. with Ezek. 36.27. 2.

            <p>To the Proposition they answere, that it is not true alwayes; for Christ prayed for his enemies, that his Father would pardon them, but was not heard. But how rash and dishonourable to Christ is this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, beside the falshood of it? For 1. Was there not absolute conformity betweene the will of God, the Father and the Sonne? Could Christ aske or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire any thing, which stood not with the will of his Father? 2. Did Christ pray for all and euery of his enemies? as if hee had not said, that some of them sinned against the holy Ghost; for whom he must not pray, Math. 12.31, 32. And, if hee prayed for some, was he not heard, seeing by vertue of that prayer so many thousands were conuerted at one Sermon, Act. 2.41? Surely he prayed for all his owne, and was heard. 3. This their answere is a meere cauill: for, our question is of that which Christ asketh for the
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:18777:231"/>
Elect, and not for his enemies: And here they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly graunt, that whatsoeuer he prayed for, for the Elect, he is heard in, and obtaineth.</p>
            <p>Then they answere to the assumption: that Christ prayed not absolutely for the perseuerance of the Saints, but conditionally. To this I say, 1. Wee neuer read of this condition in petitioning perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. 2. Their Champion <hi>Thompson,</hi> cha. 19. denieth it, saying, <hi>Oratio Christi pro Petro proculdubio ex ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluta voluntate processit, &amp; fuit efficax, &amp; exaudita.</hi> Christs prayer for <hi>Peter</hi> proceeded (no doubt) from his absolute will, and was effectuall, and heard.</p>
            <p>Therefore they answere againe; that it was made for <hi>Peter</hi> vpon speciall occasion. I answer, no: 1. Christ intends his speech and prayer further then <hi>Peter. Peter</hi> (saith he) <hi>Satan hath sought to winnow,</hi> not <hi>thee,</hi> but <hi>you,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: though as a good Phisician he applies the playster to the part affected, but neglects no part of the body, so Christ turnes him to <hi>Peter,</hi> now most distressed and diseased, hereby putting him in mind, 1. of his fall, to humble him, 2. of his rising, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, 3. of his duty, to quicken him, <hi>Thou being conuented, strengthen thy brethren.</hi> 2. Christ prayed the same for all the Disciples, Ioh. 17.11. <hi>Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, keepe them in thy Name: And not onely for these, but such as shall beleeue in their Word to the end of the world,</hi> vers. 20.</p>

               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But <hi>Peter</hi> failed in faith for the present, for all that, and so may Beleeuers: and by that word, failing in faith, wee say, Christ signified onely <hi>actum finalem</hi>; and so, notwithstanding the prayer of Christ, <hi>Petrus mortaliter peccare potuerit,</hi> he might sinne vnto

                  <hi>Aug. de corrept. &amp; gratia. ca.</hi> 8.</note> what it is to faile in Faith, namely, not to perseuere vnto the end: And therefore hee that is wholly cut off for a time, perseuereth not. 2. Christs prayer was heard, which was not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not that his Faith should not faile in part, but not vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and altogether vanish. So <hi>Chrysostome: non dicit</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. For by Christs care and fauour it was, that <hi>Peters</hi> Faith did not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanish. He failed in confession, not in affection. His Faith was not <hi>ficta,</hi> fayned, therefore not <hi>fracta,</hi> broken: It was <hi>concussa, non excussa,</hi> shaken, but not shaken off. <hi>Corde tenuit illum quem voce denegauit,</hi> saith <hi>Gregory:</hi> He denied Christ with his mouth, but held him still in his heart. Wee graunt <hi>Peters</hi> Faith wounded, not dead: his confession oppressed with feare, not wilfully reiected: his sinne miserable, not mortall or deadly in <hi>Thompsons</hi> sense.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Ground: taken from Gods continuall being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> with the Elect, their in-being in Christ, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in-being in them.</p>
            <p>First, the presence and ayde of God in trials, <hi>will not suffer them to bee tempted aboue that they are able,</hi> 1. Cor. 10.13. God is continually present with his, Esa. 46.4. in sixe troubles, and in seuen, in their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage thorow fire and water: and to this end, that they be not drowned and ouercome, but to supply both strength, and euasion. <hi>Obiect.</hi> In that place God promiseth (say they) sufficient strength to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all temptations, but, onely to them that are waking: yet God abides faithfull, in forsaking them
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:18777:232"/>
that forsake him. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. But the question is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is God faithfull in this promise of preseruing them in Faith, and in not suffering any tentation to befall aboue their strength, or whereof he will not giue a good issue? And if he be, whether they shall forsake him whom hee forsaketh not? 2. The whole Word is giuen, not to them that sleepe, but them that wake: But who is it that makes vs awake, and keepes vs waking, but the Lord? Psal. 121.4. Or who calls vs out of our beds, but he? Cant. 5.2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, their in-being in Christ preserues them as liuing members of a liuing Head: who therefore is called <hi>the sauiour of his body,</hi> Eph. 5.23. <hi>Obiect.</hi> This is true of his members, so long as they be liuing, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, dutifull, obedient members. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. There is no elect person, and regenerate, but is a liuing member: for the Head preserueth life in euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. 2. He that made him a member being no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, can and doth restore and recouer him, though sicke, vnsound, and hurt: dealing with his members as wee doe with ours, who tender, and wrap, and make much of sore and weake members, not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them as full of corruption, but as members. Ioh. 6.37. <hi>Whatsoeuer the Father giueth me, commeth to me, and he that commeth to mee, I cast not out. Obiect.</hi> True, if hee alway come to Christ: but hee may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and goe away of himselfe. <hi>Answ.</hi> No: Christ shewes in the 40. verse, what he meanes by not cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, namely, hee shall euer abide in my fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and family: for I will effect, that <hi>hee shall haue eternall life.</hi> Againe, Ioh. 17.12. <hi>Whom thou hast giuen mee, I haue kept, that not one of them is perished:</hi> and
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:18777:232"/>
Iude 1. Such as are called and sanctified, are also <hi>preserued of Iesus Christ.</hi> But how is he preserued, that departs and goes away?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in whomsoeuer the Spirit dwelleth, hee must needs perseuere in grace, so long as hee dwels there: but the Spirit dwels alway in the Elect, after conuersion, Ioh. 14.16, 17. I will pray the Father, and he shall giue you another Comforter, that hee may <hi>abide with you for euer:</hi> Which cuts off their thred-bare answere, of, So long as the Spirit dwels, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so their distinction of abiding for a time, and for euer.</p>
            <p>Whosoeuer hath the Spirit of God, is borne of God; and whosoeuer is borne of God, sinneth not, that is, so as sinne recouer his raigne and power: The reason is, because the <hi>seed of God abideth in him,</hi> 1. Ioh. 3.9. that is, either the Spirit of God, whose vertue is a principall efficient, or the Word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as an instrument we are regenerate and begotten to God. <hi>Obiect.</hi> True, so long as they are borne of God, and so long as the seed abideth in them, they sinne not. <hi>Answ.</hi> So <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellarm. de iustif. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.</note> 
               <hi>Non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test lethaliter peccare quamdiu perseuerat filius Dei,</hi> changing the casuall particle of the Apostle, <hi>quia,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a conditionall <hi>quamdiu.</hi> So <hi>Thompson</hi> also, cha. 20. But the Apostle is expresse against their absurd eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: He is alwayes borne of God, because the seed of God abideth in him, and is in him for euer. Nay, his natiuity of God keepes him, that he cannot fall from God finally, and returne into the Kingdome of Satan againe: so chap. 5.18. <hi>Hee that is borne of God, sinneth not, but preserues himselfe, and the wicked touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:18777:233"/>
him not</hi>; that is, hath power giuen him of God, whereby to preserue himselfe, that Satan touch him not in his Free-hold, or snatch him backe againe to death and destruction.</p>
            <p>These are some of the grounds, by which this comfortable Doctrine is confirmed: with which (to auoyd prolixity) I will content my selfe.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Most of the obiections preuented in foure po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions or conclusions.</hi>
               </note> Now for the manifold Obiections, which are made against it, I will endeuour to preuent them all in some fewe Conclusions.</p>
            <p>The first is this: <hi>No precept to beware of falling away, no promise to perseuerance, no commination or threatning against Apostates, doth proue, that a true Beleeuer can fall away wholy, or finally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the former: where we are exhorted to <hi>beware of falling away from the grace of God,</hi> Heb. 3.12. and to <hi>take heed, that standing we fall not,</hi> 1. Cor. 10.12. and where <hi>blessednesse is promised to him that feareth alwaies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> Pro. 28.14. none of these exhortations to so great diligence, and feare, and watchfulnesse, argue such an absolute defect in all them to whom they are giuen, and in whom they are found, but agree with certaine perseuerance, as meanes with the end, the cause with the effect: Because,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are deliuered to hypocrites, as that in 1. Cor. 10.12. Let him that <hi>thinks</hi> he stands, take heed lest hee fall: because they wanting Faith, deceiue themselues with a vaine presumption, and opinion of Faith, and fall away. But what is this to the sound Beleeuer?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If they be deliuered to the godly, who may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so grieuously fall from Faith and other graces, they
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:18777:233"/>
proue not they can fall from true sauing grace, at least in the habit and gift, but onely in the measure, degree, and parts; all which they ought to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and preserue. But one thing it is to fall, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fall away: One thing to fall from the first loue, another, from all loue.</p>
            <p n="3">3. No feare of falling impeacheth the certainty of not falling away.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christus ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se timuit, vt exemplo doceret, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morem om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> esse frustraneu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vbi perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerantia est certa.</hi>
               </note> Our Lord Iesus himselfe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and fasted, and prayed forty dayes and forty nights, before his temptations, that in his example we might see, that our feare is not then frustrate, when perseuerance is certaine.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Meanes of perseuerance and not falling away, cannot be certaine proofes of falling away, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against it. But exhortations are such meanes, while 1. they admonish vs of our imbecillity in our selues, 2. driue vs to our hold, to get strength from God, and implore his ayde and helpe, 3. dayly to awaken vs out of our dulnesse and security, 4. to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold vs, being ready to faint and grow weary, by cherishing Faith and other graces, 5. not to bring in doubting, but keepe vs in good assurance, while wee vse the meanes prescribed, still looking at the promises.</p>
            <p>And for threatnings and comminations against Apostates and back-sliders, as Ioh. 15.6. <hi>Euery branch that beareth not fruit in me, I take away and cast out:</hi> and Heb. 10.26. <hi>If we sinne willingly, after we haue receiued the knowledge of the truth, there remaines nothing but a fearefull expectation of vengeance.</hi> 1. These and the like threats are properly meant of seeming branches, that bring leaues, but otherwise are barren and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:18777:234"/>
as a true branch in Christ cannot be, vers. 5 2. All these comminations are conditionall, <hi>if a branch beare not fruit,</hi> which though it be impossible in a true branch, yet they are of vse to them, to stirre vp their care and watch; and further can conclude nothing. 3. Many such places, as Heb. 10.26. are of such as sinne against the holy Ghost, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues say is not incident vnto a true elect person.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Conclusion: No prayer or petition in Scripture, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for not losing the Spirit, or for restoring the Spirit, concludes against the elects perseuerance in grace, but for it:</hi> Because first, prayer of the Spirit argues the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Spirit, and being a prayer of Faith, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied; Secondly, it is ordinary for the Saints to pray,<note place="margin">Psal. 51.11 12.</note> 
               <hi>Take not away thy holy Spirit,</hi> Psal. 51.11. for he is sometime taken from them, not in respect of his existence, but of his powerfull working; not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the sauing gift, but of the measure, degree, and operation of it: As hee is taken away from the wicked, not in respect of the gift of Regeneration, which they neuer had, but of some common gifts, either naturall, or ciuill, for office or the like, as in <hi>Saul,</hi> 1. Sam. 15.16. Thirdly, it is as ordinary for them to pray for the returne of the Spirit, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a new Spirit, who is indeed quite gone, not in himselfe, but in their sense and apprehension: But this concludes nothing, that because they feele him not, therefore hee is not there, no more than a man in a swoone may conclude he hath no life, or a child in the wombe not to liue, because it vnderstands not the life of it. Fourthly, it is not (as they say) in vaine for them thus to pray, though they cannot fall away,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:18777:234"/>
because 1. it is an obedience to Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: 2. a testimony, that we depend on his strength and promise for perseuerance: 3. that we shal attaine this gift in Gods owne meanes, which is Prayer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Conclusion: No phrase in all the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes against the perseuerance of the Elect</hi>; though in some phrases they picke many quarrels. As wee may see in some of most seeming contrariety.</p>
            <p>For this in the Text, that some beleeue onely <hi>for a time,</hi> we haue formerly shewed, that this was farre from <hi>iustifying</hi> faith, of which our question is, but is meant of <hi>temporary</hi> faith, which hath no promise of perseuerance, as this hath. But how weake were the conclusion, Some fall from temporary faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others may fall from iustifying faith?</p>
            <p>Gal. 3.3. <hi>Some begin in the Spirit, and end in the flesh. Answ.</hi> 1. The Apostle writes not to particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, (of whom wee speake) but to foolish Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, that neuer truly beleeued. 2. By <hi>spirit,</hi> is not there meant the Spirit of Regeneration, but, they begun in the doctrine of the Gospell, called <hi>spirit and life,</hi> Ioh. 6.63. and <hi>the ministery of the Spirit,</hi> 2. Cor. 3.8. 3. By <hi>ending in the flesh,</hi> is not meant the state of a man vnregenerate, but the fleshly doctrine of false apostles, sauouring wholly of fleshly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wisedome. So as the Apostle chargeth them not with falling from true Regeneration, (which they had not, and of which we now speake) but from the profession of the Gospell, which they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Now how inconsequent is this, Many fall from professing the truth, therefore the Elect fall from grace?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="442" facs="tcp:18777:235"/>Exod. 32.32. Some are said to be <hi>blotted out of the Booke of Life:</hi> not wicked onely, Psal. 69.28. but the Elect, as <hi>Moses</hi> prayed that he might. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall or figuratiue arguments proue nothing, as this is, for God needs no bookes. 2. <hi>Moses</hi> wisheth not simply, but conditionally, If it might be, If Gods glory and his peoples good might thereby be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conditio ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil ponit in esse.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Suppositions are no positions.</hi> 3. The Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe denies, that <hi>Moses</hi> or any Elect could be blotted out, saying, <hi>Not thee, but him that sinneth against me,</hi> that is, lets sinne raigne in him. 4. There is a two-fold booke, a two-fold writing, and a two-fold blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. First, there is a Booke of Gods eternall Decree of Election; in which Booke of life who euer are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, they are neuer blotted out: for <hi>the foundation of God abideth sure, and hath his seale,</hi> 2. Tim. 2.19. This Booke is sealed. And if a man say, <hi>Quod scripsi, scripsi, What I haue written,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>August. in Psalm.</hi> 69.</note> 
               <hi>I haue written,</hi> Ioh. 19.22. <hi>Num De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us quenquam scribit &amp; delet,</hi> saith <hi>Augustine? Doth God write any man in his Booke, and blot him out againe?</hi> Secondly, there is a booke of the execution of that Decree, which lies in earth, as that in heauen, the Church-booke, wherein men are actually enrolled into the company of the Church, and receiued into Gods Couenant &amp; Family, by professing the Word and Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Now such as are written in this Book, are written in, in the iudgement of charity, not of certainty. True members are indeed written, the hypocrite on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the opinion of himselfe and others. And this is the two-fold writing, one true, the other imaginary. <hi>Augustine</hi> on Psalme 69. expresseth it excellently,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:18777:235"/>
thus: <hi>Dicuntur scripti, quia sic putant &amp; putantur: nec sic accipere debemus, &amp;c. sed hoc dictum est secundum spem ipsorum, qui ibi se scriptos putabant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So also there is a twofold blotting; 1. Out of the Church, when their hypocrisie is discouered, and they thrust out of the company of the faithfull, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom they were written and numbred.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Delentur, cum decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur ibi non esse,</hi> August.</note> 2. Out of the other Booke in heauen, when they are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and manifested neuer to haue been written there.</p>
            <p>Now the argument is weake, Because some are blotted out of the booke of the Church, therefore some out of the Booke of Election: and, because some are declared neuer to haue been written in the Booke of Life; therefore those that are indeed writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten there, may fall away.</p>
            <p>Rom. 14.15. We reade of <hi>some destroyed, for whom Christ died:</hi> therefore members of Christ may fall away, and perish. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. By <hi>destroying</hi> is meant, not a casting off the foundation, but a scandalizing of our brother in indifferent things, (of which, the Apostle there treateth) whereby we destroy so farre as is in vs, and plucke him from Christ: but if hee be a true Beleeuer, the mighty hand of God vpholds him, perhaps not from falling, but from falling away. 2. Christ is said to dye for a man two wayes, 1. Improperly and generally, for the whole visible Church, for whom his death is sufficient: 2. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, truly, and specially for the faithfull and Elect, to whom it is effectually applyed in the vertue and merit of it. Many of the former may bee destroyed, none of the latter. 3. Members of Christ are so
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:18777:236"/>
two wayes: 1. In the iudgement of charity, and of the Church, all outward members of the Church are to be reputed, redeemed, and iustified, till by their Apostasie they declare themselues hypocrites; for whom Christ neuer dyed: 2. In the iudgement of certainty he dyed not for all, and euery one. Now the weaknesse of the argument appeares euidently, That because some fall away, for whom Christs death is sufficient, therefore they may, to whom it is effectuall; or because some, who in the iudgement of charity onely are redeemed, fall away; therefore such as are certainly redeemed by his death, may.</p>
            <p>2. Pet. 1.9. We reade of one who <hi>was washed, but forgets he was purged from his old sinnes. Answ.</hi> There is a twofold washing: One outward, by the water of Baptisme, by externall profession, and outward reformation, as <hi>Simon Magus:</hi> The other inward, true and reall, by the blood of Christ, applyed by the Spirit and faith, by meanes of the Word, and by the waters of sanctification. And accordingly there is a twofold purging, one reall and existent, the other in opinion, profession, and iudgement of ones selfe and others. The former being truly washed, cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their purgation, as the latter may. One drop of that water springeth vp to eternall life. But it is no good argument, Some professing cleannesse and purity fall away, therefore such as are cleane indeed; some washed with outward water, therefore such as are baptized with the holy Ghost and fire.</p>
            <p>Heb. 6.4. and 10.26. Some that are <hi>inlightened, and taste of the good Word of God, and are partakers of the holy Ghost, and are sanctified by the blood of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:18777:236"/>
fall away, and cannot bee renewed by repentance</hi>; Therfore Elect persons may fall away finally. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In <hi>generall:</hi> None of all these phrases implyeth true Regeneration: Besides, the Apostle speakes of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and such as sinne against the holy Ghost, not of any true Beleeuer. 2. In <hi>speciall,</hi> and to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>Some that are <hi>inlightened,</hi> fall away.] But this is of knowledge in iudgement, not in affection: of knowledge in the braine, not in the heart: of bare illumination, without thorow-renouation, or refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: of science, without conscience, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, practice. What a great measure of knowledge had <hi>Demas, Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> attained, by which they seemed to haue cleane escaped such as are wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in errour? And yet they were againe intangled in errour, the greatest errour being to know, and not to doe. Now what argument is this, It is possible for some truly inlightened, to fall away, therefore for some truly regenerate?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They taste the heauenly gift, and the good Word of God,</hi> and yet fall away.] <hi>Answ.</hi> By <hi>tasting,</hi> may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood two things: 1. An <hi>approbation</hi> in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, seeing in some measure the excellency of the gift, Ioh. 4. but this in generall, not in speciall; in others, not in himselfe, as <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Agrippa:</hi> 2. An <hi>inclination</hi> in the affection, rauished with that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, as the bad ground receiued the seed with ioy, and hearing and seeing the happinesse of the Saints, wish and desire to partake of it, if by wishing they could winne it: but deale as hard Chapmen, who see a commodity, and their owne need of it, and
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:18777:237"/>
prize, and cheapen it, but will not giue so much as it must cost them, and so goe away without it. <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> wished to dye the death, but would not liue the life of the righteous. And the young man in the Gospell was loth to sell all, and so went away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out saluation. Whereas a sound Beleeuer will sell all with the Disciples, and account all but losse or dung, with <hi>Paul,</hi> and exchange the treasures of Egypt with the Crosse of Christ, as <hi>Moses.</hi> Thus the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, onely tastes the gift, and feedeth not, but the Elect feed on the Bread of life, and drinke of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Well of life, vnto life eternall. Now this is no good argument, because some that taste, doe fall away; therfore so may he that feedeth on Christ.</p>
            <p>They that are <hi>partakers of the holy Ghost, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the blood of the Couenant,</hi> fall quite away.] Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are <hi>sanctified by the blood of the Couenant,</hi> 1. in respect of profession, not of the power of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, 2. in respect of externall communion with the members of the Church, in the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, not of inward society or sanctification, 3. in respect of the application of the blood of the Couenant, not by the Spirit, but by the meanes; but diuersly from that to the Elect: To the Beleeuer, truly, by faith, and to his saluation: To the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, in outward shew and appearance, in opinion, in the iudgement of charity onely, and to his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condemnation, 1. Cor. 11.27.</p>
            <p>They are also <hi>partakers of the holy Ghost:</hi> that is, excellent gifts of the holy Ghost: as 1. the spirit of feare, howling for sinne, and sorrow, wishing the sins had neuer been committed, as in <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi>;
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:18777:237"/>
but alwayes want the Spirit of loue; 2. Externall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in great measure, as <hi>Herod</hi> did many things, but kept one <hi>Herodias</hi>; 3. Feruent zeale for the Lord, as in <hi>Iehu,</hi> 2. King. 10.16. but, for a start, at the beginning, and for the sinnes of others, not the owne: 4. Holy motions, with which the Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires them, and often purposes and promises to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, as <hi>Saul</hi> had many.</p>
            <p>But, 1. they neuer haue any but common gifts, not the speciall gifts of faith, charity, true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, proper and peculiar to the Elect: 2. Though they haue the gifts of the sanctifying Spirit, yet not the gifts of Sanctification: 3. They neuer come to be <hi>sanctified throughout, in body, and soule, and spirit,</hi> 1. Thes. 5.23. nor to be throughly <hi>changed into the Image of God,</hi> 2. Cor. 3.18. Now this is a weake ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, Because some hauing the gifts of the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Spirit, fall quite away, therefore some also that haue the gift of sanctification.</p>
            <p>They that <hi>taste of the powers of the life to come,</hi> fall away.] This tasting also is incident to hypocrites, and standeth in two things: 1. Thoughts and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations of the life to come: 2. A powerfull work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and forcing of the heart to looke somewhat that way, and to doe something, seeking to enter. Yet they shall neuer enter, 1. Because they onely taste, not digest these meditations, to follow them home: 2. Because if they performe any thing, they doe it not purely, not for Gods glory, but themselues; not for loue of God, but selfe-loue; Gods glory and seruice shall bee subordinate to their owne bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. 3. Because they are not vpheld with patience
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:18777:238"/>
to fruition, as the Elect are.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the <hi>Phrases</hi> of Scripture, which seeme to infringe the Doctrine of the Elects perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Many moe there be, but these are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall. Now to <hi>examples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Conclusion: No examples in all the Scripture proue falling away, wholly and finally, from sauing grace. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> brings in a great number: as if what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not effect by waight of argument, hee would by a number of examples. Wee will quickly dispatch them, by reducing them to fiue heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of Angels, who fell wholly and finally from grace: Which instance is cleane out of the socket: For our question is not of Angels, but Elect men; not of the grace of Creation, but Redemption; not of <hi>Legall</hi> inherent righteousnes, but <hi>Euangelicall</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by faith in the Mediator, of which they are not capable, because Christ tooke not their seed, but mans.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, who lost all grace, thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> he was perfectly righteous; therefore much more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hose who haue grace imperfect. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This example is to no purpose, the question being of men truly iustified in Christ: as <hi>Adam</hi> in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency was not. 2. They must proue, that <hi>Adam</hi> fell from his estate of Renouation and Faith in the Messiah, or else they proue nothing. 3. That he fell from all grace of Creation: which is hard for them to prooue, and many of the learned hold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. 4. <hi>Adams</hi> grace in innocency, and ours now are farre vnlike: He had more measure of grace, but ours hath more priuiledges: He had grace whereby
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:18777:238"/>
he might haue continued if hee would: wee haue grace whereby we both can and will. So the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is vtterly naught.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of whole Churches, as Rom. 11.20. <hi>The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall branches are cut off. Answ.</hi> The Iewes were cut off in respect of the outward Couenant, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon state of that people, as any Nation may, but not in respect of Faith, if inward and effectuall. So of the Galatians, Chap. 3.1. they were <hi>cut off from Christ:</hi> this is spoken of the visible face of a Church, not of the inuisible; or, of such as had a profession onely, not faith, or not true. So in Esa. 2.22.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Most true of Rome, and the Church therein.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>The faithfull City is become an harlot:</hi> That is, the City, which was a seat of faithfull men, is corrupted with idolatry, not the faithfull in the City. Againe, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men may be corrupted, but not wholly, not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Of hypocrites, as <hi>Iudas, Demas, Saul, Simon Magus, Hymeneus,</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> who made ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke of faith and a good conscience. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. They might spare their bead-roll: for the question is of none such; for they haue no true grace to fall from. 2. These must fall from all the shadow of grace they haue: the Talent must bee taken from them. 3. Hypocrites are said to depart from the faith, not the grace of iustifying faith which they neuer had; but either the doctrine of faith, so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Iude</hi> 3. or the profession of it, or from tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary faith.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Of good and truly gracious men:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Folia abie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, radix vixit: The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oph. in Luc.</hi> 22.</note> for whom I answere thus: 1. <hi>Dauid,</hi> the act of his faith was interrupted, not the habite; the flame of faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:18777:239"/>
not, but the sparkes remained; and besides, he repented, as we see in Psal. 51. 2. Of <hi>Peter</hi> it is true which <hi>Theophylact</hi> saith, <hi>The leaues faded, the root liued.</hi> 3. For <hi>Salomon,</hi> he fell not quite away, but was saued: both because it was neuer said of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, that hee was <hi>loued of God,</hi> as of <hi>Salomon,</hi> 2. Sam. 12.24. and because he was an holy Pen-man of Scripture, and a Prophet, therefore sate in the Kingdome of God, Luk. 13.28. and because of the promise, to <hi>scourge him with the rods of men, but not take away mercy from him,</hi> 2. Sam. 7.14, 15. 4. For the prodigall sonne, who is thought quite lost, and dead after he was a sonne: 1. It is a symbolicall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: 2. He was dead and lost, that is, to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in his owne sence; and so may Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be: 3. He returned, and was receiued. 5. For <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9.3.</note> who <hi>wished himselfe cut off for his countrey-men.</hi> 1. He spake not simply, but with implicite conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if God might rather glorifie himselfe in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, than in casting off his Countrey-men: 2. He onely manifests his affection to them, but concludes not such an effect in himselfe: 3. Hee saith not, hee could be separated from Christ, but in this case hee could desire it. And whereas he saith in 1. Cor. 9.29. he indeuours and beats downe his body, <hi>lest hee be a Reprobate:</hi> I answere, 1. He speakes not positiuely, but suppositiuely: 2. <hi>Reprobate</hi> is not there opposed to Gods Election, but mans approbation: Hee would not bee reproued for not hauing his life an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to his Doctrine: 3. If it were opposed to Gods Election, yet it prooued nothing, but rather the contrary: He endeuours not to be a Reprobate,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:18777:239"/>
or not to be so manifested, therefore being an Elect Vessell, can he be cast away? No, therefore he shall not.</p>
            <p>In a word, if the faithfull bee said to fall from grace, it is <hi>lapsus,</hi> not <hi>prolapsio,</hi> a falling, but not a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away: it is from the measure, or the degree, or the sence, not the whole grace giuen; as the Pastor of the Church of Ephesus fell from his <hi>first loue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reu. 2.4.</note> not all loue. And it is inconsequent, The faithfull may fall for a time, and in part, therefore wholly and finally.</p>
            <p>Therefore we conclude, that no regenerate man can fall <hi>totus, à toto, in totum,</hi> the whole man with full consent, from all grace and goodnesse, into all euill, or any euill for altogether, to the end. So as when all is obiected against this Doctrine, that can be, <hi>true grace</hi> (we see) <hi>is blessed with continuance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> This Doctrine of perseuerance doth much hurt, to make men secure, and take liberty to sinne. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Fire can neuer make a man freeze for cold, nor the fire of grace to freeze in sinne. 2. No good man can hence purchase a licence to sinne: for, 1. to be Elect, and giuen vp to sinne, implyes a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, for we are <hi>chosen to be holy,</hi> Eph. 1.4. 2. To perseuere, is to <hi>cleaue to the Word</hi> of Christ, Ioh. 8.51. 3. As he that beleeues he may quite fall from Christ, is no true Beleeuer, no more is hee that thinkes hee cannot, and doe what he list: for faith is most indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious in the meanes. 3. Though wicked men will <hi>peruert Pauls writings,</hi> yet he must write:<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.16</note> and though they doe peruert truth to their destruction, yet wee must propound such profitable and necessary truths: for 1. This confirmeth the faith of the Elect, and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:18777:240"/>
raiseth them out of despaire, and excites them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, by leading them out of themselues, to fixe their eyes, not on the ouglinesse of their sinnes onely, euen after grace receiued, but vpon Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, Christs prayers, and power preseruing them to saluation. 2. Nothing makes the Saints more loue God, than so free and vnchangeable loue. 3. It excites them to much thankfulnesse, when being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their owne weaknesse, and Satans daily assaults, they see themselues set into so firme an estate of happinesse, as they are armed against the dread of vtter foyling or forsaking. Whence <hi>Bucer</hi> on Ioh. 6. saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nihil vtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us quàm praedicare credenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibile esse vt vnquam gratia exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, Bucer in Ioh.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>Nothing is more profitable, than to preach to Beleeuers, that it is impossible for them euer to fall from grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Let all this moue vs to the earnest desire of so permanent a condition, and so to labour for truth of grace, which onely shall continue. Content and please thy selfe with no seeming or vnsound grace, which shall leaue thee in thy greatest need. In earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things men desire such as are most durable, and lay about them for long estates, of life, or liues, or fee-simples: And why not heere, in so great necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and expectations?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let this prouoke vs to perseuerance in the state and measure of grace receiued. And hereunto let vs consider, 1. The end of Redemption, to serue the Lord in righteousnesse and holinesse <hi>all our dayes,</hi> Luk. 1.75. 2. That righteousnesse departed from, is vaine and forgotten, Ezek. 18.24. All labour, prayers, hearing, yea, all sufferings are lost, as the Galatians <hi>suffered many things in vaine,</hi> Chap. 3.4. 3. Thou
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:18777:240"/>
shalt bee iudged as thou art found when the Lord comes: the question shall not bee, what thou wast once, but what thou art. As the tree falls, so it lies: If of straight it bee growne crooked, so it shall bee iudged. 4. This makes Election sure, and is a note of the saued of the Lord, <hi>to continue to the end,</hi> Math. 24.13. Glory and immortality is the part onely of such as <hi>by continuance in well-doing seeke it,</hi> Rom. 2.7. And our Sauiour is expresse, Luk. 22.28. <hi>To you which haue continued with me in tentations, haue I appoynted a Kingdome, as my Father hath appoynted me a Kingdome.</hi> The Lord make vs vpright, that by continuing in his Word, wee may manifest our selues Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; so following our Lord with patience and perseuerance in holinesse, vntill he bring vs vnto an vn-discontinued happinesse purchased by his owne blood. <hi>Amen.</hi>
