            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE Preface to the Reader.</head>
                  <p>THis Enſuing <hi>Journal</hi> of my Travils in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> in the Service of the Goſpel of my Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, was written for my own and ſome Relations, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friends Satisfaction, as the long time it hath lain ſilent doth ſhow: But a Copy that was found amongſt the late <hi>Counteſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naway</hi>'s Papers, falling into the Hands of a Perſon that much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented that Family, he was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt with me, both by himſelf and others, to have leave to Publiſh it for a Common Good: Which upon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal, I have found a willingneſs to
<pb facs="tcp:65409:3"/>
comply with, hoping that the Lord will make the Reading of it Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to ſome into whoſe Hands it may Fall; as well thoſe who have received a Diſpenſation of the ſame Miniſtry, for Their Encouragement in their Publick Service for God, as thoſe who are under the ſame Miniſtry, unto Zeal and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For it is the Glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Day in which God is Exalting his Dear <hi>Son,</hi> as <hi>Prophet, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> in the Hearts of his People. Oh, that the Nations would hear him, their only <hi>Saving Health,</hi> and <hi>Iſraels</hi> great <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd!</hi> who takes care of his Sheep, that hear his Voice, and gives unto them that follow him, in the daily Croſs, unto Regeneration, <hi>Eternal Life:</hi> And who hath ſent, and is
<pb facs="tcp:65409:3"/>
ſending forth his Servants to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther home the Sheep that are gone aſtray in all Nations, that ſo there may be but <hi>One Shepherd</hi> and <hi>One Sheepfold,</hi> according to the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Promiſe made to theſe latter Times; In which he would be the <hi>Teacher of his People himſelf:</hi> For he is Teaching thouſands, by the Light, Spirit and Grace of his Son Chriſt, in whom he is well pleaſed. To this, God hath ſent forth his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in this Day, to turn all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as God's <hi>Call</hi> and <hi>Viſitation</hi> to the Nations: And bleſſed are all thoſe that Hearken to this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, both Mediately and Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. For God is awakening Men to the Knowledge of his Glory in the Face or Appearance of Chriſt, by his Spirit in their Hearts and
<pb facs="tcp:65409:4"/>
Conſciences, which reveal to Men the Father; yea, the deep things of God.</p>
                  <p>Oh, that they would Hear, and Fear, and Learn the things that make for their Eternal Peace! For if the Righteous ſcarcely are ſaved, where, O where, ſhall they appear that neglect ſo great <hi>Salvation!</hi> A Salvation that comes <hi>ſo neer</hi> them, as to knock at the door of their Hearts; that teaches them and trys their Reins, and tells un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them their moſt inward Thoughts; and brings a Time of Judgment o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all their Words and Works. This is Chriſt Jeſus the Light of the World, that was given of God for <hi>Salvation</hi> to the ends of the Earth. He has <hi>Enlightned</hi> all, and <hi>Shines</hi> to all, and <hi>Calls</hi> all, that
<pb facs="tcp:65409:4"/>
they ſhould ſee their Sins and be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for them, and forſake them, and take up his dayly <hi>Croſs</hi> and follow him whom God hath given for an <hi>Example</hi> as well as a <hi>Propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> for our Sins. And none can know him to be their <hi>Propitiation</hi> that rejest him as their <hi>Example</hi> and Leader in their Lives and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. Wherefore, <hi>Reader,</hi> be Serious, Inward and Inquiſitive for thy Souls Sake. What Faith haſt thou? One that over-comes the World, or one that the Spirit of the World over-comes, which is not the Faith of God's Elect, without which we cannot pleaſe God. For that Faith works <hi>by love.</hi> Such a love to God as will not affend him, but ſeeks his Glory through a moſt willing Obedience to his Holy Will.
<pb facs="tcp:65409:5"/>
Bleſſed are the Souls in which this love dwells. For ſuch have none in Heaven but God, nor in the Earth in compariſon of him: As they receive all good from him, ſo they reſign all up to him; and tho' it be through many Tribulations that they muſt attain the reſt of God, yet as nothing can ſeperate them from his love, ſo neither can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nything deprive them of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the End.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, <hi>Reader,</hi> be thou perſwaded to take thy Lot among that bleſſed Number, if thou art not yet one of them. Thou ſeeſt the way to that Divine Priviledge; walk in it; for the End Crowns all: If one of that number, that have choſen God for their Portion, be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, Zealous, and fervent in the
<pb facs="tcp:65409:5"/>
Work and Service of God. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem thy Time and Run thy Race, with care and conſtancy; <hi>looking to Jeſus the Author, that he may be the Finiſher of thy Faith.</hi> Remember who ſaid, <hi>there are many Manſions prepared</hi> for the Faithful. Do we beleive and look for another World? Let us not then live in this as if there were no other. Let our Eyes be upon our better World, and live here as Strangers that are but on our way to our Eternal Home; that ſo we may Anſwer the End of God's Love by working out the Salvation of our own Souls (by his Power) with fear and Trembling; knowing God will Judge all, by Chriſt Jeſus, according to the Deeds done in the Body.</p>

                                 <p n="7">7. And further concerning Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>order, though the Doctrine of Chriſt Jeſus requireth his People to admoniſh a Brother or Siſter twice, before they tell the Church, yet that limiteth none, ſo as that they ſhall uſe no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger forbearance before they tell the Church, but that they ſhall not leſs than twice admoniſh their Brother or Siſter before they tell the Church; and it is deſired of all, that before they publickly complain, they ſo wait in the Power of God to feel if there is no more required of them to their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Siſter, before they expoſe him or her to the Church. Let this be weightily conſidered.</p>
                                 <p n="8">8. And farther, when the Church is told, and the party admoniſht by the Church again and again, and he or ſhe remain ſtill unſenſible or unrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,

let not final Judgment go forth againſt him or her, till every one of the Meeting hath cleared his or her Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that if any thing be inſiſted upon any farther to viſit ſuch a Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, they may clear themſelves, if poſſibly the party may he reacht and ſaved, and after all clear of the Blood of ſuch an one. Let the Judgments of Friends in the Power of God go forth againſt him or her, as moved for the Lord's Honour and Glory's Sake, that no reproach may come or reſt upon God's Holy Name, Truth and People.</p>
                                 <p n="9">9. As much as poſſible can be, let all Difference be ended by ſome honeſt Friends, and trouble not the Monthly or Quarterly Meetings with them; and if that will not doe, proceed to your particular Monthly Meetings; but if they be not there ended neither, then take aſide ſix honeſt Friends out of the Quarterly Meeting, and let them hear and determine the matter; and in caſe any Perſon or Perſons be ſo obſtinate as that they refuſe the Senſe and Love of Friends, and will not comply with

them, then to proceed towards them according to the way of Truth in ſuch Caſes.</p>
                                 <p n="10">10. That all ſuch as behold their Brother or Siſter in a Tranſgreſſion, go not in a Rough, Light, or upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit to reprove or admoniſh him or her, but in the Power of the Lord and Spirit of the Lamb; in the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Love of the Truth which ſuffereth thereby to admoniſh ſuch an Offender, ſo may the Soul of ſuch a Brother or Siſter be ſeaſonably and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually reach'd unto, and overcome, and have cauſe to bleſs the Name of the Lord on their behalf, and ſo a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing may be rewarded into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the Faithful and tender Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Siſter that ſo admoniſheth.</p>
                                 <p n="11">11. And be it known unto all, we caſt out none from among us; for if they go from the Light, and Spirit, and Power, in which our Unity is, they caſt out themſelves; and it has been our way to admoniſh them, that they may come to the Spirit and Light of God which they are gone from,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65409:12"/>
and ſo come into the Unity again. Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <p n="12">12. That no Condemnation is to go farther than the Tranſgreſſion is known, and if he or ſhe return and give forth a Condemnation againſt him or her ſelf, (which is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable than that we ſhould do it) this is a Teſtimony of his or her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Reſurrection before God, his People and the whole World.

                                 <p n="13">13. That no Teſtimony by way of Condemnation be given forth againſt any Man or Woman (whatever crime they commit) before Admonition, and till ſuch time as they have had Goſpel-order according to Chriſt's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                                 <p n="14">
                                    <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65409:13"/>14. And if any Brother or Siſter hear any Report of any Brother or Siſter, let him or her go to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and know the Truth of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and if true, let the thing be judged; if falſe, go thou to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter, and let him or her be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if any ſhould report it at a ſecond or third hand, without going to the party of whom the Report go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, let ſuch be brought to Judgment, for thou ſhalt neither raiſe nor ſuffer a falſe Report to lie upon my People, ſaith the Lord, for they are to be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he is Holy, and Juſt as he is Juſt.</p>
                                 <p n="15">15. And if any Controverſie, or Weakneſs ſhould appear in either Mens or Womens Meeting, let it not be told out of your Meetings, becauſe ſuch Speeches tend to the defaming of ſuch Perſons and Meetings, and to the Hurt of the common Unity, and Breach of the Heavenly Society and Previlege.</p>

                                    </note> in which the ſound of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, Goſpel, Teſtament and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant went forth, and the Meeting ended with a ſweet and weighty Senſe; that Evening we had a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect meeting of Friends than the day before, in which the Nature of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the practice of Friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it, and other things were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weightily and cloſely diſcourſed; the Reſolutions were theſe following.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. A Scruple concerning the Law of the Magiſtrate about Marriage, being propoſed and diſcourſed of in the fear of God among Friends in a Select Meeting, it was the univerſal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animous ſenſe of Friends, that joining in Marriage is the work of the <hi>Lord only,</hi> and not of Prieſt or Magiſtrate; For 'tis God's Ordinance and not Man's, and therefore Friends cannot conſent that they ſhould join them together; for we Marry none; 'tis the Lord's Work and we are but Witneſſes.</p>
                                 <p n="2">
                                    <pb n="16" facs="tcp:65409:14"/>2. But yet if a Friend through ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs have a deſire that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhould know it before the Marriage be concluded, they may pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the ſame, after the thing hath by Friends been found clear, and after the Marriage is performed in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Meeting of Friends and others, according to the Holy Order and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Friends in Truth throughout the World, (the manner of the holy Men and Women of old) to go and carry a Copy of the Certificate to the Magiſtrate, they are left to their freedom herein, that if they pleaſe they may Regiſter it. But for Prieſts or Magiſtrates to marry, or join any in that Relation, it's not according to Scripture; and our Teſtimony and Practice have been alwaies againſt it. It was God's work before the Fall, and it's God's work only in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. If any Friend have it upon him to reprint any Book already Printed and approved either in <hi>England</hi> or here, they may do it upon their own Charges.</p>
                                 <p n="4">
                                    <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65409:14"/>4. It is alſo agreed that the care of reading and approving Books be laid upon ſome of every Meeting, to the end no Book may be Publiſht but in the Unity, yet any other faithful Friends not ſo Nominated, are not thereby excluded, though in all theſe caſes it is deſired, that all would avoid unneceſſary Diſputes about words, which profit not, but keep in the love that Edifieth.</p>
                                 <p n="5">5. It is farther concluded that the general Stock of the Quarterly Meeting be not diſpoſed of, but by the conſent of the Quarterly Meeting; but if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt times there ſhould be a preſſing neceſſity concerning the Publick, let that monthly Meeting, where it ſhall fall out, lay down the Money, and give in an Account at the next Quarterly Meeting in Order to their Relief, if it appear that they are thereby over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; and let all things be done without Favour, Affection, Relation, or any reſpect to Perſons, even for the Lord's Sake and his bleſſed Everlaſting Truth, that God may bleſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper

his People. And let all things be written down, both as to your monthly and quarterly meeting Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, what you Receive, what you Disburſe, that all may be fair and clear to the ſatisfaction of all that deſire to ſee and Examine the Books. And the Lord's Fear and Life and Power was over all, in which the Lord God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his for ever.</p>

                  <p>I was moved to Viſit this Man and his Company ſix years ago, and did ſee him and his two great Diſciples, but they would not ſuffer me to ſee the People which I laboured for; I in that day ſaw the airineſs and unſtableneſs of the Man's Spirit, and that a Sect-maſter was his Name, and it was upon me both by Word of Mouth and Writing

to let them know, that the Enemy would prevail againſt them to draw them into inconvenient things, if they came not to be ſtay'd in the Light of Jeſus Chriſt, and to know the Holy Silence, and that at laſt they would come to fall out one with another and moulder away; which is in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure come to paſs as I fear'd; for I clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceived, that though they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome Divine Touches, a danger there was they would run out with them, and ſpend them like Prodigals, not knowing then where to ſtay their Minds for daily Bread; yea though they were ſomething Angelical and like to the Celeſtial Bodies, yet if they kept not their Station, they would prove fallen Stars; they moved not in the motion of him that had vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited them, but were fill'd with groſs Mixtures, and thereby brought forth mixt Births: That is to ſay, things not Natural but Monſtrous.

in them, and in this Caſe was the Counteſs commendable, in that ſhe left all to have joined with a People, that had a pretence at leaſt to more Spirituality and Self-denial than was found in the National Religion ſhe was bred up in; for God had reacht her as ſhe told me about Nine Years ago, and that by an extraordinary way.

                  <p>Now about a Year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince, <hi>R.B.</hi> and <hi>B.F.</hi> took that City in the way from <hi>Frederickſtadt</hi> to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and gave them a Viſit, in which they informed them ſomewhat of Friends Principles, and recommended the Teſtimony of Truth to them, as both a nearer and more certain thing than the utmoſt of <hi>De Labadie</hi>'s Doctrine. They left tender and loving.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65409:24"/>Soon after this <hi>Getrueydt Dircks</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Hendricks</hi> from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> viſited them, and obtained a Meeting with them, improving that little, way God by his Providence had made more cloſely to preſs the Teſtimony, and though they, eſpecially the Counteſs, made ſome Objections, in relation to the Ordinances and certain Practices of Friends, yet ſhe ſeemed to receive at that time ſatisfaction from them. Theſe Viſits have occaſioned a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence by way of Letter betwixt them and ſeveral of us, wherein the Miſtery of Truth hath been more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened to their Underſtandings, and they have been brought nearer into a waiting Frame by thoſe Heavenly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections they have frequently receiv'd by way of Epiſtles from ſeveral of us.</p>
                  <p>This Digreſſion from the preſent Hiſtory, I thought not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſary or unpleaſing.</p>
                  <p>But to Return, being arrived at that City, part of which is under her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, we gave her to underſtand it, deſiring to know what time next
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65409:24"/>
day would be moſt proper for us to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit her. She ſent us word, ſhe was glad that we were come, and ſhould be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive us the next Morning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Seventh Hour.<note place="margin">10th./20th. 6 Month.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next morning being come (which was the ſixth day of the week) we went about the time ſhe had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed us, and found both her and the Counteſs ready to receive us, which they did with a more than ordinary Expreſſion of Kindneſs. I can truly ſay it, and that in God's fear, I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deeply and reverently affected with the Senſe that was upon my Spirit, of the great and notable day of the Lord, and the breakings in of his Eternal Power upon all Nations, and of the raiſing of the ſlain Witneſs to judge the World, who is the Treaſure of Life and Peace, of Wiſdom and Glory to all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him in the Hour of his Judgments and abide with him. The Senſe of this deep and ſure Foundation which God is laying, as the Hope of Eternal Life and Glory for all to Build upon, fill'd my Soul with an Holy Teſtimony
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65409:25"/>
to them, which in a living Senſe was followed by my Brethren, and ſo the Meeting ended about the Eleventh Hour.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſs intreated us to ſtay and Dine with her, but with due regard both to our Teſtimony and to her at that time we refuſed it; deſiring if ſhe pleaſed another opportunity that day, which ſhe with all chearfulneſs yielded to; She her ſelf appointing the Second Hour. So we went to our Quarters, and ſome time after we had Dined we returned. The Meeting ſoon began, there were ſeveral preſent beſides the Princeſs and Counteſs; it was at this Meeting that the Lord in a more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner began to appear, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Word ſhewed it ſelf a Hammer at this day, yea ſharper than a two edged Sword dividing aſunder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soul and the Spirit, the Joints and the Marrow; yea this day was all Fleſh Humbled before the Lord; it amazed one, ſtruck another, broke another, yea, the noble Arm of the Lord was truly awakened, and the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65409:25"/>
weight and work thereof bowed and tendered us alſo after an unuſual and extraordinary manner, that the Lord might work an Heavenly Sign before them and among them, that the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of him that is riſen among the poor <hi>Quakers</hi> might in ſome meaſure be known unto them, what God it is we ſerve, and what Power it is we wait for and bow before, yea they had a Senſe and Diſcovery that day what would become of the Glory of all Fleſh, when God ſhall enter into Judgment. Well, let my right hand forget its Cunning, and my Tongue cleave to the roof of my Mouth, when I ſhall forget the loving kindneſs of the Lord, and the ſure Mercies of our God to us his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Servants that day. O Lord, ſend forth thy Light and thy Truth, that all Nations may behold thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Thus continued the Meeting till about the Seventh Hour, which done, with Hearts and Souls filled with Holy Thanksgivings to the Lord for his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Mercy and Goodneſs to us, we departed to our Lodging; deſiring to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65409:26"/>
know whether our coming the next day might not be uneaſie or unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her with reſpect to the Affairs of her Government, it being the laſt day of the Week, when we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſhe was moſt frequently atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Addreſſes from her Peopl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The next Morning (being the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day) we were there betwixt Eight and Nine, where <hi>R.B.</hi> falling into ſome diſcourſe with the Princeſs, the Counteſs took hold of the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and Whiſpered me to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw to get a Meeting for the more inferiour Servants of the Houſe, who would have been Baſhful to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves before the Princeſs; and bleſſed be the Lord, he was not wanting to us, but the ſame bleſſed Power that had appeared to Viſit them of High, appeared alſo to Viſit them of Low Degree, and we were all ſweetly tender'd and broken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65409:26"/>
for Vertue went forth of Jeſus that Day, and the Life of our God was ſhed abroad amongſt us as a ſweet ſavour, for which their Souls bowed before the Lord, and confeſs'd to our Teſtimony, which did not a little pleaſe that Noble Young Woman, to find her own report of us, and her great care of them ſo effectually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Oh, what ſhall we ſay, is there any God like our God? Who is glorious in Holineſs, fearful in Praiſes, working Wonders! To his Eternal Name, Power and Arm be the Glory for Ever.</p>
                  <p>The Meeting done, the Princeſs came to us expreſſing much Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we had that good opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with her Servants, telling us ſhe much deſired they ſhould have a true and right Character of us, and that therefore ſhe choſe to with-draw, that they might have freer acceſs, and that it might look like their own Act, on Words to that Purpoſe. The Twelfth Hour being come we returned to our Inn, letting them underſtand, we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65409:27"/>
(the Lord willing) to Viſit them ſome time that Afternoon.</p>
                  <p>I muſt not here forget, that we found at our Inn the firſt Night at Supper, a Young Merchant of a ſweet and ingenious Temper, belonging to the City of <hi>Bremen,</hi> who took occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from that Night's Diſcourſe, the ſixth day at Dinner and Supper, and the Seventh day alſo, to ſeek all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of conference with us, and (as we have reaſon to be believe) he ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Twenty Four Hours in that City on our Account. We opened to him the Teſtimony of Truth; I know not that in any one thing he contradicted us. At laſt he plainly diſcovered himſelf unto us to be a Follower of a certain Miniſter in <hi>Bremen,</hi> that is even by his Fellow-miniſters and Proteſtants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with the Name of <hi>Quaker,</hi> becauſe of his ſingular ſharpneſs againſt the formal lifeleſs Miniſters and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the World. We laid faſt hold upon this, and askt him, in caſe any of us ſhould Viſit that City, if he would give us the opportunity of a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65409:27"/>
Meeting at his Houſe? which he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted us: So we gave him ſome Books, recommending him to the true and bleſſed Teſtimony of Chriſt Jeſus the Light and Judge of the World, and Life of them that receive him and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, and ſo we parted.</p>
                  <p>It being now about Three in the Afternoon we went to the Princeſs's, where being come, after ſome little time, the Princeſs and Counteſs put me in Remembrance of a Promiſe I made them in one of my Letters out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> namely, that I would give them an account (at ſome convenient time) of my firſt Convincement, and of thoſe Tribulations and Conſolations which I had met withal in this way of the Kingdom, which God hath brought me to. After ſome pauſe I found my ſelf very free and prepared in the Lord's love and fear to comply with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and ſo after ſome Silence, began: But before I had half done, it was Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time, and the Princeſs would by no means let us go, we muſt Sup with her, which importunity not being well able
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65409:28"/>
to avoid, we yielded to, and ſat down &amp; her to Supper; among the reſt, preſent at theſe Opportunities, it muſt not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, that there was a Counteſs, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the Counteſs, then come in to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit her, and a <hi>French</hi> Woman of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the firſt behaving her ſelf very decently, and the laſt often deeply broken, and from a light and ſlighting Carriage towards the very Name of a <hi>Quaker,</hi> ſhe became very intimately and affectionately kind and reſpectful to us. Supper being ended, we all returned to the Princeſs's Chamber, where making us all to ſit down with her, ſhe with both the Counteſſes and the <hi>French</hi> Woman preſt from me the Continuance of my Relation, but none more than the Counteſs'<hi>s</hi> Siſter, which (tho' late) I was not unwilling to oblige them with, becauſe I knew not when the Lord would give me ſuch an opportunity, and I found them affected. It continued till about Ten at Night, yet many particulars omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, partly through forgetfulneſs, and partly for want of time; howbeit, I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65409:28"/>
muſt needs ſay, they heard me with an Earneſt and Tender Attention, and I hope and believe the Lord hath made it profitable unto them.</p>
                  <p>This done, ſome diſcourſe they had upon it, and afterwards we ſpoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Meeting for the next day, being the firſt day of the Week, and that we might have not only as many of her own Family, but as many of her Town as would willingly be there, ſhe yielded to it, and appointed the Meeting to begin at the Second Hour, ſo we parted being near the Eleventh Hour at Night.<note place="margin">12th./22th. 6 Month.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Morning we had a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among our ſelves in our Chamber, wherein the Lord refreſht us, and there was a great Travail upon our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that the Lord would ſtand by us that day and magnifie the Teſtimony of his own Truth by us, that he might have a Seed and People in that place to lift up a Standard for his Name.</p>
                  <p>At Dinner there were ſeveral Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that came by the Poſt-Waggon that day, among whom there was a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65409:29"/>
Young Man of <hi>Bremen,</hi> being a Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Duysburgh,</hi> who informed us of a ſober and ſeeking Man of great Note in that City of <hi>Duysburgh</hi>; to him we gave ſome Books. There was one more who was tender and inquiring, to whom alſo we gave ſome Books.</p>
                  <p>The Second Hour being at Hand we went to the Meeting, where were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral as well of the Town as of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; the Meeting began with a weighty Exerciſe and Travel in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that the Lord would glorifie his own Name that day, and by his own power he made way to their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and ſounded his wakening Trumpet in their Ears, that they might know that he was God, and that there is none like unto him. Oh, the day of the Lord livingly dawned upon us, and the ſearching Life of Jeſus was in the midſt of us! Oh! the word that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver faileth them that wait for it, and abide in it, opened the way and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſealed the Book of Life, yea the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Power and Life of Jeſus wrought and reacht to them, and vertue from
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65409:29"/>
him in whom dwelleth the God-head bodily, went forth, and bleſſedly diſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us his own Heavenly Life, ſweeter than the Spices with pure Frankincenſe, yea than the ſweet ſmelling Myrrh that cometh from a far Country, and as it began, ſo it was carried on, and ſo it ended; Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord, and confided in be our God for ever. Aſſoon as the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was done, the Princeſs came to me and took me by the hand (which ſhe uſually did to us all coming and going) and went to ſpeak to me of the Senſe ſhe had of that Power and Preſence of God, that was amongſt us, but was ſtopt, and turning her ſelf to the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow brake forth in an extraordinary Paſſion, crying out, I cannot Speak to you, my Heart is full, claping her Hands upon her Breaſt; it melted me into a deep and calm tenderneſs, in which I was moved to Miniſter a few words ſoftly to her, and after ſome time of Silence, ſhe recovered her ſelf, and as I was taking my leave of her, ſhe interrupted me thus, Will ye not come
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65409:30"/>
hither again? Pray call here as ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn out of <hi>Germany</hi>: I told her we were in the Hand of the Lord, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his, could not diſpoſe of our ſelves; but the Lord had taken care, that we ſhould not forget her and thoſe with her, for he had raiſed and begotten an Heavenly Concernment in our Souls for her and them, and that we loved them all with that love wherewith God had loved u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, with much more to that purpoſe. She then turned to the reſt of the Friends, and would have had us all gone down to Supper with her, but we choſe rather to be excuſed; we ſhould Eat a bit of her Bread and Drink a glaſs of her Wine if ſhe pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Chamber where we were. At laſt we prevailed with her to leave us. The Counteſs, the <hi>French</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the Counteſs's waiting Woman ſtay'd with us, and we had a very retir'd and ſeaſonable Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with them. After the Princeſs had Supt, we went all down and took our Solemn leave of her, the Counteſs, her Siſter, the <hi>French</hi> Woman, with
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65409:30"/>
the reſt of the Family, whoſe hearts were reach'd and opened by our Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; recommending unto them Holy Silence from all Will-worſhip, and the Workings, Strivings and Images of their own Mind and Spirit, that Jeſus might be felt of them in their Hearts, his holy Teachings witneſſed, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the way of his Bleſſed Croſs that would crucifie them unto the World, and the World unto them; that their Faith, Hope and Joy might ſtand in Chriſts in them the Heavenly Prophet, Shepherd and Biſhop, whoſe voice all that are truly Sheep will hear and follow, and not the voice of any ſtranger whatever. So we left them in the Love and Peace of God, praying that they might be kept from the Evil of this World. So we returned to our Lodging, having our Hearts filled with a weighty Senſe of the Lord's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with us in that place, and being late (towards the Ninth Hour) we prepared to go to Reſt.<note place="margin">13th./23th. 6 Month.</note>

The Lord moved me to call upon his great Name, that he would be with them that ſtayed, and with them that returned alſo, and with us that went forward in wild and untrodden places, and his bleſſed Love and Life over-ſhadowed us, yea he filled our Cup together, and made us drink into one Spirit, even the Cup of Bleſſings in the Fellowſhip of the everlaſting Seed, in which we took leave of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and after having Eaten, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Seventh Hour, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the City.</p>
                  <p>We came to <hi>Paderborn</hi> that Night, ſix <hi>German</hi> Miles,<note place="margin">Pader<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne.</note> which are about thirty ſix <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it is a dark Popiſh Town, and under the Government of

a Biſhop of that Religion; howbeit, the Woman where we lodged was an Ancient, Grave and Serious Perſon, to whom we declared the Teſtimony of the Light, ſhewing her the difference betwixt an outſide and an inſide Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which ſhe received with much kindneſs.

                  <p>There was alſo with us at Supper a <hi>Lutheran</hi> that was a Lawyer, with whom I had very good Service in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to him the great loſs of the power of Godlineſs, as well among them who ſeparated from <hi>Rome,</hi> as in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: which he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: I directed him to the Principle of Light in his Conſcience, that let him ſee the lifeleſs State of the falſe Chriſtians; and if he turned his mind to that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and waited there for Power, he would receive Power to Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern himſelf according to true Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that it was the loſs of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> that they went from this Principle, in which the Power ſtandeth, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth the Soul into the Image and

                  <p>Upon the Sixth day of the ſame week about Noon,<note place="margin">17th./27th. 6 Month.</note> we ſet out towards <hi>Franckfort,</hi> having left ſeveral Books behind us, which hath been our Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in our Journey.</p>

The perſons
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65409:33"/>
that reſorted thither were generally People of conſiderable Note, both of <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and we can ſay, they received us with gladneſs of Heart, and embraced our Teſtimony with a broken and reverent Spirit, thanking God for our coming amongſt them, and praying that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper this work in our Hands; this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged our hearts to make ſome longer ſtay in this City.</p>

                     <note place="margin">21ſt./31ſt. 6 Month.</note>We therefore deſired another Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the next day, which they cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſented to, where ſeveral came that were not with us the day before, and the Lord that ſent us into the Land was with us, and by his Power reached to them, inſomuch that they confeſſed to the Truth of our Teſtimony. Of theſe Perſons there were two Women, one a Virgin, the other a Widow, both Noble of Birth, who had a deep Senſe of that power and preſence of God that accompanied our Teſtimony, and their hearts yearned ſtrongly towards us;<note place="margin">22/1 6 Mon.</note> the Virgin giving us a particular invitation to her Houſe the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65409:33"/>
where we had the moſt bleſſed Opportunity of the three, for the Lord's power ſo eminently appeared, that not only thoſe that had been with us before were moſt effectually reacht, but a certain Student reſiding in the Houſe of a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Miniſter (ſent for by that Young Woman) was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to pieces, and magnified that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed power which appeared. Alſo there accidentally came in a Doctor of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> who unexpectedly was affected, and confeſſed to the Truth, praying God to proſper us.

                  </p>
                  <p>But there is one thing more not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be mentioned. Among ſome of thoſe that have Inclinations after God, a fearful Spirit together with the ſhame of the Croſs hath entred, againſt which our Teſtimony in part ſtriking, we took Notice it was as Life to theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Women, for that was it as they told us, which had long oppreſt them, and obſtructed the work of the Lord amongſt them. Therefore ſaid the Young Virginour, Quarters are free for

No, the Lord hath taken us up: Were we ever in Priſon, and he viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us not? hungry, and he fed us not? naked, and he clothed us not? or have we been ſick, and he came not to ſee us? When were the Jails ſo cloſe, that he could not come in? and the Dungeons ſo dark, that he cauſed not his Light to ſhine upon us? O nay; he hath never left us, nor forſaken us; yea, he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided richly for us; he hath brought us into the Wilderneſs, not to ſtarve us, but to try us; yet not above our
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65409:39"/>
meaſure: For he fed us with Manna from on high, with pure Honey and Water out of the Rock, and gave his good Spirit to ſuſtain us: By Night he was a Pillar of Fire to us, to comfort us; and by Day a Pillar of Cloud, to hide and ſhelter us. He was a Shadow of a mighty Rock, that followed us; and we never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Brook by the way to refreſh us. Was God good to <hi>Iſrael</hi> outward? Much more hath he abounded to his ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the proper Seed and Off-ſpring of himſelf. O the noble Deeds and valiant Acts that he hath wrought in our Day for our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance! He hath cauſed One to chaſe Ten, and Ten an Hundred, and an Hundred a Thouſand many a Time. None hath been able to ſnatch us out of his Hands, who abode in his Truth. For though the Winds have blown, and the Sea hath raged, yet hath he rebuked the Winds and the Sea for his Seed's ſake: He hath ſaid to the Winds, <hi>Be ſtill</hi>; and to the Sea, <hi>Thus far ſhalt thou come, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65409:39"/>
no further.</hi> He hath caſt up a high Way for his Ranſomed to walk in, ſo plain, that though a Fool he ſhall not err therein. This is the Light, in which all Nations of them that are ſaved muſt walk for ever.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, <hi>Friends,</hi> let us ſtay our Minds in the Light of the Lord for ever; and let the Awe, Fear and Dread of the Almighty dwell in us; and let his Holy Spirit be known to be a Covering to us, that from the Spirit of this World we may be chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept and preſerved unto God, in the holy Light and Self-denying Life of Jeſus, who hath offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf once for all, leaving us an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that we ſhould alſo follow his Steps; that as he our dear Lord and Maſter, ſo we his Servants, and Friends, and Children, might by the eternal Spirit offer up our ſelves to God in Body, in Soul and in Spirit, which are his; that we may be his Workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus unto good Works, to the Praiſe of him that hath called us; which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65409:40"/>
Calling is an high and an holy Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, by the eternal Light and Spirit in our Conſciences. O that it might for ever remain in high Eſtimation with us; and that it may be the daily Watch and Travel of us all, in the Preſence of the Holy and Living God, that hath called us, to make our great Call and Election ſure, which many have neglected to do, (who have been convinced by the bleſſed Light and Truth of Chriſt Jeſus revealed in their Hearts, and who for a time have walked among us) have been overcome by the Spirit of this World, and turned their Hands from the Plough, and deſerted the Camp of the Lord, and gone back into <hi>Egypt</hi> again, whereby the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens have blaſphemed, and the Way and People of the Lord greatly have ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, O my dear Friends and Brethren, in the Senſe of that Life and Power, that God from Heaven ſo gloriouſly hath diſpenſed among us, and by which he hath given us
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65409:40"/>
multiplied Aſſurances of his Loving-kindneſs unto us, and crowned us together with heavenly Dominion, and in which my Spirit is at this time broken before the Lord, do I moſt earneſtly entreat you to watch continually, leſt any of you, that have taſted of the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come, fall by Temptation; and by Careleſneſs and Neglect tempt the living God to withdraw his fatherly Viſitation from any of you; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to deſert ſuch: for the Lord our God is a jealous God, and he will not give his Glory unto another. He hath given to Man all but Man himſelf, and him he hath reſerved for his own peculiar Service, to build him up a glorious Temple to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſo that we are bought with a Price, and we are not our own.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us continually watch, and ſtand in awe, that we grieve not his Holy Spirit, nor turn his Grace into Wantonneſs: But all of us let us wait, and that in a holy travail of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65409:41"/>
Spirit, to know our ſelves ſealed by the Spirit of Adoption, unto the Day of our compleat Redemption; when not only all our Sins, but all Sorrows, Sighings and Tears ſhall be wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from our Eyes; and everlaſting Songs of Joy and Thankſgivings ſhall melodiouſly fill our Hearts to God, that ſits upon the Throne, and to his bleſſed immaculate Lamb, who by his moſt precious Blood ſhall have compleatly redeemed us from the Earth, and written our Names in the Book of Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friends,</hi> The Spirit of the Lord hath often brought you into my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, ſince I have been in this deſolate Land, and with Joy unutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable have I had ſweet and precious Fellowſhip with you in the Faith of Jeſus, that overcometh the World: For, though abſent in Body, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in him that is Omnipreſent. And I can truly ſay, you are very near and very dear unto me; and the Love that God hath raiſed in my Heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, ſurpaſſes the Love of Women.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65409:41"/>
And our Teſtimony, I am well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is ſealed up together. And I am well aſſured, that all that love the <hi>Light</hi> ſhall endure to the End through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Tribulations, and in the End obtain Eternal Salvation.</p>
                  <p>And now, <hi>Friends,</hi> as I have been travelling in this dark and ſolitary Land, the great Work of the Lord in the Earth has been often preſented unto my view, and the Day of the Lord hath been deeply upon me, and my Soul and Spirit hath frequently been poſſeſſed with an holy and weighty Concern for the Glory of the Name of the Lord, and the ſpreading of his everlaſting Truth, and the Proſperity of it through all Nations, that the very Ends of the Earth may look to him, and may know Chriſt the Light to be given to them for their Salvation: And when the Senſe of theſe things hath been deeply upon me, an holy and ſtrong Cry God hath raiſed in my Soul to him, <hi>That we, who have known this fatherly Viſitation from on High,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65409:42"/>
and who have beheld the Day of the Lord, the Riſing of the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, who is full of Grace and full of Truth, and have beheld his Glory, and confeſſed it to be the Glory of the only begotten Son of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and who by Obedience to his appearance are become the Children of Light, and of the Day, and as the Firſt-Fruits to God after this long Night of Apoſtacy, might for ever walk and dwell in his holy Covenant, Chriſt Jeſus, the Light of the World; becauſe in him we have always Peace, but out of him comes all the Trouble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whilſt this heavenly Senſe reſted with me, the <hi>Lord God,</hi> that made me, and called me by his Grace unto Salvation, laid it upon me, to viſit you in an holy Exhortation. And it is the Exhortation of my Life at this time, in the earneſt and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Motion of the Power and Spirit of Jeſus, to beſeech you all, who are turned to the Light of Chriſt, that ſhineth in your Hearts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in it, That you carefully and faithfully walk in it, in the ſame
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65409:42"/>
Dread, Awe and Fear, in which you began; that that holy Poverty of Spirit, that is precious in the Eyes of the Lord, and was in the Days of your firſt Love, may dwell and reſt with you; that you may daily feel the ſame heavenly Hunger and Thirſt, the ſame Lowlineſs and Humility of Mind, the ſame Zeal and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the ſame Sincerity and Love unfeigned; that God may fill you out of his heavenly Treaſure with the Riches of Life, and crown you with holy Victory and Dominion over the God and Spirit of this World: That your <hi>Alpha</hi> may be your <hi>Omega,</hi> and your <hi>Author</hi> your <hi>Finiſher,</hi> and your <hi>firſt Love</hi> your <hi>laſt Love</hi>; that ſo none may make Shipwrack of Faith, and of a good Conſcience, nor faint by the Way. And as in this State we are kept in holy Watchfulneſs to God, as in the beginning, the Table which our heavenly Father ſpreads, and the Bleſſings with which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth us about, ſhall not become a Snare unto us, nor ſhall we turn the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65409:43"/>
                     <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercies</hi> of the Lord into Wantonneſs; but we ſhall eat and drink in an holy Fear, apparel our ſelves in Fear, buy and ſell in Fear, viſit one another in Fear; keep Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and there wait upon the Lord in Fear: yea, whatſoever we take in hand to do, it ſhall be in the holy Fear of God, and with an holy Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of his Glory, and Regard to the Proſperity of his Truth: yea, we ſhall deny our ſelves not only in the unlawful things, but in the things that are even lawful to us, for the Sake of the many Millions that are unconverted to God.</p>
                  <p>For my Friends and Brethren, God hath laid upon us (whom he hath honoured with the beginning of his great Work in the World) the Care both of this Age, and of the Ages to come; that they may walk, as they have us for Examples: yea, the Lord God hath choſen you to place his Name in you; the Lord hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted you with his Glory, that you might hold it forth to all Nations;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65409:43"/>
and that the Generations unborn may call you Bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, let none be Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the Lord, nor reward him Evil for Good; nor betray his Cauſe directly by wilful Wickedneſs, nor indirectly by Negligence and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs: But be zealous and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant for Truth on Earth; let none be ſlothful or careleſs: O remember the ſlothful Servant's State. And let the loving-kindneſs of the Lord over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come every Soul to Faithfulneſs; For with him are Riches and Honour, and every good thing: And whither ſhould any go? he hath the words of Eternal Life. O, let none looſe their Teſtimony, but hold it up for God; let thy Gift be never ſo ſmall, thy Teſtimony never ſo little. Through thy whole Converſation bear it for God; and be true to what thou art convinced of: And wait all upon the Lord, that you may grow in your heavenly Teſtimony; that Life may fill your Hearts, your Houſes, and your Meetings; that you may daily
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65409:44"/>
wait to know, and to receive Power to do the Will of God on Earth, as it is in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And O! that the Croſs of Jeſus, may be in high and honourable Eſteem with every one; that the Liberty of all may ſtand in the Croſs, which alone preſerveth: for it is the Power of God, that crucifieth us to the World, and the World to us. And through Death, way is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Life and Immortality; which by this bleſſed Croſs, the Goſpel, the Power is brought to Light: So ſhall the Seed of Life that God hath ſown in our Hearts, grow; and in that Seed ſhall we all come to be Bleſſed, unto whom God hath appointed the Dominion over us: and it is good for all to live under the Holy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; for the Ways of it are the Ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all its Paths are Peace; and all that are born of it, can ſay, <hi>Thy Scepter is a Scepter of Righteouſneſs.</hi> And O! That all Friends every where, may continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bow unto his righteous Scepter,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65409:44"/>
and keep to his holy Law, which is written in their Hearts; that it may be a Light to their Feet, and a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn to their Paths. So ſhall they come to witneſs that holy Promiſe made good unto them,<note place="margin">Iſa. 59.21.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which I have given unto him, the Seed; and the Words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I have put into his Mouth, ſhall not depart from him, nor from his Seed, nor from his Seed's Seed unto all Generations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, Friends, redeem the Time, becauſe the Days are Evil; God hath given you to ſee they are ſo: and be ye ſeparated more and more, yea, perfectly diſentangled from the Cares of this World. And be ye not cumbred with the many things; but ſtand looſe from the things that are ſeen, which are Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral.</p>
                  <p>And you that are Poor murmur not; but be Patient, and truſt in the Lord, and ſubmit to his Providence, and he will provide for you, that which is convenient for you, the Days of your appointed Time. And

you that are Rich, keep in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and ſtrive not to multiply earthly Treaſure, nor to heap up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Riches to your ſelves; but what God hath given you more than what is convenient for your own Uſe, wait for his Wiſdom, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it for his Glory; that you may be faithful Stewards of this World's Mammon; and the Lord God ſhall reward you into your Boſoms, of the Riches of that Kingdom that ſhall never have an End.</p>
                  <p>O my Friends and Brethren, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rich or Poor, in Bonds or at Liberty, in whatſoever State you are, the Salutation of the univerſal Life of Jeſus is to you.

                     </gap> have had many bleſſed Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties amongſt them, wherein our Hearts have greatly rejoiced; having been made deeply ſenſible of the Love of God towards them, and of the great openneſs and tenderneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in them to receive the Teſtimony of Light and Life through us. And we have a ſtedfaſt belief, that the Lord will carry on his Work in this Land effectually; and that he will raiſe up thoſe, that ſhall be as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of his eternal Teſtament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. And O! our deſire is, that God would put it into the Hearts of many of his faithful Witneſſes, to viſit the Inhabitants of this Country, where God hath a great Seed of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be gathered; that his Work
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65409:47"/>
may go on in the Earth, till the whole Earth be filled with his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>And it is under the deep and weighty Senſe of this approaching Work, that the Lord God hath laid it upon me, to write to you to wait for the farther pourings out of the Power and Spirit of the Lord; that nothing that is Careleſs, Sleepy, Earthly, or Exalted, may get up, whereby to diſpleaſe the Lord, and cauſe him to withdraw his ſweet and preſerving Preſence from any that know him. But let all keep the King of Righteouſneſs his Peace, and walk in the Steps of the Flocks of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions: For Withering and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhall come upon all ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Camp of the Lord, or with their murmuring Spirit diſquiet the Heritage of God; for they are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Enemies to <hi>Sion</hi>'s Glory, and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>'s Peace, than the open Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Aliens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is a Warning to all, that make mention of the Name of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65409:48"/>
Lord in this Diſpenſation he hath brought us to, That they have a care how they let out their Minds in any wiſe to pleaſe the Luſts of the Eye, the Luſts of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Life; which are not of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but of this World, leſt any be exalted in a Liberty, that maketh the Croſs of Jeſus of none effect, and the Offence thereof to ceaſe: for ſuch will become as Salt that hath loſt its Savour, and at laſt will be trod un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Feet of God and Men. For the Lord will withdraw his daily Preſence, and the Fountain will come to be ſealed up, and the Well of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be ſtopped again.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, as all would rejoice in the Joy of God's Salvation, let them wait for the ſaving Power, and dwell in it; that, knowing the Myſtery of the Work of Regeneration, Chriſt formed in them the Hope of their Glory, they may be able in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, that hath begotten them through Death to Life, to go forth and declare the Way of Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:65409:48"/>And all you, that are young, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Eternal Truth, come into it, and then you will feel the Virtue of it: And ſo, you will be Witneſſes, otherwiſe <hi>Vain Talkers, Wells without Water, Clouds without Rain; for which State is reſerved the Blackneſs of Darkneſs for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore gird up the Loins of your Minds, and be ſober, and tempt not God; but receive the Day of your Viſitation, and walk worthy of ſo great Love, and delight to retain God in your Knowledg; and grieve not his Holy Spirit, but join to it, and be led by it, that it may be an Earneſt to you of an Eternal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>And take up your daily Croſs and follow Chriſt, and not the Spirit of this World. He was meek and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he was humble and plain; he was few in Words, but mighty in Deeds: He loved not his Life unto Death, even the reproachful Death of the Croſs; but laid down his Life, and became of no Reputation, and that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65409:49"/>
for the Rebellious. <hi>O the Height, and the Depth, the Length, and the Breadth; yea, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſearchableneſs of the Love of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, while it is to Day, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his Voice, and harden not your Hearts; and make no Bargains for your Self, neither conſult with Fleſh and Blood: But let the Lord be your Light, and your Salvation; let him be the Strength of your Life, and the Length of your Days. And this know aſſuredly, that none ever truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lord, and were confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore hold up your Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for God; as ye would enjoy the Increaſings of his Life and Love: And let your Light ſhine, and confeſs him before the whole World. Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not his Appearance, neither hide thy Candle, God hath lighted in thee, under a Buſhel; for Chriſt walketh among his Candleſticks of pure and tried Gold: Wherefore ſet thy Light upon a Candleſtick, and ſhew forth thy good Converſation in Meekneſs
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65409:49"/>
and godly Fear, that thou mayeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a good Example; and others beholding thy good Works, may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God. But for the Rebellious, the Fearful, and the Unbelieving, the Day haſtens upon ſuch, that the things that belong to their Eternal Peace, ſhall be hid from their Eyes for ever.</p>
                  <p>And all you my dear Friends and Brethren, who are in Sufferings for the Teſtimony of Jeſus, and a good Conſcience; look up to Jeſus, the Author and Finiſher of your Faith; who for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Shame; and is ſat down at the Right Hand of the Father in the heavenly Place: into which, if you faint not, you ſhall all be received, after the Days of your Pilgrimage ſhall be at an End; with a <hi>Well done, good and faithful Servant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though theſe Afflictions ſeem not joyous, but grievous for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; yet a far more exceeding weight of Glory ſtands at the Door.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:65409:50"/>Wherefore count it all Joy, you fall into theſe Trials, and perſevere to the End; knowing that he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry, and that his Reward is with him. Remember the Martyrs of Jeſus; that loved not their Lives to the Death for his Name's-ſake, that had called them. And Jeſus himſelf, that made a good Confeſſion before <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate</hi>; who hath conſecrated through his Blood a new and living Way for all, that come unto God by him, who is made a high Prieſt, higher than the Heavens, one that can be touched and moved; and is daily touched and moved with our Weakneſs and Infirmity; that through him we may be made ſtrong in the Lord, and more than Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors through him that hath loved us.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let it not ſeem, as if ſome ſtrange thing had happened to you, for all theſe things are for the Trial of your Faith; which is more precious than the Gold that periſheth. 'Tis the old Quarrel, Children of this
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65409:50"/>
World, againſt the Children of the Lord; thoſe that are born after the Fleſh, warring againſt thoſe that are born after the Spirit: <hi>Cain</hi> againſt <hi>Abel,</hi> the Old World againſt <hi>Noah, Sodomites</hi> againſt <hi>Lot, Hagar</hi> againſt <hi>Sarah, Iſhmael</hi> againſt <hi>Iſaac, Eſau</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Jacob, Egyptians</hi> againſt <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> the falſe Prophets againſt the true Prophets, as <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Profeſſion of the Letter of the Law againſt Chriſt, that came to fulfil the Law, and all his ſpiritual Followers and Diſciples: And all the falſe Apoſtate Chriſtians againſt the true and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Chriſtians and Martyrs of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>So, your Conflict is for the Spiritual Appearance of Chriſt Jeſus againſt thoſe that profeſs him in Words, but in Works and Converſations every day deny him; doing Deſpight to the Spirit of Grace in themſelves, and thoſe that are led by it. But though <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> ſhall gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together to lay waſte the City

                     <hi>Wherefore rejoyce, O thou little Hill of God, and clap thy Hands for Joy; for he that is Faithful and True, Juſt and Righteous, and able to deliver thee, dwells in the midſt of thee: Who will cauſe thee to grow and increaſe, till thou becomeſt a great Mountain, till thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comeſt the Praiſe of the whole Earth, and the whole Earth be filled with thy Glory.</hi>

I have this to ſay by way of holy Encouragement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you all; the Lord God Eternal that was, and is, and is to come, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for you the Glories of the laſt Days: and if ſo be, that the Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Martyrs of Jeſus in Ages paſt,

when the Church was going into the Wilderneſs, and his Witneſſes into Sackcloth, were notwithſtanding ſo Noble and Valiant for the Truth on Earth, that they loved not their Lives unto the Death, and ſuffered joyfully the Spoiling of their Goods for the Teſtimony of Jeſus, how much more ought you all to be encouraged unto Faithfulneſs, who are come to the Reſurrection of the Day, which ſhall never more be eclipſed; in which the Bride-groom is to come, to fetch you his Spouſe out of the WILDERNESS, to give you Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for Aſhes, and the Garment of Praiſe for the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> of <hi>HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINESS</hi>; who will cover you with his Spirit, and adorn you with his fine Linen, the Righteouſneſs of the Saints.

touch with fleſhly Births, or ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> by Word or Practice, to that which is not born of the Spirit: for God is not to be found of that, in your ſelves or others, that calleth him Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he hath never begotten it in them; that Latitude and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is not of God, but ſecretly grieveth his Spirit, and obſtructeth the growth of the Soul in its Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and intimate Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Lord. <hi>Without me,</hi> ſaith Jeſus, <hi>you can do nothing; and all that came before me are Thieves and Robbers:</hi> If ſo, O what are they that Pray, Preach and Sing without Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and follow not him in thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but even in them crucify him?

                                 <p>IT would ſeem ſtrange that I, both a Stranger and a Subject, ſhould uſe this freedom of Addreſs to a Prince, were he not one whoſe Actions ſhew him to be of a free Diſpoſition and eaſy Acceſs to all; would to God all Princes were of that mind: But I have not choſen this way of Application, I am dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to it by the diſappointment thy abſence from this Court gave me, and the neceſſity I am under to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite my Return. And though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo fully, and conſequently not ſo clearly, expreſs by Letter the Grounds inducing me to attempt this Viſit; yet this being all the way that is left me, I ſhall declare them as well as I can.</p>
                                 <p>In the firſt place I do, with all ſincere and Chriſtian reſpect, acknowledg and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65409:58"/>
commend that Indulgence thou giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to all People profeſſing Religion, diſſenting from the National Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: for it is in it ſelf a moſt <hi>Natural, Prudent</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> thing. <hi>Natural,</hi> becauſe it preſerves Nature from being made a Sacrifice to the ſavage Fury of fallible yet proud O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, out lawing Men of Parts, Arts, Induſtry and Honeſty, the grand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites of Humane Society; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them and their Families to utter Ruine for meer Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, not to Religion, but to Modes and Faſhions in Religions. <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> ſince the contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly contradicteth both the Precept and Example of Chriſt, who taught us to love Enemies, not to abuſe our Friends, and triumph in the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our harmleſs Neighbours. He rebuked his Diſciples, when they called for Fire from Heaven upon Diſſenters, it may be Oppoſers: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly then he never intended that they ſhould kindle Fire on Earth to devour Men for Conſcience. And
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65409:58"/>
if Chriſt (to whom all Power was given) and his Apoſtles refuſed to employ Humane Force and Artifice ſo much as to conſerve themſelves, 'tis an Arrogancy every way indefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in thoſe that pretend to be their Followers, that they aſſume an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to ſupercede, controul and contradict the Precepts and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; whoſe Kingdom not being of the nature of this ambitious violent World, was not erected or maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe Weapons that are Carnal, but Spiritual and Intellectual, ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the Nature of the Soul, and mighty through God to caſt down the Strong-holds of Sin, and every vain Imagination exalted in Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the lowly meek Fear of God, that ought to have the preeminence in the Hearts of the Sons of Men. Indulgence is <hi>Prudent,</hi> in that it preſerveth Concord: No Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf, can ſtand; It encourageth Arts, Parts &amp; Induſtry, to ſhow and improve themſelves, which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65409:59"/>
indeed are the Ornaments, Strength and Wealth of a Countrey: It en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth People to tranſplant into this Land of Liberty, where the Sweat of the Brow is not made the Forfeit of the Conſcience. And, laſtly, it rendereth the Prince pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly <hi>Safe</hi> and <hi>Great. Safe,</hi> becauſe all Intereſts, for Intereſt-ſake, are bound to love and court him. <hi>Great,</hi> in that he is not govern'd or clogg'd with the Power of his Clergy, which in moſt Countries is not only a Coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Power, a kind of Duumvirate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Government, <hi>Imperium in Imperio,</hi> at leaſt an Eclipſe to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, but a Superior Power, and rideth the Prince to their Deſigns, holding the Helm of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſteering not by the Laws of Civil Freedom, but certain Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick Maxims of their own, to the Maintenance and Enlargement of their Worldly Empire in their Church: And all the Villany acted under the ſacred, peaceable and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring Name of Chriſt, his Miniſtry

and Church; though as remote from their Nature, as the Wolf from the Sheep, and the Pope from <hi>Peter.</hi>

                                 <p>The next thing I ſhould have taken the liberty to have diſcours'd, would have been this; What Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a Colony of vertuous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Families might hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from Thee, in caſe they ſhould tranſplant themſelves into this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which certainly in it ſelf is very excellent, reſpecting Taxes, Oaths, Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Further, to have repreſented the condition of ſome of our Friends, and thy own Subjects; who though they are liable to the ſame Tax as <hi>Menniſts, &amp;c.</hi> (not by part the Caſe of other Diſſenters) yet the Vaught of the Town where they live, came yeſterday to forbid all preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, which implies a ſort of Contradiction to the Indulgence given.</p>
                                 <p>And in the laſt place, for as much as all Men owe their Being to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greater than themſelves, to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65409:60"/>
which 'tis reaſonable to believe they are accomptable, from whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Rewards or Puniſhments.</p>
                                 <p>I had an earneſt deſire to have ſpoken of the Nature of Truth, Uſe, Benefit and Reward of Religion, and therein as to have diſcours'd what is Chriſtian Religion in it ſelf, (freed from thoſe unreaſonable Garbs ſome Men make it to wear, ſo juſtly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to wiſe and thinking Men) ſo to have proved the Principle and Life of the People, in ſcorn called <hi>Quakers,</hi> to have been ſutable to the true Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Holy Jeſus. But as the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars would ſwell a Letter to a Book, I ſhall take the Freedom to preſent thee upon my Return with ſome Tracts treating upon all theſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                                 <p>Prince, my Soul is filled with Love and Reſpect to thee and thy Family; I wiſh you all true and laſting Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and earneſtly deſire that you may never forget your Afflictions, and in the remembrance of them be dehorted from thoſe Luſts and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65409:60"/>
which draw the Vengeance of Heaven upon the greateſt Families on Earth, that God may look upon you with the favourable Eye of his Providence. And bleſſed is that Man, whoſe God (by profeſſion) is the Lord in reality, <hi>viz.</hi> that is ruled and governed by the Lord, and that lives in ſubjection to his Grace, that having a Divine Senſe of God in his Heart, delights to retain that Senſe and Knowledg of him, and be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating in his Noble Royal Law, that converts the Soul to God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deems Man from the ſenſual Pleaſures of this World, to the true Satisfaction of the Intellectual and Divine Life. O the meanneſs and lowneſs of their Spirits, that abandon themſelves to the Government of Senſe, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Life, thereby debaſing their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, rejecting the Divine Light, that ſhineth in their Hearts, ſaying, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die</hi>; forgetting whence they are deſcended, and not conſidering the Peace and Joy of the Vertuous!</p>

                                 <p>One thing more give me leave to recommend to thee, and that is, to be very careful of inculcating generous, free and righteous Principles into thy Son, who is like to ſucceed thee, that when thou art gone, the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Country may not ſink by contrary Practices, nor the People of divers Judgments (now thy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) be diſappointed, diſtreſſed or ruined.

                  <p>The Meeting held till the ninth Hour at Night; they conſtrained us to ſtay and eat with them, which was alſo a bleſſed Meeting to them: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we parted, we deſired a ſelect Meeting the next Morning at the ſame Place of thoſe that we felt more inwardly affected with Truth's Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and that were neareſt unto the State of a ſilent Meeting; which they joyfully aſſented to.</p>

                  <p>We recommended a ſilent Meeting unto them, that they might grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an holy Silence unto themſelves; that the Mouth that calls God <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> that is not of his own Birth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be ſtop'd, and all Images con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, that they may hear the ſoft

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65409:64"/>
That he would readily do it.</p>
                  <p>This night when we were in Bed, came the Reſident of ſeveral Princes (a ſerious and tender Man) to find us out; we had ſome diſcourſe with him, but being late, promiſed to ſee us the next Day.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning came the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Merchant, informing us,<note place="margin">7.1. 7<hi>th Month.</hi>
                     </note> that it was a buſy Time, ſeveral preparing for the Maſs or great Fair at <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>; yet ſome would come, and he deſired it might be at his Houſe in the Afternoon about Three.</p>
                  <p>In the Morning we were to viſit that Reſident, whom we met coming to ſee us; but he returned and brought us to his Houſe. We had a good Time with him, for the Man is an antient Seeker, oppreſt with the Cares of this World, and he may be truly ſaid to mourn under them: his Heart was opened to us, and he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, that he had lived to ſee us. We gave him an Account, how the Lord appeared in the Land of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and how he had dealt with us,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65409:65"/>
which was as the cool and gentle Showers upon the dry and ſcorched Deſart. About Noon we returned Home; after we had eaten, we went to the Merchant's Houſe to the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; where came four Perſons, one of which was the Presbyterian Prieſt, who preach'd in private to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of that Place, for they are no ways allowed in that City. Surely the true Day and Power of the Lord made known it ſelf to the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of them preſent; yea, they felt that we were ſuch as had been with Jeſus, and that had obtained our Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony through the Sufferings and Travels of the Croſs. They were tender: the Reſident and Merchant conducted us to our Inn, and from thence to the Boat, being about ſeven at Night. We ſet out towards the City of <hi>Duysburgh</hi> of the Calviniſt Way, belonging to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> in and near to which we had been informed there were a retired and ſeeking People.<note place="margin">1.2. 7<hi>th Month.</hi> Duysburgh</note>

                  <p>We arrived there next Day about

Noon, being the firſt Day of the Week; the firſt thing we did after we came to our Inn, was to inquire out one Dr. <hi>Maſtricht</hi> a Civilian, for whom we had a Letter to introduce us from a Merchant of <hi>Cullen:</hi> Whom quickly finding, we informed him what we came about, deſiring his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; which he readily promiſed us. The firſt thing we offered was an Acceſs to the Counteſs of <hi>Falchen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteyn</hi> and <hi>Bruch:</hi> He told us ſhe was an extraordinary Woman, one in whom we ſhould find things worthy of our Love; that he would write to her to give us an Opportunity with her; that the fitteſt time was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, in that we might find her at the Miniſter's of <hi>Mulheim,</hi> on the other ſide of the River from her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Caſtle; for that ſhe uſed to come out the firſt Day Morning, and not return till Night: That we muſt be very ſhy of making our ſelves pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, not only for our own ſakes, but for hers, who was ſeverely treated by her Father for the Sake of thoſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65409:66"/>
Inclinations that appeared in her, although her Father pretended to be of the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
                  <p>We therefore diſpatched towards <hi>Mulheim,</hi> having received his Letter, and being alſo accompanied by him about one third of the way; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſix Engliſh Miles, and on foot, we could not compaſs the Place before the Meeting was over, for it was paſt three before we could get out of <hi>Duysburgh</hi>; and following that way which led to the back-ſide of the <hi>Greaf</hi>'s Caſtle and Orchard, which was alſo a common way to the Town, (tho if we had known the Country we might have avoided it) we met with one <hi>Henry Smith,</hi> Schoolmaſter and Catechiſer of <hi>Speldorp</hi>; to whom we imparted our Buſineſs, and gave the Letter of Dr. <hi>Maſtricht</hi> of <hi>Duyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> to introduce us to the Counteſs. He told us, he had juſt left her, being come over the Water from the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but he would carry the Letter to her, and bring an Anſwer ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but notwithſtanding ſtaid near an

We anſwered,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65409:67"/>
that we were Engliſhmen come from <hi>Holland,</hi> going no further in theſe Parts than his own Town of <hi>Mulheim.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mulheim.</note> But not ſhowing him, or paying him that worldly Homage and Reſpect which was expected from us, ſome of his Gentlemen ask'd us, if we knew whom we were before? and if we did not uſe to deport our ſelves after another manner before Noble-men, and in the preſence of Princes? We anſwered, we were not conſcious to our ſelves of any Diſreſpect or unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Behaviour: one of them ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, Why don't you put off your Hats then? is it reſpect to ſtand covered in the preſence of the Soveraign of the Country? We told them it was our practice in the preſence of our Prince, who is a great King, and that we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered not our Heads to any but to the Almighty God. Upon which the <hi>Graef</hi> called us <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſaying unto us, We have no need of <hi>Quakers</hi> here; get you out of my Dominions, you ſhall not go to my Town. We told him, that we were an innocent Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

that feared God, and had good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will towards all Men; and that we had true Reſpect in our Hearts towards him, we would be glad to do him any real Good or Service; and that the Lord had made it Matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to us, not to conform our ſelves to the vain and fruitleſs Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of this World, or words to this purpoſe. However he commanded ſome of his Souldiers to ſee us out of his Territories, (to whom we alſo declared ſomewhat of the Reaſon and Intention of our coming to that Place in the Fear and Love of God) who were civil to us. We parted with much Peace and Comfort in our Hearts; and as we paſſed through the Village where the Schoolmaſter dwelt, (yet in the Dominions of the <hi>Graef</hi>) we called upon him, and in the ſenſe of God's Power and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom open'd to him the Meſſage and Teſtimony of Truth, which the Man received with a weighty and ſerious Spirit. For under the Dominion of the <hi>Graef</hi> there is a large Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65409:68"/>
of Proteſtants called <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> of a more religious, inward and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous frame of Spirit, than any Body of People we met with or heard of in <hi>Germany.</hi> After we had ended our Teſtimony to him, we took our leave, deſiring him not to fear, but to be of good Courage, for the Day of the Lord was haſtning upon all the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Iniquity; and to them that feared his Name, wherever ſcattered throughout the Earth, he would cauſe the Sun of Righteouſneſs to ariſe and viſit them, with Healing under his Wings; and to remember us with true Love and Kindneſs to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, Daughter to this <hi>Greaf,</hi> and to deſire her not to be offended in us, nor to be diſmayed at the Diſpleaſure of her Father, but eye the Lord that hath viſited her Soul with his holy Light, by which ſhe ſeeth the Vanity of this World, and in ſome meaſure the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptineſs and deadneſs of the Religions that are in it; and he would preſerve her from the Power of the Wrath of Men, that worketh not the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs

of God: So we left the Peace of Jeſus with him, and walked on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Duysburgh,</hi> being about ſix Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Miles from thence, and near the eight Hour at Night. The Lord was with us, and comforted our Hearts as we walked (without any outward Guide) through a tedious and ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wood (about three Miles long) with the Joy of his Salvation, giving us to remember, and to ſpeak one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another of his bleſſed Witneſſes in the Days paſt, who wandred up and down like poor Pilgrims and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers on the Earth, their Eye being to a City in the Heavens, whoſe Builder and Maker is God. Betwixt nine and ten, we reached the Walls of <hi>Duyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>; but the Gates were ſhut, and there being no Houſes without the Walls, we laid us down together in a Field, receiving both natural and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Refreſhment, bleſſed be the Lord.<note place="margin">2.3. 7<hi>th Month.</hi>

Zeal towards God, my ſelf having from my Childhood been both a Seeker after the Lord, and a great Sufferer for that Cauſe from Parents, Relations, Companions, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of this World: the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance whereof hath ſo much the more endeared thy Condition unto me; and my Soul hath often in the ſweet Senſe and Feeling of the holy Preſence of God, and the precious Life of his dear Son in my Heart, with great tenderneſs implored his Divine Aſſiſtance unto thee, that thou mayſt both be illuminated to do, and made willing to ſuffer for his Name's ſake, that the Spirit of God and of Glory may reſt upon thy Soul. And truly I can ſay, I felt the good Will of God, his holy Care and heavenly Viſitations of Love to extend unto thee. But one thing more eſpecially lay upon my Spirit to have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto thee, which made me the more preſſing for an Opportunity to ſpeak with thee, and that was this;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65409:70"/>
That thou ſhouldeſt have a true, right and diſtinct Knowledg of thy own State, and what that is which hath viſited thee, and in what thy Faith, Patience, Hope and Salvation ſtand; where to wait, and how to find the Lord, and diſtinguiſh between that which is born of God, and that which is not; both with reſpect to thy ſelf in all the Motions and Conceptions of thy Heart, and with reſpect to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their Religious Worſhips and Performances, to the end that thou mayeſt not be deceived about the things relating to God's Kingdom, and thy Eternal Peace; this is of greateſt weight.

Thus God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to <hi>give him,</hi> viz. <hi>for a Light to lighten the Gentiles, and for his Salvation to the ends of the Earth.</hi> So that Chriſt the Light is God's Gift, and eternal Life is hid in him; yea, all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Wiſdom and Knowledg, who is the Light of the Goſpel-Temple, true Believers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. And all that receive this Light into their Hearts, and bring their Deed to it, to ſee in what ground they are wrought, whether in God or in the evil One, and make this Bleſſed Light the Guide of their Life, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a holy Fear to do any thing that this Light manifeſts to be evil, waiting and watching with a godly Care to be preſerved blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs before the Lord: I ſay, all ſuch become Children of Light, and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Life of Jeſus.

Now was all the Glory of the World as a Bubble; yea, nothing was dear to me that I might win Chriſt: for the Love, Friendſhip and Pleaſure of this World was a Burden unto my Soul. And in this ſeeking-ſtate I was directed to the Teſtimony of Jeſus in my own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as the true ſhining Light, giving me to diſcern the Thoughts
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65409:72"/>
and Intents of my own Heart; and no fooner was I turned unto it, but I found it to be that which from my Childhood had viſited me, though I diſtinctly knew it not: and when I received it in the Love of it, it ſhewed me all that ever I did, and reproved all the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> judging me as a Man in the Fleſh, and laying Judgment to the Line, and Righteouſneſs to the Plummet in me: And as by the brightneſs of his coming into my Soul, he diſcovered the Man of Sin there upon his Throne, ſo by the Breath of his Mouth, which is the two-edged Sword of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he deſtroyeth his Power and Kingdom; and having made me a Witneſs of that Death of the Croſs, he hath alſo made me Witneſs of his Reſurrection. So that in good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my Soul can now ſay, I am ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in the Spirit; and though the State of Condemnation unto Death was glorious, yet Juſtification unto Life was and is more glorious. In
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65409:72"/>
this ſtate of the new Man all is new; behold new Heavens and a new Earth, old things come to be done away, the old Man with his Deeds put off. Now new Thoughts, new Deſires, new Affections, new Love, new Friendſhip, new Society, new Kindred, new Faith, even that which overcometh this World through many Tribulations; and new Hope, even that living Hope that is founded upon true Experience, which holds out all Storms, and can ſee to the Glory that is inviſible (to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eyes) in the midſt of the greateſt Tempeſt. Now 'tis the ſame bleſſed Seed of Light, Life and Grace, that from God the Father is ſown in thy Heart, and hath moved and wrought there that Change which thou haſt witneſſed from the Spirit of this World: turn to it, watch in it, that by it thou mayeſt be kept from all that it diſcovers to be contrary to God; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from thy ſelf, from thy own runnings, willings and ſtrivings: for whatſoever is not born of the Spirit
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65409:73"/>
is Fleſh, and that inherits not the Kingdom of God; and all that ſow to it, ſhall inherit Corruption. By this thou wilt come to feel, not only all Sin to be a Burden, but all thy own Righteouſneſs, yea, all Man's Righteouſneſs to be a Burden. Thou wilt ſee the difference betwixt the Duties and Prayers which thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteſt, and the Duties and Prayers which in thy true ſilence from all ſelf-activity of Mind the Lord begets in thee. O that thou mighteſt know the Myſtery of the new Birth, and what that is that can truly call God <hi>Father,</hi> even that that is begotten of him, which liveth and breatheth, and hath its Beginning and Being in that Life which is hid with Chriſt in God, and by which it hath been quickened to the Knowledg and Worſhip of Chriſt and God; and this thou ſhalt not fail to know and enjoy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as thou patiently ſuffereſt the Lord to work his own Work in thee by his own bleſſed Spirit. And that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65409:73"/>
which will give thee to ſavour and diſcern the right Motions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, Duties and Performances in thy ſelf, from the falſe, will give thee to ſavour and diſcern that which is right in others, from that which is falſe; that which is of God, from that which is of Man. Have a Care of gathering of Sticks, and kindling a Fire of thy own, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing thy ſelf about the Sparks of the Fire which thou haſt kindled; for the end of this State is to lie down in Sorrow, becauſe the heavenly Fire is abſent, which maketh the Sacrifice acceptable; yea, the Lord may ſtir in thy Heart, and thou mayeſt bring forth: but he that gives to conceive, he brings to the Birth, and he giveth Power to bring forth, for without Chriſt we can do nothing; and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that ſtir not before the Angel moveth the Waters, and go not before Chriſt, but are led by him, and that awaken not their Beloved till he pleaſe, in whoſe Hand the

                                 <p>My dear Friend, weigh theſe Things with a ſerious, retired, ſweet and tender frame of Spirit; and the God that hath called me and thee, by the Light of his dear Son, open thy Underſtanding to perceive the Truth as it is in Jeſus, and what is the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Fellowſhip of the Saints in Light.

(but more eſpecially unto thoſe in whom he hath begotten an holy hunger and thirſt after him) ſaluteth thee: and amongſt thoſe of that place where thou liveſt, the remembrance of thee, with thy companions, is moſt particulary and eminently at this time brought before me; and the ſenſe of your open-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſimplicity and ſincere love to the teſtimony of Jeſus, that by us was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto you, hath deeply engaged my heart towards you, and often raiſed in my ſoul heavenly breathings to the God of my life, that he would keep you in the daily ſenſe of that divine life, which then affected you; for this know, it was the life in your ſelves that ſo ſweetly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited you by the Miniſtry of life through us. Wherefore love the Divine Life and Light in your ſelves; be retired and ſtill; let that holy ſeed move in all heavenly things before you move; for no one receiveth any thing (that truly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth) but what he receiveth from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; thus ſaid</hi> John <hi>to his Diſciples.

How at times, betwixt that and 15, the Lord viſited me; and the divine Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions he gave me of himſelf: Of my Perſecution at <hi>Oxford</hi>; how the Lord ſuſtained me in the midſt of that hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh darkneſs and debauchery; of my being baniſht the College, the bitter Uſage I underwent when I returned to my Father; whipping, beating and turning out of doors in 1662, of the Lord's dealings with me in <hi>France,</hi> and in the time of the great Plague in <hi>London:</hi> In fine, the deep ſenſe he gave me of the Vanity of this World, of the Irreligiouſneſs of the Religions of it: Then of my Mournful and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cries to him that he would ſhow me his own way of Life and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and my Reſolutions to follow him whatever Reproaches or Sufferings ſhould attend me, and that with great reverence and brokenneſs of Spirit, How after all this the glory of the world over-took me, and I was even ready to give up my ſelf unto, it, ſeeing no

ſuch thing as the Primitive Spirit and Church on the Earth, and being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to faint concerning my hope of the reſtitution of all things; and that it was at this time that the Lord viſited me with a certain ſound and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his eternal Word, through one of thoſe the World calls a <hi>Quaker.</hi> I related to them the bitter Mockings and Scornings that fell upon me, the Diſpleaſure of my Parents, the Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveneſs and Cruelty of the Prieſts, the ſtrangeneſs of all my Companions, what a Sign and Wonder they made of me; but, above all, that great Croſs of reſiſting and watching againſt my own Inward vain Affections and Thoughts.

Friends, too large to be here related. And notwithſtanding all my Sufferings and Tryals by Magiſtrates, Parents, Companions, and, above, all from the Prieſts of the falſe Religions in the World, the Lord hath preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me to this day, and hath given me an hundred fold in this World, as well as the aſſurance of Life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Informing them of the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Father to me before, and at his death, and how, through pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and long-ſuffering, all oppoſition was conquered: Then beginning my Exhortation unto them, which was on this wiſe.</p>
                  <p>That therefore ſince God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me and them a divine Senſe of him, our Eye might be to him, and not to Man, that we might come more into a ſilence of our ſelves, and a growth into that heavenly Senſe. That this was the Work of the true Miniſtry, not to keep People to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ever teaching them, but to turn them to God, the new Covenant-tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and to Chriſt the great Goſpel-teacher.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65409:97"/>
Thus, <hi>John</hi> did, and thought it no diſhonour, that they left him to go to Chriſt. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that taketh away the Sins of the World!</hi> And even <hi>John</hi>'s Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples left him to follow Chriſt: Nay, <hi>John</hi> teſtifies of himſelf, <hi>That he was to decreaſe, and Chriſt was to encreaſe.</hi> Wherefore I preſt them to have their eye to Chriſt that taketh away the Sin, that is from Heaven, heavenly; to ſee that he increaſe in them. Yea, that henceforward they ſhould know no Man after the Fleſh, no, not Chriſt himſelf. That their knowledge of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and regard and fellowſhip one with another, would ſtand in the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Son of God in them, which is God's great Prophet by whom God ſpeaketh in theſe latter days: And if their Miniſters be true Miniſters, they will count it their glory to give way to Chriſt, and that they decreaſe, and Chriſt encreaſe; that the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giveth way to him that uſeth it, the Servant to the Lord; which though it ſeemeth to detract from the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65409:98"/>
Miniſters, yet it was and is the glory of a true Miniſter, that God and Chriſt ſhould be all in all, and that his Will ſhould be fulfilled: For the day of the Lord God was come, and all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt look to him for Salvation: That all People muſt now come to keep God's great Sabbath, to reſt from meer Man, and the Spirit of Man, and all Men's thoughts, words and works; and that if they were true Believers, they were, at leaſt, entring into their reſt. I cloſely recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that to them, that they might not be of thoſe that begin in the Spirit, and end in the Fleſh; for that thoſe that ſhould do ſo, and thereby break God's Sabbath-day, ſhould be ſtoned to death by the Stone which is cut out of the Mountain without hands; yea, that ſhould fall upon them as a Milſtone and grind them to Powder. Therefore let Chriſt have his honour, let him preach and ſpeak among you, and in you, and you in him, and by him only to ſigh, groan, pray, preach, ſing, and not otherwiſe, leaſt Death
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65409:98"/>
come over you; for thereby the Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy came in, by their going before Chriſt, inſtead of Chriſt going before them. And wait in the Light and Spirit of Judgment that hath viſited you, that all may be wrought out that is not born of God, ſo will you come to be born of the incorruptible Seed of the Word of God that liveth and abideth for ever. That you may be a holy Pri<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And turning my ſelf towards the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merdikes,</hi> with a ſerious and tender Spirit I thus expreſt my ſelf: <hi>That you ſhould be Pilgrims in the Inheritance of your Father, I have a deep and reverent ſenſe of: O that you might dwell with him for ever, and exalt him that hath ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited you, with whom are the Rewards of Eternal Bleſſedneſs!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So I left the bleſſing and peace of Jeſus among them, departing in the love and peace of God; and I muſt needs ſay, they were beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65409:99"/>
tender and reſpectfull to us; all of them coming with us but the ancient <hi>A. M.

                  <p>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:65409:99"/>The two Paſtors and the Doctor came with us a Field's length, where we took Waggon; and the chiefeſt of them took occaſion to ask me, If the Truth roſe not firſt amongſt a poor, illiterate and ſimple ſort of people; I told him yes, that was our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and that we owed it not to the Learning of this World: Then, ſaid he, let not the Learning of this World be uſed to defend that which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God hath brought forth; for Scholars now coming among you, will be apt to mix School-learning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt your ſimpler and purer Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and thereby obſcure the brightneſs of the Teſtimony: I told him it was good for us all to have a care of our own Spirits, Words and Works, confeſſing what he ſaid had weight in it; telling him, it was our care to write and ſpeak according to the divine Senſe, and no humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>

of his bleſſed Preſence that was with us! O let my Soul truſt in the Lord, and confide in him for ever; O let me dwell and abide with him that is faithfull and true, and bleſſed for ever-more! So in a very ſober and ſerious manner we parted, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the 12th. hour at noon: This night about ten we got to <hi>Lippenhuſen,</hi>

that is God's Decree, ſo may the Souls that are deceived come by the right Door into the heavenly Unity.

filled their hearts, and not the troubler and accuſer of</hi> the <hi>Brethren; who hath ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an evil Eye in them, and begotten them into a diſcontented ſelf-ſeparating mind, and this Image they bear, and the pure Eye ſees it. O let none tempt the Lord! let none provoke the eye of his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie; let us all dwell in that divine ſenſe, that he hath begotten in us: Where our love as a freſh and pure ſtream will always flow to God and one another. Here all his ways are pleaſantneſs, and all his paths are peace; for where he keepeth the Houſe who is Prince of Peace, he will keep all in his heavenly peace. We are but as one Family, and therefore we have but one Lord and Maſter, we are but as one Flock, and we have but one heavenly Shepherd to hear, who goeth before us, and giveth us eternal like to follow him: And if any are offended in him or in his, it is their own fault; if faint and grow weary we are truly ſorry, if through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchfulneſs the Enemy hath enter'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten coldneſs to the Brethren, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs of embracing the opportunity by which the Unity is renewed and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65409:104"/>
ſo that what's done by the Brethren without them, is lockt upon, firſt with a ſleight eye, and then with an evil eye, which begets diſtance, and this diſtance in a time ſeparation, and ſeparation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth enmity, and this enmity death it ſelf: We are in our Spirits truly griev'd for them, however the Judgments of God muſt ſtand againſt them, and that Spirit which leadeth them, in which they gather not to God but to themſelves, and woe to them, that ſtrengthen their hands and deſpiſe counſel, they will have much to anſwer for before the Lord. I feel a ſlighting, ſcornful, laughing Spirit often flying at me with its venemous Sting, but the Seed of Life is over it, and the Lord God will deſtroy it. Wherefore Friends, in all places where the Spirit hath entrance keep ſound Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, if you will keep your Garments clean, and enter not into Diſputes and Conteſts with it, 'tis that it ſeeketh and loveth; but go on in your Teſtimony and buſineſs for the Lord, in the Lord's peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Power and Spirit, and his bleſſing and preſence of Life ſhall be with you,

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65409:107"/>
a Foſterer of all the ſtrange Religions that came through the Town: Alſo he was then actually under Proceſs, and that the People that had heard of the innocency of his cauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a prejudice againſt our Name, though it might be without cauſe; he could not at preſent confer with us, and ſaid he was ſorry for it with all his heart, but what we ſhould ſay to his Brother ſhould be the ſame as if it been ſaid to him, to whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred us, however I took hold of his Arm and ſaid, I have this Meſſage to deliver to thee, that I may diſburden my ſelf before the Lord, which was this: Mind that which hath touched thy heart, let that guide thee, do not thou order that, conſult not with Fleſh and Blood, how to maintain that cauſe, which Fleſh and Blood in thy enemies perſecuteth thee for. He anſwered, rather than I will betray that cauſe or deſert Chriſt, by Gods ſtrength they ſhall pull my fleſh of my bones: So he left us in his houſe, and truely we had a good time with his

Companion the other Miniſter about three hours teſtifying unto him, that the day was come and coming in which the Lord would gather out of all Sects (that ſtand in the oldneſs of the Letter) into his own Holy Spirit, Life and Power, and in this the Unity of Faith and Bond of Peace ſhould ſtand, and therefore that he and all of them ſhould have an eye to the principle of God, that being turned to that, they might ſpeak from it, and that therein they would Glorifie God and be edified. So we parted leaving the man in a ſenſible and ſavoury frame. We viſited the Merchant twice and had a very good time with him, the man is of a loving and ſimple Spirit, and the Love of God opened our hearts to him often.</p>

The time being come we went to viſit her, and found her and the Counteſs ready to receive us, which they did with much love and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: I obſerved them to be much lower than ever, and that our former bleſſed opportunities had had a bleſſed effect upon them. That afternoon was imployed in the narrative of our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, which they heard with great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and refreſhment, the whole diſcourſe ended with a precious little

meeting. The houſe being clear of Strangers, they both earneſtly preſt us to ſup with them, which being not well able to decline we ſubmitted to. At Supper the Power of the Lord came upon me, and it was a true ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to us, for the hidden <hi>Manna</hi> was manifeſted amongſt us, yea a bleſſed Meeting it proved to us: O the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent tenderneſs and lowly frame of Spirit that appeared this Evening both in the Princeſs and Counteſs. The <hi>French</hi>-woman we found greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved both in her Love and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, yea, ſhe is very zealous and very broken, ſhe was always with us on theſe occaſions. After ſupper we returned to the Princeſſe's Chamber, where we ſtayed till it was about 10. at Night, at parting I deſired the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs would give us ſuch another op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity next day, being the firſt day of the Week, as we had the laſt time we were with her; ſhe anſwered me, <hi>With all my heart, But will ye not come in the Morning too?</hi> I replied, <hi>Yes wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, What time wilt thou be ready to receive us,</hi> ſhe anſwered, <hi>at</hi> 7.</p>

After the People were gone out of the Chamber, it lay upon me from the Lord to ſpeak to them two, the Princeſs and the Counteſs, with reſpect to their particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, occaſioned by theſe Words from the Counteſs; <hi>I am fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, but O my Sins are great.</hi> Whilſt I was ſpeaking, the glorious Power of the Lord wonderfully roſe, yea, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an awful manner, and had a deep entrance upon their Spirits, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Counteſſe's, that ſhe was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to pieces, God hath raiſed, and I hope fixt his own Teſtimony in them.</p>
                  <p>We returned to our Inn, and after dinner we came back to the ſecond Meeting on that day, which began about the ſecond Hour in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon:

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, the precious ſenſe of Truth was raiſed in the Meeting; There came more of the City than in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and we were much comforted in the Lord's power that was with us. For the Truth had paſſage, and the hungry were ſatisfied, and the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-hearted deeply affected: This day at both Meetings was one of the Princeſs's Women, that never was at Meeting before, and ſhe (though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhy of us the laſt time) became tender and loving to us, ſhe was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reacht. O, magnified be the Name of the Lord, whoſe preſence was with us, and whoſe arm ſtood by us. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Meeting the Princeſs preſt us to ſtay and ſup with her, pleading the quietneſs of the Family, and that they were alone; At Supper (as the night before) it was upon me to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Goodneſs of the Lord, his daily Providences, and how pretious he is in the Covenant of Light to the dear Children, and Followers of the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65409:110"/>
Light. Great was the reverence and tenderneſs that was upon the Spirits of both Princeſs and Counteſs at that inſtant. After Supper we returned to the Princeſs's Chamber, where we ſpent the reſt of our time in holy ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or diſcourſe, till about the tenth hour, and then we repaired to our Quarters.<note place="margin">7<hi>th.

                  </p>
                  <p>Next morning about eight we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Court, where the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and Counteſs were ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us. The morning was imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in very ſerious Conference, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the affairs, practice and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Friends in <hi>England,</hi> with which they ſeemed greatly affected: When about the Eleventh Hour a ratling of Coach interrupted us. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs immediately ſtept out to ſee what was the matter, and returned with a countenance ſomewhat uneaſie, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, that the young Princes, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews to the Princeſs and the Graef of <hi>Donaw,</hi> were come to viſit her; upon which I told them, we ſhould withdraw, and return to our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65409:111"/>
but intreated, that for as much as we were to depart that night with the Poſt-Waggon, we might not be diſappointed of a farewell Meeting with them; and the rather, for that I had a great burden upon my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which they readily complied with, telling me, theſe perſons would onely dine and be gone. As we went to the door, the Counteſs ſtept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and opened it for us; and as I paſt by, ſhe lookt upon me with a weighty countenance, and fetcht a deep ſigh, crying out, O the cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and entanglements of this vain World! they hinder all good; Upon which I replied, looking her ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly in the face, O come thou out of them then.</p>
                  <p>After we had dined in our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſomething being upon me to write to the Profeſſors of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I went up to my Chamber that I might be the more retired; juſt as I was about the concluſion of the Paper, cometh the Steward of the Houſe to the Princeſs, with this Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65409:111"/>
That the Princeſs intreated us to come to her, for the Graef of <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naw</hi> had a great deſire to ſee us, and to ſpeak with us; this brought a freſh Weight and Exerciſe upon us; but committing all to the Lord, and caſting our care upon him, we went.</p>
                  <p>Being arrived, the Graef approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us in <hi>French</hi>; at firſt took no great notice of our inceremonious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, but proceeded to inquire of us our ſucceſs in our Journey, and what we found anſwering our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Inclinations. Then we fell to points of Religion, and the Nature and End of true Chriſtianity, and what was the way that leadeth to the Eternal Reſt. After ſome ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate about compleat ſatisfaction in this life, we both agreed that Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, Mortification and Victory was the Duty, and ought to be the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of every ſincere Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>From this I fell to give him ſome account of my Retreat from the World, and the inducements I had thereto, and the neceſſity of an inward work,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65409:112"/>
with which he ſeemed much pleaſed. After this he fell to the Hat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This choaketh; and the rather, becauſe it telleth tales; it telleth what people are; it marketh Men for Separatiſts; it's blowing a Trumpet, and viſibly croſſing the World, and that the fear of Man (greatly prevalent with too many ſerious people in that Land) cannot abide, ſtarteth at, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth away from him; howbeit the Lord enabled me to open the thing to him, as that it was no plant of God's planting, but a weed of Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy and Apoſtacy, a carnal and earthly Honour, the effect, feeder and pleaſer of pride and of a vain mind, that no advantage redounded to mankind by it; and how could they that ought to do all to the glory of God, uſe that vain and unprofitable cuſtom, which cannot be done to the glory of God. I intreated him ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſider with himſelf the riſe and end of it, whence it came, whom it pleaſed, and what that was that was angry that it had it not? I
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65409:112"/>
alſo told him of the ſincere and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable reſpect which Truth ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in place thereof, and exhorted him to Simplicity and Poverty of Spirit, to believe that Jeſus he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be his Saviour, whoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide as well as Doctrine pleaſed not the Jews, and ſo we parted; he took his leave of the Princeſs, and then of us with great Civility.</p>
                  <p>After he was gone, the Princeſs deſired us to withdraw to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and there we began our farewell Meeting; the thing lay weighty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and that in the deep dread of the Lord: and eternally magnified be the Name of the Lord that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaddowed us with his Glory; his heavenly, breaking, diſſolving Power richly flowed amongſt us, and his miniſtring Angel of Life was in the midſt of us: Let my Soul never forget the Divine Senſe that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed all, at that bleſſed farewell I took of them much opened in me of the Hour of Chriſt's Temptation, his Watchfulneſs, Perſeverance and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65409:113"/>
Victory: about the ten Virgins, what the true Virgin was, the true Oyl and Lamp; what the Bride-groom, his Door, Chamber and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: and in concluſion, that torrent of heavenly melting Love that we were all deeply affected; I fell on my Knees, recommending them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, crying with ſtrong Cries for their Preſervation, and beſeeched the Lord's Preſence with us, and ſo ended.</p>
                  <p>After ſome pauſe, I went to the Princeſs and took her by the hand, which ſhe received and embraced with great ſigns of a weighty kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, being much broken, I ſpoke a few words apart to her, and left the Bleſſing and Peace of Jeſus with and upon her. Then I went to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, and left a particular Exhortation with her, who fervently beſeeched me to remember and implore the Lord on her behalf. From her I went to the French-woman, and bid her be faithful and conſtant to that which ſhe knew; ſhe was exceedingly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65409:113"/>
and took an affectionate and reverent Leave of us.</p>
                  <p>Then I ſpoke to the reſt, and took leave ſeverally of them; my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions did all the like. They fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us to the outward Room, and there it was upon me to ſtep to the Counteſs, and once more to ſpeak to her and take my leave of her, which ſhe received and returned with great Senſe, Humility and Love. So turning to them all, my Heart and Eye to the Lord, I prayed that the Fear, Preſence, Love and Life of God, with all heavenly Bleſſings, might deſcend and reſt with and upon them then and for ever.</p>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65409:114"/>
us made Twelve in number, which much ſtreightned us; they were often, if not always Vain, yea, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Songs, which is the faſhion of that Country, eſpecially by Night, they call them <hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>Songs,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Pſalms:</hi> We were forced often to reprove and teſtify againſt their Hypocriſy, to be full of all vain and often prophane Talk one hour, and ſing Pſalms to God the next; we ſhewed them the Deceit and Abomination of it. We paſſed through ſeveral great Towns by the way, as <hi>Lipſtad, Ham,</hi> &amp;c. many Diſcourſes we had of Truth, and the Religion and Worſhip that was truly Chriſtian, and all was very well; they bore what we ſaid. But one thing was remarkable that may not be omitted. I had not been ſix hours in the Waggon, before an heavy weight and unuſual oppreſſion fell upon me, yea, it weighed me almoſt to the Grave, that I could almoſt ſay, <hi>My Soul was ſad even unto Death</hi>; I knew not at preſent the Ground of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65409:114"/>
this Exerciſe, it remained about 24 hours upon me; then it opened in me that it was a travel for the Seed, that it might ariſe over all in them I had left behind, and that nothing might be loſt but the Son of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. O the ſtrong Cries and deep Agonies, many Tears and ſincere bowings and humblings of Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, that this holy ſenſe which was raiſed in them, might be preſerved alive in them, and they for ever in it, that they might grow and ſpread as heavenly Plants of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to the glory of the Name of the Lord.</p>

This World hath a falſe Earth and a falſe Heaven, a falſe Foundation, and a falſe Ioy; not only groſs Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but Iniquity in a Myſtery inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and outwardly. The Whore, falſe Prophet and Dragon, and all their Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring are here concerned: This is their World, that muſt be burnt with fire, that Chriſt is not of, nor his true Diſciples. O the Light of Jeſus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth it!

Wherefore labour not for the Bread that periſheth, that is the Bread of Man's inventing and making, which cometh from below, and profiteth not, becauſe it giveth not life eternal. But labour thou (my dear Friend) for the Bread that never periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that endureth for ever, and that giveth life eternal to all that feed upon it. O caſt thy care upon this Word, love it, and dwell with it, wait daily upon it, hear its Voice only and follow it, for it bringeth the Soul to the eternal Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reſt and glory. Yea, when all Fleſh wither, and the beauty thereof fade away, this Word, and they that are graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſhall abide for ever.

O give not heed to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the falſe accuſer, that ſeeketh to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that which is begotten of God in thee, neither look upon thy own Sins, Burdens, or Weakneſſes, but lift up thy head and look to Jeſus, the Author of thy bleſſed Viſitation, and wholly hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt after him, the ſpiritual brazen Serpent that healeth and reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all that in Faith and full Aſſurance look to him. Want of looking to him, hearing and obeying him, and having true faith in him, is the cauſe both of all the Preſumption and Deſpair that are at this day. He did no mighty things of old in thoſe places where they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not. O faint not, look not back, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the holy Ancients, the holy Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims of Faith, the Royal Generation of Heaven, <hi>Heb. 11.</hi> Thou believeſt in God, believe alſo in him for the Work's ſake that he has already wrought in thee:

they may be made perfect through Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings as Chriſt was.

His very office is <hi>Babyloniſh,</hi> namely, a Chaplain; for 'tis a Popiſh Invention: In the good old times, Godly <hi>Abraham</hi> that was a Prince, and <hi>Joſhua</hi> a great General, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> a King, with many more, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed their Families in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and fear of God: But now People are too Idle or too Great to pray for themſelves, and ſo they worſhip God by Proxy. How can a Miniſter of the Goſpel be at the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65409:122"/>
beck of any Mortal living, or give his Soul and Conſcience to the time and appointment of another? the thing in it ſelf is utterly wrong, and againſt the very Nature and Worſhip of the new and everlaſting Covenant. You had better meet to read the Scriptures, the Book of Martyrs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if you cannot ſit and wait in ſilence upon the Lord, till his Angel move upon your Hearts, than to uphold ſuch a formal, limited and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, Worſhip: this is not the Way out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And I have a deep ſenſe upon my Soul, that if the Young Man ſtrive beyond the talent God hath given him to anſwer his Office and fill up his Place, and wait not for the pure and living Word of God in his Heart to open his Mouth, but either ſtudieth for his Sermons or ſpeaketh his own Words, he will be utterly ruined. Wherefore, O Dear Friend, have a care thou art no Snare to him, nor he to thee: Man's Works ſmother and ſtifle the true life of Chriſt, what have you to do but
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65409:123"/>
to look to Jeſus the Author of the holy deſires that are in you, who himſelf hath viſited you, tempt not the Lord, provoke not God, what ſhould any Man Preach from, but Chriſt? and what ſhould he Preach people too, but Chriſt in them the hope of Glory? Conſider nothing feedeth, that which is born of God, but that which cometh down from God, even the Bread of God which is the Son of God, which giveth his life for the World, feel it and feed on it, let none mock God nor grieve his eternal Spirit that is come to ſeal them up from the mouth of Man that hath deceived them: that Jeſus the anointing may teach them and abide with them for ever. Be ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt and immoveable, and this will draw the Young Man near to the Lord, and empty him of himſelf and purge away mixtures, and then you will all come to the Divine Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: and when all Fleſh is ſilent before the Lord, then is it the Lord's time to Speak, and if you will hear
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65409:123"/>
your Souls ſhall live. O my Soul is in great pain, that you may be all chaſtly preſerved in that divine Senſe begotten in your Hearts by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word of God that abideth for ever, that nothing may ever be able to extinguiſh it. But more eſpecially thou, my Dear Friend, mayeſt be kept in faithfulneſs: for the Lord is come very near to thee and thou muſt begin the Work, the Lord God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth it at thy hand: if one Sheep break through the reſt will follow; wherefore watch, O watch, that thou may'ſt be ſtrengthned and confirmed, and ſtrengthen all that is begotten of God in that Family, by thy weighty, ſavoury and circumſpect life. O how is my Soul affected with thy preſent condition! it is the fervent Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of my heart, that thou may'ſt through the daily obedience of the Croſs of Jeſus, conquer and ſhine as a bright and glorious Star in the Firmament of God's eternal Kingdom: So let it be, Lord Jeſus. <hi>Amen.</hi>

This Perſon preſently conducted us to the Houſe of one who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been a Doctor in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and there left us: To this Perſon both <hi>G.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Hague.</note>The firſt thing we did there was to enquire out the Lady <hi>Overkirk</hi> a Perſon of a retired and religious Character, ſeparated from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip of that Country: She was a home, but her Huſband with her, being a great Man of the Army of another Diſpoſition and Way of Living, hindred our Acceſs at that time.</p>

                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:65409:131"/>The next Perſon we went to was a Judge at the Law of Chief Court of Juſtice in that Republick, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us with great Reſpect, and a more than ordinary deſire to know the truth of our Faith and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: We declared of the things moſt ſurely believed amongſt us in the Power and Love of God: He made his Obſervations, Objections, and Queries upon ſeveral things we ſpake, to whom we replied, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained all Mattters in queſtion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he declared himſelf ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in our Confeſſions, and his good Belief of us and our Principles: We took a ſolemn and ſenſible leave of him, and we felt the Witneſs reacht, and his Spirit tendred, which filled our hearts with dear love to him; he brought us to his Street<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door, and there we parted.</p>
                  <p>From him we went to viſit that Perſon for whom we had a Letter from the Dr. at <hi>Leyden,</hi> but he was not at home. We immediately took

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65409:134"/>
open their States and Conditions to me, and opened my Mouth to them; the ſubſtance of my Teſtimony was to this purpoſe, That Death reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes, Moſes</hi> was till the Prophets, the Prophets till <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> till Chriſt: What Chriſt's day was, how few ſee this day; and whilſt People are talking of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt under Grace, and not under the Law, Death reigneth over them, and they are not come to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> nor the ſhaking Mountain, the Thundrings, Lightnings and Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds, and what it was that led to Chriſt, and what it was to be in him, and under the Government of his Grace; directing them to the bleſſed Principle of Light and Truth and Grace, which God had ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in our hearts. I declared the nature and manner of the appearing and operating of this Principle, and appealed to their own Conſciences for the truth of what was ſaid: And I can truly ſay the holy Life
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65409:135"/>
of Jeſus was revealed amongſt us, and like Oil ſwom at the top of all: In this I was moved to kneel down and pray, great brokenneſs fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all, and that, that was before the World began, was richly manifeſted in us and amongſt us. The Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, the great Man and his Wife bleſt us, and the work of God in our hands, ſaying, with tears in his eyes, <hi>My houſe is bleſſed for your ſakes, and bleſſed be God that I ever lived to ſee you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus we left them, though with much difficulty, for they preſt us with great earneſtneſs both to eat and to lodge with them, and were hard to bear our refuſal. They ſaid it we was a Scandal to their houſe, that they ſhould let ſuch good people as were to go out of it; or ſuffer us to lodge in any other place: But we declared our pre-engagement elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and that it was not for want of true kindneſs towards them. One paſſage I had almoſt forgot to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65409:135"/>
I was (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) once at table with the Duke of <hi>Holſteyn</hi> at <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickſtadt,</hi> when the Magiſtrates came to complain againſt a people called <hi>Quakers</hi> in that City. The Duke was ready to be prejudiced againſt them, but at the very naming of them I conceived a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary kindneſs in my mind towards them. I askt the Magiſtrate what they were for a People, he told me that they would not pull off their hats to their Superiors; I askt him whether they would pull off their hats to God, he ſaid, yes; ſaid I, that may be the reaſon why they will not pull them off to Man. Do they live peaceably? Yes, Do they pay their Taxes? Yes, Do they rub their hats in your eyes? No, Do they do any harm with them? No, Why what is your Quarrel then; not they meet in ſilence, and they will ſpeak or pray unleſs they be moved by the Spirit; why, that is according to the Doctrine of Scripture: If this
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65409:136"/>
be to be a Quaker, I would I were a <hi>Quaker</hi> too, but, ſaid he, I never ſaw one before, but I bleſs God I ſee you now. He very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed againſt the falſe Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is in the World, and greatly magnified a tender, mortified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired Eſtate. I have great hopes he and his Wife will eye the truth. We returned to our Inn to ſupper, and to bed.</p>

In this eternal Love it is, that I love thee, and would be loved of thee, bleſſed are they that hold their fellowſhip in it: It is Pure, Harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, Patient, Fervent and Conſtant. In fine, it cometh from God, and leadeth all that receive it to God, indeed it is God, and they that live in God, live in Love. If we keep and abide in him that hath viſited

us, we ſhall always feel his love as a fountain, and Wonderful are the Effects of it.
