            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Remember a while ago, there was a Queſtion propoſed to the <hi>Athenian Society; <hi>Whether Books are not more proper to be given at Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, than Biſquets, Gloves, Rings,</hi>
               </hi> &amp;c. The Anſwer they returned was: <hi>That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a Book would be a far more convenient, more durable, and more valuable a Preſent, than what are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally given, as much exceeding them, as the Soul does the Body; and beſides, will much better, and more profitably preſerve the <hi>Memory of a Deceaſed Friend;</hi> if good, teaching him how to follow him; if bad, to avoid his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb facs="tcp:108243:16"/>
that they may eſcape his End; and the Truths contained therein, we ſhould think, would make a more laſting Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, even than a Sermon it ſelf, much more than a <hi>Dull Deaths-head;</hi> for having always before our Eyes, the Idea of thoſe for whom 'twas given; they'll ſtill (as it were) Preach from the Dead unto us.</hi> Thus far you have the Opinion of the <hi>Athenian Society,</hi> in this Matter. And certainly nothing can more conduce to our eternal Well-fare, and to put us in mind of Mortality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than <hi>Books of this kind;</hi> and to the end they may be more Profitable and Uſeful to Chriſtians, it were to be wiſhed that this. <hi>Mourning-Ring,</hi> which is ſo Entituled, that it might be given at Funerals, instead of <hi>Gloves, Biſquets, Wine.</hi> And thoſe that think it proper, may Print in a Sheet of Paper, the moſt Material Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, in the Life of their <hi>Dead Friend,</hi> and bind it up with thoſe <hi>Mourning-Ring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

of Mortality,</hi> (as this <hi>Mourning-Ring,</hi> ſhould be when given at Funerals) will be very decent and proper for ſuch a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Occaſion;</hi> to make the <hi>ſerious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> of our Frailty more ſtrong, was I ſuppoſe the firſt Original of <hi>Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and for this purpoſe they are ſtill Printed, that the <hi>conſideration of the Dead</hi> may further the Holyneſs and Salvation of the Living.

            <p>It was a <hi>Cuſtom</hi> in former times for <hi>Great Men</hi> to make them Sepulchres in their Gardens, to mind them of Death, in the midſt of the Pleaſures of this Life.

<pb facs="tcp:108243:18"/>
and that <hi>Princes</hi> and Great Men muſt Die; that their very <hi>Monuments</hi> are <hi>Mortal,</hi> and will in time be found as <hi>Archemedes</hi> his <hi>Tomb</hi> (by <hi>Cicero) in vepretis,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with <hi>Thorns and Briars:</hi> And that even <hi>Poor Men</hi> too, (who have no Comet, Prodigy, or Earthquake to Toll the Knell of their Departure.) But who do as it were ſteal into their ſilent Graves with no greater <hi>noiſe</hi> than can be made by a <hi>Branch of Roſemary, Sprig of Lawrel, or a Black Ribband,</hi> have Precious and Immortal Souls to ſave as well as they <hi>with the Methods and Courſes</hi> both ſhould take to get Saving Grace, and the Knowledge of Chriſt, which will prove a Poſſeſſion for them to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</p>

of the humanity of Chriſt; it appears by Chriſts <hi>weeping</hi> that he is perfect man, as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God: That <hi>Chriſt wept,</hi> is to be referred, not to his Divinity, but to his Humanity; and ſo we ſhall find that Chriſt was ſubject as to this, ſo to all <hi>natural infirmities; as hunger, thirſt wearineſs,</hi> &amp;c. which may comfort the Saints that groan under natural, as well as ſinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; and that from the reaſon why Chriſt was made in all things like unto his brethren; namely, <hi>That he might be a merciful High-prieſt, Hebr.</hi> 2. 17, 18. And though Chriſt be now in glory, yet he is touched with the feeling of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of his people here on earth, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 15. ſo touched, as that he cannot but have <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on them</hi> under all their preſſures and grievances whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Do'ſt thou then groan under natural weakneſſes <hi>and infirmities? Go boldly to the Throne of grace,</hi> and Chriſt will enable thee to bear up under theſe weakneſſes, until <hi>mortality ſhall have put on immortality.</hi>

               <p>The Subject Matter of this Chapter is <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus redivivus;</hi> it is a Relation of the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous raiſing up of <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Dead.</p>
               <p>From verſ. 1, 3. we may obſerve thus much, that a Believers intereſt in the diſtingniſhing love of Chriſt, doth not exempt him from outward Troubles or bodily Diſtempers: <hi>He whom thou loveſt is ſick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From verſ. 4. We may obſerve thus much, that the darkeſt Difpenſations of Providence, they oftentimes uſher in the brighteſt manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God to the Soul, or Gods Glory is moſt manifeſted in the Creatures Weakneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:108243:34"/>From Verſ. 6. We may take notice, it was ever in Chriſt's intention to manifeſt his Love and Goodneſs to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and yet he comes not near him for the preſent, but rather goes away and leaves him upon his ſick Bed, and ſuffers him at laſt to give up the Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>From Verſ. 14. We may obſerve, that Chriſt his abſence or the ſuſpenſion of divine Grace and Love, they are in infinite Wiſdom ordered for the further advancing of Soul Comfort. Had not <hi>Lazarus</hi> been ſick, had he not been dead and buryed, the Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs of Chriſt had never been ſo eminently diſcovered as it was towards him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> cry out, <hi>v. 21, 32. Lord, if thou hadst been here our Brother had not died;</hi> It is true, Chriſt might have recovered <hi>Lazarus</hi> upon his ſick-bed; but to fetch him out of the Grave after he had lain ſtinking four days, was a higher demonſtration of his Love, Wiſdom, and Power. There is not the like ground that Chriſt ſhould ſhew forth his miraculous Power, in raiſing up our dead Friends from the Grave, as was then; yet this ſpecial and uſeful conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may by way of Analogy, be deduced from this inſtance; namely,</p>
               <p>That ſuch Comforts and Mercies as are fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Grave, as have had a ſentence of Death paſs'd upon them, they are ever ſweeteſt, and tend moſt to Gods Glory. <hi>Iſaac</hi> had never been ſo precious to his Father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> had he not been ſo miraculouſly reſtored from dying, as he was once.</p>
               <p>But we ſhall haſten to ſee what is the cauſe of Chriſt his weeping, and what the cauſe was, you may ſee, ver. 32, 33, 34, 35, 36<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when Chriſt ſaw <hi>Mary</hi> come weeping towards him, having her
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108243:34"/>
heart running over with Grief, for the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her Brother, Chriſt groaned in Spirit, and was troubled; when they told him where <hi>dead Lazarus lay,</hi> he wept (as my Text expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.)</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Jeſus Wept.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh Men and Angels, stand and wonder</hi> to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity! When you read theſe two words, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus wept.</hi> What, doth <hi>Mary</hi>'s weeping ſet Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt a weeping? Doth <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> ſhed Tears for the Death of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and doth Chriſt his Heart even bleed within him to ſee them troubled and mourning upon the ſame account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo the word in the Greek ſeems to import, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he troubled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; his own heart ſtirred up his Affections to be troubled. Doth Chriſt weep upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of <hi>Lazarus</hi> Death? Then hence we may learn, that a moderate ſorrowing for Friends departed is lawful, tho exceſſive Sorrow is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unſuitable to a Goſpel Frame of Spirit. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> tells us, There is a <hi>time for Weeping,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, We ſhould weep as though we wept not.</p>
               <p>But to come to the thing I chiefly intend, and that is the occaſion of <hi>Chriſts weeping,</hi> which was the death of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> a good man: whence I ſhall obſerve and proſecute this Doctrine:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is a Chriſt-like temper of mind, to be deeply affected with, and to weep over the death of ſuch as are truly pious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here's <hi>Lazarus</hi> a good man in his grave, and <hi>Chriſt he weeps</hi> over him: you have a weeping Chriſt over a dead <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When old <hi>Jacob</hi> an eminent perſon was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, it's ſaid <hi>Gen. 50. 10. That they mourned with a great and ſore lamentation,</hi> and that for 7 days
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108243:35"/>
together. And ſo when <hi>Moſes</hi> died, and was buried by a ſecret hand, it's ſaid <hi>the Children of Iſrael mourned for him 30 days,</hi> Deut. 34. 8.</p>
               <p>My dearly beloved, you have loſt a <hi>Moſes,</hi> one that was valiant for God in former times, when the people of God in <hi>England</hi> were coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and he hath been an eminent lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the ſaints in their wilderneſs ſtate, and God did often take him to the top of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> and gave him there glorious viſions, and that not onely of heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but alſo of that glorious land of reſt and righteouſneſs that the Saints ſhall injoy in this world. Now that ſuch a <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould be taken off in the Wilderneſs, while the people of God are yet ſhort of this good Land, is matter of great humiliation.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe you find the ſame ſpirit in thoſe Chriſtians, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. that <hi>Paul</hi> (the great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the Gentiles) did there take his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel of, ſaying, <hi>ver. 25. And now behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdom of God, ſhall ſee my face no more.</hi> It's ſaid, 37, 38 verſes, <hi>And they all wept ſore, and fell on Pauls neck, and kiſſed him: Sorrowing moſt of all for the words which he ſpake [that they ſhould ſee his face no more.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Now by all this it appears, that it is both the duty and property of a Chriſtian (<hi>ſuch an one as hath been baptized into the ſpirit of Jeſus</hi>) to be deeply affected with, and <hi>weep</hi> over, the death of ſuch as are truly pious, eſpecially when they are eminent for uſe and ſervice to Chriſt, and his people.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now give you the reaſons why it is ſo, and cannot be otherwiſe, but that gracious
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108243:35"/>
perſons muſt needs weep over the death of good men.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe every ſtroke in this kind, puts a <hi>ſerious heart</hi> in mind of its own mortality, tells us that we are dying creatures, and that's a very ſerious conſideration to every awakened ſoul. <hi>The living, the living will lay it to heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccl. 7. 2. <hi>Alas my Brethren 'tis a ſerious thing to dye.</hi> And the ſtroke of death upon others, tells us that die we muſt, and how ſoon we know not: <hi>This Evening ſun may ſee us dead,</hi> it went out Early this morning to ſcore us out this <hi>lodging of a Tomb.</hi> And oh happy, thrice happy is that perſon that can die well. Now ſuch ſtrokes as theſe put <hi>a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſoul in mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d of dying.</hi> There's none preſent knows who may go to the <hi>grave next.</hi> That's the Firſt; but then,</p>
               <p>2. It Springs from that <hi>Sympathy</hi> that is both in nature, and grace: firſt in nature, when God takes away a husband, a Father, a Child, &amp;c. this cuts deep, and affects much. <hi>Abraham</hi> he mourns over beloved <hi>Sarah; David</hi> over <hi>Abſolon,</hi> though a rebellions ſon. To be ſtupid, and not to mind the hand of God when he ſmites our near and dear relations, doth declare, that we do not onely want grace, but natural affection; And then in <hi>Grace</hi> there is alſo a great <hi>ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:</hi> if God ſmites one member of the Church, the reſt are affected with it: If a <hi>Paul,</hi> a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:108243:36"/>3. The periſhing of good men is a <hi>juſt cauſe of weeping,</hi> and that becauſe they are a great bleſſing to the <hi>nations, cities, families, &amp;c.</hi> where they are caſt. It fares either the better, or the worſe with ſuch places for their ſake. When God deſtroyed the old world, the family of <hi>Noah</hi> was ſaved for <hi>Noahs</hi> ſake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Proſane wretches are ready to wiſh the people of God all out of the world; but alas! what would then theſe wretches do? they are beholding to the ſaints <hi>for their very beings,</hi> and for the continuance of all their mercies.</p>
               <p>When God hath but once gathered in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and done his work in <hi>Zion,</hi> he will ſoon pull the world about theſe mens ears: If the righteous be taken away, <hi>he is taken away from the evill to come, (Iſa</hi> 57. 1.) Wo to <hi>Sodom,</hi> if <hi>Lot</hi> depart; and ſo I may ſay, Wo to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if the righteous ſhould be taken away; Wo to <hi>Graffham</hi> whenever thou ceaſeſt to be a refuge to the ſaints, whenever thy gates ſhall be ſhut againſt the miniſters and people of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>The Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though they ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſpiſed the Prophets, would in time of diſtreſs come to them for Prayer, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 8, 9. and 12, 19. Yea, <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as proud, and as high as he was, yet when the Plague was upon him, <hi>Moſes</hi> he muſt be ſent for, and be entreated to pray for him, and his people.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the Reaſons of the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, ſhewing why the <hi>People of God</hi> muſt needs be affected with, and <hi>Weep</hi> over the Death of Religious Perſons.</p>

and diſcompoſed;</hi> but when he came to ſpeak of the <hi>unſearchable riches</hi> of the Grace of Chriſt, he was as an <hi>Angel of God, lifted up above him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi> he had a flood of words, and yet ſeemed to want words to expreſs what he did know, and what he did enjoy of <hi>divine grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> This being true muſt needs be great.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To loſe a pure Goſpel Preacher is a great loſs: Eternity depends upon a right underſtanding of the great Doctrine of Juſtification by Christ.</hi> Eternity depends not upon being baptized once or twice, upon this or the other Form; we may be <hi>guilty of miſtakes about the circumſtances of worſhip, and yet be happy;</hi> but if we miſtake about the great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Juſtification by Chriſt, we are loſt for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> His Death juſtly calls for <hi>Weeping,</hi> for as much as we have all loſt the Converſation of one who was <hi>an Experimental Chriſtian,</hi> one that had much communion with God, and much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his goodneſs, as you have heard him often expreſs: <hi>Many a Preacher diſhes out largely to others, of that which he taſtes but little himſelf.</hi> I am apt to think, many a faithful Miniſter of Chriſt lives but low, in compariſon to what this bleſſed Saint enjoyed. By this his Experience, he was enabled to ſpeak a word in due ſeaſon to the weary Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He walked cloſe with God in his Family;</hi> he was not a Saint abroad, and a Devil at home; but made it appear that he was really good, by this, that he was <hi>relatively good,</hi> good in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; a good Husband, a good Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſate looſe from this World;</hi> he made not gain his godlineſs; he did not deſign to make Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of Chriſt and the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>His diſcourſe was <hi>moſtly heavenly, and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al:</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:108243:38"/>
If other diſcourſe was in hand, he was but dull Company, he had little to ſay: but if the <hi>Conference were Heavenly,</hi> he was as upon the Wing, as a fiſh in the Water, and a Bird in the Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He would often ſay, with pious <hi>Dod, come, enough of the World, now let us talk of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>

And again—<hi>Bonum ſodalitium op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timum ſolatium. Good Company is the beſt ſolace:</hi> Indeed, ſuitable <hi>Society</hi> is the comfort of Life, the improvement of Parts, the joy of the Intellect, the only diſtinguiſhing Priviledge that gives the Preference to Men above Beaſts. Take away this, and what happineſs is it to be a Man, or what is humane Life any thing to be accounted of. But when Man is dead, there can be no more delight in him, or comfort received by <hi>Society</hi> with him. There is no converſe in the ſhades below, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlocution in thoſe gloomy Regions. <hi>The Grave is a ſilent Houſe,</hi> where the Eyes of all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are cloſed in the Duſt, and their Mouths filled with cold Clay.

                     </hi> to any pleaſure or ſatisfaction we received in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning with him, for we ſhall enjoy no more of it for ever. Oh! ſurely this cannot but cut deep in a generous Soul; this cannot but greatly wound a ſpirit, whoſe thoughts are drained from the droſs of <hi>Plebeian</hi> Converſation, that has any eſteem at all for the advantages of a rational Life. Upon this account it was, that the old Prophet in <hi>Bethel,</hi> lamented over the man of God which came from <hi>Judah,</hi> who was ſlain by a Lion, as he rode upon an Aſs in the High-way. He bitterly bewailed, and mourned for his Death, crying out,—<hi>Alas my Brother!</hi> As if he had ſaid, I have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly refreſhed by thy company, in hearing the Word of the Lord from thy mouth, concerning the deſtruction of the Prieſts that burn Incenſe upon the Altar, and the pulling down the Houſe of <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> Oh! <hi>How have I been strengthned in my Courage, confirmed in my Faith, and the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in the Ways of God, by this thy Prophecy. But now thou art gone, I ſhall never have any more of this profitable and ſpiritual Diſcourſe with thee.</hi> This made him weep over his torn Carcaſs, and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lament his untimely Fall, and to give a ſolemn Charge to his Sons, that when he was dead, they ſhould bury him in the Sepulchre wherein this man of God was buryed, and lay his Bones cloſe by the Bones of this Prophet.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Death</hi> parts us from a Friend, we ſhall never ſee him more: he vaniſhes (as it were) out of our ſight, and we are never more to behold him, or caſt our Eyes upon him. He is both actively and paſſively in an inviſible State. So <hi>Job</hi> mournfully ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>chap. 7. ver. 7, 8. Oh! remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

Were Man to Return, though after never ſo many Years abſence from his home, or continuance in the <hi>Grave:</hi> Were he to viſit his habitation again, and become the objective delight of his poor <hi>Mourning</hi> Friends and Relations, it might be ſome alleviation to their Grief, when he takes his journey to his <hi>Long home.</hi> But Oh! <hi>What a prick to the heart,</hi> what a ſtab to the Soul, what a deadning to the Spirits, what an inundation of Sorrow, (like the opening of <hi>Pandora</hi>'s Box) is this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thought to an ingenuous Man, that he muſt never, never, never more behold the Face of this or that Relation in this Region of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; nor have any converſe with him on this ſide the <hi>Bank of Eternity! What Husband can think ſo of his Wife, and not melt?</hi> what Wife can have ſuch a thought of her Husband, and not faint? what Parent can conſider this, with reſpect to his Child, and not mourn? what Child can reflect upon the impoſſibility of ever ſeeing his Father or Mother more, and not be overwhelmed with grief? In a word, What Friend or Relation can ponder on ſuch an <hi>eternal Farewel, as is then given, and not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into Tears.</hi> It is the opinion of Divines, That the chiefeſt of Saints happineſs, conſiſts in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or in the uſe of the viſive faculty, which will then be enlarged and made glorious to perfection; for they ſhall ſee the Face of God
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108243:41"/>
in Righteouſneſs, and be ſatisfied with his likeneſs; they ſhall be for ever with open Face, beholding (as in a Glaſs) the Glory of the Lord, and be changed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. Sure I am, the Saints greateſt comfort in this World, conſiſts in Viſion, or beholding God's Image in his People; and that not only the work of his Power in their comly Features, but the work of his Grace in the divine Characters of Wiſdom, engraven in their Souls and immediatly reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon in all their Actions. Therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but cauſe Mourning, when ſuch delightful Objects are removed out of ſight, and never more to be beheld.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much the more ſtill, if conſider the great change and alteration Death makes in the place of the Deceaſed; the great Vacuum there is, when Man is removed, and carried away to his <hi>Long home:</hi> Concerning which, <hi>Job</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſpeaks, <hi>chap. 7. v. 9, 10, 11. As the cloud is conſumed, and vaniſheth away: ſo he that goeth down to the</hi> Grave, <hi>ſhall come up no more. He ſhall return no more to his houſe, neither ſhall his place know him any more. Therefore I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſrain my Mouth, I Will ſpeak in the anguiſh of my Spirit I will complain in the bitterneſs of my Soul.</hi> Oh! It is very ſad to conſider what a great change one ſtroke of Death may make. A Wife Husbandleſs, poor Children Fatherleſs, Servants Maſterleſs, and many Friends Comfortleſs: And ſo great is the alteration in the Family, that the whole Houſe reſents it; and ſeems ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to <hi>Mourn</hi> for it. There is (as it were) a Face of ſadneſs in every place he was wont to be converſant in: <hi>Look in his Parlour,</hi> where he uſed to ſit with his Wife, and Children
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108243:42"/>
about him, and there is nothing but a profound ſilence; his voice is not to be heard: <hi>Look at his Table,</hi> where he uſed to ſit with chearfulneſs, eating his Bread with joy among his Relations, and the dull demeanor, and ſorrowful poſture of all the aſſeſſors, do plainly, yet dolefully ſpeak, Behold, he is not here: <hi>Look in his Shop,</hi> where he uſed to be about his occaſions; and the diſorder and confuſion there proclaims aloud his being gone, and not to be heard of: In a word, <hi>Look in every place</hi> where he us'd to be, and you will find one mourning circumſtance or other, a legible Hiſtorian of his departure, and being no more among them. So that, if you ſeek him, you will not find him; if you ask for him, you will hear no news. Now ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, methinks, the very miſs of a Man in his Family, the want of him in his place, the great change immediately following his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his Relations and in all his affairs and Concerns, ſhould be cauſe enough to enforce a <hi>Mourning</hi> from his Survivors, if there were no other conſideration, and cauſe 'em to prepare for their own Deaths. For,</p>
                  <p>How many have we known that were of as healthful and vigorous a Conſtitution as we are, that by a Surfeit, or an acute Feaver, have in a few days been ſnatch'd away? How many that were travelling on the ſame Road with us a while ago, are now at their long Home, lying in the Grave; and ſhould not we by their early depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>learn to die?</hi> It would not be tedious to us in this ſenſe, to live in <hi>Golgotha,</hi> or to <hi>dwell among the Tombs,</hi> when we have in them ſeen <hi>the End of all Men,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 2.

Eye; and after all the poor ſatisfaction they have given us, fall into the dead Sea. The Paſſing-Bells of others loudly tell us, that <hi>Man in his beſt Eſtate is altogether Vanity,</hi> Pſal. 39. 5. And what they have undergone, will in a few days or hours more, be our own Lot. Though they are gone before, we muſt tread in their ſteps, and go the ſame way. When that hour is come, all our Friends and Acquaintance cannot hold us; for we that now hear, and move, and ſpeak, ſhall fly away into a vaſt Expanſe, and not <hi>behold Man with the Inhabitants of this World any more,</hi> Iſa. 38. 11. As we have ſeen the pale Looks, and have heard the laſt Voice of others, ſo ſhall we our ſelves in the like manner be made Spectacles of Mortality to thoſe that remain after us. We, and all our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, muſt take a long Farewel of each other, and not meet again till the day of the general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. And is it too ſoon to remember our Creator, when we have ſeen many as Young as we are, breathe their laſt? And we that now mourn for others, know not how ſoon our Friends may do the ſame for us, and celebrate our Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.

O what ſad and perplexed thoughts have I had for you in the day times; and how many hours have I borrowed from my ſleep in the nights, to think what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you, if ye ſhould not be obedient to the Commandments of my God! To the ſame God they are beſt known. O how often upon my knees have I prayed for your happineſs; and wept, and mourned, when ye have done what ye ought not! To him is it beſt known to whom I now am going. Sometimes when ye have offended, I was enforced to correct you: but each ſtripe which ye received did cut me into the heart. In many things ye failed, becauſe ye were young: and in many
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108243:44"/>
things I failed too, becauſe I am a weak and a ſinful Woman. If at any time ye thought that I did not my Duty, take heed that hereafter ye remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it not to my diſhonour. Ponder in your minds that curſe which wretched <hi>Ham</hi> the Father of <hi>Canaan</hi> received from <hi>Noah,</hi> when he ſaw his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, and told his Brethren. <hi>Curſed</hi> (ſaid <hi>Noah) be</hi> Canaan: <hi>a ſervant of ſervants ſhall he be to his Brethren,</hi> Gen. 9. 25. But becauſe <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet, took a Garment, and laid it upon their Shoulders, and went backward, and covered the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs of their Father, and their faces were back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and they ſaw not their Fathers nakedneſs,</hi> verſ. 23.

Conſider with your ſelves that I am your mother. Whatſoever imperfections ye have diſcovered in me, do in ſome kind reflect even upon your ſelves: for as your Bodies were mine, ſo my Credit and good Name you muſt account to be yours. But I cannot think that ye will need more Advice for this, which even Nature it ſelf ſhould teach you to practiſe.</p>
                  <p>My time is but ſhort; my Speech beginneth to fail me. I will not trouble you with much, although ſomething more I muſt ſay unto you, which I hope ye will remember when I ſhall ſleep in the Duſt. Your firſt and chiefeſt Duty muſt always be for the ſervice of your God. If ye will daily obſerve the benefits which he ſendeth you, ye cannot chuſe but thank him daily for his Bleſſings. Let it be your care to ground your actions upon his written Law. Undertake nothing which is not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Word: and go forward in nothing by unlawful means, or to a bad intent. Begin all in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108243:44"/>
him, and continue in him, and end in him; and he himſelf will be your Reward. If ye always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Religion in your hearts, ye will always have quietneſs and content in your minds. Firſt make him your God, and then diſtruſt not his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; no nor his love and compaſſion while ye remain his Children. In whatſoever vocations ye ſhall lead your lives, be ſure that ye be <hi>conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably induſtrious</hi> and laborious in them; and then leave the event and the bleſſing to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I would ſain have you be his Children much more than ye are mine: for ye have nothing from me but your ſin and corruption; but from him you muſt expect both grace and glory. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye ſtrive to bleſs and magnifie your God, ye may be ſure that <hi>your God</hi> will both bleſs and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie <hi>you</hi> his <hi>Children.</hi> Remember that <hi>the bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich; and he addeth no Sorrow with it,</hi> Prov. 10. 22. Take heed therefore to <hi>your</hi> ſelves, and let him be in all <hi>your thoughts;</hi> for even for them <hi>ye</hi> muſt account at his great <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> Take heed unto <hi>your Words,</hi> that <hi>they</hi> give none offence either to <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man.</hi> There is a ſort of people who <hi>bleſs with their mouths, but they curſe in their inward parts,</hi> Pſal. 62. 4. I would not have <hi>you</hi> be of the number of them: for <hi>as they love curſing, ſo it ſhall happen unto them: they delight not in bleſſing, therefore ſhall it be far from them,</hi> Pſal 109. 17. <hi>As they cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with curſing like as with a Garment, ſo it ſhall come into their Bowels like Water, and like Oyl into their Bones,</hi> verſ. 18.

Oh preſs thy Soul hard with theſe thoughts, how it is like to go with thee, when thou firſt ſteppeſt into Eternity? What ſayeſt thou, Oh my Soul, are the things of time only or chiefly to be minded? And are the precious things of Eternity utterly to be forgotten, or

                  <p>Theſe words have Relation unto the precedent Verſes in this Chapter, wherein our Saviour Chriſt, from the thirteenth to the ſeventeenth verſe, reproveth the Covetouſneſs of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> by ſhewing unto them, that no man can ſerve two Maſters, that is, God and Riches. <hi>All theſe things heard the Phariſees, which were covetous, and they mocked him:</hi> Whereupon he aptly and fitly taketh occaſion to relate this Parable of the Rich Man and <hi>Lazarus.</hi>

                  <p>And here obſerve what one <hi>formerly Notes,</hi> viz. That if Jeſus Chriſt had ſaid only thus much, <hi>There was a certain Rich man that fared ſumptuouſly daily, and a certain Beggar laid at his Gate full of ſores:</hi> The wicked would have ſtraightway inferr'd that the rich man was the happy man, for at the firſt view it ſeems to be ſo; But take all together and you'l quickly ſee that there is no man in a worſe condition than this miſerable wretch.</p>
                  <p>(2.) That if a man would judge of perſons according to outward appearance, he ſhall very often take his mark amiſs. Here is a man to outward appearance, appears the only bleſſed man; better by half than the Beggar, in as much as he is rich, the Beggar poor: he is well clothed, but peradventure the Beggar is naked; he hath good food, but the Beggar would be glad of Dogs meat (<hi>and he deſired to be fed with the Crumbs of the Rich Man's Table,</hi>) the Rich man fares well every day, but the Beggar muſt be glad of a bit when and where he can get it. O! who would not be in the Rich man's ſtate? A wealthy man ſorts of new Suits, dainty Diſhes every day: enough to make one, who minds nothing but his belly and his back, and his luſts, to ſay, O that I were in that mans condition! Oh that I had about me, as that man hath! then I ſhould live a life indeed; then ſhould I have hearts eaſe good ſtore; then ſhould I live pleaſantly, and might ſay to my Soul, <hi>Soul, be of good chear, eat, drink, and be merry,</hi> Luke 12. 19. <hi>thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ast every thing plenty,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108243:51"/>
and art in a moſt bleſſed condition.</hi> But if the whole Parable be well conſidered, you will ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 26. 15. that that which is had in high eſtimation with men, is an abomination to God. And again, <hi>John</hi> 16. 20, 21, 22. that condition that is the ſaddeſt condition, according to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance is oft-times the moſt excellent; for the Beggar had ten thouſand times the beſt of it, though to outward appearance his ſtate was the ſaddeſt.</p>
                  <p>Methinks, to ſee how the tearing Gallants of the World will go ſtrutting up and down the Streets: Sometimes it ſtrikes me with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſurely they look upon themſelves to be the only happy men, but it is becauſe they judge according to outward appearance; they look upon themſelves to be the only bleſſed men, when the Lord knows the generality are left out of that bleſſed condition; <hi>Not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 26. Ah! did they that do now ſo brag that no body dare ſcarce look on them; but believe this, it would make them hang down their heads and cry, Oh! give me a <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s portion.</p>
                  <p>But I'll proceed to the diviſion of my Text and in this Scripture obſerve theſe following parts, (formerly taken notice of) <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>The parts of the Text are four.</head>
                     <p>1. The life of the rich man, in theſe words, <hi>There was a certain rich man, cloathed in purple and fine linnen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. The life of the Beggar, in theſe words: <hi>Alſo there was a certain Beggar, named</hi> Lazarus, <hi>which was laid at his Gate full of ſores,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:108243:52"/>3. The death of the Beggar, in theſe words; <hi>And it was ſo that the Beggar died and was carried,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>4. The death of the rich man; <hi>The rich man alſo died and was buried.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the firſt part, I note theſe three circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                     <p>1. What this Rich Man was, and whether there were any ſuch man or no.</p>
                     <p>2. What his Apparel was; not mean or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, but <hi>Purple and fine Linnen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. That his Diet was not baſe, nor homely, but delicious, and not once, nor twice, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day.</p>
                     <p>In the Life of the Beggar, I find four Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                     <p>1. Where he lived: in no Palace or Houſe, but at the Rich mans Gate.</p>
                     <p>2. How he lived: neither in Health nor Wealth, but miſerable, full of Sores.</p>
                     <p>3. That he deſired in this life, not Lordſhips, or Houſes, or Land, or Gold, or Silver, but Crumbs to ſave his Life.</p>
                     <p>4. Who ſhewed the Beggar kindneſs in his Life? Not the Rich man, but the Rich mans Dogs, <hi>The Dogs came alſo and licked his Sores.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the death of the Beggar, I note theſe three Circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>What became of his Body being dead?</hi> No men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof is made in Holy Scriptures; it may be it was Buried with little or no reſpect, becauſe he was a poor man, or elſe caſt into ſome Ditch, by reaſon of his Sores.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>What became of his Soul?</hi> It went not out to Purgatory (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>3. By whom? By Angels. <hi>It was carried by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels into</hi> Abraham'<hi>s Boſom.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:108243:52"/>In the Death of the Rich man, I note theſe two Circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>What became of his Body being dead?</hi> It was Honourably Buried becauſe of his great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>What became of his Soul?</hi> It went to Hell. <hi>He being in torments, lift up his Eyes, and ſaw</hi> Abraham <hi>afar off, and</hi> Lazarus <hi>in his Boſom.</hi>

                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Of theſe ſucceſſively.</head>
                     <p>And firſt, in the life of the Rich man, we noted what this Rich Man was, whether there was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any ſuch man or no: Wherefore here may a Queſtion ariſe, whether this be a Parable or Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory: The Writers hereof do not agree.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marlorat</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quanquam quibuſquam haec ſimplex Parabola eſſe videtur, tamen quia his Lazari nomen expri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur, rem geſtam narrari probabile;</hi> Some are of that mind, that this is a Parable, yet becauſe (ſaith he) Chriſt twice expreſſeth the name of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> it argueth, that he ſpake of a thing that was ſo done indeed.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe ſaith <hi>Franciſcus Lambertus, Credendum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis eſſe hiſtoriam &amp; exemplum verum quàm Parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam;</hi> It muſt be believed that this is rather a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and a true Example than a Parable.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Theophilactus</hi> is of a contrary opinion, who ſaith, <hi>Parabola haec est &amp; non vera historia;</hi> This is a Parable and no Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eraſmus</hi> alſo ſaith, that it is but a Parable, whereby Rich Men may learn to be merciful to their poor Brethren, that they may ſpeak for them in the day of Vengeance and Wrath.</p>
                     <p>Many Writers there are alſo, that rather aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Arguments and Obſervations herein, have not ſet down their Judgments, whether it

be a Parable or Hiſtory: Therefore it might ſeem Wiſdom in me to ſuſpend my judgment alſo herein, eſpecially, ſince <hi>Marlorat ſaith, Paru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But becauſe it is requiſite that I alſo ſhew my Opinion, I will return my Verdict, according to my Evidence: And therefore in naked truth I find and hold that it is a Parable: And my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are theſe two: Firſt, becauſe our Saviour in the beginning of this Chapter, doth relate a Parable of the Rich Man that had a Steward, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore he continueth in this Chapter to open his mouth in Parables, according to the Prophet, <hi>I will open my mouth in Parables, and ſhew dark ſentences of old time.</hi> Secondly, becauſe the Rich Man cryed out of Hell unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> anſwered the Rich man; which needs muſt be underſtood Parabolically: For the Damned in Hell cannot ſee nor hear the Saints that are in Heaven, neither by reaſon of the diſtance of place, and alſo becauſe of many Sphears and Orbs that are betwixt Heaven and Hell, neither ſhall they ſee nor know what is done there. And again, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s throat is dry, and cleaveth to the Roof of his Mouth: Therefore he cannot ſpeak ſo loud as to be heard out of Heaven into Hell. Therefore it is but a Parable.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, let us conſider what his Apparel was, Purple and fine white, as ſome will have: But we read, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, although ſome take it for fine Flax, yet let it here be underſtood of Silk. There was a very great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Apparel of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108243:53"/>
Man; <hi>John</hi>'s Rayment was Camels Hair, with a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Girdle about his Loins, which did Argue Repentance and Mortification in him; but this Rich Mans Apparel was Purple and fine Silk; whoſe outward Apparel did argue the Pride at his Heart: The outward Habit for the moſt part reſembles the inward Habit and condition of the Mind. Pride, as ſaith one, is grounded in the Heart of Man, a Vice moſt loathſom to God, hateful to Men, and hurtful to the Soul.</p>
                     <p>But let us conſider the third Circumſtance in the Life of the Rich Man, to wit, what his Dyet was, <hi>Deliciouſly every day:</hi> And here we ſee what the Children of this World delight in, namely, <hi>in fulneſs of Meat, who neglecting the ſerving of God, have given themſelves to ſerve</hi> Bacchus <hi>and</hi> Venus. Hence one noteth, <hi>A gluttonous Perſon eateth more for Pleaſure than Neceſſity:</hi> So did the Rich Man, ſo did our firſt Parents, it was not through need or neceſſity, that they did eat of the forbidden Tree, but through Wantonneſs, Pleaſure, and Idleneſs. <hi>Gluttony is a flattering Devil, and a pleaſant ſin, and a ſweet Poyſon, which whoſo uſeth, hath not the uſe of himſelf, which who ſo hath not, hath no ſin, for he is all ſin it ſelf.</hi> Beſides, it hath an eſpecial effect, for it doth, as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, generate Luſt.</p>
                     <p>To be ſhort, it was Gluttony that cauſed our Parents to tranſgreſs. It was Gluttony that cauſed <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t</hi> to commit Inceſt. It was Gluttony that made <hi>Eſau</hi> to ſell his Birth-right. It was Gluttony and Drunkenneſs that cauſed <hi>Nabal</hi>'s Death. It was Gluttony that loſt <hi>Belſhaſars</hi> Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Be not thou deſirous of dainty meats, ſaith <hi>Solomon, For he that loveth Banqueting, ſhall be Poor, and he that delighteth in Wine, ſhall not be Rich.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But let us a while leave this Rich Man, and conſider the ſecond, that which is the Life of the Beggar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:108243:54"/>
                        <hi>There was alſo a certain Beggar, named</hi> Lazarus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here obſerve theſe things: 1. That the Saints of God are a poor contemptible People. <hi>There was a certain Beggar:</hi> If you underſtand the word <hi>Beggar,</hi> to hold forth outward Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or ſcarcity in outward things, ſuch are Saints of the Lord, for they are for the moſt part a poor, deſpiſed, contemptible People; but if you Allegorize and Interpret it thus, they are ſuch as beg earneſtly for Heavenly food; this is alſo the ſpirit of the Children of God, and it may be, and is a truth in this ſenſe, though not ſo Naturally gathered from this Scripture. 2. <hi>That he was laid at his Gate full of Sores:</hi> Theſe words hold forth the Diſtempers of Believers, ſaying, <hi>he was full of Sores;</hi> which may ſignifie the many Troubles, Temptations, Perſecutions and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Body and Spirit, which they meet withal while they are in the World; And alſo the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments they find at the hands of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ones, who Live upon the Earth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaid, <hi>he was laid at his Gate full of Sores.</hi> Mark, <hi>he was laid at his Gate;</hi> not in his Houſe, that was thought too good for him, but <hi>he was laid at his Gate full of Sores:</hi> From whence Obſerve, that the Ungodly World do not deſire to entertain and receive the poor Saints of God into their Houſes; If they muſt needs be ſomewhere near unto them, yet they ſhall not come into their Houſes: <hi>Shut them out of Doors!</hi> if they will needs be near us, let them be at the Gate. <hi>And he was laid at the Gate full of Sores.</hi> 2. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the World are not at all touched with the afflictions of God's Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for all they are full of Sores, a deſpiſed, afflicted, tempted, perſecuted people, the World doth not pity; no, but rather
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108243:54"/>
labour to aggravate their Trouble by ſhutting them out of Doors, ſink or ſwim, what cares the World? they are reſolved to diſown them, they will give them no Entertaiment; if the lying in the ſtreets will do them any good, if hard Uſage will do them any good, if to be diſowned, ſhut out of Doors, rejected of the World will do them any good, they ſhall have enough of that, but otherwiſe, no Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no Comfort from the World: <hi>And he was laid at his Gate full of Sores.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Poor <hi>Lazarus!</hi> What, lying at a Gate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and full of Sores too? Would not this Rich Man afford thee ſome out-houſe to lie in, to ſhroud thee from Storms and Tempeſts? no: would not his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants pity thee? no: would not his Children ſpeak for thee? no: Would not his Wife in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat her Husband for thee? no: Hadſt thou ever done them any wrong; no: But, <hi>Lazarus,</hi> it may be thou art ſtout, and often-times Beggars will be chuſers; thou perhaps wouldeſt have ſome great Alms, or Copy-hold, ſome Farm of this Rich Man? no: Or thou wouldeſt have ſome delicate Meat? no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Many Diſhes? no: Or thou wouldeſt ſit at the Table with his Sons and Servants? no, no: What is it then that thou doſt deſire?

                     <p>What ſhall I ſay of the hardneſs of this ſcrewing Rich Mans Heart? Let me ſpeak for <hi>Lazarus</hi> unto the Rich Man; yet I ſhall but <hi>aſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ched Object lay, ſeeing him bewrayed with ſores, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tattered with Rags, and the Dogs licking him, ſtopping his Noſe, with a ſqueamiſh Face, and diſdainful look, began to ſay unto him: <hi>I ſee thou art ſome lewd Fellow, that ſuch Miſeries hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto thee, and ſuch Plagues come upon thee; it is not for thy goodneſs, or Righteouſneſs, that theſe Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons light on thee.</hi> But he reply'd, <hi>O good Maſter, ſome Comfort, good Maſter, ſome Relief; good Maſter, ſome Crumbs to ſave my Life, I ſhall die elſe, and starve at your Gate; good Maſter, I beſeech you for Gods ſake, I beſeech you for Chriſts ſake, take ſome Pity, ſome Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſome Mercy on me.</hi> But he with an Angry look, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining <hi>Lazarus,</hi> ſaid: <hi>Away hence thou Idle Rogue, not a penny, not a Morſel, not a crumb of Bread;</hi> and ſo ſtopping his Noſe from the ſcent, and his Ears from the Cry of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> returned unto his ſtately Palace: And this Poor mans Throat being dry with Crying, his Heart fainting for want of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth, being worn out with Faſtings and miſeries, ſtarved at the Rich Mans Gate. Now, muſt I ſpeak for dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> againſt this Rich Man. <hi>Nam ſi hi tacuiſſent, nonne lapides clamabunt; if I ſhould hold my peace, the very ſtones would cry. O thou Rich Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, and more than cruel wretch,</hi> Lazarus <hi>is dead,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108243:55"/>
he is dead at thy Gate, and his Blood ſhall be upon thee, thou ſhewedſt no Mercy unto him, no Mercy ſhall be ſhewed to thee, thou ſtoppedſt thy Ears unto his cry, thou ſhalt cry and not be heard. It is inhumane Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have no Compaſſion on diſtreſſed</hi> Lazarus, <hi>but most of all, to let him ſtarve at thy Gate for want of Food. What did be deſire of thee but only Crumbs to ſave his Life? Is it not a ſmall thing, I pray thee, that thou having abundance of Meat, ſhouldst ſee him ſtarve for Bread? That thou flouriſhing in Purple and Silk, would ſee</hi> Lazarus <hi>lye in Rags? That thou ſeeing even thy Dogs have pity on him, thou wouldſt have no pity upon him thy ſelf? What Eyes hadſt thou that wouldeſt not ſee his Sores? What Ears hadst thou, that wouldeſt not hear his cry? What Hands hadſt thou that would not be stretched out to give, What Heart hadſt thou that would not melt in thy Body? What Soul hadſt thou, that would not pity his ſilly Soul, this wretched Body, poor</hi> Lazarus? <hi>If the ſtones could ſpeak, they would cry, fie upon thee: If thy Dogs could ſpeak, they would condemn thee of unmercifulneſs: If dead</hi> Lazarus <hi>were here, his Sores would bleed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> afreſh before thy face, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Why ſhould not I tell thee the Portion that is prepared for thee? This ſhall be thy Portion to drink: <hi>Let thy days be few, and let another take thine Office: Let thy Children be Fatherleſs, and thy Wife a Widow: Let thy Children be Vagabonds and beg their bread, let them ſeek it alſo out of deſolate places; let the Extortioner conſume all that thou haſt and let the ſtranger ſpoil thy Labour: Let there be no Man to pity thee, nor to have compaſſion on thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs Children: Let thy Memorial be clean forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and in the next Generation let thy Name be clean put out: Let him be an accurſed Example to all the World: Let him be curſed in the City, and curſed in the Field; let him be curſed when he goeth out, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108243:56"/>
when he cometh in; let him be curſed when he lyeth down, and when he riſeth up: Let all Creatures, and the Creator himſelf forſake him, Angels reject him, Heavens frown at him, Earth open thy Mouth, Hell receive him, Spirits tear him, Devils torment him, let no mercy be ſhewed unto him that ſhewed no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> Thus ſhall the miſeries of <hi>Lazarus</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged by the juſt plagues that ſhall juſtly fall upon the Rich man's head.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the Life of <hi>Lazarus</hi> I noted how he lived, to wit, miſerably and full of Sores, and yet this rich Man would not pity him. Chriſt could not of his mercy but cure the Leper, when he ſaw him full of Sores and Leproſie; and <hi>Eliſha</hi> could not but out of Humanity teach <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> to waſh himſelf in <hi>Jordan,</hi> that he might be whole, but this rich Man would not help the poor Beggar, neither by his counſel, Purſe, Table, or Crumbs, but let him alone to pining Miſery at his Gate.</p>
                     <p>Here we note in the perſon of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the great miſeries and Afflictions that the Church of God doth endure in this World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Great are the troubles of the Righteous,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> not ſmall or few, but great and many, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 34. Again, <hi>He will throughly purge his floor,</hi> not ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor by halves; thorowly, <hi>Mat. 3. And he will ſearch</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>with Candle-light,</hi> leſt he ſhould over-ſlip any wickedneſs therein.</p>
                     <p>And further to prove this, we have many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the Scripture, but that well known out of <hi>Job,</hi> may not be omitted, whoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were more than many, and intolerable: As firſt, he being a juſt man, and one that feared God, to be thus plagued: For when one <hi>Meſſenger</hi> was relating tragical News to him, there came another on the neck of him, like the waves

No, then the Dogs will be beguiled, that muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the Dogs. From whence obſerve, that the ungodly world do love their Dogs better than the Children of God; you'll ſay that is ſtrange: It is ſo indeed, yet it is true, as will be clearly manifeſted; as for inſtance, how many pounds do ſome men ſpend a year on their Dogs, when in the mean while, the poor Saints of God may ſtarve for hunger? they will build Houſes for their Dogs, when the Saints muſt be glad to wander, and lodge in Dens and Caves of the Earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 38. and if they be in any of their Houſes, for the hire thereof, they will warn them out, or Eject them, or pull down the Houſe over their heads, rather than not rid themſelves of ſuch Tenants.

Nay, if when they are buſie with their Dogs, they ſhould chance to meet a Chriſtian, they would willingly ſhift him if they could: they will go on the other ſide the Hedge or the way, rather than they will have any ſociety with him; and if at any time a Child of God ſhould come into a Houſe where there are but two or three ungodly wretches, they do commonly wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>The Dogs came and licked his ſores.</hi> The Rich Man's Dogs by licking <hi>Lazarus,</hi> taught their Maſter to have mercy on him, but he would not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had worſe than a doggiſh Nature, and cruel Heart.

So <hi>Elias</hi> was fed by <hi>Ravens</hi> to ſave his life, 1 <hi>Kings 19. 4. And thou ſhalt drink of the River: and I have commanded the Ravens to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But now let us conſider the Third Part, which is the Death of the Beggar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It was ſo that the Beggar died.</hi> Here is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage fulfilled, <hi>Mors optima rapit, deterrima relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit.</hi> Now muſt I ſpeak of Tragical matters, of Funerals and Obſequies, of Diſſolution and Death.</p>
                     <p>This Beggar died, that repreſents the Godly; and the Rich Man died, that repreſents the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly: From whence Obſerve, neither Godly nor Ungodly muſt live always without a change either by Death or Judgment: The good man died, and the bad man died; that Scripture doth alſo back this Truth, that good and bad muſt die, marvellous well, where it is ſaid, <hi>And it is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to men once to die, and after that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Heb. 9. 27.</p>
                     <p>Now, when it is ſaid, the Beggar died, and the Rich man died, part of the meaning is, they ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108243:58"/>
to be any more in this World I ſay, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the meaning is ſo, but not altogether, though it be altogether the meaning, when ſome of the Creatures die, yet it is but in part the meaning, when it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is ſaid, that Men, Women, or Children die; for there is to them ſomething elſe to be ſaid more than a barely going out of the World; for if when unregenerate Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men die, there were an end of them, not only in this World, but alſo in the World to come, they would be more happy than now; for when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men and women die, there is that to come after Death, that will be very terrible to them, namely, to be carryed by the Angels of Darkneſs from their Death-beds to Hell, there to be reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Judgment of the great day, when both Body and Soul ſhall meet and be united together again, and made capable to undergo the uttermoſt vengeance of the Almighty to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Ah, Beloved, if this great Truth, that men muſt die, and depart this World, and either enter into Joy, or elſe into Priſon, to be reſerved to the Day of Judgment, were believed, we ſhould not have ſo many Wantons walk up and down the ſtreets as there do; at leaſt, it would put a mighty check to their filthy Carriages, ſo that they would not, could not walk ſo baſely and ſinfully as they do. <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> notwithſtanding he was ſo far from the fear of God as he was, yet when he did but ſee that God was but offended, and threatned him for his Wickedneſs, it made him hang down his head, and knock his knees together, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 5, 6. If you read the Verſes before, you will find, he was careleſs, and ſatisfying his Luſts in Drinking, and playing the Wanton with his Concubines: But ſo ſoon as he did perceive the Finger of an hand writing, <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith the Scripture) <hi>the King's
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108243:59"/>
countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, ſo that the joynts of his Loins were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt another.</hi> And when <hi>Paul</hi> told <hi>Felix</hi> of Righteouſneſs, Temperance, and Judgment to come, it made him tremble. Further, this is a certain truth, that not only the Wicked, but the Godly alſo muſt have a time to depart this Life. <hi>And the Beggar died;</hi> the Saints of the Lord they muſt be deprived of this Life alſo, they muſt yield up the Ghoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Lord their God; they muſt alſo be ſeparated from their Wives, Children, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Friends, Goods, and all that they have in the World, for God hath decreed it: <hi>It is appointed,</hi> namely, by the Lord, <hi>for Men once to die, and we muſt appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt,</hi> as it is, 2 Cor. 5. 10, 11.</p>
                     <p>But again, in the Death of the Beggar: Firſt we noted what became of his Soul, <hi>It was carried by Angels into</hi> Abrahams <hi>Boſom.</hi> Whereby we learn the Immortality of the Soul. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was the firſt among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that taught the Soul was Immortal. The Philoſophers alſo, and Heathen Poets do prove the Immortality of the Soul.</p>

                     <p>But leaving theſe, we prove by Scripture the Immortality of the Soul, <hi>Man was made a living Soul.</hi> Therefore the Soul is Immortal. And here in the Text, <hi>Lazarus</hi> being dead, <hi>his Soul was carried into</hi> Abraham'<hi>s Boſom.</hi>

But St. <hi>John</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, that all things were made by the Word of God, and without it nothing was made; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they are made they are made by the Word of God, and of a reaſonable Soul, which do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and believe in the Creator. <hi>Anima eſt primum principium vitae per ſe ſubſistens, incorporea a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Here therefore we note that the Souls of the Elect being ſeparated from their Bodies, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in Joys, and are carried into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; ſo called, becauſe it belongeth only to the Faithful.

                  <p>This is well for <hi>Nature's</hi> part; and <hi>Moralists</hi> think this enough for their part to conceive ſo: But <hi>Christians</hi> muſt go farther; and ſearch deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: <hi>They</hi> muſt try where the power of death lyes. They ſhall find that the power of every man's death lyes in his own ſin; That death ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hurts a man but with his own weapons: It always turns upon us, ſome ſin it finds in us. <hi>The sting of Death is ſin:</hi> Pluck out the ſting, death cannot hurt us. The way to die well, is to die often. Let a man often and ſeriouſly

think of dying, then let him ſin if he can, ſaid <hi>Picus Mirandula.</hi> In <hi>Sardis</hi> there grew an Herb cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Appium Sardis,</hi> that would make a Man lie laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he was deadly ſick: Such is the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin.

                  <p>We count it a fearful thing for a man to be author of his own death; but a ſinful life ſlays the ſoul. and ſo while we live, we kill or loſe our better life. The Commandment that ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially forbids the murthering of our own Souls. And herein is our happineſs; though we live in ſin, yet we die without ſin.

                  <p>THE ſecond ſtep to dying-well, is, to die daily. Methinks, O my Soul, it is but yeſterday ſince we met, and now we are upon parting; neither ſhall we, I hope, be unwilling to take our leaves: for, what advantage can it be to us to hold out longer together. Are we not aſſured that if our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, <hi>we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens?</hi> Why therefore, O my Soul, ſhouldſt thou be loth to part upon fair terms? Thou, O my Soul, to the poſſeſſion of that happy Manſion, which thy dear Saviour hath, from all Eternity, prepared for thee in his Father's houſe: and thou, O my body, to that quiet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory of the grave; till ye both ſhall happily meet in the bleſſed Reſurrection of the Juſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I die, that I may not die. I die daily,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul. So many days as thou liveſt, reckon ſo many lives; for he that diſpoſeth all his days as one life, can neither wiſh nor fear to morrow.</hi>

                  <p>THE third ſtep to dying well is, to die by little and little.</p>
                  <p>Naturally we are every day dying by degrees: the faculties of our minds, the ſtrength of our bodies, our common ſenſes are every day decaying, by little and little: every ſin is more than a diſeaſe, and a wicked life makes a continual death. <hi>Impiè vivere eſt diu mori; To live wickedly, is to be long a dying:</hi> Therefore ſaith the good Man, <hi>We are killed all the day long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that uſeth this courſe every day. To die by little and little, to him (let Death come when it will) it can neither be terrible nor ſudden.</p>
                  <p>If we keep <hi>a Courſer to run a Race,</hi> we lead him daily over the place, to acquaint him by degrees with all things in the way, that when he comes upon his ſpeed, he do not ſtart or turn aſide for any thing he ſees. So let us inure our ſouls; and then <hi>we ſhall run with boldneſs the race that is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, looking to Jeſus, the Author and finiſher of our ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To die by little and little, is firſt to mortifie our leſſer ſins, and not to ſay with <hi>Lot, Is it not a little one?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be alſo a ſort of little deaths, ſickneſs of body, loſs of Friends, and the like: Uſe theſe in their kind, and you may make them kindly helps to dying well.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every change is a certain imitation of Death.</hi> Let

a man go out as he came into the World; which was, firſt by a life of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> then of <hi>Senſe,</hi> afterwards of <hi>Reaſon.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>To die daily,</hi> is this: daily to attend upon, and exerciſe that great duty of Mortification, according to our <hi>ſolemn Vow and Covenant made to God at our Baptiſm:</hi> which Vow and Covenant, we renew, at our firſt coming to the <hi>holy and bleſſed Sacrament of the Lord's Supper.</hi> Alas, how few do conſider, or underſtand this great duty of Mortification, and fewer practiſe it. And yet this, above all others, is the Grace which fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and prepareth us for Death; this Grace putteth us into the poſſeſſion of Life Spiritual; and by perſeverance in it, into life Eternal, <hi>Rom. 8. 13. But if ye live after the fleſh;</hi> that is, after the appetites, luſts, affections of the fleſh; <hi>ye ſhall die.</hi> But I bleſs God, I have nothing to do with the World, nor the World with me. Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Pleaſures, honours tranſport me not, affect me not; nor am I dejected and afflicted with poverty, common pains, ſickneſſes, diſgrace or ſcorn.

                  <p>Before you die, ſet your houſe in order: He that hath not a houſe, yet hath a ſoul; no ſoul can want affairs to ſet in order, for this final diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>The chief grace of the Theatre, is the laſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108243:72"/>
Scene. It is the Evening that Crowns the day; and we think it no good ſign of a fair Morrow, when the Sun ſets in a Cloud: <hi>The end Crowns every Work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moſt men wiſh a ſhort Death, becauſe death is always accompanied with pain. <hi>We die groaning.</hi> To lie but an hour under Death is tedious, but to be dying a whole day, we think beyond the ſtrength of humane patience: He that <hi>deſires to be diſſolved, and be with Christ,</hi> dies not only pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, but delightfully. Happy is he, that after due preparation, dies ere he be aware; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is he happy that, by long ſickneſs, ſees death afar off; for the one dies like <hi>Elias,</hi> the other like <hi>Eliſha:</hi> both bleſſedly.</p>
                  <p>The beſt poſture to be found in when Death comes, is in the exerciſe of our calling: <hi>Preſs,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling,</hi> Phil. 3.</p>
                  <p>A good Man, by his good will, would die <hi>praying,</hi> and do as the Pilgrim doth, go on his way <hi>ſinging,</hi> and ſo adds the pains of ſinging to that of going; Who yet by this ſurplus of pain, unwearies himſelf of pain.</p>
                  <p>But ſome wretches think God rather curious, than they faulty, if a few ſighs, with a [<hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi>] be not enough at the laſt gaſp.</p>
                  <p>But commonly good Men are beſt at laſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when they are dying. It was a Speech worthy the commendation, and frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſo divine a Biſhop as <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which is reported of an aged Father, in his time; who, when his Friends comforted him on his ſick bed, and told him, they hoped he ſhould recover; anſwered, <hi>If I ſhall not die at all, well; but if ever, why not now?</hi> Surely it is folly,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108243:73"/>
what we muſt do, to do unwillingly. I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think my Soul in a good caſe, ſo long as I am loth to think of dying.</p>
                  <p>There is no Spectacle in the World ſo profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or more terrible, than to behold a dying man; to ſtand by, and ſee a man diſmanned. <hi>Curiouſly didſt thou make me in the loweſt part of the Earth,</hi> ſaith <hi>David:</hi> but to ſee thoſe Elements which compounded, made the Body: To ſee them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and the man diſſolved, is a ruſul ſight.</p>
                  <p>Every dying man carries Heaven and Earth wrapped up in his boſom, and at this time each part returns homeward.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, death hath great dependency on the courſe of man's life, and life it ſelf is as frail as the Body which it animates. <hi>Augustus Caeſar accounted that to be the best death which is quick and unexpected, and which beats not at our doors by any painful ſickneſs.</hi> So often as he heard of a man that had a quick paſſage, with little ſenſe of pain, he wiſhed for himſelf that <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanafie:</hi> While he lived he uſed to ſet himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his two friends, <hi>Groans and Tears.</hi> When he died he called for his Looking-glaſs, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have his Hair and Beard kembed, <hi>his reviled Cheeks ſmoothed up.</hi> Then asking his Friends, if he acted his part well, when they anſwered, <hi>Yes; why then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>do you not all clap your hands for me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Deſpair in dying, may as well ariſe from weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Nature, as from trouble of Mind: But by neither of theſe can he be prejudiced, that hath lived well.</p>
                  <p>Raving, and other ſtrange Paſſions, are many times rather the effect of the Diſeaſe, than coming from the mind. For upon Death's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, choler fuming to the Brain, will cauſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108243:73"/>
diſtempers in the moſt patient Soul. In theſe caſes, the faireſt and trueſt judgment to be made is, that ſins of ſickneſs occaſioned by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Diſeaſe in a patient man, are but ſins of infirmity, and not to be taken as ill ſigns or preſages; <hi>A Son of ſo many Tears</hi> cannot but be ſaved. I will not deſpair in reſpect of that man's impatient dying, whom the Worm of Conſcience had not devoured living.</p>
                  <p>Seldom any enter into <hi>Glory</hi> with eaſe; yet the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay of <hi>Moſes, His ſoul was ſucked out of his mouth with a kiſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> in this caſe, the better to make his way, prayed and cried, <hi>Lord, ſpare me a little. O ſpare me, that I may recover my ſtrength, before I go hence and be no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed to <hi>Ezekias</hi> ſome <hi>Years of Days</hi> were lent: But we are not worthy of that favour; we muſt not expect that God will bring back the ſhadow of degrees, when once it is gone down in the Dial of <hi>Ahaz;</hi> we muſt time it as we may, and be content to live and die at uncertainties.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, as a ſick man hearkens to the <hi>Clock, ſo let us watch Death.</hi> For ſudden com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Death, finding a weak ſoul unprepared, makes it deſperate, and leaves it miſerable.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>WHen Mary came where Jeſus was, and ſaw him, ſhe fell down at his feet, ſaying unto him, Lord if thou hadst been here, my Brother had not died,</hi> Jo. 11. 32. She wept indeed, <hi>yet</hi> it was but for a Brother; and <hi>the Jews alſo wept,</hi> verſ. 33. yet it was but for a common Friend: But what was all that to the death of a Husband? O my Husband, my Husband! That very name of Husband me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks would flatter me with comfort, as if I might imagin that he could hear me. But oh, he is dead, he is dead: He cannot hear me he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not behold me; he cannot anſwer me: His Ears are locked up, his Eyes are cloſed, his mouth is ſealed, his Soul is gone. O what ſhall I do for <hi>my head, my guide, my heart, my Husband?</hi> Were <hi>my</hi> Saviour upon Earth again, I could ſend one to him as <hi>Mary</hi> did, who ſhould ſay, <hi>Lord, behold, he whom thou loveſt is dead.</hi> Dead, ſay I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> O dead, dead; he is gone; he is departed, and can never be recalled. But why? Why can he not be called back again? Did not my Jeſus cauſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> to ariſe when he had been <hi>four days dead?</hi> ver. 39. Yes, he did: But what then? I neither love my Saviour ſo well as <hi>Mary</hi> did, nor
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108243:76"/>
(I fear) doth he love me ſo well as he did <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> or if both were ſo, yet ſince Miracles are ceaſed, I cannot ſo much as hope that he will call back the Spirit of my Lord, my Husband. Oh could he be wooed by the Tears of a ſinful Woman, never did any mourn ſo much as I would. But nothing will perſwade: I ſeek but the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of him whom <hi>I</hi> mourn for, if <hi>I</hi> deſire to call him from his eternal reſt.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Sarah</hi> died in <hi>Kirjath-Arba, Abraham</hi> ſtood <hi>up from before his deceaſed Wife, and ſpake unto the Sons of</hi> Heth, <hi>ſaying, I am a stranger, and a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer with you: Give me a Poſſeſſion, and a bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my ſight,</hi> Gen. 23. 3, 4. Though he ſo tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected her whilſt ſhe was living, yet he would not look too long on her when ſhe was dead. It is a duty as full of humanity to interr with decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the Bodies of the dead, as it is of Religion to love the Perſons when they are alive. Yet vain is man in this affection, if he fixeth his love only on the beauty of the body. This fleſh which is ſo tender, this skin which I ſtrive to preſerve both ſmooth and white, muſt one day be a banquet for the loathed Worms. No greater priviledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to me than did to my Husband; for the time will come when <hi>I</hi> ſhall follow him to the Earth. Had <hi>I</hi> loved only his outward form, my love ſhould now either be quite forgotten, or elſe <hi>I</hi> ſhould fondly deſire to deny it interment: But it was his body enlivened with a rich and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Soul, which drew mine affection, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded my deſires. Had that Soul and body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their Society, <hi>I</hi> had been freed from my laments: but they have bid farewell till the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reſurrection, and hence am <hi>I</hi> enforced to utter my complaints. <hi>I</hi> weep for my loſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108243:76"/>
we are divorced: But oh what conflicts then can I imagin that he had, when he was not only to part from his indeared Wife; but likewiſe his Soul was to leave this chillowed Earth! Oh for him, for him, for my loſs of him do <hi>I</hi> pay the tribute of theſe watering Eyes. Yet theſe tears muſt not flow in too great abundance, leſt by them <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſeem to envy his happineſs. Even when his body ſhall be layed to ſleep in the grave, if <hi>I</hi> mourn too much, it will be juſtly ſuſpected that too much <hi>I</hi> loved the worſt of my Husband. His Soul, which was his beſt, is now in perfection, and may not be lamented: his Body which is the worſt and groſſer part of him, is now to be committed to the Earth whence it came. Thither it muſt go, to that place <hi>I</hi> muſt commend it; otherwiſe my former love may be turned into loathing: and that which <hi>I</hi> eſteemed when it was alive, <hi>I</hi> ſhall be forced to abhor, if <hi>I</hi> keep it from the Grave. O it grieveth me each minute that <hi>I</hi> think of my deareſt; it troubleth and perplexeth me with diſturbed thoughts, when <hi>I</hi> conſider how frequently <hi>I</hi> loved him, yet cannot enliven him. But theſe are only the fond concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an erring phantaſie; and tell me that <hi>I</hi> loved him more than <hi>I</hi> ſhould, or elſe now <hi>I</hi> would not grieve ſo much as <hi>I</hi> do. If my love to God be ſo great as <hi>I</hi> pretend, <hi>I</hi> ſhall thankfully acknowledg his Love to the departed. O let it never be ſaid that my Love was Idolatry, in affecting him, too much, who is but duſt and aſhes.</p>
               <p>But why ſit <hi>I</hi> muſing in theſe penſive thoughts when <hi>I</hi> ſhould rather prepare for the burial of the dead? Have <hi>I</hi> taken a courſe for the place of his Reſt, where his cold body may be laid to ſleep? This is a duty which every age hath been careful to perform. It was a greater argument of <hi>Jehoja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim</hi>'s

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> the Prophet, that <hi>he cast his dead body into the graves of the common People, than that he ſlew him with the Sword,</hi> Jer. 26. 23. It hath alſo been a teſtimony of God's revenge, when he ſuffered not the dead to have a decent interment. <hi>If a Man beget an hundred Children</hi> (ſaith the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) <hi>and live many years, ſo that the days of his years be many; and his Soul be not filled with good, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that he have no burial, I ſay that an untimely birth is better than he,</hi> Eccleſ. 6. 3.

Thus hath it often diſcovered the wrath of the Almighty, when the carkaſſes of the dead have been denyed their funerals: and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it hath ſometimes manifeſted his love, when they have peaceably been brought to their longeſt home. Burial is the laſt of duties which we owe unto our friends, to which both religion, and nature, and civility do prompt us forward. When <hi>Iſaac, being old and full of days, did give up
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108243:77"/>
the Ghoſt, and died, and was gathered unto his people; his two ſons</hi> Eſau <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>buried him,</hi> Gen. 35. 29. When <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was beheaded in the priſon <hi>his diſciples came and took up the body, and buried it,</hi> Mat. 14. 12. The diſciple that was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow my Redeemer, yet accounted it his duty to attend on the funeral of his deceaſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore deſired, ſaying, <hi>Lord, ſuffer me firſt to go and bury my Father,</hi> cap. 8. 21.</p>
               <p>Even the glutton in the Goſpel had ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as to be brought to his Grave: ſo ſaith the text; <hi>The rich man alſo died, and was buried,</hi> Lu. 16. 22.</p>
               <p>It is then the duty of the living to provide even for the dead, that they may be buried in peace.</p>
               <p>But is it a matter of any moment in what place we lay the bodies of our deceaſed friends? Is it not all one, whether in the fields, or whether in our Golgotha's? No doubtleſs, for even the laws of our land are ſo juſtly ſevere againſt Idolaters, that we ſuffer not the convicted to be buried in our ground which is dedicated to this uſe. Neither may they be permitted to mix with our dead, who have deſperately become the murderers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but they lye in the roads, where a ſtake is ſet up, to give notice to paſſengers that they unnaturally haſtened their own departure. Is it a matter of ſome moment to us who are living, that we lay our deceaſed friends in a place conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: for although it extendeth not to their knowledge, yet it redoundeth to their honour.</p>
               <p>But is it not all one in what part of the ground I bury my Husband, ſo I lay his body in a place that is ſet apart for that purpoſe? Surely no; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is equal to him, yet is it not to me. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at the reſurrection we ſhall meet again, at what diſtance ſoever our Graves ſhall be made;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108243:78"/>
yet there is ſome reaſon we ſhould be buried ſo near as we may, that as our bodies were injoyned a mutual ſociety in the time of life ſo they might alſo ſleep together in the ſilent duſt. It is but juſt that one grave ſhould receive the bodies of us, for whom one bed was deſigned upon earth; that as in our lives we were made one fleſh, ſo after our deaths we ſhould make one lump. When <hi>Barzillai</hi> was offered a favour from King <hi>David,</hi> and wooed to ſpend his time at the Court, he beſought the King, ſaying, <hi>Let thy ſervant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my Father, and of my Mother,</hi> 2 Sam. 19. 37. Friends have ever deſired to lye by friends, that thoſe eſpecially who were knit together in <hi>blood &amp; affection,</hi> might be joyned together in their <hi>earth</hi> and <hi>aſhes.</hi> In the Cave of <hi>Machpelah</hi> which <hi>Abraham bought of Ephron for four hundred ſhekels of ſilver,</hi> was buried both <hi>himſelf, and</hi> Sarah <hi>his wife,</hi> Gen. 23. 16. There lay <hi>Iſaac, and Rebekah his wife,</hi> cap. 49. 31. and there lay <hi>Leah,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> her husband, chap. 50. 13. Though <hi>Saphira</hi> died by the judgment of God for the lye ſhe had told: yet when ſhe fell dead <hi>at Peter's feet, and yielded up the Ghoſt, the young men came in, and carried her forth, and buried her by her Husband,</hi> Act. 5. 10. It is therefore convenient that I chooſe a place for burial of my Husband, where (if ſo it may be) I my ſelf may be layed. Convenient it is, but not abſolutely neceſſary; for the ſouls ſhall not enjoy the leſs felicity for the remoter diſtance, and ſeparation of the bodies: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the bodies either be ſenſible of the disjunction; or ſhall it retard their meeting at the general day. Although the bones of <hi>Jacob</hi> were <hi>carried into the land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>and buried in the cave of the field of</hi> Machpelah <hi>which</hi> Abraham <hi>bought,</hi> according as he had <hi>made his ſon</hi> Joſeph <hi>ſwear to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108243:78"/>
him before his death,</hi> Gen. 50. 13. 5. yet he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>buried</hi> his beloved <hi>Rachel in the way to</hi> Ephrah, <hi>which is</hi> Bethlehem, and there <hi>Jacob ſet a pillar up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Grave, which was called the pillar of</hi> Rachel's <hi>grave,</hi> cap. 35. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>Thus do I ſit and muſe about the burial of him whom ſo dearly I loved. Yet methinks I could moſt readily preſerve him from the duſt, if either it were in my power, or might bring me content. But go he muſt, and I muſt follow him. This nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row room of his coffin muſt be put in truſt with his mouldring earth: and he who in his life time was entertained with variety of ſpacious chambers, muſt now ſecurely ſleep in the chamber of a Grave. O how it grieveth me to ſee this effect of ſin! Had not Adam fallen, my husband had not died. But oh, he's dead; and ſince nor tears, nor ſigh's, nor groans, nor cries have power to recall him, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my duty, and it ſhall be my care to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my love to him in the rites of his fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Friends ſhall carry him; neighbours ſhall attend on him; and my tears ſhall embalm him. The preacher ſhall be inſtructed in the vertue which adorned him, that ſo he may commend them to others for their due imitation. The hearers ſhall greedily attend to the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the dead; and not only acknowledg their truth, but contentedly wiſh like him to live, and like him to die.</p>
               <p>Now, O now another ſtorm approacheth in mine eyes: for the company beginneth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach my doors; and my neighbours and my friends are haſtening to my houſe. But when they come let them not think to comfort me, leſt they add to my grief while they vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrive to conquer my Paſſion. I cannot allow
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108243:79"/>
an intermiſſion or forbearance of Tears, leſt I ſhould appear unnatural. If I do not weep, I I did not love. O methinks I could willingly weep my ſelf into a Statue, that I might become his monument. It is the height of injuſtice to forbid <hi>my</hi> Tears, ſince the delight of mine <hi>Eyes</hi> is now to be carryed to the place of Oblivion. Methinks every thing ſeemeth to call for a <hi>Tear,</hi> which is the object of a Senſe. Thoſe Bells which ſo mournfully accord in their Tunes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite my Neighbours to come to the <hi>Funeral;</hi> yet not to appear with <hi>empty Eyes,</hi> unleſs they come to learn how to weep. Theſe Herbs, theſe Strew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which lately were freſh and at eaſe in their Beds, are willing to <hi>lye</hi> even under the feet of theſe that will mourn: And becauſe they have no <hi>Eyes</hi> themſelves to weep us a Tear, they <hi>lye</hi> to receive what ſhall drop from the mourners. Theſe Sprigs of <hi>Roſemary</hi> do call to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance with what joy and delight they pleaſed me at my Nuptials: But (leſt I ſhould forget the greater happineſs of the marriage with the Lamb) even this <hi>Herb</hi> which ſerved at our Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding does attend at the <hi>Funeral.</hi> O methinks theſe Spriggs have ſad Rhetorick ſitting on their leaves; for thoſe drops of Water which hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, were once the Blood of the fragrant Flowers, and now are the Tears of the drooping Plants. So ready were theſe Spriggs to come when I deſired them, that they ſlipped from their ſtems to attend theſe Obſequies. Theſe exotick Perfumes which delight the ſenſe, are willing to be burned, rather than the living ſhall be offended with the dead. Theſe ſable Garments ſtrike Terror into the <hi>Eye,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſpectator to lend us a <hi>Sigh.</hi> And what other Lecture is read here, or taught,

And theſe <hi>Tears,</hi> theſe <hi>early Tears,</hi> which ſo ſuddenly ariſe, when my Heart doth call, teach me <hi>Mortality</hi> in their <hi>hasty falling.</hi> And who can chooſe but weep for the ſhortneſs of our Lives? Who can forbear a <hi>Tear</hi> at the <hi>Funeral</hi> of a Friend? It was a curſe inflicted upon the wicked <hi>Jews,</hi> that they neither ſhould be buried, nor yet la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. <hi>They ſhall die of grievous deaths</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>they ſhall not be lamented; neither ſhall they be buried: but they ſhall be as dung upon the face of the earth; and their carkaſſes ſhall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beaſts of the earth,</hi> Jer. 16. 4.</p>
               <p>Grace muſt, and moſt willingly ſhall have the chief predominance; but let Nature have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe its qualifyed Drops, ſo they grow not immoderate. Though my loſs be the greateſt to whom he was a Husband, yet others may weep too, to whom he was a Friend: When <hi>Joſeph went to bury his Father,</hi> then <hi>all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>went with him, and the Elders of his houſe, and all the Elders of the Land of</hi> Egypt: <hi>And all the houſe of</hi> Joſeph, <hi>and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and his Fathers Houſe: And they came to the Threſhing-Floor of</hi> Arad, <hi>and there they mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a great and very ſore lamentation: and

When her Brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, ſhe wept, and her ſiſter wept, and her friends the <hi>Jews</hi> wept: And when Chriſt did ſee them all thus weeping, he was ſo far from blaming them, that <hi>he wept himſelf,</hi> ver. 35.

For ſhe hath wrought a good work upon me: For in that ſhe hath pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Ointment on my Body, ſhe did it for my Burial,</hi> Mat. 26. 8, 10, 12. <hi>She hath done what ſhe could; ſhe is come aforehand to anoint my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the burying,</hi> Mar. 14. 8. Here, I find, was Ointment to embalm him; and here were alſo Tears at his Funeral: And yet ſo far was Chriſt from blaming her for her Tears, that he not only decreed the <hi>publiſhing of this Act through the World where the Gospel ſhould be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and that <hi>for a Memorial of her,</hi> Mat. 26. 13. but he likewiſe upbraided <hi>Simon</hi> with the tears of the ſinner, and ſaid unto him, <hi>I entred into thine houſe, and thou gavest me no water for my feet, but ſhe hath waſhed my feet with Tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wherefore her ſins, which are many, are forgiven; for ſhe loved much,</hi> Luke 7. 44, 47. Weep then I may upon this ſad occaſion; yea, and weep may my Friends too. Tears are as proper at a Funeral, as Smiles at a Wedding. We have two Marriages; the firſt whereof is to

                  <hi>living Duſt;</hi> the laſt to the cold and ſilent <hi>Earth.</hi> At the former we rejoyce, for it was an inſtitution of God before <hi>Man had ſinned,</hi> Gen. 2. 24. At the latter we weep, for it is the effect of ſin. We cloath our ſelves in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Colours, when we celebrate the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: But our <hi>Blacks</hi> at the latter are our <hi>Wedding Garments.</hi> The <hi>Roſemary</hi> is ſerved about at each: The <hi>Gloves</hi> and the <hi>Favours</hi> attend at each: The <hi>Wine,</hi> and the other accuſtomed <hi>Entertainments</hi> are given at each: We go to the <hi>Church</hi> for the conſummation of each: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here is the difference, that at the one we rejoice, but at the other we mourn. Every <hi>Gueſt</hi> that is willing to comply with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion, muſt as well be ſad at this, as be merry at the other. Weep we may, and weep we muſt; eſpecially my ſelf who have loſt my ſelf. But yet let me take heed that I offend not in my Tears, leſt that which is my Duty be turned into a Crime. I muſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially take heed that I err not in the cauſe of theſe Laments: for if I grieve at the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of him that is departed, I diſcover an Envy rather than Affection. If I grieve for the loſs which my ſelf ſuſtaineth, I muſt take heed that I wrong not my confidence in God. I may not offend in the number of my Tears; for if I weep too much, I may forfeit my hope; or at leaſt I may occaſion thoſe that behold me to think that I doubt of the ſalvation of the Dead. Weep I may, and weep I muſt: but for fear leſt <hi>I</hi> offend in theſe my Tears, in my earneſt Prayers I will beg that they may be ſanctified. To my God will I go for his Direction and Aſſiſtance: And in this ſtorm of my Tears, I will ſhelter my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Protection.</p>

               <head>The Dying Knell—, Or, Tears for the Death of a beloved Brother, and may likewiſe ſerve at the Deceaſe of any other faithful Friend.</head>
               <p>A <hi>Friend</hi> (ſaith King Solomon) <hi>loveth at all times, and a Brother is born for adverſity,</hi> Prov. 17. 17. Friendſhip which is begotten by the outward form, or any other ſiniſter and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect, liveth no longer than that ground of affection: but nature is ſtronger than our election can be; and Religion obligeth far more than both. O how great then is my loſs of my deareſt Brother, in whom both excellency of Feature nearneſs of blood, and a gracious converſation conſpired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to render him <hi>matchleſs!</hi> To me he was a Friend but now to the Grave: and what loſs can be greater than the loſs of a Friend? To me he was a Brother, but now to the Worms: And what loſs can be more deplorable than the loſs of a Brother? But to me he was yet more: he was a Friend in his Love and courteſies, a Brother by his blood, yea and an inſtructer, a teacher of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and goodneſs: And yet nor love, nor blood, nor Religion could preſerve him mine. O what Sorrows do accompany all things tranſitory! His love could not die, but his body could: And ſo I am deprived of the Society of my Brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my Brother was ſubject to Corruption. But is this the adverſity for which he was born, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to King <hi>Solomon?</hi> Did the Wiſe Man intend that a <hi>Brother is born to bring Adverſity?</hi> Or rather to comfort us in the time of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity? Had he been a cauſe of my leaſt diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108243:82"/>
while he was living, he would have eaſed my grief by grieving himſelf. He would have comforted me in the time of trouble, had he lived to ſee my grievous mourning. But now alas I am left to lament alone; and ſo much the more for the want of his comfort. I now muſt grieve for him who was my joy: and my laments and my griefs increaſe the higher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for his ſake they ariſe who cannot allay them. Had we lived in hatred, his death per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure might have been my Comfort. Had we loved but ſlightly, a tear or two I might have thought enough to pay at his Funeral. But our Love was firm, it was ſtrong, yea ſtrong as death; and who then can blame me if my ſorrows in ſome meaſure keep pace with my love? O what tie can be ſo great as that of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? What love ſo great as of a Brother and Siſter? And yet ſo vain is Man, ſo frail are Mortals, that either our affection or our perſons muſt have a divorce. Had my deceaſed Brother forgotten the tie and bond of nature, and in his life had he turned his love into hatred; yet his fault ought not to have leſſened my Love, to which both Nature and Religion did ſtrongly oblige me. Had he loved me but coldly and faintly, as divers do; yet I ought to have warmed his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the <hi>fervency</hi> of mine. But oh, he <hi>dearly loved,</hi> he <hi>cordially</hi> affected me: and <hi>yet</hi> his <hi>love</hi> and his affection could not prolong his life.</p>
               <p>Had my Brother and I been <hi>Idolaters</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I might have believed that that ſin had ſlain my Brother. But as our Love was conſtant, ſo our Religion was undefiled: yea the ſtrength of our Love was founded on the <hi>purity</hi> of our Religion; and yet he hath payed his debt to Nature. The Lord did, threaten to ſet the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:108243:82"/>
againſt the Egyptians, and that they ſhould fight every one againſt his Brother,</hi> Iſ. 19. 2. Thoſe <hi>Egyptians</hi> were heathens, and Enemies to the Church; but my Brother and I were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both in the Profeſſion and the Love of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity:</hi> and yet through our ſins I fear that even <hi>we deſtroy each other. My ſins</hi> are partly <hi>puniſhed</hi> in his death: and his death hath given me ſo deep a wound, that peradventure I ſhall not long ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive him. Our love was ſo entire, that methink's I could willingly ſleep with him in his Grave: for while I live, my breaſt is but his walking monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Such love as ours did not always poſſeſs the hearts of ſome as nearly allyed? which maketh me ſigh to think that ever there were any which had layen ſucceſſively in the ſelf ſame womb, and yet did not joyn in the unity of affection.</p>
               <p>Methinks the complaint of the Church may be part of an Elegy upon my deceaſed brother; for with her I may cry out, and that juſtly too; The good man is periſhed out of the earth. But neither can I ſay that he was a <hi>Jew</hi> in ſupplanting; or an enemy to the <hi>Church,</hi> lying in wait for blood; What ſecret <hi>Devil</hi> did guide both the tongue and the hand of <hi>Joab,</hi> when under the colour of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he asked <hi>Amaſa, Art thou in health, my brother? And took him by the beard with the right</hi> hand <hi>to kiſs him,</hi> 2. Sam. 20. 9. and yet even at that time <hi>ſmote him with his ſword in the fifth ribb, and ſhed out his bowels to the ground that he died<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

What curſed fiend did guide the tongue of that wicked miſcreant whom the Pſalmiſt chargeth thus, and ſaith, <hi>Thou ſitteſt and ſpeaketh againſt thy brother; thou ſlandereſt thine own mothers ſon,</hi> Pſal. 50. 20. Had my brother either ſupplanted me, or hunted me with a net, or ſought to ſlay me, or ſlandered me with his tongue, then I might peradventure have ſaved
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108243:83"/>
this great expence of my Tears. But he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo good a Brother, that I could never juſtly charge him with the leaſt diſcourteſie. O no, <hi>we took ſweet Counſel together, and walked unto the Houſe of God in company,</hi> Pſal. 55. 14. I may ſay of him as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſpake of <hi>Hanani</hi> the Ruler of the Pallace, <hi>He was a faithful man, and feared God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove many,</hi> Neh. 7. 2. His blood was near to me; but his Soul was nearer. His perſon I loved, as I was prompted to it by Nature: But his inner man I more zealouſly affected, to which I was allured by his gracious endowments, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Counſel, nor his <hi>ſociety,</hi> nor his <hi>fidelity,</hi> nor his <hi>Religion</hi> could preſerve him from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a <hi>temporal death.</hi> O what would I not do to call him back again? What would I not give to have him <hi>reſtored to life again?</hi> But all that I can either do or give, cannot perſwade his Soul to return back to its <hi>Priſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then, ſeeing that I cannot fetch him from the Grave, I will yet ſend up my ſighs towards the place where he is bleſſed. This I may do without any check either of <hi>reaſon,</hi> or <hi>religion.</hi> It was a curſe which God did inflict upon <hi>Jehojakim</hi> for his ſins, <hi>That they ſhould not lament for him, ſaying, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But on the <hi>contrary,</hi> when <hi>Deborah</hi> (though ſhe was but <hi>Rebekah</hi>'s Nurſe) <hi>was buried beneath</hi> Bethel <hi>under an Oak, the name of it was called</hi> Allon-Bachuth, <hi>the Oak of weeping,</hi> Gen. 35. 8. When the enemies of <hi>David</hi> were viſited by ſickneſs, he <hi>behaved himſelf as though they had been his Friends, or his Brethren: Yea he bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his Mother.</hi> Pſ. 35. 14. But he who now is dead was not my <hi>enemy,</hi> but my <hi>friend,</hi> yea and no common friend, but a Brother: <hi>yea,</hi> and not a Brother in the fleſh ſo much as in affection, even
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108243:83"/>
as dear as a Mother. Why then ſhould I not ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the loſs of ſuch a <hi>Brother?</hi> I will grieve, I will lament when I remember the Love, and the <hi>courteſies</hi> which he ſhewed unto me; and I will ſpeak in the language of the Church to Chriſt, and ſay, <hi>O thou that wert my Brother, that ſucked the breaſts of my Mother, when I ſhould find thee without, I would kiſs thee; yet I ſhould not be deſpiſed,</hi> Cant. 8. 1. I will lament him as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and <hi>ſay, the Beauty of Iſrael is dead,</hi> 2 Sam. 1 19. <hi>he was lovely and pleaſant in his life,</hi> ver. 23. <hi>I am diſtreſſed for thee, my Brother; very pleaſant haſt thou been unto me; thy love to me was wonderful, paſſing the love of Women,</hi> v. 26.</p>
               <p>But what advantage to the dead are the tears of the living? Can my ſighs inſpire life into his boſom? Can a draught of my tears fetch him back again to life? O no: 'tis this, 'tis this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that doth heighten and increaſe my ſorrows, even that my tears cannot recover him whom I lament. But ceaſe, fond woman, ceaſe thy ſobbs and cryes of diſcontent. By the extremity of thy paſſion thou mayeſt haſten to his Grave: yet if thou murdereſt thy ſelf with exceſſive ſorrow, thy ſoul may be deprived of the ſociety of his. 'Tis true indeed; 'tis moſt true. Little can I expect to come to heaven, if I violently force my ſelf from the earth. Why then do I take on, as if I either ſuſpected his happineſs, or doubted of following him? What comfort can it bring to his body of earth, to have it cabined in the Grave with his diſperſing aſhes? The duſt of both of us may mix in the vault, and yet no joy ariſe to our ſenſleſs aſhes. If his earth was that which drew mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I ſee my fondneſs in the corruption of that Earth: but if his gracious ſoul was the object of my love, I muſt ſtrive to come where that ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:108243:84"/>
To heaven he's gone, and to heaven I'll haſten: and becauſe I will go the ſureſt way, I will walk in thoſe paths which faith and patience ſhall direct me in. I will no more diſturb the peace of my mind, ſince that cannot help me to the company of him. Weep indeed I do; I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced unto it: 'tis the law of nature; 'tis an act of neceſſity; I cannot avoid it. Yet, though I weep, I will labour for content: and ſince my God (as I undoubtedly believe) hath been pleaſed to crown my brother with glory; I will beſeech him to comfort me here with his grace. I will not immoderately weep, leſt I injure my ſelf: I will not weep without hope, leſt I offend my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: but that I may weep as I ſhould, and hope as I ought, and live as I am required, <hi>I</hi> will humble my ſelf at the feet of him to whom my brother is gone.</p>

                  <p>IT is evident, that in this Verſe that I have now read to you, the Wiſe man ſpeaks of ſuch a <hi>mourning,</hi> as is occaſioned by the Death of friends. And he ſaith of that Mourning, that <hi>it is better than to be in the Houſe of Feaſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That he ſpeaks of ſuch a <hi>mourning,</hi> appears by that which followeth: Firſt, he ſaith that <hi>this is the end of all men,</hi> he ſpeaks therefore of ſuch a <hi>mourning,</hi> as is upon the end of men, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the departure of men out of this World: And Secondly, he ſaith, <hi>the living will lay it to his heart:</hi> He ſpeaks of ſuch an end of Men, as is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the life of Men.</p>
                  <p>In a word, <hi>By the Houſe of mourning,</hi> he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a houſe wherein ſome one is dead, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth occaſion to the parties that dwell there, of ſorrow and mourning for their departed friend. <hi>It is better to go to ſuch a houſe.</hi>

                  <p>By <hi>the Houſe of feasting,</hi> he meaneth not only ſuch a houſe wherein there is feaſting, but alſo all manner of abundance: As commonly Men ſhew their wealth in Feaſting.</p>

                  <p>So that the ſum and ſubſtance of the words is thus much; <hi>It is a better thing for a Man to be converſant about the thoughts of death, and to take hold of all occaſions that may bring the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration thereof into his heart, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light himſelf in thoſe worldly pleaſures, and ſenſual delights, wherein for the most part men ſpend their lives.</hi>

                  <p>What is <hi>the end of all men? The Houſe of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> That which he meaneth by the <hi>Houſe of Mourning</hi> here, is that which he calleth <hi>the end of all men,</hi> that which putteth an end to all men, and to their actions upon earth, and that is Death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:108243:86"/>So that the main point, that in this place the wiſe man intendeth, is but thus much, I will deliver it in the very words of the Text, we need not vary from them at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Death is the end of all Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here it will be objected; We find ſome men that did not die. It is ſaid of <hi>Enoch, that he was tranſlated, that he ſhould not ſee death,</hi> Heb. 11. 5. And of <hi>Elijah, that he went up by a whirl-wind into heaven in a chariot of fire,</hi> 2 King. 2. 11. Theſe men did not die.</p>
                  <p>To this, I anſwer briefly, Particular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary examples, do not fruſtrate general rules: God may ſometimes diſpenſe with ſome particular men, and yet the rule remain firm. I ſay it may be ſo.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly we anſwer, They had that that was in ſtead of Death to them, ſome change, though they did not die after the manner of other men. So at the end of the world, it is ſaid, <hi>that thoſe that are alive ſhall be caught up and changed, in the twinkling of an eye;</hi> there ſhall be a ſudden, and almoſt undiſcernable, unperceivable change, which ſhall be to them in ſtead of death.</p>
                  <p>But it will be objected further; There is a promiſe made in <hi>Joh. 11. That thoſe that believe ſhall never die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer with that common diſtinction; There is a twofold death, which the Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, the <hi>first and the ſecond death:</hi> The <hi>firſt death,</hi> is the death of the body, that ariſeth from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and ſeparation of the body from the ſoul; And there is a <hi>ſecond death,</hi> that ariſeth from the diſ-junction, and ſeparation of the ſoul from God. The <hi>firſt death</hi> is no death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, the <hi>ſecond Death</hi> is that which is truly Death: And ſo they ſhall not die. A man may have a body ſeparated from the ſoul, and yet not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:108243:86"/>
his ſoul ſeparated from God, nor himſelf from Chriſt. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God in Chriſt? Neither life, nor death, nor principalities, nor powers,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8 38.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This point alſo is of uſe to us, in the death of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, to moderate the mourning of Chriſtians for the Death of others. Why? It is <hi>the end of all men,</hi> it is that that is the common condition of all men, it ſhould not be too grievous, nor too doleful to any man. We would not have our friends to be in another condition in their birth than others, we would not have them have more fingers, or more members than a man, and would we have them have more days? Let this ſerve as a brief touch upon that.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it teacheth us to make good uſe of our fellowſhip while we are together. Not only we may die, but thoſe that are uſeful to us may die alſo, let us make good uſe of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, while we live therefore.</p>
                  <p>It did ſmite the heart of thoſe Epheſians, that they <hi>ſhould ſee the face of Paul no more;</hi> ſpecially above the reſt it grieved them, that they ſhould ſee him no more; how would it have grieved them think you, if they had always hardned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt his miniſtry before?</p>

contrary to the Word of God: For Almighty God, by whom Death is inflicted, would have the nature thereof to be ſuch, that it ſhould bring Tears and ſorrow, not only unto them which die; but unto thoſe alſo of whom they that die are beloved. Who (but a man of a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heart, in the mourning Troop accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his loving Neighbours deceaſed Son unto his Grave, dying in the Spring of his Youth, even at that Age when he was moſt able to comfort his deareſt Friends, even her that brought him into the World, or in the Winter of her Widowhood, when ſhe did moſt want him) could refrain from mourning and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?

                  <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his book concerning <hi>Naboth, ch.</hi> 5. makes mention of a Tragical Accident: How that in his time there was a poor man, in extream neceſſity, conſtrained to ſell one of his Sons in perpetual Bondage, that he might hereby ſave the reſt from a preſent Famine; who calling all his dear Children unto him, and beholding them as Olive Branches round about his Table, could not reſolve which he might beſt ſpare; his eldeſt Son was the ſtrength of his Youth, even he that called him firſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore not willing to part with him; his youngeſt Boy was the Neſt-chick, the dearly beloved of his mother, and therefore not willing to part with him; a third moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled his Progenitors, having his Fathers Bill, and his mothers eye, therefore not willing by

Nay, it is almoſt Death to ſome, to part with any of their Children, but for a Year or two, although that they go but a little way, and may return when they will: Therefore could <hi>David</hi> be thought blame-worthy, to mourn for his Child, whom he could not ſee till he went to him; <hi>but now he is dead,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And this brings me now unto the ſecond thing conſiderable in my Text, which is the Perſon whom <hi>David</hi> that good King, wept and mourned for thus dolefully, and that was for his Son, an innocent Babe, who was no ſooner born into this miſerable World, but viſited with a mortal Diſeaſe, and ſo cut off for the Life of <hi>

wiſh for Death; they honour all that contemns it, but cannot endure, or heartily love any that is afraid of it; this makes many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally love a Souldier, and honour thoſe tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and contemptible Regiments, that will die at the command of a Sergeant. For a Pagan there may be ſome motives to be in love with Life, for a Chriſtian to be amazed at Death; I ſee not how he can eſcape this <hi>dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> that is too ſenſible of this Life or careleſs of the Life to come. If a Wife put forth her Child to Nurſe, and the Nurſe having kept it long enough, ſhe taketh it home again; can the Nurſe or any other have any cauſe to complain? ſo the cauſe ſtands between God, and our Souls, If God (having inſpired into theſe mortal Bodies of ours, that which is immortal) come, and take it to himſelf, leſt it ſhould come to harm; can any one have any reaſon to Complain? As ſeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſs ſown in the Ground, cannot bring forth, ſo we until that Death come, and we be laid in the Ground cannot expect our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation and bliſs with Gods Saints in his Kingdom of Glory. Death freeth the godly from the Tyranny of Satan, from Sin, from the World, from the Fleſh, and from eternal Damnation, placing them with Chriſt for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore in Heaven, the Center of all good wiſhes, where inſtead of Earthly Bodies, they ſhall be cloathed with unſpeakable Glory; and all this holy <hi>David</hi> was not Ignorant of, which made him (as ſoon as his dearly beloved Son had taken his Farewell of this inferior Orb) ſay, Wherefore ſhould I faſt? ſeeing my Child, yea, my precious Jewel, has changed his Life out of a miſerable world, into a Kingdom where pleaſures ineffable are to be had for

evermore; <hi>but now,</hi> &amp;c. And this brings me now unto the Third thing conſidered in my Text, which is the manner of his mourning, and that was how he ſpun away his time in weeping, faſting, and praying for his dear child ſo long as he was alive; he did not as <hi>Priamus</hi> did for his Son <hi>Hector,</hi> Faſt, Weep, and Pray after his Death, or as many do now adays, only in outward ſhew, altering their Garments. No, his was far otherwiſe. it was real, true, and hearty ſorrow, not countenanced in the leaſt with a heavy look or with a ſolemn ſigh blown from deceitful lungs. No, his was a Weeping, Watching, Mourning, and Faſting Grief; he was ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from all Worldly contentment, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Body from all the pleaſures of this mortal Life, ever <hi>making his bed to ſwim, and watering his touch with tears.</hi> He mourned as one for his only Son, eating aſhes like Bread, and mingling his Drink with weeping; ſtill weeping, wailing, and crying as <hi>one that had parted with his dear Mother,</hi> Pſalm 35. 14. or as <hi>a virgin girded with ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nature (being we are Members of one Body, thinking the miſhap of other men to be our own, through the mutual compaſſion of Chriſt's Body) makes us deſirous to live together ſo long as is poſſible; therefore was it poſſible for <hi>David</hi> to refrain from tears, when he took his farewel of one Child, part of his own Body? No, he could not forbear crying, until he began to conſider with himſelf that he was dead, and that the Death of the Saints is precious in the ſight of the Lord, and the day thereof better to them, than the day of their birth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being then

                     <item>1. <hi>Man goeth,</hi> there is his Life.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>To his long home,</hi> there is his Death.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>And ſo I am upon the firſt Stage.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Man's Life is a Voyage, his Death the term or period of this Voyage, his Grave his home, and Mourners his Attendance. The Hour-Glaſs is run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whether the Preacher proceeds, or makes a pawſe, and the Ship is ſayling whither it is bound, when we ſleep in our Cabbine; ſo whether we wake or ſleep, move or reſt, be buſie or idle, mind it, or mind it not, we walk on toward our long home.</p>
                  <p>We are expiring and dying, from the running of the firſt Sand in the Hour-glaſs of our life, to the laſt, from the moment we receive Breath, to the moment that we breath out our laſt gaſp.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Man</hi> in my Text goeth, or rather run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſtill in his natural Courſe, that is, every Man.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>I am now come, though long firſt, to Man's long home, which cannot be deſcribed in a ſhort time, and therefore I leap into my laſt ſtage, which as you may remember was:</p>
                  <p>The Application of the Text to this ſad Occaſion.</p>
                  <p>I muſt now uſe in the Application of my Text, a method direct contrary to that which I followed in my Explication; for therein firſt I ſhewed you how the natural Man goeth to his long, and the Spiritual to his eternal home; and after how, and why, and what ſort of Mourners went about the Screets lamenting the deceaſed; but now I am to ſpeak of the Mourners, who have already finiſhed their circular motion, and then of the direct mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Man, the man of quality, the man of worth, the Man of eſtate and credit, who is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy arrived at his <hi>long Lete,</hi> and now entring into his long home.</p>

                  <p>As Man is Duſt and Earth by Procreation, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he is Duſt and Earth by Suſtentation, and that in two reſpects; In regard of Aliment and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Meat and Apparel: It is truly ſaid, That of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we conſiſt, we are nouriſhed with; Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are Aliments, where we begin, we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; all Meats for our Bodies in Health, and all Medicines for the ſame, being Sick, are Earth and Earthy, even Duſt and Aſhes as we our ſelves are; we feed on the Things of the Earth, and walk and ſleep thereon: As for Apparel and Ornaments, we borrow Wooll of the Sheep, Hair of the Camel, Silk of the Worm, Furies of the Beaſts, and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Fowls of the Air; like unto <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Crow, having ſome Plume from every Bird, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from every Creature.

Now from this Principle I will infer three or four Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of very great Fruit and Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is this, If thou art Duſt and Aſhes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore art thou proud, thou Duſt and Aſhes? Of thy Beginning? No; of thy End? No; Of what then? If thou ſhouldeſt ſee thy ſelf Seated between the Horns of the Moon, think on the baſeneſs of thy beginning, and thou ſhalt then ſee clearly that Pride was not born for Man, nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Pettiſhneſs appointed for Woman's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; Pride cannot ſute with Dirt, nor Curſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with Woman's Softneſs. <hi>Lord cleanſe me from my ſecret ſins, and ſpare thy Servant from thoſe that are ſtrangers:</hi> By Aliens you may underſtand thoſe of Pride, for it is a Stranger as it were, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind of thing, differing much from Man's baſe and vile Condition.

with Whips and Scourges, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16. becauſe they inſulted, and proudly triumphed upon the Walls and Towers of his City: Speak Puniſhment unto thoſe that reioyce in Walls that are made of Brick. What, can earthen Walls raiſe up ſuch Pride in Men? <hi>Samuel</hi> being to Anoint <hi>Saul,</hi> God gave him for a Sign that he would have him Prince over his People, That he ſhould find two Men as ſoon as he was gone from him, near unto <hi>Rachels</hi> Sepulchre: God might have given unto him ſome other Sign, but he choſe rather this to give him, to quell the Pride and Haughtineſs of this new Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; as if he ſhould admoniſh and put you in mind, that the Aſhes of ſo fair a Creature as <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> ſhould read a Lecture unto you, what you muſt be. And this is the reaſon why the Church, though ſhe might uſe other Metaphors to expreſs the Miſery and ſhortneſs of Mans Life, as is often made mention of in the Ornament of Grace, as by a Leaf, a Flower, and a Shadow; yet it makes more particular choice of Duſt and Aſhes, becauſe the other are Metaphorical, theſe Literal: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more properly appertaineth unto Man than Duſt, and therefore the Scripture termeth Death, a Mans returning again unto the Earth from whence he came. The Flower, the Leaf and the Fruit, have ſome good in them, though of ſhort conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; as Colour, Odour, Beauty, Vertue and Shade, and albeit not good in themſelves, yet they are the Image and Repreſentation of Good; but Duſt and Aſhes ſpeak no other good. Amongſt the Elements, the Earth is the leaſt noble, and the moſt weak, the Fire, the Water and the Air, have in them Spirit and Actitude; but the baſe Element Earth, as it were a Priſoner laden with Weightineſs. A certain Poet ſtyles the Earth <hi>Bruta,</hi> not only for that it hath an unpleaſant
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108243:109"/>
Countenance, as Deſerts, Quick-ſands, Dens, and Caves; but alſo for that it is an Inne of Serpents, Tygers, Panthers, and the like, ſo that it is good neither to the Taſte, to the Smell, to the Feeling, nor to the Hearing, nor yet to the Seeing. Thou being therefore Earth, why art thou Proud, thou Duſt and Aſhes? And thus far of the Firſt.</p>
                  <p>Now the Second Thing regardable, is, If thou art Aſhes, why ſuch a deal of Care in Pampering thy Body, which the hungry Worms are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to morrow? Conſider thoſe rotting and ſtinking Carkaſſes of your Relations, that lye here under the Ground, and the very thought thereof will moderate your deſire of being over-dainty and curious in cheriſhing your own. <hi>Iſaac</hi> on the Night of his Nuptials, placed his Wifes Bed in the Chamber where his Mother died. <hi>Tobias</hi> ſpent all the Night with his Spouſe in Prayer, being mindful of the harm which the Devil had done to her former Husbands; as being adviſed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that he ſhould temper with the remembrance of Death, the Delights and Pleaſures of this ſhort Life of ours. The Camomile, the worſe you treat it, and the more you tread upon it, the better it thrives; other Plants require Pruning and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make them fruitful; but this Herb hath a quite contrary condition, that with ill uſage it grows the better. It is the pamper'd Fleſh that brings forth Thiſtles and Thorns, but the Flesh that is trodden down and humbled, that yields ſtore of Fruit: And this is likewiſe concerning the Second.</p>
                  <p>Now the Third thing to be conſidered, is, If thou art Duſt, and to Morrow muſt become Duſt and Aſhes, why ſuch a deal of coveting of Honours and Riches, which on a ſudden may take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Wings and flye away. <hi>Eſau</hi> ſold his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right

come ye unto Judgment. What is ſaid in my Text, as it is likely you have often heard it with your Ears, ſo now you may ice it accompliſhed, <hi>It is appointed unto all Men once to die. Death</hi> hath long ſince come into our Nation, and hath ſummoned many to make their appearance in another World, yea, you know that <hi>Death</hi> hath already entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Streets, and hath not been afraid to ſtep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our <hi>Threſhold,</hi> and to ſeize upon thoſe that have been ſtanding round about us; yea, it hath come into our very <hi>Bed-chambers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and hath ſuddenly ſnatched away thoſe that have been lying in our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Boſoms: So that we have had warning enough of the near approaches of <hi>Death</hi> unto our ſelves, and without doubt ſome of us have had the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Death</hi> within our ſelves, (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh;) and therefore it is high time for you and I ſeriouſly to conſider what is ſaid in my Text, <hi>Set thy Houſe in order,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Something we ſhall briefly ſpeak now in order to the explanation of the words, that ſo you may once more hear (before you feel) the meaning of them; It is <hi>appointed</hi> or <hi>enacted</hi> by the Court of Heaven; <hi>Statutum eſt,</hi> it is a Statute or Law (more firm and certain than the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi>) which is never to be repealed or abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. We are not therefore telling you what may, but of what muſt inevitably come to paſs. It is appointed <hi>unto Men,</hi> that is as much as to ſay, unto all Men, <hi>once to die.</hi> It is an indefinite Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and ſo is to be underſtood of all the ſame kind, without ſome ſpecial exception from this general Rule. And indeed ſuch an exception there is to be found in the Scripture; for, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>We ſhall not all Die, but ſome ſhall be Changed, in a Moment, in the twinkling of an Eye;</hi> there ſhall be ſome at the end of the World, who ſhall not

paſs under <hi>Death, but yet they muſt paſs under a Change,</hi> which is thought will be equivalent unto <hi>Death.</hi> But for the preſent time, and according to the common Method and Courſe of Providence, no Man or Woman hath any ground to expect that they ſhall eſcape the ſtroke of <hi>Death;</hi> for it is <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto Men,</hi> that is, unto <hi>all Men, once to Die: Death</hi> will no more ſpare him that wears a <hi>Crown</hi> upon his Head, than him that carries a <hi>Spade</hi> in his Hand, as the <hi>Poet</hi> Elegantly expreſſes it.</p>

Now by this word <hi>Houſe,</hi> you may underſtand, even every Humane Body, which although at its firſt Creation, was a moſt ſolid, ſound, and incorruptible Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; yet, by the entrance in of ſin became ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of all ſorts of Maladies; 'tis true, before that we knew what a damnable thing ſin was, we had ſtrong Houſes, but ever ſince God Almighty lets us dwell in Paper thatched Cottages, and clay Walls, every Diſeaſe like a tempeſtuous ſtorm totters us, and is ever and anon ready to overwhelm us. Now this ruinous Houſe, and all decaying Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, which by the corruption of ſin is become as a Peſt-houſe, fetide, filthy, and unclean, before it can be ſet in order, muſt be ſwept clean and throughly rinced of all ſins infective dregs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt it muſt be throughly purged from the guilt of blood, which leaves ſuch a ſtain behind it, that the whole Land could not be cleanſed but by the blood of the ſhedder; for even ſo did holy <hi>David,</hi> who although he was a renowned, and glorious King, and holy Prophet of God, a Man juſtified even of his Enemies, thou art more Righteous than I; eſteemed of his Subjects, thou art worthy of

                  <p>Secondly, As the Body, before it can be ſet in Order, muſt be throughly cleanſed from the guilt of blood; ſo muſt it likewiſe be purged throughout, and ſcoured well of all the Pollutions, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptive Dregs, which Adultery leaves behind it, they are not a few, it is a Quotidian Fever to the Corps, a Canker to the Mind, a Corroſive to the Conſcience, and a mortal Bone to all the Body. It is an efficient cauſe of more cruel Maladies in the Body than any thing beſide.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it ſets the Body on fire, which ever after conſumes away by an incurable Conſumption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:108243:119"/>Secondly, it brings the Body into a Dropſie, which by no skilful Phyſitian with all his cunning Medicines, and drawing Iſſues can be once cured; till that Tyrant, and all-devouring Death come with its ſharp ſtinging Arrows, and execute its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Concupiſcence is like a fire, and our Bodies unto ſeething pots which cannot be cooled, but either by taking away the fuel, by keeping it in continual motion, by caſting in of cold water, or laſtly, by taking it altogether from the fire. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let every man in the fear of God, uſe theſe means preſcribed for the cooling of intemperate Luſt boiling in his fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Firſt I ſay, let him take away the fuel, let him refrain himſelf from eating, and drinking too much, leſt at laſt Luſt command like a Tyrant; for ſaturity is the father of wantonneſs, and uncleanneſs, the Daughter of ſurfeiting, <hi>ſine</hi> Cerere <hi>&amp; Libero friget</hi> Venus, <hi>without Nectar and Amrboſia</hi> Concupiſcence cannot long continue, for Lady <hi>Venus</hi> dwells-ſtill at the ſign of the Ivy-buſh: where there is clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Teeth, uſually there is no filthineſs of Body, but if that we ſtuff our Corps as full as they can hold, making our mouths as Tunnels, our throats as Wine-pipes, and our bellies as barrels, we muſt expect nothing but Luſt ever to Tyranize over us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let every one keep his Body in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Action, for Concupiſcence is begot of an idle Brain, and hatch'd in a lazy Body.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, Let every Man ſtir to cool his Body by waſhing of himſelf throughly with his Tears, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did, who <hi>watered his Couch with his Tears,</hi> and <hi>whoſe Eyes became a Fountain of Tears.

                  <p>Fourthly, As the Pot is cooled by taking it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from the Fire; ſo indeed may the Luſt of the Body, by ſhuning opportunities and occaſions of Sin, for Liberty makes Thieves. <hi>Daniel,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though but a young Man, was ſo indued with the Continency, that he did not only all he could to ſuppreſs Luſt in himſelf, but alſo reproved the Laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious Elders. <hi>Joſeph</hi> a young Man reſiſted the Temptations of his own Miſtreſs, and likewiſe St. <hi>John</hi> the Bleſſed Evangeliſt, although very young, almoſt a Boy, did what as in him lay to bridle his Nature, and to keep his Houſe in order: Now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that filthy Luſt doth not only diſhonour, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo pollutes our Veſſels, our Clay Bodies, let us take Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice, which is <hi>to abſtain from its eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind,</hi> for although it doth ſeem a Paradiſe to the Deſire, yet it is a Purgatory to the Purſe, a Plague to the Body, and a Hell to the Soul; and that which may ſtir up the Wanton the moſt, a Sin againſt his own Body; Doſt thou then love thy

But further, as the Body muſt be made clean, and purged of all thoſe ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dregs, which thoſe forementioned crying Sins have left in it; even ſo it muſt be ever kept clean from thoſe Diſtempers which Drunkenneſs and Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony procure.

                  <p>That the Health of the ſound is to drink no Health, but to his own. He, that is a common Drunkard, can but of neceſſity break all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God. For firſt inſtead of giving that honour due unto Almighty God his Creator, he makes a God of the Creatures loving it with all his Heart and Mind; ever having more Gods than one. Secondly, he is ever ready to Blaſpheme, and to back all his words with execrable Oaths. Thirdly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:108243:123"/>
Fifthly, the Drunkard breaketh the Eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment as well as the reſt; for although, like a cunning Fox he may refrain to take up at home, yet if it be to be had abroad, he is ſure to have it; but indeed, that which is the worſt of all is that he robs God of his due, which is of his poor Soul, which he hath purchaſed with his moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood; and ſo brings both his Body and Soul to utter ruin and deſtruction. (O thou that ſpins away thy time, like a Swine in drinking, and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;) ever have this in remembrance, and <hi>ſet thy Houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die and not live.</hi> There are many more ruſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and filthy dregs of Sin, which as well as thoſe muſt be ſcoured out of the Body before that it can <hi>be ſet in order,</hi> as of Lying, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Curſing, and ſuch like; but thoſe I ſhall leave to your conſideration, hoping that you will not ſuffer the leaſt of them to have any place in your Mortal Bodies.</p>
                  <p>And ſo proceed a little further concerning the very matter of our diſcourſe, the thing that we are all warned unto, which is to <hi>ſet our Houſes in order, for we muſt die, and not live. Set thy Houſe,</hi> &amp;c. As it is the Cuſtom among the Nobles and Peers of this Realm, when that they know of the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give them a viſit, to have all about them in order and decency; ſo indeed ought every one of us to <hi>ſet our Houſes in order,</hi> to keep our Bodies, which are the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt ever clean and decent, and ſtill furniſhed with all ſorts of Heavenly Graces to entertain ſuch a Glorious Prince, who hath writ on his Thigh King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. It will not be long ere he come, for St. <hi>James</hi> ſaid, <hi>In his time behold the Judge ſtandeth before the door,</hi> and likewiſe, it was St. <hi>John</hi>'s the Baptiſt Text, ſaying, <hi>Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, he may come to day, or
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:108243:124"/>
he may come to morrow, therefore make your ſelves ever ready, and ſet your Houſe in order, for you ſhall die, and not live.</hi> Firſt, you muſt furniſh your ſelves with love, which is the complement of the Law, and an earneſt deſire of interchangeable affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the Soul. Secondly, you muſt furniſh your ſelves with Charity, which of all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues is ſtill Chief, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Biſhop of the Gentiles, comparing it with Faith and Hope, tells you that it is the Chief, for it ever Edifieth, ſtill ſuffereth, never envieth, yea, and ſtill continueth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. Thirdly, you muſt get your ſelves fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with patience, that with all alacrity and chearfulneſs of Heart, you may endure all things for Chriſts ſake. Fourthly, you muſt get your ſelves furniſhed with Humility, Virtue, which when the Lord of Heaven beholds it in you, which cauſed him to ſink into your Hearts. Fifthly, you muſt get your ſelves furniſhed with Hope of Everlaſting Faith and Salvation. And then ſixthly and laſtly with Faith, which is an evidence of things not ſeen, thus you muſt get your ſelves <hi>ſet in order,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And thus far of the matter of this Admonition, and earneſt Exhortation. Now I ſhould come to the Reaſon, which is twofold, affirmative, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; Affirmative, <hi>thou ſhalt die;</hi> and Negative, <hi>and rot live.

                  <p>Now of theſe ſeverally, and firſt of the reaſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, <hi>thou ſhalt die.</hi> Now there are three kinds of Death. Firſt, the Death of the Body, which is a natural Death. Secondly, the Death of the Soul, which is a Spiritual Death. And then thirdly and laſtly, the Death both of Body and Soul, which is Eternal Death. But that which good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was warned of, was but only the Death of the Body, which according to the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:108243:124"/>
Statute Law Decreed in that High Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven, all Men ſhall once taſte of, no Man can eſcape it, for ſo ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto all Men that they ſhall once die, to all once, to many twice, for there is a ſecond Death, and that is truly a Death, becauſe it is <hi>Mors Vitae,</hi> the Death of Life; the other rather a Life, becauſe it is <hi>Mors Mortis,</hi> the Death of the Death, after which there ſhall be no more Death. Now as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mans time is appointed, his Month determined, and his day numbered,</hi> yea, and (as Chriſt Jeſus the Worlds Saviour ſaith) his very laſt hour is limited; he was made of the Mould of the Earth, he ſhall return again to the Earth: And as all have one Entrance into Life, the like going out ſhall they have to Death: Nothing we brought in, nothing we shall carry out. Naked come I out of my Mothers Womb, and naked shall I return. A Change then shall come which of the wicked is to be feared, of the godly to be deſired, and of all people to be daily and hourly expected. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them that have been before you, and that ſhall come after you, that this is the Judgment of the Lord over all Fleſh to taſte of Death. <hi>All Men ſhall once die, for as much as all have ſinned, and been diſobedient unto the Laws of God.</hi> This Death of the Body is not a dying, but a departing, a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration, and <hi>Exodus</hi> of our Earthly Pilgrimage, unto our Heavenly Home; yea, a paſſage from the Valley of Death unto the Land of the Living: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Souls and Bodies are ſeparated for a while, yet ſhall they meet again in the receptacle of Bleſſed Saints and Angels with much joy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an incorruptible Crown. The Body is a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

nothing unto us, but much grief, and Age the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of long Impriſonment; wherefore if that you would but ſeriouſly conſider this, you might find Death to be rather a Friend than an Enemy, and by conſequence rather to be deſired than ſhun'd as <hi>Simeon</hi> did, as it is evident, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 29. ſaying, <hi>Now, Lord, letteſt thou thy Servant depart in peace, according to thy Word,</hi> which by ſome is uſed thus; Now, Lord, I hope that thou wilt ſuffer me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in peace, and keep my poor Immortal Soul no longer within the ſmall circumference of this Mortal Body. The Thief upon the Croſs laid down his Life moſt joyfully, becauſe he ſaw Chriſt, and did ſtedfaſtly believe, that he ſhould paſs from a place of pain and miſery, unto a Paradiſe of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſo did St. <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 7. 56.

Or elſe, Death may ſeize upon thee, <hi>For Duſt ſhall return unto the Earth as it was, and the Spirit ſhall return unto God who gave it,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 7. In a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea, at the twinkling of an Eye, when once this Tyrant Death comes, it will ſweep us all away. It is the Cuſtom among us here to let Leaſes, one, two, or three Lives, but God lets none for more than one, and this once expired, there is no hopes of getting the Leaſe renewed, he ſuffers Man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

Secondly, to try our patience whether that we will put our whole truſt, and confidence in him, although we know not the time of our departure and diſſolution; and then thirdly, to keep us in continual watchfulneſs, for if that we should know, when Death would come with a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to remove us, it would make many more careleſs than they are, though indeed the beſt of us are careleſs enough. Here Men do know the date of their Leaſes, and the expiration of the Years, but Man is meerly a Tenant at will, &amp; is put out of Poſſeſſion at leſs than an Hours warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

Wherefore let your Houſes be daily perfumed by a Morning and Evening Sacrifice of Prayer, Praiſe unto Almighty God, both which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed under the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 38. 39.

                     <q>What is your Life? It is even a Vapour that appeareth for a little time, and ufterward vaniſheth away.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THere is nothing that doth evidently ſet before Mens Eyes the Deceits of the World, and the vanity of things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as doth the due conſideration of the uncertainty, ſhortneſs and frailey of Man's Life; for all humane Pride, and the whole glory and pomp of the World (having Man's Life for a ſtay and foundation) can certainly no longer endure the ſame Life abideth; ſo that Riches, Dignities, Honours, and ſuch like, howbeit, a Man may enjoy them for a ſmall ſpace on Earth, yet do they never continue longer with him, than unto the Grave.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration whereof, together with this preſent occaſion offered, have cauſed me amongſt all other places of Holy Scripture to make choice of theſe words which I have now read unto you;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:108243:129"/>
in which (as in a moſt bright ſhining Glaſs) we may behold both the frail Conſtitution of Man's Nature, as alſo the ſhort continuance of his Life here on Earth, it being but a Vapour, and <hi>What is your Life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This whole Chapter containeth four Dehorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the firſt is from Luſt, unto the fifth Verſe; the ſecond from Pride, to the Tenth; the third from ſpeaking evil of our Neighbour, to the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth; the laſt from Preſumption of words, to the end of the Chapter; to diſſwade from which ſin, he uſeth two arguments eſpecially; the firſt is drawn <hi>Ab incertitudine rerum,</hi> from the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of things, and that's contained in the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately going before my Text, the ſecond is drawn <hi>á Vanitate Vitae,</hi> from the vanity of Man's Life, and that's ſet down in the words of my Text. Which words contain two general parts, a Queſtion and an Anſwer; <hi>What is your Life?</hi> There's the Queſtion; the Anſwer followeth in the next, <hi>It is even a Vapour,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of the Queſtion, <hi>What is your Life?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in obſerve, that Life is twofold; for there is a Created Life, and there is an Increated Life; the latter is only to be found in God, the former is a quality in the Creature, whereby it liveth, and moveth, and acteth it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now Created Life is twofold, Spiritual and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural: Again, Spiritual Life is twofold; ſometimes it is taken for the Life of Grace, which God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren only do enjoy in the Spiritual Kingdom of Chriſt in this World; which by way of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is called <hi>the Life of God;</hi> not ſo much for that it is from God, as alſo all other kinds of Life are, as becauſe God liveth in them that are his, and approveth this Life in them: And it is called (for the ſame reſpect) <hi>the Life of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:108243:129"/>
Chriſt liveth in his through a ſuper-natural Faith and Spirit; and they live unto God, and conform their Life unto his Will: And it is called <hi>a new Life, a Chriſtian Life,</hi> and a <hi>renewing of the Mind, Will</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi> This Life is oppoſed to Death in Sin, and to the old Man. Sometimes it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the Life of Glory, whereby the Soul (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ioyned again to her Body) ſhall lead a Life, which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>Spiritual;</hi> not in reſpect of the Subſtance, but of the qualities, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 44. whereby the Faithful ſhall live for ever, and it is laid up in Chriſt, and the end of the World ſhall be diſcloſed, and which is oppoſed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death, and it is called <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> Thus much of the <hi>Spiritual Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Natural Life alſo is twofold; for either it may be taken generally for the Life of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whereby they live, move, and have their being; or more particularly for the Life of Man, which natural Life in Man is the act and vigour of the Soul, ariſing from the conjunction of the Body with the Soul; this Life is given by God, continued by Meats and Drinks, and other nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary helps, and ended by Death; this is the Life properly meant in this place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is even a Vapour,</hi> &amp;c. A Vapour (according to the Philiſophers) is a thin fume extracted out of the Earth, by the Sun in the night time, but in the morning (or afore) it is ſcattered with the Wind, or diſpelled with the Sun; or elſe, if the Sun do not appear in his Brightneſs, it falleth away of it ſelf to the Earth from whence it came, or was drawn by the heat of the Sun. Such as is the nature of a Vapour, even ſuch is the Life of Man; for he is extracted out of the Earth by the Sun of Righteouſneſs, and he either periſheth before he ſeeth the Sun, or elſe in the Morning of his Youth;
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:108243:130"/>
or if he eſcape the mid and noontide of his growth, yet at the laſt he falleth away by Age to the Earth from whence he was taken. The Text thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, we may obſerve theſe Points of Doctrine for our Inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the Frailty of our Conſtitution, in theſe words, <hi>It is even a Vapour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Shortneſs of our continuance, <hi>Which appeareth for a little time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The vanity or nullity of our Life after Death, in theſe words, <hi>And afterward vaniſheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Of the Frailty of our Conſtitution; the Apoſtle doth not compare the Life of Man to Silver or Gold, or Iron, or Braſs: which are durable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; or ſome Body that is <hi>Corpus perfecte mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> that is, perfectly mixed or compounded of the four Elements; but to a Vapour that is <hi>Corpus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecte mixtum,</hi> that is, ſuch a Body that is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly mixed; and that for two Reaſons: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath not <hi>perfectum Miſcibilium numerum,</hi> that is, all the Elements in it; then alſo becauſe it hath not <hi>perfectum Mixtionis modum,</hi> the true man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a mixt Body, and therefore it vanisheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into Air; either <hi>per attenuationem,</hi> by rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and attenuation (as the Philoſopher ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) <hi>aut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>per conderſationem,</hi> when it returneth to the Earth from whence it came<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And well might this our Apoſtle compare the Life of Man to ſuch an Imperfect Body as a Vapour is: For firſt, if we conſider our Birth, we are brought forth in the danger of our ſelves and them that bear us. Our Feet are not our own, neither are they able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the bulk and trunk of our Body; our Tongues are not our own, our Hands are not our own; but we lye bound and wrapped for many Months toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; we Live, and yet we ſeem not to breathe;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:108243:130"/>
in our Youth we are liable to many Diſeaſes: If it be true that the Phyſicians ſay, our Eyes are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to an hundred Perils, how much more is the whole Body? Some cry, My Head, My Head, as the <hi>Shunamites</hi> Child; ſome are troubled with lame Legs, as <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> ſome with Gouty Feet, as <hi>Aſa;</hi> ſome are pained in the Belly, as <hi>Jeremy.</hi> This is that miſerable Frailty which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſignifieth in theſe words; Almighty God ſaid unto his Prophet, <hi>Cry;</hi> and the Prophet anſwered, <hi>What ſhall I cry?</hi> God ſaid unto him, <hi>All Fleſh is Graſs, and all the glory thereof like the Flower of the Field, the Graſs withereth, the Flower fadeth away, but the Word of the Lord continueth for ever:</hi> Upon theſe words St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith thus; Truely it is even ſo, for the glory of Man flouriſheth in the Fleſh like unto Graſs; which although it ſeem to be great, it is in very deed but little; it buddeth like a Flower, and fadeth like Graſs, ſo that it hath no more but a certain flouriſhing in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and no firmneſs and ſtability in the Fruit. For what firmneſs can there be in the matter of Fleſh? Or what good things (of any long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance) are to be found in ſo weak a Subject? To day thou maiſt ſee a young Man, in the flourishing time of his Age, with great Strength, Luſty, and jetting up and down in the Streets in great Bravery, with a jolly lofty Countenance; and if it ſo fall out, that this very next Night he be taken with ſome Diſeaſe, thou shalt ſee him the next day with a Face ſo far altered and changed, that whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſeemed very amiable and beautiful, he shall now ſeem ill-favoured, miſerable and loathſom to behold; nay, Mans Fading away is ſuch, and ſo ſudden oftentimes, that there can be no reaſon given of his Death; for many have gone to Bed well in the Even, that in the Morning have bee
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:108243:131"/>
found dead in their Beds; and many ſuddenly have dropped down in the Highways and Streets, as they have walked about their Affairs: And this is no wonder, if we conſider the Subſtance of Mans Body, which being a Building compact of green Clay, is eaſily overthrown with a ſmall puff of Wind. This being then the frailty of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, the conſideration thereof ſhould be uſed, to put away and abandon our natural Pride, and make us humble our ſelves under the Hand of God. An Example hereof we have in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Gen. 18. 27. Behold, I have begun to ſpeak to my Lord, who am but Duſt and Aſhes.</hi> Mark here how the conſideration of his frail condition, made him to abaſe and caſt down himſelf in the ſight of God: In like manner, if we could but conſider how Frail we are, it would ſtraightway pull down our Peacocks Feathers, and make us with <hi>Job,</hi> to abhor our ſelves in Duſt and Aſhes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The next Point I am to treat of, is the ſhortneſs of our continuance, intimated in theſe words, <hi>Which appeareth for a little time,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Man that is Born of a Woman</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) is of ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance and full of Miſeries; he ſhooteth forth as a Flower, and is cut down; he vaniſheth alſo as a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and continueth not,</hi> Job 14. 1, 2. In which words, in that <hi>Job</hi> compared Man to a Shadow and a Flower, he notably ſetteth forth the ſhort continuance of Mans Life; a Shadow we ſee, if the Sun be never ſo little overclouded, it vaniſheth away; and a Flower, we know, is a comely and beautiful thing, yet for all that, there is nothing ſound more ſading and vaniſhing; even ſo Man du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of his Childhood and flouriſhing Youth, ſeemeth to be of a wonderful Comelineſs, but his Beauty is of ſmall Price, becauſe it is more brittle than Glaſs, ſeeing that Man carrieth always
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:108243:131"/>
the Cauſe of Death in his Veins and Bowels. We ſee at this day, what a great matter it is for one to live Threeſcore and Ten, or Fourſcore years, and this is commonly the ordinary Race of Mans Life; inſomuch as when they live ſo long, they account themſelves not to be evil dealt withal, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſignifieth when he ſaith, The days of Man are at the uttermoſt but Threeſcore and Ten Years; and if the Strongeſt do reach to Fourſcore, what followeth is but labour and grief. Now if we ſhould deduct thoſe years which Infancy and Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ſpendeth, if alſo we ſhould take away that time which paſſeth away when we ſleep, it would be a ſmall number of Years that would remain; which remnant if we ſhould compare with the Life to come, it would ſeem but as a drop of Water compared with the whole Sea; ſo ſhort is his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Life in regard of that which laſteth always. Neither is our Life ſo ſhort only, but as it is ſhort, ſo is it uncertain, how long it shall continue; for though there is nothing more certain than Death, yet is there nothing more uncertain than the hour of Death; and therefore a certain Philoſopher compared the Lives of Men to Bubbles that are made in Water pits, when it raineth, of the which ſome do vanish away ſuddenly, even at their very riſing; others do endure a little longer, and out of hand are decayed; others do continue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, and others leſs: So that although they do all endure but ſome little time, yet (in that little) there is great variety. This being then the shortneſs and uncertainty of our Lives, it should teach us ſo much the rather to embrace our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Counſel in the Thirteenth of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>Watch, becauſe ye know not the day nor the hour:</hi> The which is as much as if he had more plainly ſaid, Becauſe ye know not that Hour, watch every
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:108243:132"/>
hour; and becauſe ye know not that day, watch every day; and becauſe ye know not the Month and the Year, watch therefore every Month and Year. And to make this matter more plain by a Similitude: If thou ſhouldeſt be invited to a Feaſt, and being ſet at the Table, ſeeſt before thee many and ſundry ſorts of Meats, a Friend of thine ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admoniſheth thee, that among ſo many dainty Diſhes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is one Poyſoned; what in this Caſe wouldſt thou do? which of them dareſt thou touch or raſte of? wouldſt thou not ſuſpect them all; I think (though thou wert extremely hungry) thou wouldſt refrain from all, for fear of that one where the Poyſon is. It is made manifeſt unto thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that in one of thy ſeventy Years, thy Death lieth hidden from thee, and thou art utterly Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant which year that ſhall be, how then can it be, but that thou muſt ſuſpect them all, and fear them all? O that we underſtood the ſhortneſs of our Life! how great Profit and Commodity ſhould we then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the Meditation thereof!</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and laſtly, the vanity and nullity of our Life after Death, intimated in theſe words, <hi>and afterward vaniſheth away:</hi> The whole Courſe of Mans Life is but a flying Shadow, a little ſpot of time between two Eternities, which will quickly diſappear; the ſame Earth which we now ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently tread upon, may ſuddainly receive us into her cold Imbraces. Well may Life then be ſaid to be vaniſhing away, Though now we are in perfect Health, yet before to morrow ſome dear Friend or other may paſſionately follow our Hearſe to the Grave. Our time paſt is like a Bird fled from the Hand of the owner out of ſight, and our preſent time is vaniſhing away, and on Earth we have no abiding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:108243:132"/>But here conſider, if Life be ſo vaniſhing and uncertain a thing, then</p>
                  <p>1. This reproveth thoſe that Squander away their precious time, as if their abode on Earth would be too long to prepare for Eternity, if they did not miſpend it half; but it is time for us to cry out, <hi>The time paſt is more than enough to have wrought the Will of the Fleſh,</hi> 1. Pet. 4. 3. or as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 13, 14. 'Tis high time to awake out of Sleep.</p>
                  <p>2. If Life be thus vaniſhing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then be not over ſolicitous as to future Events, but willingly ſubmit to a Divine Providence; be not ſo much concerned for to Morrow, do not cumber your ſelves with too much Proviſion for a ſhort Voyage.</p>
                  <p>3. If Life be thus ſhort and vaniſhing, then do much work in a little time; ſhall we looſe any of that time which is ſo fleeting and ſo uncertain. And thus I have briefly ſhown you the frailty of the Life of Man, and the profitable uſe we might make of this Conſideration, That our Life is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>4. If Life be ſo ſhort and uncertain, then <hi>look upon every day as your laſt;</hi> ſo did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>I die d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>l,</hi> as there is nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than Death, ſo there is nothing more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than the time of Death. We are all <hi>Tenants at Will,</hi> and therefore the great Landlord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth may turn us out of our <hi>Clay Houſes</hi> when he pleaſeth. It was a worthy Cuſtom of a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor that would have his Man come every morning to his Bed ſide, and pronounce theſe Words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Remember thou art a dying Man;</hi> certainly ſuch are juſtly to be reproved, who look upon Death as at a great diſtance from them. It is a common ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:108243:133"/>
of ſome, that they <hi>thought no more of ſuch a thing, than of their dying day;</hi> ſurely it argues a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked frame of Heart to be ſo forgetful of <hi>Death,</hi> when 'tis that we are to expect <hi>every minute,</hi> and know not but each day that comes <hi>may be our laſt.</hi>

                     <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 2. and they indeed are and ſhall be unto me, and I unto them a Crown of rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and on their behalf I pray, that their Faith may grow exceedingly, and that their Love unto Jeſus Chriſt, and unto all Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may every day more and more abound, and I commend them unto God, who is able to keep them from falling, and to preſent them faultleſs before the preſence of his glory with exceeding Joy.</p>
                  <p>As for others, I am jealous over them with a Godly Jealouſie (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually praying, that they may not be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, but that they may hold faſt the myſtery of Faith in a pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>

                  <p>But here I know the timerous Soul will object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this truth, and ſay, Oh, how can the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſo earneſtly deſire to be with Chriſt in the fulneſs of Glory? were it indeed but a ſhort ſtep into Glory, or were the way ſtrewed with Roſes and Flowers, and with all the <hi>Spices</hi> of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, it might be ſo, but there is a Lion in the way (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks in another caſe) there is <hi>Death</hi> the King of Fears, that ſtands ſrowning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul at the laſt caſt when the Soul is upon its very <hi>Entrance</hi> into Chriſt, his prepared Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of eternal Glory; and therefore it were more deſirable, to dwell ſafely upon the Earth in a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Heaven made up of the greateſt worldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and the moſt delightful creature Comfort, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to venture over the terrible mountain of Death (the very Epitomy of all Diſcouragements) into the doubtful poſſeſſion of thoſe inviſſible Depths of ſpiritual Glory, which the Scripture tells us, is only attainable after this Life.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that by nature of this Objection, you may preſently know the name of the Objector. It comes from off a carnal heart, and fully ſpeaks the temper an <hi>Epi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:108243:136"/>
Chriſt in the fulneſs of Glory, and that eſpecially when the believing Soul looks upon <hi>Death</hi> under theſe Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that to die is no worſe a rhing than to tread in the very ſteps of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> we might indeed have been afraid to die if <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had not firſt ſtept into the cold grave before us, but if we will ſhew our ſelves true Soldiers unto Chriſt our Captain, we muſt not fear to venture, where he hath broken the way before us; Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath died that he might by his Death procure the Death of Death, and that he might free Believers from the fear of Death, the ſting being taken out of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Death is only ordained to refine, and not to ruine Nature, Death ends our ſins and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and not our life, as it may be made out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you by this following Illuſtration, thoſe Trees, which ſeem dead in the Winter, yet they revive in the Spring, becauſe the Body and the Arms of the Tree, they are joyned to the Root, where the Sap lies all the Winter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by means of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction the Root it conveys life unto all the parts of the Tree. And the Bodies of Believers they have the Winter to, when as they are turned into the Duſt, but their Life it is hid with Chriſt, at laſt they are revived and raiſed up into Glory.</p>
                  <p>Now here you may obſerve the great difference of Tempters, according to the various Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Mens Spirits; the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> he dares not die for fear of being put out of his being, and the proſane Perſon he dares not die for fear of exchanging his preſent bad being for a worſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>God could as eaſily have received all his redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ones into the immediate imbraces of Divine Love and Glory, without letting them know what it was to be tempted, to be afflicted or to die, but only for the better ſweetning and endearing fulneſs of Glory to them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Deaths mortal Wound, it is but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to an immortal weight of Glory.

Death it is the <hi>Saturday</hi> or laſt day of our Weekly labours, which uſhers in a <hi>Sabbath</hi> of eternal reſt.

                  <p>The Believer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Afflictions upon Earth, they are fore-runners of Deliverances, they are as throws to the Birth of future Comforts. The Whale which ſwallowed up <hi>Jonah,</hi> God appointed as the means of bringing himſelf to the Shore. And ſo the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which we often times think may ſwallow us up, it brings us to our harbour Death, it lands us ſafely upon Glory.

                  <p>THE Scripture will afford us many Texts for <hi>Funerals.</hi> Methinks there is none more fit, nor more ordinarily Preached on than two: And they are both of them <hi>Voices from Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One was to <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet. He was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to cry. <hi>The Voice ſaid, Cry. And he ſaid, What ſhall I cry? All Fleſh is Graſs, and all the goodlineſs thereof, is as the Flower of the Field.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will ſay, That is a fit Text indeed; ſo is this here; A <hi>Voice from Heaven too.</hi> But St. <hi>John</hi> is not commanded to cry it, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was; he is commanded to write it.</p>

                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:108243:144"/>That that is written is for the more aſſurance. <hi>It ſeemeth good to me</hi> (ſaith St: <hi>Luke</hi> in his Preface to his Goſpel) <hi>Moſt excellent</hi> Theophilus, <hi>To write to thee of thoſe things in order, that thou mighteſt know the certainty.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> had his Sepulchre in his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> at the Publicans Feaſt, falls into a ſerious diſcourſe of his Paſſion, and Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to teach us that in times and places of greateſt Pleaſure, we ſhould put our ſelves upon Theams of Mortality. Heathens indeed had their Burying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places without their Cities, but Chriſtians in and about their Churches, as ſignifie that in our Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we ſhould think upon our diſſolutions, which was one reaſon why <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> uſed to confeſs, that dead Men were his beſt Friends; they gave him ſound and ſeaſonable Counſel, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Mortality here, and provide for Eternity hereafter.</p>
                  <p>To this end; St. <hi>John</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> is ſometimes adviſing us to make Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Death.</p>
                  <p>And ſometimes encouraging us againſt the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Death, by deſcribing the glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Saints departed, as in this Text, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>From whence we may obſerve that they that die in a ſtate of Grace, live in a ſtate of Glory. This Obſervation I take to be the Scope and Quinteſſence of the Text, and therefore ſhall make it the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subject of my preſent Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt by way of Explication, to ſhew what it is to die in the Lord. That implies two things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially. 1. To die in the Lord is to die for the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:108243:144"/>
Confeſſion of the Faith. 2. To die in the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Faith of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>3. And laſtly, To die in the Lord, is to die in the peace of a good Conſcience. A Conſcientious Man dies Bleſſedly, howſoever, or whenſoever, or whereſoever he dies; therefore when St. <hi>Paul</hi> had received the Summons of Death, he fled to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of his good Conſcience; there he ſat like <hi>Noah</hi> in his Cabbin, in an Ark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pitch'd within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. I am ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand; and here is my Comfort, <hi>I ſhall go to my Grave with a Conſcience as clean as my Winding-ſheet;</hi> it follows, <hi>I have fought a good Fight, finiſhed my Courſe, kept the Faith, henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Truth is confirmed by a double Reaſon, <hi>They Reſt from their Labours, and their Works follow them.</hi> Their Bleſſedneſs conſiſts in two things. 1. In a ceſſation from all Sin and Miſery, <hi>They Reſt,</hi> &amp;c. 2. In a poſſeſſion of all Glory and Felicity, <hi>Their Works follow them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>They Reſt,</hi> &amp;c. The Kingdom of Heaven is often in Scripture termed a Reſt, a place of Reſt.</p>
                  <p>The World indeed is a troubled Sea, but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is the Haven of Reſt; the World is an <hi>Egypt,</hi> a place of Burden and Bondage, but Heaven is a <hi>Canaan,</hi> that reſembled by the Boſom of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a place of ſweet Refreſhment, and <hi>Soul-ſatisfying Reſt.</hi>

Labour of their particular Calling and Vocation, which is toilſome and troubleſome, ever ſince God paſt this Doom upon Man for his offence in Paradiſe, <hi>In the Sweat of thy Brows ſhalt thou eat Bread.</hi> Indeed, Man in the ſtate of Innocency, was not excuſed from La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: Paradiſe, which was <hi>Adams</hi> Store-houſe, was his Work-houſe too; God put him into the Garden, not to ſleep in thoſe ſweet Bowers, not to ſpend his time idly in thoſe pleaſant Walks, but to dreſs and keep it (<hi>ut operaretur</hi>) that he might work and labour in it, only here is the difference, Labour then was a Recreation to the Mind, and now it is an Affliction to the Body.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond-Reaſon is laid down in the laſt words of the Text, <hi>Their Works follow them,</hi> therefore they are Bleſſed: Their Happineſs is not only privative, conſiſting in a freedom from Sin and Miſery, but poſitive alſo, in a poſſeſſion of all Peace and Glory, in a conſummation of Grace, in a perfect Fruition of God, and a Bleſſed Communion with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Their Works follow them,</hi> not their Works in kind, but their Works in Iſſue and Effect, the Fruits and Reward of their Works, the Bleſſings of God which lye in the Promiſes to Works of Piety and Charity, Theſe follow them to Heaven: Indeed Faith leads the way, that muſt be our Harbinger to take up our Lodging in the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> that like the Star in the Eaſt, leads us to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where Chriſt is, but then good Works follow after, they are our Attendants to the Court and Kingdom of Glory.</p>
                  <p>The Uſe, If the Saints departed reſt from their Labours, here is then comfort in the general a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Croſſes and Calamities in the World, and in particular againſt the fear of our own Death, or the Death of Friends.</p>

                     <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead, they reſt,</hi> &amp;c. Death (like <hi>Lot</hi>'s Angels) plucks us out of the <hi>Sodom</hi> of Sin and Miſery, and placeth us in <hi>Zoar,</hi> a City of Reſt and Tranquility: Like <hi>Peter</hi>'s Angel, it ſhakes off the Chain of Mortality, and opens the Iron-gate, the Gate of Pearl into the <hi>New Jeruſalem;</hi> like <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Angel, it conducts the Soul from Earth to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Boſom, from this Vail of Tears to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory. Moreover, as Death helps us to our Reſt, ſo it is our Reſt: Why ſhould we fear it?</p>
                  <p>The Scripture terms it but a taking away of the Soul to Peace, a ſweet Sleep of the Body. <hi>Our friend</hi> Lazarus <hi>ſleepeth,</hi> and the Patriarchs are fallen aſleep, St. <hi>Stephen</hi> fell aſleep: Our Burying-places are but <hi>Dormitories,</hi> Sleeping-places. <hi>The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is taken away from the Evil to come; and he ſhall enter into Peace, they ſhall reſt in their Beds.</hi> Such a Bleſſed Reſt have the Righteous in Death; as our Saviour wept, becauſe his Friend <hi>Lazarus</hi> was to be deprived of it; it is both the Obſervation of an Ancient Father, and the Reſolution of an Ancient Council, concerning Chriſts weeping over <hi>Lazarus,</hi> John 11. 35. <hi>Doluit</hi> Lazarum, <hi>non dormientem, ſed reſurgentem.</hi> Chriſt did not weep becauſe <hi>Lazaras</hi> was dead, and taken out of the World, but becauſe he was to return from the Grave into a Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome World after he was gone to his Reſt.</p>
                  <p>It may be for the ſame Reaſon, the <hi>Thracians</hi> of old uſed to lament at the Birth of their Children, but rejoice at their Funeral.</p>
                  <p>The time will come that we muſt part with our <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s, our <hi>Benjamin</hi>'s, neareſt Friends, and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Comforts. Then remember my Text; if they <hi>die in the Lord,</hi> take no care for them, they are Bleſſed, they are at their Reſt.</p>

                  <p>1. An impoſſibility of Recovery, <hi>He ſhall not come to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. An aſſured Hope of meeting again in Heaven, <hi>But I ſhall go to him.</hi> He ſhall not come to me, that would be for his loſs, to part with his Reſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for a reſtleſs condition on Earth; but I ſhall go to him, I have not loſt him for ever, we ſhall meet again as comfortably as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> met in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> meet again in Heaven and never part. Now you know it never troubles us to ſee the Sun ſet, becauſe we know it will riſe again in the Morning; it never troubles us to part with a Friend when he goes to Bed, becauſe we hope to ſee him again in the Morning. Beloved, the Death of a Friend is but like the ſetting of the Sun, or the uncloathing of a Man when he goes to Red, there will be a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearing in the Morning of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> condemns immoderate ſorrow for the dead, <hi>I would not have you ſorrow as thoſe that have no hope.</hi> Nature will be ſorrowful, but let Grace moderate the ſorrow, and keep it within the bounds of hope; and the ground of hope is ſet down, <hi>If ye believe that Jeſus died, and is riſen again, even ſo alſo them that ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the Scripture mention ſome that ſhall not die, as they that ſhall be found alive at the Coming of Chriſt to Judgment. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:108243:146"/>
plain terms, <hi>we ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall be changed.</hi> The meaning is, they ſhall not ſo ſleep, as to continue in the ſtate of the dead, but be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an Eye; yet ſuch a change, as they ſhall have a diſſolution, and in the ſame moment, a redintegration, a real Death, and a real Reſurrection, though no ſleeping in the Grave of Corruption.</p>
                  <p>You ſee one Generation paſſing, and another Generation coming, one Friend and Neighbour drops into the Grave after another, and when your turn ſhall be you know not. This you may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of, Death will come certainly, and it may be ſpeedily, it may be ſuddenly. <hi>What Man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee Death?</hi> Pſal. 89. 48.</p>
                  <p>Now I beſeech you embrace and improve theſe few directions, in order to a Pious Life, and a Peaceable Death.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if you would live to the Lord, and die in the Lord, labour for exemplary purity of Life: <hi>Not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom, but he that doth the Will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you would live to the Lord, and die in the Lord, give the World a Bill of Divorcement, otherwiſe it will clip your Wings, and clog your Souls, and hinder your purſuit of Heaven; there is nothing in all the World that is worthy of your Affections, nothing but what is tranſitory, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory, and therefore look on it and paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> ſpeaks of a Land which had abundance of Curious Flowers in it, but no Corn for Bread to ſatisfie the Peoples Hunger; the World is very like that Land, here are many Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which may pleaſe our Sences and our Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies, but here is no Corn for Bread, no ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſatisfying Comforts.</p>

                  <p>In the former Verſe we have conſidered and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Confeſſion of <hi>Job</hi>'s Faith in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As living or eternal.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As riſing from the Dead, or raiſing the Dead to Life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As judging both the Quick and Dead. He in theſe two Verſes enlargeth the Confeſſion of his Faith concerning his own perſonal Reſurrection. Which,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He aſſerts in the Cloſe of the 26th Verſe, <hi>In my fleſh ſhall I ſee God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the ſtrong actings of his Faith he aſſureth himſelf of it, notwithſtanding all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that might obſtruct and hinder it in the 26th Verſe, and in the Cloſe of the 27th. <hi>Though after my Skin Worme deſtroy this Body; though my Reins be conſumed within me,</hi> yet I believe I ſhall ſee God: Theſe Impediments do not weaken my Faith.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He declares the Benefit or Happineſs which ſhall accrew unto him after the Reſurrection of his Body, which he doth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In thoſe words, <hi>I ſhall ſee God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In thoſe, <hi>I ſhall ſee him for my ſelf.</hi> In both which Expreſſions, he ſets forth the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Saints after the raiſing of their Bodies but of the Grave, and the re-union of Soul and Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:108243:151"/>Fourthly, He maintains the identity of his fleſh or body in the Reſurrection, or that the ſame body which falls ſhall riſe. And this is in a twofold notion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, An identity ſpecificial, it ſhall be the ſame Body in kind.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, An identity numerical, or individual, ſhall be the ſame particular Body he had on Earth, and laid down in the Earth. Both which are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced and evinced from thoſe paſſages in the Text: <hi>I ſhall ſee him in my fleſh; Mine eye ſhall behold, and not another. I, my, mine, and not another,</hi> imply no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if not himſelf, or no other thing but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>From all we may collect, how excellent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith <hi>Job</hi> made about that great myſtery of the Reſurrection, and how firmly his Soul was eſtabliſhed in it.</p>
                  <p>Verſe 26. <hi>And though after my Skin Worms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſtroy this Body.</hi> As if he had more largely ſaid; `After I am dead, and laid in the Grave, where Worms do not only eat my Skin, and conſume this upper Garment, but my whole Body alſo: yea, and not only the outward Limbs and Members of my Body, but my very Bowels and Entrals. Though my Reins be conſumed within me: though Worms devour, and rottenneſs invade whatſoever I am, or have of a Body, though I am ſpent from Head to Toe, from Skin to Reins, without and within, yet notwithſtanding all this, I believe that I ſhall riſe again, and ſee God in my fleſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And mine Eyes ſhall behold, and not anoother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have in this Text, <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>behold.</hi> The word in the original is different from what we had before, <hi>I ſhall behold him.</hi> It ſignifies more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So here, <hi>Mine eye ſhall behold him:</hi> That is, I ſhall even ſet my ſelf to take a view of him, to gather up (as it were) into my ſelf the Idea's of his divine Perfections, and ſo to receive all thoſe delight and contents which ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The joy which I ſhall then receive ſhall not be of any report or narrative that others ſhall give me of the Glory of God. I ſhall ſee with mine own Eyes, not others, or not by another.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge we have here, is but like that which the <hi>Samaritans</hi> had of Chriſt by the Womans report; but that which we ſhall have in Heaven ſhall be like that which they had of Chriſt when himſelf came perſonally among them, and ſpake immediately. Or we may illuſtrate it by that of the Queen of the <hi>South:</hi> The knowledge which we have of God here, and of his Glory and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is like that of the Queen of the <hi>South</hi> in her own Country; there ſhe had a report of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Perſon, of his Government, of his Riches and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſuch a report, as did not only affect and

aſtoniſh her, but provoke her to undertake that great Journey, that ſhe might ſee for her ſelf, and her Eyes behold, and not another; and when ſhe came to the Court at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and beheld <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Perſon and Attendance, when ſhe obſerved the ſervice of his Table, and heard his wiſdom, there was no more Spirit in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When we come to the Court of Heaven, as the Queen of the <hi>South</hi> to <hi>Solomons</hi> Court, and there behold how much God is beyond, and above all that we have hitherto heard of him here at home in our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we ſhall be rapt up into admiration, and there ſhall be indeed no more of this low and narrow Spirit in us for ever.</p>
                  <p>All theſe conceptions about, and interpretations of the Text, are pious and profitable; but that which I rather take to be the proper meaning of theſe words (<hi>Mine Eye ſhall behold, and not another</hi>) is this; <hi>Job</hi> (as was touched in giving the analyſis of theſe two Verſes) ſpeaks here of the Identity of his fleſh in the Reſurrection: <hi>I ſhall ſee him, I ſhall ſee him for my ſelf, mine Eyes ſhall behold him, and not another.</hi> That is, <hi>I, the Man</hi> who ſtand here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, the ſame who <hi>Job</hi> now ſpeaketh; I the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame numerical Perſon ſhall ſee God in this very flesh, and with theſe eyes; they shall be indeed new dreſſed and dyed, trimmed, and made fit to come into the preſence of the great and glorious God; yet it shall be even this flesh, and theſe Eyes, in which I shall come into the Preſence of God, and and behold my Redeemer. I shall be altered from what I was, but I shall not be another than I was, I shall be changed into a better condition, but I shall not be changed into another perſon. My
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:108243:152"/>
qualities shall have a perfective alteration, but I shall retain the ſame matter, and be the ſame man. A man raiſed glorious and immotal, is what he was, except his Morality, and hath no more than he had, except his Glory. The Philoſopher acknowledgeth there may be a ſpecificial, but not a numerical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of that which is corrupted. But <hi>Job</hi>'s Faith was clearer than <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s reaſon: He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved a Perſonal Reſurrection, <hi>Mine Eye ſhall behold, and not another;</hi> I shall not be changed into another Perſon, whatever changes I undergo, I shall be <hi>Job</hi> ſtill, the ſame <hi>Job.</hi> Hence obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every Man at the Reſurrection ſhall receive the ſame Body that now he hath, and be the ſame M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>One of the Antients hath a large Diſcourſe upon this ſubject, wherein he diſcovers ſome, who tho' they granted the Soul immortal, yet denied the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the ſame Body: Such were the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites, Baſilidians,</hi> and <hi>Valentinians.</hi> Theſe, ſaith he, went halves with the <hi>Sadduces</hi> in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Sadduces</hi> denied Spirits. Hence (<hi>Act;</hi> 23. 6.) <hi>Paul</hi> perceiving that the Aſſembly was mixed of <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> (and wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that if he did but mind them of their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences between themſelves, they would not ſo ſtrongly agree and combine againſt him) he made his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it, by profeſſing openly that he was a <hi>Phariſee.</hi> And the ſacred Hiſtorian tells us what the peculiar tenents of the <hi>Sadduces</hi> were, (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) <hi>The Sadduces ſay there is no Reſurrection, neither Angel nor Spirit,</hi> (they denied both) <hi>but the Phariſees confeſs both.</hi> They held, that there were immortal Spirits or Souls, united to the bodies of Men, that thoſe bodies ſhould ariſe, and be reunited to the Soul. They alſo confeſſed that there were Angels, who are Spirits ſubſiſting properly without Bodies Now, as the <hi>Sadduces</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:108243:153"/>
the Reſurrection of the Body, ſo others deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Reſurrection of the ſame Body: Theſe he calleth ſharers or halvers in the <hi>Sadduces</hi> Opinion; though not ſo groſly as they, yet too too groſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the Faith. And indeed, they who deny the Reſurrection of the ſame body, do (by implication) altogether deny the Reſurrection of the body: For if the ſame numerical Body ſhould not riſe, it could not be called a Reſurrection; Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is the riſing of that which fell, and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of that which was before laid down: So that it would be the Creation of a new Body, not the Reſurrection of the old, if it were not the ſame Body. And it conduceth much to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Saints, and may be the terrour of wicked Men, to keep cloſe to the Faith of this Article. The Apoſtle ſeems to touch it (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10.) <hi>We ſhall all appear before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things he hath done in his Body, according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> That hand which hath been doing for Chriſt, that very Tongue which hath been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Chriſt, that whole Body which hath been moved, and acted for Jeſus Chriſt, as an inſtrument of his Glory, that ſhall receive the Reward: As alſo that Hand, that Eye, that Tongue, that Foot which hath moved, and ſtirred againſt Chriſt, that alſo ſhall be puniſhed, and receive according to the evil committed in the Body. Judgment would not be exact, unleſs as there hath been a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partnerſhip between Soul and Body in their works, ſo alſo they ſhould be co-Partners both in reward and puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, how can the ſame numerical Body riſe again, eſpecially in ſuch caſes, when thouſands of Carcaſſes are mingled, and their Duſt promiſcuouſly heapead together, or ſcattered abroad?

When the Bodies of Men are devoured by wild Beaſts, and digeſted into the ſubſtance of Fowls and Fishes, eſpecially when the Bodies of Men are eaten and concocted into the Bodies of other Men? How can theſe numerical Bodies riſe? I anſwer, firſt, if we will not reſt in matters of Faith, till we have a clear rational account of them, our Faith may quickly be at a ſtand. I anſwer, ſecondly, that as it is eaſie to make Objections againſt Faith, ſo Faith hath one anſwer as eaſie as theſe Objections. The Apoſtle gives it, and into that all ſuch doubts muſt be reſolved (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20.) For having ſhewed the preſent condition, or diſpoſition of the Spirit of Saints in the former Verſe; <hi>Our Converſation is in Heaven, from whence alſo we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He preſently ſhewes what the future condition of the Saints Bodies ſhall be. <hi>Who ſhall change our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Our dead Siſter ſpeaks firſt in the dignity of her Extraction, fairly proclaim'd to you by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauldry of her Hearſe, but fairer far in the ſuitable Character of her Life, the worthineſs of her Birth had no other influence on her, but to engage her to worthineſs of Action, which ſhe ſo nobly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, that the Vertue of her Life dignified the Honour of her Deſcent; ſo the Glory ſhe received from her Father on Earth, by the Acts of Humility, and Charity, ſhe enhanſed to the glorifying her Father which is in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Her Beauty, which was a depoſitory from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſhe beautified with ſo much Piety, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo much Religion, as if ſhe had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to preſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both the Luſtre and the Vertues of the Celeſtial Bodies in her Epi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Her Reproofs, like Lightning, quick, but ſhort, ſuch as would melt the Blade, yet not ſinge the Scabbard; kill the Sin, but preſerve the Sinner.</p>

                     <p>Her Attire neither fordid nor curious, nor too early in, nor too late out of Faſhion; not like thoſe Muſhroom Gentry, who declare their late riſe from Peaſantry and Poverty by the Herauldry of the Dirt and Rags on their Back.</p>
                     <p>Her Table was both wholeſome and handſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſatisfie the Stomach of the hungry, and well enough to fancy the Palate of the Curious: yea when the Sword had Carved her Meat to the fifth part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her good Chear was as much as ever.</p>
                     <p>Her Viſits were like the Sun's, beneficial where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e're ſhe came, and treading in her Saviours ſteps, <hi>She went up and down doing good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>Her Affection was great as <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s, wonderful and paſſing the love of Women, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 26.</p>
                     <p>Marriage made her Husband and her one Fleſh, but Love made them one Soul.

ſo her Husband wore the principality, ſhe received influence from him, and gave conformity to him. <hi>But a Vertuous Woman is a Crown to that Head,</hi> Prov. 12. 14. ſo ſhe gave ſafety, plenty, and honour to her head, as <hi>Crown</hi> may ſignifie. <hi>The Heart of her Husband did faſely truſt in her ſhe did do him good and not ill all the days of her life.</hi> Longer ſhe is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged;—<hi>Till death us depart</hi>—was their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Death ends her natural Relation, and enters her into a Divine; which ſhe began here by her Religion.</p>

What is ſaid in my Text, as it is likely you have often heard it with your Ears, ſo now you may ſee it accompliſhed, <hi>It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto all men once to dye. Death</hi> hath long ſince come into our Nation, and hath ſummoned many to make their appearance in another World; yea, you know that <hi>Death</hi> hath already entred into our Streets, and hath not been afraid to ſtep over our <hi>Threſhold,</hi> and to ſeize upon thoſe that have been ſtanding round about us; yea, it hath come into our very <hi>Bed-Chambers,</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:108243:161"/>
and hath ſuddenly ſnatched away thoſe that have been lying in our very Boſoms: ſo that we have had warning enough of the near approaches of <hi>Death</hi> unto our ſelves, and without doubt ſome of us have had the Sentence of <hi>Death within our ſelves,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh;) and therefore it is high time for you and I ſeriouſly to conſider what is ſaid in my Text, <hi>It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Something we ſhall briefly ſpeak now in order to the explanation of the words, that ſo you may once more hear (before you feel) the meaning of them; It is <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi> or <hi>enacted</hi> by the Court of Heaven; <hi>Statutum eſt,</hi> it is a Statute or Law (more firm and certain than the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi>) which is never to be repealed or abrogated. We are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore telling you of what may, but of what muſt inevitably come to paſs. It is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>unto Men,</hi> that is as much as to ſay, unto all men, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, it is an indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Expreſſion, and ſo is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of all the ſame kind, without ſome ſpecial exception from this general Rule. And indeed ſuch an exception there is to be found in the Scripture; for, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We ſhall not all Dye, but ſome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108243:162"/>
ſhall be Changed, in a Moment, in the twin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling of an Eye;</hi> So that this general Rule in my <hi>Text</hi> is to be underſtood with an <hi>Exceptis excipiendis:</hi> There ſhall be ſome at the end of the World, who ſhall not paſs under <hi>Death,</hi> but yet they muſt paſs under a <hi>Change,</hi> which is thought will be equivalent unto <hi>Death.</hi> But for the preſent time and according to the common Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and courſe of Providence, no Man or Woman hath any ground to expect that they ſhall eſcape the Stroke of <hi>Death;</hi> for it is <hi>appointed unto Men,</hi> that is, unto <hi>all</hi> Men, <hi>once to Dye: Death</hi> is a ſure Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, it never miſſeth, and is certain to have its blow, and it will ſtrike home, it will hit the Nail on the Head, and it will ſmite down every one that ſtands in its way; whether Poor or Rich, young or old; it will no more ſpare him that wears a <hi>Crown</hi> upon his Head, than him that carries a <hi>Spade</hi> in his Hand, as the <hi>Poet</hi> elegantly expreſſes it:</p>

Gods, but ye ſhall dye like Men:</hi> So ſome have thought Kings to be no leſs than Gods, when they have ſeen them ſitting upon their Thrones; yet it will appear that they are no more than men, when they ſhall be ſeen lying in their <hi>Tombs.</hi> But what is the meaning of the Phraſe <hi>to Dye?</hi>

                     </gap>. I can aſſure you if you know not yet, it will not be long e're you will know the meaning of it: The Philoſopher deſcribes Death thus, <hi>Eſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatio Vitae, ob Animae ſeparationem à Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore:</hi> As <hi>Spiritual Death</hi> is the Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God from the Soul, ſo <hi>Temporal Death</hi> is the Separation of the Soul from the Body; When thoſe two (the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi>) which have like Twins, dwelt lovingly together under the ſame Roof, muſt be parted aſunder, and enjoy no more ſweet and intimate Communion one with another, till the time of re-unition at the <hi>General Reſurrection.</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, This is that which muſt <hi>once</hi> be done, every one muſt here take their turn, and that is indeed to be turned off from the Stage of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life, into the bottom of the <hi>Grave:</hi> And though this happeneth to ſome at one time, and to others at another time, yet firſt or laſt, it will happen unto all once.

The Greek word (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) which ſignifies Death, is taken from a word which ſignifies <hi>extendere,</hi> and indeed Death ſtretcheth out it ſelf ſo far, that no Man can live out of the reach of it. As ſurely as thou waſt once Born, ſo ſurely ſhalt thou once Dye; and though this is but once to be done, yet ſeeing it will be done to the purpoſe, it ſhould be more than once thought on beforehand; yet one ſerious thought of once Dying, and of what will come after, will certainly deaden the Soul as to the Actings of Sin, and quicken it unto the Actings of Grace. Let me but ask you this one plain Queſtion, and your own Conſcience ſhall be the Judge in the Caſe: Couldeſt thou ſtill remain a Drunkard or a Swearer, if thou didſt but once ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider that thou muſt once Dye? or couldſt thou ſo eagerly ſet thy Heart upon the empty, lying and dying Vanities of this World, didſt thou but once ſeriouſly conſider that thou muſt once; (and it may be before to morrow) be taken out of this World? or couldeſt thou neglect the means of Grace, or delight in Profaneſs, and ſlight Seriouſneſs and Heavenly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, didſt, thou but ſeriouſly conſider that thou muſt once Dye, and it may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> Now when you are about any badneſs, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any evil, I dare ſay you never think of this ſuddain and ſtrict account that you are to give to God of all your Thoughts, Words and Deeds: But howſoever, we ſhall next ſhew you the reaſons and grounds, why it will and muſt be thus, that all muſt dye, and that all muſt come to Judgment.

                        </gap>, for it.

Though now there ſeemeth to be little difference between the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and the Ungodly, between the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the unrighteous, between thoſe that ſerve the Lord and them that ſerve him not; yet then it will be a plain Caſe, that it was better to be a poor Believer, than a rich Unbeliever; then it will be put out of all doubt, who was the wiſeſt, and who ſhall be the happieſt Man, whether he that preferred Chriſt before the Creature, or he that valued the Creature more than Chriſt: yea then will appear a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

between the Sanctified and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified: though the Sanctified were happy in enjoying of God on Earth, in having Communion with him in Duties and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; yet will the Glorified be more, yea moſt happy, when they ſhall fully and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly enjoy immediate Communion with God, without the uſe of all means, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Philoſophical Maxim, <hi>Finis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilior eſt mediis;</hi> The principal ultimate End is more excellent in it ſelf, and more deſirable and valuable than the Means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing unto the End: But this you that have feared, loved, obeyed and ſerved the Lord in this World, will moſt underſtand in the World to come.</p>

                  <p>OH Lord our God, in thee, and by thee we live, move, and have our being: As thou didſt at the firſt breathe into Man the Breath of Life, and he became a living Soul; ſo when thou ſhalt be pleaſed to command that Breath again out of Mans Body, then will he preſently become a dead Carkaſs; and ſo ſhort is the Life of Man, that many times he doth but Cry and Dye, yea ſometimes his Mothers Womb doth prove his Tomb, ſo that he doth not once Cry to tell the World that he did once Live.</p>
                  <p>Neither is the Thred of Mans Life at any time Spun ſo ſtrong, or drawn out ſo long, but at one word of thy Mouth it is ſoon ſnapt in two: Seeing therefore we do but Live to Dye, we beſeech thee (Oh Bleſſed God) let us Dye to Live; let us live well, that ſo we may dye well; let Death never ſurprize us unlooked for, or unprepared; nor let it ever ſeize upon us in an unconverted unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate State while we live, that ſo when we Dye Corporally, we may live Spiritually and Eternally with thee in a State of Glory.</p>
                  <p>Good Lord, let us not ſo live as to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108243:170"/>
to Live any longer, or to be afraid to look grim Death in the Face, when it comes to ſeparate our Souls from our Bodies, and to ſummon our Souls to make their appearance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great Judge of the Quick and Dead. Let us with thy Servant <hi>Job</hi> wait all our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, untill our Change doth come: indeed it will be our greateſt Wiſdom to wait for Death, which always waits for us, and to expect that at all times, which <hi>will</hi> come at ſome time, and <hi>may</hi> come at any time.</p>
                  <p>Let us Pray, and Preach, and Hear, and ſo ſpend our time, as thoſe who know and conſider that all they do, they do it for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and we ſhall never have but one caſt for Eternity: Heaven and Glory is here to be won or loſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed God, thou haſt taught us in thy Word, that it is better to goe to <hi>The Houſe of Weeping, than to the Houſe of Feaſting,</hi> for that is the end of all Men, (and thou haſt ſaid <hi>That the Living will lay it to Heart:)</hi> Oh Lord, we have this day been at the <hi>Houſe of Mourning and Weeping,</hi> and we have ſeen the end of one, yea, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Friends and Acquaintance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſhort ſpace of time, (and in the Death of our Friends we may read our own Death) and yet ſhall not we who are left behind them

But ſeeing, Lord, this World is a dying World, and all its glory is a dying glory, let our Minds and Hearts therefore be ſet upon the Glory of Heaven, which is a never fading Glory: Oh did we believe and conſider how much better a Believers future Eſtate will be, than his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State is, then ſhould we think that Time is too long before we do, and that Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will be too ſhort when we ſhall enjoy our Gracious Redeemer upon his Throne of Glory: Let us ever live as thoſe that have one Foot in the Grave already. Thouſands and Millions, yea innumerable Millions of Thouſands are gone to their Graves before us, and do we think, that we that are but enlivened Duſt, animated Shadows, dying lumps of Clay, can keep our dying Bodies from being a Feaſt for Worms, or keep our Souls from being turned out of their Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Clay, from ſeeking new Lodgings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Grey hairs which are here and there upon our Heads, the deep wrinkles which are engraven upon our Foreheads, the loſs of Teeth, the Dimneſs of Sight, our Deafneſs in hearing, our Palſie-hands, our feeble trembling Limbs, and the frequent Sight of ſeeing Friends laid out in their Winding Sheets for Dead, and carried to their Houſes of Clay, the ſilent Grave, are Circumſtances and Symptoms ſerving to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind us, that the time draws near wherein we muſt Dye, and that our departure is at Hand: Let us therefore live as dying Men, and let us dye as Living Chriſtians; let us ſet our Houſe and our Heart in order, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the <hi>Text, It is appointed for all Men once to Dye, but after this the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

                     <hi>The Dead ſhall live,</hi> ſayeth my Text: Yea, I ſay theſe Subjects; theſe Dead; theſe Carkaſſes; this Duſt, inveterate Duſt; theſe under-earth Citiſens (as I ſaid before) they ſhall live, they ſhall riſe again. Though theſe Bodies have lain a long time pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefying in the earth, yet this ſhall not hinder Gods divine power; but he will raiſe them up again.</p>
                  <p>For ſhall the Potter do what he will with his clay, and ſhall not God do what he will?</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected: Firſt, that theſe ſeem to imply a main oppoſition, or rather impoſſibility; that Death, and life ſhould be coupled together. For what is Death, but a privation of life; a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul, from the Body? and yet not only Dead, but even twice Dead (as I may ſay) ſhall live, ſhall riſe again.</p>
                  <p>Another objection, or doubt that may ariſe is this. Walk but ſome pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Dead ſhall not live; they ſhall not riſe again. Why, how can this be? what doth the holy Ghoſt ſay, yea, and nay; can ſweet and bitter water come from the ſame fountain? Can ſweet, and ſower fruit come from the ſame tree? Shall they live, and not live again; and yet both true?</p>
                  <p>For the better clearing of this doubt and the reconciling of theſe places, we muſt diſtinguiſh of Life, and Reſurrection: for there is a Reſurrection unto glory: and there is a Reſurrection unto condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

of the one, and the riſing of the other.

For if the Children of God had hope only in this Life, they were of all men moſt miſerable; but here is there comfort, that though they have their Hell in this life, they ſhall have their Heaven hereafter; all which is moſt lively ſet forth in this Text.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Rachel</hi> had born ſix ſons to <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſhe ſaid God hath endowed me now with an exccllent Dowry, now will my husband dwell with me, becauſe I have born him ſix ſons.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, could we not be content to live, yea, to dye with this ſentence which hath born, and brought unto us theſe ſix places of conſolation? ſuerly it is a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence much to be embraced, for it offers exceedingly great comfort unto us.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let us often meditate of it: let us often have recourſe unto it: yea, let it be as a Sanctuary, or place of refuge for our troubled Souls to fly, and reſort unto, when as we ſhall be preſſed with any miſerie, or affliction whatſoever.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Text thus opened, and the ſenſe thereof being made clear, and manifeſt, the main Point that offers it ſelf to our conſiderations is this.</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>That there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the Bodies of the Saints at the laſt day.</hi> This for the general.</p>
                  <p>And this is a matter very comfortable to the people of God, that there ſhall be a Reſurrection: <hi>Nulla conſolatio tanta est, quanta mortuorum Reſurrectio,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Gualter.</hi> There is no conſolation of a Chriſtian ſo great in this life as is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Dead, and therefore <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> calls it the Chriſtian's hope, and ſo it is indeed; For <hi>if in this life only the Chriſtian had hope, he were of all Men most miſerable,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tolle ſpem Reſurrectionis,</hi> &amp;c. &amp; <hi>reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta erat obſervantia nimis pietatis;</hi> Take away the hope of the Reſurrection, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and you take away all care of Piety, and Godlineſs out of the World.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, what makes the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:108243:184"/>
to take ſuch pains in tilling, manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ſowing of his ground; but the Hope of a joyfull harveſt, wherein he ſhall reap the fruits of his labours?</p>
                  <p>What makes the Labourer to ſubject himſelf to ſo much pains, and labour all the day long, but that he hopes for a time of reſt wherein he may be refreſhed?</p>
                  <p>What makes the liberal and charitable Man diſperſe his wealth unto the Poor, but that he looks for a day of payment, wherein he ſhall be ſure that what he hath laid out, ſhall be payed him again, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 17.</p>
                  <p>But all this is the Reſurrection unto the Sants of God.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, it is as the Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt:</hi> For though he have Sowen in tears all his life time by reaſon of the continual afflictions thereof, yet he ſhall be ſure to reap in joy at the Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>And this did animate, and encourage them to undergo any torture of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, rather than they would be ſubject to the rack of an evil Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>And this may ſerve as a ſtrong ground of Comfort unto us, if God at any time ſhould call us to ſuffer for his Name (for
<pb facs="tcp:108243:185"/>
as yet we have not reſiſted unto bloud.</p>
                  <p>This is an honour that God doth not vouchſafe to all his Saints) ſay this may ſerve as a notable means to ſupport us in our ſufferings, that though Tyrants may rage never ſo much, and Perſecuters may wrack their malice upon the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Saints (as they did in the Primitive Church (for they caſt the Bodies of the Chriſtians to be devoured of wild beſts, nay they threw them into <hi>Rodanus,</hi> thinking, (thereby to hinder their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection) yet I ſay, let them do their worſt, and yet they can by no means diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Chriſtian of his hope of a <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reſurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that a Chriſtian in the midſt of his ſufferrings, may ſay of his tormentor, as once <hi>Socrates</hi> ſpeak of his Accuſer, <hi>occidere me poteſt, ledere vero non potest.</hi> Well may he kill me, but he ſhall never ill me. For though Perſecuters kill the body, yet they cannot berieve a Chriſtian of that Happineſs, and Glory that God hath given unto the Souls in the day of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. This is to be thought on as a means to ſupport our languiſhing Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Then it will be unto him a day of ſweet
<pb facs="tcp:108243:185"/>
reſt, wherein he ſhall be refreſhed after all his painful labours, and travails ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ſervice of God, which will be no leſs comfortable unto him, than the gladſome morning to a ſick man, which hath toſſed, and turned up and down wearily all the night long.</p>
                  <p>And it ſhall be the Chriſtians pay day alſo (ſo our Saviour calls it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 14.) becauſe then (he having his reward, with him) will come forth of every ones debt, and reward their goodneſs with glory.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch a day Beloved, there ſhall be unto all the Elect, and dear Children of God. As they have had a day of Death: ſo ſhall they have a day of Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>All the people of God that have died from the beginning of the World, or ſhall die to the end of it hereafter, are but as the ſeed ſowen in the ground, they muſt endure rottenneſs for a while: <hi>But being fowen in diſhonour, they ſhall riſe in honour: being ſown in corruption, they ſhall riſe in glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the myſteries they endured in this Life, they were but <hi>mortis praeludia,</hi> the tokens, and forerunners of Death: but let them hope, yea, let them know aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly,
<pb facs="tcp:108243:186"/>
that there will come a day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls it,) <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19. when God ſhall ſay unto theſe dry Bones, <hi>I will cauſe breath to enter into you, and you ſhall live, and will lay ſinews upon you, and will cauſe fleſh to grow upon you, and will cover you with skin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That there ſhall be a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> even things in nature probably do ſhew it. And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſends the Atheiſt to learn this leſſon from the ſeed that is ſowen in the ground. <hi>O Fool</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that which thou ſoweſt is not quickned except it die.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 36.</p>
                  <p>And the Ancient Fathers ſend us to the <hi>Phoenix</hi> of <hi>Arabia</hi> (out of whoſe Cinders, when ſhe is dead another bird ſpringeth up) to learn the ſelf ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the <hi>Phoenix</hi> is a notable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of the Reſurrection: and we want not reſſemblance thereof daily before our eyes, conſiderer but the trees of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, the flowers of the garden, and the Herbs of the field!</p>
                  <p>We ſee that the Tres in winter being deſpoiled of their Leaves, the Garden of the Flowers, and the Fields of the Graſs, do ſeem utterly to die, and to periſh: But
<pb facs="tcp:108243:186"/>
when the ſpring time comes, they putting on their green Carpets, and particoulered Garments, like <hi>Joſeph;</hi> they all wax as freſh, and flouriſhing as ever they were before: So the Body, which during the Winter of many Ages is deprived of her beauty, and turned to rottenneſs, doth at the Spring time of the Reſurrection not only recover its former Beauty, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth a far more excellent Glory.</p>
                  <p>Nay, the mutual viciſſitude, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of things: the ſetting, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of one and the ſame Sun; ſleep, and waking: labour, and reſt: night, and day: the day that dies into the night, and yet revives again, and is with his former brighteneſs revived to the whole World: all theſe are probable Proofs of the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But beſides theſe, we have infallible teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monis, and Arguments proving the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, this was ſhadowed in holy Scripture by ſundry Types, and Figures. So God ſhewed this in a viſion to <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,</hi> when he ſaw a field full of dry Bones receiving at Gods Comandment, Fleſh, and Nerves, and Fire. See <hi>Ezech.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:108243:187"/>
37. to the 12. For this was not only a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Babel;</hi> but alſo a typical confirmation of the Reſurrection of our Bodies.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Jonas</hi> being reſtored alive out of the Wales belly (wherein he had lain three days, and three nights) was a type of the Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that we ſhould not doubt of the certainity of it. God hath given us examples of many particular Perſons raiſed already from Death to Life, both in the Old and New Teſtament. As of the Widows Son of <hi>Sarepta</hi> raiſed up by <hi>Elias, 1 Kings</hi> 17. 22. Of the <hi>Shunamitiſh</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Son raiſed by <hi>Eliſha, 2 Kings</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34, 35. And of a certain man at the touching of <hi>Eliſhas</hi> bones lying in the Sepulchre, (13. 21.) Theſe in the Old Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>And in the New Teſtament, we find not only that our Saviour Chriſt did raiſe himſelf by his own power never to die any more, but that he raiſed others alſo: as the Rulers Daughter: the Widow of <hi>Naim</hi>'s Son, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> of <hi>Bethania,</hi> when he had lain four days putrifying in the Grave; yea, many alſo at his Death: not that they might die any more
<pb facs="tcp:108243:187"/>
as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the reſt: But rather (as ſome think) that they might accompany him into Life eternal, by whoſe power they had riſen, that they might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Teſtimonis of his quickning pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and why then ſhould any think it impoſſible for God to raiſe all the Bodies of the Saints to Life at the laſt day?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we have divine Teſtimonies in in the Scripture proving the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neceſſity of it: <hi>Thy dead Men ſhall live</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>even with my Body ſhall they riſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Awake and ſing ye that dwell in Duſt. For thy deaw is as the deaw of hearbs, and the earth ſhall caſt out the Dead,</hi> Iſa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26. 9. See alſo concerning this matter, <hi>Dan. 12. 2. Job</hi> 19. 25, 26.</p>
                  <p>So our Saviour alſo in the fifth of <hi>John</hi> 28. 29. ſpeaks plainly to this purpoſe, <hi>The hour ſhall come</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the which all that are in the Graves, ſhall hear his Voice, and they ſhall come forth that have done good, unto the Reſurrection of Life: but they that have done evil, unto the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of condemnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the faith of the Reſurrection is grounded on the power of God, who is omnipotent, with Whom is poſſible that which with Men is impoſſible, <hi>Who
<pb facs="tcp:108243:188"/>
calleth thoſe things, which are not, as though they were,</hi> Rom. 4. 17. <hi>With Whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is impoſſible,</hi> Luk. 1. 37.</p>
                  <p>And the Argument drawn from Gods power, it follows, <hi>A majori ad minus:</hi> from the greater unto the leſſer: For did God make our Bodies of the Duſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cannot he (think you) repair our Bodies again, when they are turned into Duſt, which is a leſs matter? <hi>Qui potuit id quod non erat producere, ut aliquid eſſet, id quod jam est, cum ceciderit, reſtituere non potuerit?</hi> ſaith <hi>Cyril:</hi> He that could bring out that which was not, and make it to be ſomething, ſhall we think that he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot raiſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that which now is, after that it hath fallen? Far be it from us (Beloved) to think ſo; but rather let us ſtedfaſtly believe that he that made us of nothing, is as able to reſtore us from nothing: For what though this may ſeem ſtrange unto us? as indeed it is a matter very won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull (the Budding of <hi>Arons</hi> Rod, <hi>Numb.</hi> 17. 8. was very admirable; but the raiſing of our Bodies is more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,) yet let us remember, that it is God that doth this. Conſider the Author (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) and take away the doubt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:108243:188"/>Fifthly, the Juſtice of God requireth that it ſhould be ſo. For it is a ſpecial part of Gods glory to ſhew forth his mercy on the godly, and his Juſtice upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he wicked, in rewarding them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their works, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God will reward every man according to his works, to them, that by continuance in welldoing ſeek glory, and honour, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, Life eternal: but unto them that diſobey the truth, that be contentiouſs, and obey unrighteouſneſs, ſhall be indignation, and wrath,</hi> Rom. 2. 6. But in this Life God rewardeth not men according to their doings; and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking of the eſtate of all men in this world, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nay, which is more: here the Wicked flouriſh, and the Godly are afflicted. The Ungodly have hearts eaſe, and all things at will: whereas the Godly are oppreſſed with all kind of miſeries, and are as ſheep appointed for the ſlaughter. It remaineth therefore, that here muſt needs be a Reſurrection after this Life, that the righteous man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a reward of Gods free mercy, and
<pb facs="tcp:108243:189"/>

                  <p>Laſtly, it is apparent from the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt. For he aroſe not f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Then thoſe eyes of thine, that now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps are full of Adultery (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks) and cannot ceaſe to ſin: The ears that now are opened to receive falſe, and ſcandalous accuſations of thy brethren: the mouth that now can power out nothing, but curſing, and bitterneſs; rotten, and filthy ſpeeches: the hands that are now defiled with filching, ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and taking of curſed intereſt mony; and the feet that are ſwift to ſhed innocent bloud, ſhall come before the glorious preſence of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Then that body that now thou abuſeſt to filthineſs, and haſt made a monſter by thy diſguiſed attire, and wearing of new

And then thou wilt wiſh that the hils, and mountains would fall on thee and cover thee from the glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, but all in vain.</p>
                  <p>O that every Wicked wretch would conſider of this, and lay it to heart, that theſe very eyes, and no other, ſhall one day ſee the Lord, that ſo he might in time prepare himſelf to meet the Lord. For aſſure ourſelves, <hi>that without holineſs, no man ſhall ever ſee the Lord to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> Heb. 12. 14.</p>
                  <p>And ſince the bodies of the Saints ſhall be raiſed up to ſuch glory (as hath been ſhewed) this ſhould teach us alſo to live here on earth as thoſe that do believe, that there ſhall be a glorious Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>

                  <p>We ſhould live as men devoted wholy to the ſervice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe we are both in life, and Death.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould ſtrive to abound in the
<pb facs="tcp:108243:194"/>
work of the Lord, rouſing up ourſelves to the care of well doing, ſtudying to keep a conſcience voyd of offenſe toward God, and man. Nay our minds ſhould run on that time, our hearts ſhould be affected with it, and our converſation ſhould be in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>We read of St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> that this ſaying ran in his mind, and ſounded always in his ears: <hi>Ariſe ye dead, and come unto Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And this always to be ſounding in our ears, and our thoughts ought to run upon it, to this end, that while we have time we may prepare ourſelves to meet the Lord at the laſt day.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Uſe of Conſol.</hi> Thirdly, here is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of conſolation to all the children of God; and the conſideration thereof may ſerve to fill the hearts of Gods choſen with moſt ſweet, and comfortable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhings, and that in many regards.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, wheras the Godly are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to manifod afflictions, and miſeries of this life, here they may find a ſufficient ſtay to quiet, and calm their minds, if they conſider that after this ſhort life is ended, there will enſue a glorious Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Thus we ſee the holy man <hi>Job</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:108243:194"/>
in the greateſt extremity of all his miſery, made this the Comfort to his ſoul, that <hi>one day he ſhould riſe again in which he ſhould enjoy the glorious preſence of his Redeemer:</hi> See <hi>Job.</hi> 19. 26.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may Comfort the Saints of God againſt the perſecutions of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; yea, and death it ſelf. We read of the Saints of God in the days of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> that they were <hi>racked, and would not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,</hi> and why ſo, <hi>becauſe they looked for a better Reſurrection,</hi> Heb. 11. 35.</p>
                  <p>No doubt but they counted the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from the rack a thing much to be deſired; yet, they knew that the Redemption from Hell, and the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to eternal life was much more to be ſought for, without which condition they would not be delivered, and no marvel, for what though the rack might rend their fleſh, and disjoint their Lims? yet they knew well enough, and were fully aſſured that at the Reſurrection, all ſhould be conjoined, and perfected again.</p>

                  <p>THE ſerious remembrance of Death ſhakes off all ſenſe of pleaſure, and turns Honey into Wormwood. The Expectation of Death, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> ſuffers us not to be ſenſible of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and Pleaſures we injoy. And indeed what is it not able to do, when conſider'd not only in the Extremities of the Fingers, and as it were in the Hair, but over the whole Body. Death ſpares no Age, nor no Degree of Dignity. Here dies a young Man, there an Infant, there an old Man. Another by Poyſon, or a Fall, another by a ſlow Rhume, another by a quick deſcent of Humour; here lyes another oppreſs'd with a mighty Shower, or the Waves, there lyes another ſtruck with Thunder. Among ſo many doubtful, ſo many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſo many ſudden Accidents, what ſecurity, or what mind to ſin among ſo many Incertainties? Therefore, ſince we daily die, think upon the Hour-glaſs, whether the old faſhion'd one running Water, or the new one running Sand. Do ye not find that by dropping of the Water, and the paſſage of the Sand the upper Glaſs empties and the lower Glaſs fills? Conſider that it is ſo with Life, every moment ſomething ſlides away, the preſent Life empties, and flows into another. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is here ſafe; not the Hour of the Hour, nor the Moment of the Moment. Happy he, to whom every day is the laſt; more happy he, to whom every Hour; moſt happy he, to whom every Moment is the utmoſt period of his Thoughts. He will abſtain from the wickedneſs of his hands who believes every Hour decreed, every Moment his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108243:200"/>
laſt. O vain Hope! How many doſt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive? How many, to whom thou promiſeſt old Age, doſt thou cut off in the midſt of their Courſe? Believe therefore that may happen to thee, which happ'ns to many. How many has Death prevented in the midſt of their wickedneſs, and cut off half the Crime? How many fall with a revengeful Mind, though with an Innocent Hand? How many ſnatch'd away in the attempt, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the reward of their Impiety? Many in the very Moment of a wicked Action begun, have been forc'd to leave their ill deſigns unfiniſh'd. What if thou ſhouldſt be in the number of thoſe? What Hour or Moment is more certain to thee than to another? Now who can expect a Crime from ſuch a Thought, as with the Crime expects Death, and with Death, Puniſhment. No prudent Man plays or ſports in the midſt of a Storm. No Man at the brink of a Precipice meditates miſchief. No Man is merry unarmed in the midſt of his Armed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. More ſtupid is he, whom the perpetual fear of Death, when every Hour is doubtful, every Moment uncertain, dares thoſe things that procure an unhappy Death to Eternity. O Fools! Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we run to be puniſh'd for ever?

In the Morning it is hatch'd, at Noon it fluoriſhes, in the Evening it grows old and dies. But this is more to be wonder'd at in that winged Creature, that it makes no leſs proviſion for one little day, than if it were to live the Age of a Crow or a Raven, To this little Animal the Life of Man is moſt fitly to be compar'd. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habits by the River of gliding Time: But more fleet than either Bird or Arrow. And often only one day determines all its Pomp, oft-times an Hour, and as often a Moment.

diſclaim the Natural Sweetneſs of Life that cauſes Men to act and ſuffer many ſhameful things; and then the end of thy Life will be far more happy than the beginning. Wholeſom was the Doctrine of the ſecond <hi>Pliny,</hi> Therefore, ſaith he, many were of Opinion, that thought it beſt never to be Born, or immediately to die. Thus <hi>Sitenus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tak'n by <hi>Midas,</hi> and ask'd, what was the beſt thing could happen to Man? For a while ſtood ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. At length, being urg'd to ſpeak, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, That the beſt thing, was never to be Born, the next, to die the ſooneſt that might be.</p>
                  <p>This I muſt not omit very wonderful, unheard of, and pleaſant in the Relation. <hi>Lodowic Cortuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> a Lawyer of <hi>Padua,</hi> forbid to his Relations all Tears and Lamentations by his will. And deſir'd that he might have Harpers, Pipers, and all ſorts of Muſick at his Funeral, who ſhould partly go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, partly follow the Corps, and leaving to every one a ſmall Sum of Money. His Bier he ordered to be carry'd by twelve Virgins, that being clad in Green, were to ſing all the way ſuch Songs as Mirth brought to their Remembrance; leaving to each a certain Sum of Money inſtead of a Dowry. Thus was he Buried in the Church of St. <hi>Sophia</hi> in <hi>Padua,</hi> accompanied with a hundred Attendants, together with all the Clergy of the City, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that were black. For ſuch by his Will he forbid his Funeral; as it were turning his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rites into a Marriage Ceremony. He died the 17th of <hi>July</hi> 1418.</p>
                  <p>Admirable was the ſaying of St. <hi>Bernard, Let them bewail their Dead, who deny the Reſurrection.</hi> They are to be deplor'd, who after Death are Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Hell by the Devils, not they who are plac'd in Heaven by the Angels.

                  <p>AS we may meet with old Men, not old Men but Children, ſo we may meet with young Men, not young Men, but ſtricken in years. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> the Hermit an old Man of Seventy years, when <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> the King asked him how old he was, anſwered Forty five, at which when the King ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, he reply'd, that he had been abſent from his Studies Twenty five years; as if thoſe years which he had ſpent upon the Vanity of the World had been quite loſt. So <hi>Similius,</hi> being Buried in the Cares of the Court, and living rather for his Emperors ſake than for his own, cauſed this Inſcription to be put upon his Tomb. <hi>Here lyes</hi> Similius, <hi>an old Man of Seven years of Age.</hi> The Book of <hi>Samuel</hi> relates of <hi>Saul</hi> that he was the Son of one year when he began to Reign, but that he Raigned Two years over <hi>Iſrael. Saul</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Reign was as free and Innocent from all wickedneſs as a Child of one year old, but he continued in this purity but one year, though he Reigned Twenty years in all. Many attain to old Age betimes, and before they are old. But the moſt of Men, never; who when they are old, yet retain the Vices of Children ſtill; ſo that they die Children of a hundred years of Age. The Happineſs of Life conſiſts not in the length or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereof, but in the uſe of it: And it may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happen that he that has lived long, has not lived at all. Wherefore there is nothing more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous than a childiſh old Man, who has no other
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108243:215"/>
Argument to prove his long Life but his Age. Elegantly St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> concerning St. <hi>Agnes.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy was reckoned in her year, but a vaſt Age of mind. The Oracle of Divine Venerable old Age is not laſting, nor to be computed by number of years: But the Senſes of men are grey, and old Age is an immaculate Life. And therefore the Manners rather than the Hairs of men are to be eſteemed Venerable. Only he is worthy of more reverence who is old betimes. An honeſt Life is the beſt old Age.</p>
                  <p>Yet, you will ſay, a man ſo early dead might have proved a great Man, and ſerviceable to his Countrey. Rather (which is more to be feared, he might have become like others.

                  <p>THE <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Moſchee at <hi>Caire</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> was Built by this means. <hi>Aſſan Baſha,</hi> a perſon as well Cunning as Covetous, reſolving to raiſe himſelf a Name in the World by ſome great Structure, yet not willing to be at the Coſt himſelf, found out this Trick. He cauſed Proclamation to be made in all places, that he intended to erect: a vaſt and ſumptuous Temple to Gods Now that the work might go on the more proſperouſly, he promiſed large Wages to all that ſhould come to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Work. And a certain day was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to divide the Money. This Proclamation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together a vaſt multitude. not only from all parts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but from ſeveral other Regions and Kingdoms; againſt their coming <hi>Aſſan</hi> had cauſed a great number of new Shirts and Veſts to be prepar'd. Which done, thoſe that came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Wages, were order'd to paſs ſingly out of the great Court, where they met into another Court equally as big through ſeveral little by Doors. Where they were ſtript of their old Garments, and new Shirts and Veſts impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon them. All this was done to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that whatever ſo many thouſands had brought to bear their Expences, ſhould be left in that place.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:108243:218"/>
For in thoſe Countreys the people are wont to ſow their Money in their Shirts or their Veſts. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a hidious Out-cry and Lamentation aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people. But the <hi>Baſha</hi> contemning the Clamours and Cries of the people, threw all their Cloaths into a vaſt Fire and burnt them. Which huge Bonfire produced ſuch vaſt heaps of Silver as eaſily ſufficed for the Edifice. Thus Death deals by us; it takes from us againſt our Wills our old Garments, and cloaths us with a new Sepulcher: For we, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that are in this Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, do groan, being burthened, not for that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon. But in vain we reſiſt. Death derides our Clamours, our Tears; whether we will or no, the old Garment muſt go off. Uncaſe and be gone, All are tyed to the ſame Condition. Who happens to be Born, of neceſſity muſt die. We are diſtinguiſhed by Intervals, but our Exit is the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But hear how the Cruelty of this moſt Covetous Man was revenged. The Turkiſh Emperor being informed of <hi>Aſſan</hi>'s Wickedneſs, ſent <hi>Ibram Baſha</hi> to him with Letters, wherein he ſeverely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, that ſo ſoon as he had received the Letters from <hi>Ibram,</hi> he ſhould immediately ſend his own Head to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Such Fatal Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as thoſe the Turkiſh Emperor is wont to write with his own hand, and to bind about with black Silk; and generally they contain theſe words, <hi>Send me thy Head.</hi> Whoever thou art, King or <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when the Emperor of Heaven ſends thee his black Letters there's no reſiſting, no excuſe, no deprecation will ſerve. `Tis in vain to fly or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, the Sentence is decreed. Therefore do this and trample upon neceſſity. What thou ſhouldſt be compelled to do againſt thy will, that do of thy own accord. Send thy Head; not to a Tyrant,

but to a Father; not to a Man, but to God. Make no delay, but be willing to die. For why ſhould not the Will prevent Neceſſity. `Tis the part of Neceſſity to ſubmit, but of Vertue to be willing.</p>

Heaven nor to God. How much time does our Meals, our Recreation, our Play, our Diſcourſe, our Sleep, our Idleneſs takes up? How much do litigious Suits and Diſeaſes ſnatch from us? How many Thieves do ſteal away our Lives, while we perceive not what we loſe? The following Verſes, though not ſo terſe and neat, very lively expreſs our Madneſs.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>A man lives fourſcore years, not often more,</l>
                     <l>Of which in meat and drink ſome half a ſcore;</l>
                     <l>In play as many, twenty years in ſleep,</l>
                     <l>Till ſeventeen in our childiſh years we heap</l>
                     <l>And nothing do; for years diſeaſes claim.</l>
                     <l>Therefore the time that we expend to frame</l>
                     <l>Our ſelves to vertue and learning, is in brief,</l>
                     <l>But the fourth part of all that tedious life.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>What a little is left us of that which is our own; many there are whom their Misfortunes will not give leave to take breath; many, whom their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity. For we lay not hold upon time to ſtop the fleeteſt thing in Nature; but let it ſlip as a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous thing and eaſie to be recovered. What keeper of time ſo ſparing, that may not find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy to exchange with his time? We trifile with the moſt precious of all things, and there is no reckoning made of that which cannot be ſufficiently valued. Like them that ſleep in Ships, who are driven along by the Winds, though they perceive not the motion, and when they wake. wonder to ſee themſelves ready to be landed, Thus the courſe of our life haſtens away, while we ſleep and neglect the ineſtimable price of Time. When we ſhould wake for a better life, we admire to ſee our ſelves at our Journeys end; Death is to many, as the Harbour to the Sailer, he ſails well that does not Shipwrack in the Port.</p>

But how ſhall they know this that never endeavouted to learn? Moſt Mortals care not for living well, but for living long. Some then begin to live when they are ready to leave the World. Hence it is that we are empty of all thoſe Comforts, which we deſire at the end of our Lives; fearful of death, and ignorant of living.

                  <p>DEath is the ſame to all Men, but the Wages by which it happens are various. One expires while he is feeding, another ſlumbering falls into an Eternal Sleep, another in the act of Impiety ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes. Here one drops by the Sword, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Drowns in Water; another Fires conſumes. Some by the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing of Serpents die, while others are Buried in the ſudden fall of Ruins. Others by the Contraction of their Nerves are tortured to Death. Others are cut off in their Youth, others in their Cradles. Sometimes an Infant comes into the World to take its farewel of Life. The Exit of ſome is milder, of others harſher. But how mild and gentle Death may ſeem to be, however it brings ſomething of Horrour with it, and that for this reaſon, becauſe it ſeems to deprive us of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Happineſſes, and to take us from that plenty to which we are accuſtomed. This love of our ſelves, and deſire of ſelf-preſervation, is the Chain that clogs us. There is alſo a natural fear of darkneſs, to which Death is thought to be our Conductor; which has engaged the Wits of many to augment the Terrours of Death.</p>
                  <p>But that which moſt augments the fear of Death is this, that preſent things we know, whither we are to go we know not, and therefore are afraid. Therefore is the Mind to be enured by much Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, that it may not be afraid of that Eternity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which we are to enter. Eternity is that we are to think upon day and night; as they that would bring themſelves to endure hunger, muſt enure themſelves to faſting by little and little: So the Soul that is to be tranſlated from this inconſtant
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108243:230"/>
World to a ſtable Kingdom, muſt accuſtom it ſelf to endure Eternity. Let it every day ſalute the Gate of Eternity, every Moment believe that it waits there: Whatever it acts, let it act for Eternities ſake; and only obſerve this one form of action. I read, I write, I paint, I meditate, I watch, I ſpeak, and all for the ſake of Eternity Whoever aſpires to Eternal Triumphs, let him learn to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat Eternity.</p>

Yet when Ninety nine years were expir'd in the fear of God, they Buried him with joy. Could <hi>Tobias,</hi> in our judgment, Expoſtulate with God or complain. Why Lord, doſt thou now break off my Life? Why didſt not thou permit me to make up the full hundred? What other Anſwer would God return? It ſo pleas'd me: Now die,

Wherefore do ye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend immature Age? Wherefore do ye expect a Truce? Wherefore do ye think upon delay? Thou wert ripe for Death long before?

Delay has made many the worſe. 'Tis a bad preparation for Death, to be unwilling to die. He has perform'd half of the Act who now is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The deſire of Death is to be ſhaken off, and thou art to learn, that it matters not when thou ſuffereſt whatever it behoves thee to ſuffer. How well thou haſt lived, is the main buſineſs, not how long; and often it happens well, when there is no delay.

                  <p>Thereby he taunted their Icterical, Yellowiſh and Wan Complexions.

                  <p>But whether or no is Sickneſs a Benefit, and Death an Evil? No, Mortal, no; it is not, ſaith <hi>Epictetus. Health well us'd is a good thing; ill us'd, a miſchief:</hi> And therefore we may reap Benefit by Sickneſs. What doſt thou ſay of Sickneſs? I wil ſhew thee its Nature; then I ſhall be quiet, I ſhall think my ſelf well dealt with, I ſhall not flatter the Phyſician, I ſhall not wiſh for Death. What wouldſt thou more? Whatever thou ſhalt give me, that will I make happy, proſperous, honourable, to be deſir'd. But there are ſome that deny this, and ſay, <hi>Take heed of being ſick, 'tis an ill thing.</hi> To them <hi>Epictetus</hi> again, <hi>That is as much as to ſay,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Take heed that thou doſt not feign three to be four, 'tis an ill thing. How evil? If we ſo think of it as we ought. What harm will it do me? Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it not do me good?

Why weepeſt thou? what is it thou wouldſt have? thou loſeſt thy labour: Thou ſhalt go thither, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all things created go. What is there that thou canſt call a Novelty?

Let us, I beſeech ye, examine things themſelves, and not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things. If we believe <hi>Seneca,</hi> Death is the beſt Invention of Nature, the Remedy of all Evils. Why therefore do we fear at laſt? Immortal Peace, Eternal Joy will entertain us. Let us take Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage from the deſpair of longer Life. Make that a Vertue, which would be neceſſity. Certainly a prudent Chriſtian does nothing unwillingly; he avoids all neceſſity, becauſe he wills what that would compel him to. Let us therefore do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, what we cannot but do. Let us with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Mind expect our end, or rather our begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

                  <p>MOST certain it is, that nothing terrifies ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as an unexpected neceſſity of dying. Behold how they, who are ſubject to the power of another, being commanded a long Journey, pack up their things in haſte, ſollicitous and ſad; how they murmur becauſe they had no longer warning. As they are upon their departure they often look back, pretending this and t'other Obſtacle. Now there is no longer Journey than <hi>to Die;</hi> no way more crabbed, more dark, more hard to find, none more ſuſpitious and infeſted with Robbers. Beſides there is no return again. Therefore we muſt the more heedfully take care that we leave nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. There is a neceſſity of going thither, fellow Souldiers, ſaid the Roman Captain, from whence
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108243:241"/>

                  <p>NEither is there any Queſtion to be made of this. They chiefly fear to die, who know not how to live; who believe no other Happineſs but that of the Body.

                  <p>A prudent Chriſtian, that takes no more care of the Body than of a mean and abject Slave, looks upon Death no otherwiſe than a Morning depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of a dark, unpleaſant and incommodious Inn.

                  <p>Pain of the Body is to be aſſwag'd by tranquility of Conſcience: A guiltleſs Mind is a wonderful Conſolation to the Sick.

                  <p>SO I ſay we muſt always pray in ſickneſs. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this a thing of any great difficulty to a ſick perſon. For either with his Tongue if he have ſtrength enough, may he pronounce his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God. Or if his Tongue be numm'd, or that his voice be intercepted by weakneſs, a ſuppliant Mind is to be lifted up to Heaven, while the Body lyes quiet, but only for ſome ardent groans that diſtinguiſh theſe private Colloquies with God in Sickneſs. But there is alſo a ſort of Sickneſs that does not only interrupt the voice, but even op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the very Soul it ſelf: But then Patience and Suffering are to be offered up for Prayers to God, to whom Pain is a grateful Sacrifice, ſo that Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be joined with it. He prays well, who ſuffers well. Neither may he be ſaid to pray, but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by Prayer of God, who ſends ſuch Eloquent Meſſengers to him as <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi> But let him be ſuch a ſick perſon, whoſe Speech may be interrupted, whoſe Mind may be broken, and whoſe Patience may be at a loſs. Yet there is a way for him to pray. Let him look about, he ſhall ſee ſome ſitting, ſome ſtanding by him, ready to help and aſſiſt him. How eaſie is it then to caſt in a word by the by; how eaſie is it for him to point or cry to his Friend, ſay this Prayer, read this Pſalm, or that Paragraph. Who ſo hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to deny ſo ſmall a Duty to the Sick? So
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:108243:245"/>
that when a ſick perſon cannot pray with his own, he may with anothers Lips. And therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat this again, <hi>Pray always in Sickneſs.</hi> We can never unſeaſonably have recourſe to God.</p>

                     <hi>Sect. 17.</hi> In Pain, and at other times, what is to be meditated upon, what to be done every day.</head>
                  <p>A Man that truſts in God, though oppreſſed with Miſeries, and full of Pain, may rightly ſay this; while I breathe I hope, and ſo much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the better the nearer to my end I find my ſelf. <hi>Seneca</hi> has moſt excellently Philoſophized concerning pain. <hi>No Man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>can feel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive pain and long; for thus has Nature moſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to us ordered it, that pain ſhould be either tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or ſhort. For the intenſe exceſs of grief finds an end.</hi> Therefore this is the Comfort of vaſt pain, that thou muſt of neceſſity ceaſe to feel it, if thou feeleſt it over-much. But this is that which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the unskilful in the pains of the Body: They are not content with their Souls alone, they have ſtill ſo much Buſineſs with the Body. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore O Sick Perſon, accuſtom thy ſelf by degrees to wean thy Soul from thy Body, and to converſe with thy better and more Divine part; but with thy Body, the frail and weak part no more than needs muſt. And though pain is ſeldom ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant but that it has ſome intermiſſion; therefore do not think that all Exerciſe of the Soul is to be omitted, when thou lyeſt ſick, when thou feeleſt pain. Above all things, take care that thy Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayers, and thy Evening Examination of thy Conſcience, as much as in thee lyes, may make a due progreſs: If thy Tongue fail thee, let thy
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:108243:245"/>
Mind pray. Never begin the Night, nor compoſe thy ſelf to ſleep, till thou haſt examined thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: In the day-time when thy pain-ceaſes or relaxes, take a good Book, and there read and weigh every Period; every Day ſet aſide a ſmall Hour for Prayer, pious Groans, and humble Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; ſo thou wilt believe thy ſelf to have pray'd an Hour in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning and end of all thy Prayers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thy ſelf wholly to the will of God with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Obedience. All which things are ſo far from difficulty, that a dying man may perform them, as well as he whoſe Pain is not ſo ſevere. If thou canſt not, or rather will not perform theſe Duties, yet for that one little Hour patiently endure thy Pains: Make not thy Miſery more intollerable than it is, nor burthen thy ſelf with Complaints. Pain is the Lighter of Opinion and Conceit, and not to the Weight. On the other ſide, if thou beginſt to exhort thy ſelf, and ſay, <hi>'Tis nothing, or elſe it is very little, let us endure, it will be over by and by;</hi> thou wilt make it eaſie while thou believ'ſt it ſo. Every Man is miſerable as far as he believes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſo.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here I ſeaſonably cite to thee the words of the wiſe <hi>Roman: Being thrown,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>into this deep and unquiet Sea, flowing with uncertain Tydes, now advancing us with ſudden encreaſe of Riches, now again leaving us upon the barren Sands of greater Loſſes, we can never ſtand fixt in any place.</hi> We float up and down, are waſht one againſt another, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we make an abſolute Shipwrack, but are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in fear. Neither is there any Port, but that of <hi>Death,</hi> to them that ſail in this ſtormy and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous Ocean.</p>
                  <p>But every Mans Credulity deceives him, and a willing forgetfulneſs of <hi>Death,</hi> for the ſake of thoſe things which he loves. Daily we behold the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of perſons known and unknown; yet we mind other buſineſs, and account that unexpected, which was foretold us all our life-time before. 'Tis not the injuſtice of Nature, but the depravedneſs of humane Reaſon that takes it ill to forſake that place, to which it was admitted but of Courteſie. He is unjuſt who will not leave the diſpoſal of the Gift to him that gave it. And an extream piece of Covetouſneſs it is, not to look upon what a man has received as gain, but what he reſtores as a loſs. Ingrateful is he that calls the end of Pleaſure an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. A Fool, who thinks there is no good but what is preſent; immediately all pleaſure leaves us, and is ſnatcht away almoſt before it comes. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narrow and circumſcrib'd are his Joys, who thinks he poſſeſſes only what he has and ſees. Therefore let us rejoyce for what is given, and reſtore it when 'tis requir'd <hi>Death</hi> ſeiſes upon one at one time, he will paſs by none. Therefore let the Soul lie upon the watch, and never be aſraid of that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:108243:247"/>
which will neceſſarily happen, which is uncertain, and always to be expected. I know not whether it be a greater piece of Folly to be ignorant of that Law of Morality, or more impudent to deny it. All Men, all Creatures look toward their latter end; who ever is born, is deſtin'd to die, and prepared for an Eternity.</p>

Ceaſe therefore, O my Soul, to be willing to be miſerable, and to conſume thy ſelf with ſo much turmoiling. Painful Beginnings thou wilt ſay. 'Tis very true. But thou knowſt that no days are leſs quiet than thoſe that are next to reſt. No days leſs Holidays than thoſe that precede Feſtivals. So it is with thee. But thy reſt ſhall be Eternal. The preparation tires thee, ſhortly the Paſchal without end ſhall follow. Go to then, and expend a little Labour and Grief. By and by thou ſhalt behold the Gate, not that which leads out of this Life; but that which leads to Eternity. Then hadſt thou but begun to labour, it would prove ſufficient, if he for whom thou laboureſt think it ſo. Therefore, O my Soul, diſmiſs vain things to vain people, and turn thee to the Lord who hath rewarded thee.

Therefore let not God be delayed through any commiſeration of me. For if I die, I ſhall eſcape free and ſecure from my Sins, nor ſhall I ever any more reſiſt the will of God, as one that has left this Life, and the Inconſtancy of Mortals. Yet I am very much afraid of my weakneſs, leſt I ſhould faint in the right road, and in my holy purpoſe. Seeing then that hitherto, through the Mercy and Grace of God, I have remained ſtedfaſt in the truth, I would not depart from the Innocency of my Life, though I have a firm hope, that it will never be that I ſhall contradict the will of God, but rather that I may be always able to attend and wait upon it: Which when God ſhall be pleaſed to fulfil in me, I am ſo far from praying againſt it, that I ſhall rather eſteem it as a great favour.

                  <p>PAin is a ſharp, cruel, horrid, ſad, bitter thing, contrary to Nature, hateful to the Sences, yet which by the aſſiſtance of our Age may be mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or elſe little or nothing felt. He that in this
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:108243:256"/>
Combat unwillingly turns his Back, but makes a reſiſtance cordially and with all his might, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Superior, always gets the Victory. Why, O Clay, doſt thou murmur againſt the Potter? He deſigned from Eternity one Veſſel for Honour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for Diſhonour, another for another uſe, yet all Brittle and Mortal. Wherefore then doſt thou repine? Complaints and Repinings are but an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and increaſe of the Diſtemper. For nothing ſo much exaſperates the heat of a Wound, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience of enduring the pain. All repining turns to its own Torment. Thus while the wild Beaſt moves the ſnare he is taken. Thus while the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted Birds diſorder the Lime-twig, they hang by the Feathers. There is no Yoke ſo ſtrait that does not leſs hurt him that bears it willingly than him that reſiſts. There is but one mitigation of terrible pains, which is to ſuffer, and ſubmit to neceſſity. Wherefore then doſt thou add a Diſeaſe of mind to ſickneſs of Body? Making thy ſelf more miſerable by murmuring, and provoking him the more thereby, who beholds the Sufferings of Men from above, and conſiders their Patience, with a deſign to reward it.</p>
                  <p>But the ſick Man objects; thou canſt not make me not to feel what I feel. My tender ſick Friend, if no where elſe, at leaſt ſuffer patience to inhabit in thy Ears. I do not deny pain to be pain, but I ſay it may be leſſened by patience. Which if it take not away all ſence of pain, yet it gives thee the Victory over pain, while thou haſt ſtrength to endure it manfully. Therefore the Mind is to be rouſed up, to be armed and embattelled againſt its Enemies. An unprepared and impatient mind is dejected at the leaſt Misfortunes; like a Coward, that upon the ſight of the Enemy throws away his Arms and flies; thus the thought of pain Exani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:108243:256"/>
a ſluggiſh mind, which had it held but out the Buckler of Patience had proved a Victor over pain. Patience not only augments the Courage of the Mind, but mitigates the ſharpneſs of the pain. So that if it be never ſo violent, however begin then to hope: Exceſs of pain promiſes an end. For extremity of Grief is the beginning of Joy. This is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his patience, he loſt not his meekneſs of Mind. Neither in this deſperate Sickneſs had he waſted all his hope and patience. He envied no body, he repined at no body, he reproaches no body. He accuſes no Man, condemns no Man; wiſhes no Man his ill Fate. Neither does Curſe himſelf, nor the day of his Birth; nor blame For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, nor his Parents; much leſs does he murmur againſt God, complain of Heavens Cruelty, or ſtand upon his own Innocency; nor does he chide the ſlowneſs of Death. Nor does he prepare to make himſelf away; but patiently expects help, and ſtill hopes; nor is he importunate with Chriſt, contentedly ſatisfied that he had only not conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Miſeries from his Saviour.

Nor is there any that dares afford the leaſt Word to aſſwage theſe unſpeakable Torments. His weeping Friends, (and how many of them?)

                  <p>THE Complaints of the Sick are almoſt innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, they can hardly ſpeak without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring: How often do we hear them cry out, Oh miſerable me! Oh afflicted me! Oh who ſo overwhelm'd in Pain as I am. But they that more narrowly examine the buſineſs, will change their Notes, and cry, `Tis well, `tis very well, `tis Gods pleaſure: O happy, O bleſſed me, corrected not by a Tyrant, but by a Father; God be praiſed; Glory be to God. Heaven reward all my Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. This is that, my ſick Friend, that becomes thee, and behoves thee. <hi>Seneca</hi> admoniſhing the ſame thing; <hi>Do not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>make thy miſeries more grievous to thy ſelf than they are.</hi> Complaints of paſt Griefs are idle, and theſe common Sayings; <hi>Never had any man ſuch a time on't:</hi> What Torments, what Miſeries did I feel! No body thought I would ever have recovered; and the like. They may be true, but they are paſt; what ſignifies it to remember paſt Troubles, and to be miſerable, becauſe thou wert ſo. Therefore lay aſide two things, the Fear of what is to come and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of paſt Sorrows. Wherefore then doſt thou complain in vain, and feſter thy Wounds with the Nails of Impatience? I am miſerable thou ſayſt. Rather bleſſed Humanity is in a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in regard no man is miſerable, but through his own fault. Bleſſed is the Man whom God cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteneth, for whom he loves he chaſtiſeth. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Wound, and he healeth; he wounds, and his hand maketh whole again. Knoweſt thou not, that the Wound which the Chirurgeon makes is
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:108243:262"/>
the beginning of the Cure. Do thou therefore not mind the Wound, but the hand of him that wounds, and thou wilt confeſs thy ſelf to be much more in health, than when thou wert at the beſt. But ſayſt thou, I feel a moſt vehement pain; No queſtion, if thou endureſt it effeminately. But as the Enemy makes the greateſt ſlaughter upon them that flie, ſo is all pain more heavy to him that ſuccombs under it. But the Torture is intolerable. It is not for the ſtout to endure ſlight Pains.

But ſayſt thou, My Diſeaſe will let me do nothing. How, nothing: Alas it is thy Body that is only infirm and ſick, not thy Mind. Therefore if thou beeſt a Racer, thy Feet are only bound, if a Smith, or other Handicrafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thy hands are not at liberty. But if thy Mind fail thee not, thou mayſt hear, thou mayſt learn, thou mayſt remember, though ſick. What more doſt thou believe, thou doſt nothing if thou art temperate in ſickneſs?

                  <p>NOT to know how to die is the moſt miſerable piece of Ignorance in the World. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we may learn that which we ought to learn all our Lives, there are five things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to good Death.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>A free and undaunted Mind.</hi> This is that which is of chiefeſt moment, and upon which the reſt depend. It is a great ſatisfaction for our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences ſo willingly to abandon'd what is moſt dear to us. Therefore, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> an Offering of a Free-heart-will I give unto thee. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo acceptable to God nor ſo profitable to Man, as a free and ready Mind, and a generous Truſt in God.</p>

Well ſaid <hi>Tertullian, That is not to be fear'd that frees us from all fear.</hi> But thou wilt ſay, 'Tis a terrible thing in Sickneſs to foreſee Death creeping on by degrees. Worm of a Man, what wouldſt thou have? Did not thy Saviour Chriſt foreſee his Death, and that a moſt ſharp one, for thirty years and more? Art thou better than he? But becauſe thou doſt not ſo much fear Death, as the previous Inconveniences of Death, hear <hi>Epiete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, And ſhalt not thou,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>depart with a firm and conſtant mind, but trembling and cowardly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thy fine Cloaths, or thy gaudy Silver Plate?</hi> Unhappy Man! Was it thus that hitherto thou haſt loſt all thy time? What if I prove Sick? Thou ſhalt be honeſtly Sick. Who ſhall Cure thee? God. I ſhall lye hard. But as a Man. I ſhall not have a convenient Houſe. 'Tis an inconvenience to be Sick. What ſhall be the iſſue of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe? Nothing but Death. Therefore doſt not thou believe that the Fountain of all Evil, is the chief mark of a degenerate and daſtardly Mind, is not ſo much death it ſelf as the fear of Death. Therefore exerciſe thy ſelf againſt it; make uſe of whatever thou heareſt or readeſt, as weapons to Encounter it. So ſhalt thou know there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way for Man to gain his own Liberty.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. From how many Evils art thou freed by Death. To die is to ſhut up the Shop of all Miſeries. Excellently well ſaid <hi>Pliny. That is the condition of Life, that Death becomes the Haven for the beſt of Man and the chief benefit of Nature.</hi> And therefore let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one provide himſelf of this as one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cures for his Mind, that of all the Benefit which Nature affords Men, there is none better than a ſeaſonable Death. <hi>Caeſar</hi> in <hi>Saluſt</hi> affirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Death to be a Ceſſation from Miſery to the afflicted and no Torment. Therefore the Wiſe Man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways conſiders what manner of Life he led, and not how long. For Nature provided us a place to Lodge and Sojourn in but not to inhabit, lends us the uſe of Life, like that of Money, are not payable at a certain day. Why then doſt thou complain if ſhe call it in when ſhe pleaſes; ſince ſhe lent it upon that condition.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Priſon Doors are ſet open by Death; and doſt thou fear to go forth. Rather rejoice: Hitherto thou wert a Captive, now thou ſhalt be free. How fooliſh a thing it is to depend upon Hope, or Happineſs, and be afraid to go at large to that which always remains, and to change for a moment of dying a perpetual Immortality. The Priſon is open, haſte thee to a better place.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Death is the way; yea, it is the Gate that leads us into our Countrey, to Eternal Life, to Immortal Joy. For Death is not ſo much the end of Life as the beginning of Life. Learnedly ſaid St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> The Juſt Man dies but ſecurely, whoſe death as it is the Exit out of this preſent Life, is the Entry into a better. But thou wilt ſay, To live long how pleaſant a thing it is; but how uncertain is it whether Divine Grace will not forſake thee before thy Sin. And who is there that has not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reaſon to be afraid for his perſeverance, which no holineſs of Life can merit. 'Tis a Gift, and given gratis. Therefore he that deſires this Gift let him reconcile himſelf to the Giver.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But the Reaſon of Reaſons is the Will of God, whoſe Eternal pleaſure it was that thou ſhouldſt yield to Nature at this time, in this place, and through this Diſeaſe. What wouldſt thou more? It was Gods will; it ſo ſeem pleaſing to God. This is that will, that can will no evil. Therefore the

Son of <hi>Syrack</hi> gives this advice; <hi>Humble thy ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou beeſt ſick, and while thou maiſt ſin, ſhew thy Converſation.</hi> But all theſe Reaſons I do ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſum up thus.</p>

                     <hi>LET us behold</hi> Paul, ſaith <hi>Gregory, how he loves what he ſeeks to avoid.</hi> How he avoids what he loves. He deſires to die and yet ſears to be ſpoil'd of his Fleſh. Why ſo? becauſe though the Eternal Victory over-joy him, yet the preſent pain diſturbs him: And though the Love of the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence overcome him, yet he cannot be unſenſible of the twitches and pangs of Torment. For as a Couragious Souldier juſt before the Battel palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, trembles, looks pale, yet is ſtill inſtigated by his Anger. So a Holy Man ſeeing the approach of his Suffering, is ſhaken by the weakneſs of his Nature, fears the approach of Death, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices to die. And becauſe there is no paſſage but through Death, therefore truſting he doubts, and doubting truſt; rejoicing he fears, and fearing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices. Becauſe he knows he ſhall not attain the Garden of Repoſe, unleſs he get over the Hill that lyes between. <hi>David</hi> ſhew'd his fear of Death when he cry'd out, <hi>Lord take me not away in the midſt of my Age.</hi> Neither was <hi>Abraham, Jacob</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>VEry truly ſaid <hi>Pliny</hi> the younger; the common Opinion is falſe, that the Wills of Men are the mirrour of Manners.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Zilka</hi> bequeathed his Skin to make a Drum, and his Fleſh to the Fowls of the Air, und Wild Beaſts; and commanded his Souldiers to ſpare nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches nor Monuments. He died of the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the year 1424.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There was a Woman that left her Cat, by Will, five Hundred Crowns, for her Cats Food, as long as ſhe lived. O the ridiculous Foſteries of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Thoughts. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Herod,</hi> I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be his Hog than his Son. A Man might as well have ſaid, I had rather have been this Womans Cat than her Servant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 A Famous Uſurer, being at the point of Death, ſending for the <hi>Publick Notary</hi> and <hi>Reſpeſſes,</hi> cauſed his Will to be written in theſe VVords; Let my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be returned to the Earth, from whence it was taken; but my Soul be given to the Devils. His Friends aſtoniſhed at his words, adviſed, rebuked him, but he again and again perſiſted, ſaying, Let my Soul be given to the Devils, for I have unjuſtly ſcraped together the moſt of my Eſtate. To them
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:108243:279"/>
belongs the Soul of my Wife, and the Souls of my Children, who that they might have where withal to ſpend upon Cloaths, Feaſting and Luxury, put me upon the wicked Trade of Uſury. To them alſo belongs the Soul of my Confeſſor, who encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged my wickedneſs by his ſilence. And ſo ſaying he breathed his laſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. St. <hi>Jereme</hi> rebukes the Covetouſneſs of Heirs, with this Fable. A little Pig bewailed the Death of its Dam. with a moſt bitter gruntling; but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Will read, and that there were a heap of Acorns, and ſome Buſhels of Peaſe left him, he held his Peace; and being asked wherefore he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Lamentation ſo ſuddainly; Oh, ſaith he, the Acorns and the Peaſe have ſtopped my Mouth. This is the Humour of moſt Heirs now adays. They gape after the Legacies, make Inventories of the Goods, and tell the Money; let what will become of the Soul of the Teſtator; let him reſt as he has deſerved. But let us view another ſort of Wills.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Holy Martyr <hi>Hierem,</hi> the fourth day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was carried to Execution, left his Eſtate to his Mother and Siſter; but to <hi>Ruſticius,</hi> who was chief in Authority in the Commonwealth of <hi>Aneyra,</hi> his Hand already cut off.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Holy <hi>Hilarion,</hi> at Fourſcore years of Age, made <hi>Heſychius</hi> his Heir, in theſe Words. All my Wealth, that is to ſay, the Goſpel, and one Hair Veſt, my Coat, and little Cloak, I leave to my moſt loving Friend <hi>Heſychius.</hi> And this was all the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of his Goods.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Antonius</hi> the Great, made his Will, in theſe Words. As for the Place of my Burial, let no man know, but your own Love. My Felt, and old Cloak, give it to <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> the Biſhop, which he gave me when it was uew. Let <hi>Serapion,</hi> the Biſhop, take the other, which is ſomewhat better. Do you
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:108243:279"/>
take my Hair Garment. And ſo farewel. My Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els for <hi>Antony</hi> is going. He had no ſooner ended theſe Words, but extending his Legs, he gave admittance to Death.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria, John</hi> of <hi>Almes,</hi> wrote his Will thus. I give thee thanks, O God, that at my Death, of all my Revenues, it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thee to let me have remaining, but one third part of a pound. When <hi>Alexandria</hi> firſt made me their Patriarch, I found Fourſcore Hundred pieces of Gold; to this the Friends of Chriſt added an unſpeakable quantity of Money, all which, that I might give to God that which was Gods, I expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Poor; wherefore what remains I alſo give to them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. To this may be added, the Will of a certain Chriſtian, changing only the Name, the Year, and the Day.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Achathius,</hi> Victor, have been running to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, from the year 1581. upon the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> and have Eternity in my mind. Now I commend my Spirit to God; and becauſe I cannot deny the Earth what belongs to it, I bequeath my Body to the Earth, and to the Worms. Of my Goods, there is nothing now mine, but good will, which I carry with me to the Tribunal of God; the reſt I thus diſpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I forgive all my Enemies from the bottom of my Heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I am ſincerely ſorry for all my Sins.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I believe in Chriſt Jeſus, my moſt loving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. And in this Faith, I deſire the Sacrament of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I hope for Eternal Life through the goodneſs of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I love my God, with all my Heart, above all things, and reſign my ſelf up fully to his holy will.</p>

                  <p>Unleſs every Chriſtian ſo order his Life, and his laſt Actions, he is to be thought to have lived ill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to have died worſe. The laſt Hour conſumates Death, but is not the cauſe of it; which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by a good Death: For nothing makes Death ill, but what follows Death. Good Seed brings a good Harveſt. The Highway to a good Death, is a good Life. I may not unfitly compare Life and Death to a Syllogiſme. The end of a Syllogiſme, is the Concluſion; the Concluſion of Life Death: But the Concluſion is either true or falſe, according to the Nature of the Antecedents; ſo is Death good or bad, as the Life before was good or bad. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeverely prononnces, ſaying, <hi>Whoſe end ſhall be according to their VVorks.</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 15.</p>
                  <p>Memorable is the Death of that Holy Martyr, <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> who being led to Execution, rejoicing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with a loud Voice; I have, ſaid he, preſerved my Virginity, I have kept the Goſpels, I have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Truth, and now I bow my Head a Victim to God.

                  <p>Whoever thou art, O Chriſtan, before thou layſt thy ſelf to Sleep, examine thy Conſcience, and wipe away the ſtains and ſpots that defile it. There are many who have begun to ſleep, and die both together; and ended their Lives before they had ſtept out of their Sleep. The Brother of Death is to be feared, and not only cautiouſly, but chaſtly to be fallen into. He that ſleeps not chaſtly, ſhall hardly wake chaſtly.</p>

Pity me, O God, pity me, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy great Mercy! Spare a Sinner, O Infinite God; through the Paſſion and Blood of thy dear Son.

Why do we fear to die?</p>
                  <p>8ly, The Hope of Reſurrection. Wherefore do we expoſtulate with <hi>Death?</hi> He does not deprive us, but introduces us into Life. The Day will ſhine that will recal us from our Graves. We ſhall all riſe. Which ſundry Arguments demonſtrate unto us, as has been already ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>9ly, Immortality it ſelf. <hi>Death</hi> is the end and paſſage; the end of Calamity, the paſſage to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity. Hence the death of the Juſt is called their <hi>Birth-day.</hi> Hence alſo that other Saying, <hi>Death is but a Sport to a true Chriſtian.</hi> And that no man might fear this Sport, <hi>Prudentius</hi> in his Hymns, has theſe Lines.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:108243:300"/>But it is good that the Body be kept veiled and ſecret, and not expoſed to curious Eyes; neither ſhould the diſhonours wrought upon the Face, by the changes of death, be ſtared upon by imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> was dying, he called his Sons and Friends to take their leave of him, to touch his Hand, to ſee him the laſt time, and gave in charge, that when he had put his Vail over his Face, no Man ſhould uncover it. And <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Body was reſcued from inquiſitive Eyes by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. Let it be interr'd after the manner of the Countrey, and Laws of the Place, and the Dignity of the Perſon; for ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> was Buried with great Solemnity, and <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Bones were carried into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> after they had been embalmed, and kept 400 years, and <hi>devout men carried St.</hi> Stephen <hi>to his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, making great lamentation over him.</hi> And <hi>Aelian</hi> tells us that thoſe who were the moſt excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, were buried in publick, and men of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Courage and Fortune had their Graves only trim'd with Branches of green Olives, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flowers, together with a few ſprigs of Roſema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Bays.</p>
            <p>But nothing of this concerns the dead in real and effective purpoſes; nor is it with care to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by themſelves, but it is the duty of the living; for to them, it is all one whether they be carried forth in a Chariot or a wooden Bier, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they rot in the Air, or in the Earth, whether they be devoured by Fiſhes or by Worms, by Birds or by Sepulchral Dogs, by Water or by Fire, or by delay.</p>
            <p>Concerning doing honour to the dead, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is not long; anciently the Friends of the dead uſed to make their Funeral Orations, and the Cuſtom deſcended, and in the Channel of time it mingled it ſelf in the Veins of the Earth, through

            <p>But that which is moſt conſiderable is, that we perform the will of the dead, the Laws oblige us, and will ſee to it; but did they not, certainly it is the nobleſt thing in the World, to do an act of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him whom we ſhall never ſee again, but yet hath deſerved it of us, and to whom we would do it if he were preſent: And unleſs we do ſo, our Charity is Mercenary, and our <hi>Friendſhips</hi> are direct Merchandize, and our Gifts are Brokage; but what we do to the dead, or to the living for their ſakes, is <hi>Gratitude, and Vertue for Vertues ſake, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt portion of Humanity, Kindneſs and Love.</hi>

               <p>IN the firſt place, when our dear Friends and Relations are dead, we close their <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Mouth,</hi> which a Learned Author ſays, is a Cuſtom that was uſed by the Primitive Chriſtians, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent that the death of the Faithful is, according to the Oracles of Scripture, nothing elſe but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; ſince after having been aſleep for a while, they ſhall be awaked to Eternity. Moreover by <hi>ſhutting their Eyes and Mouth,</hi> we do intimate, that the dead are no more to take delight in the Objects of this viſible World, their Employment now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtedfaſtly to behold all the Raviſhing Beauties

               <head>The Reaſons why Dead Bodies are often Kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Waſhed, Perfumed and Cloathed: Together with the Cuſtoms of ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Burial of their Dead.</head>
               <p>MAny Perſons, 1. Kiſs, and kindly Salute their dead Friends and Relations, to ſhew the natural tenderneſs and love they had for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed; but this Cuſtom is now quite aboliſhed with us in many places, though this practice ought not to be altogether diſcommended. 2. As for the uſage that is in ſome Countreys, of waſhing the dead, St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> tells us, that it was derived at firſt from the Perſon of our Lord and Saviour, whoſe precious Body was waſhed as ſoon as they took it down from the Croſs. And we read in the ninth Chapter of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> that a Woman of <hi>Joppa</hi> called <hi>Tabitha,</hi> whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> reſtored to Life, had been waſh'd before ſhe was laid out for the Grave. <hi>The Indians burn their dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Cuſtom of Perfuming and Embalming the Corps, hath in our days been (eſpecially in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) much obſerved. And indeed the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> were ſo careful to <hi>perfume the dead,</hi> was, becauſe they regarded them as ſo many Members of the Myſtical Body of the Redeemer of the World. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apology, upbraiding the Heathens with the vaſt expences of ſweet Scents and Perfumes, conſumed in the Temples, tells them that thoſe <hi>Odours</hi> would be better employed, in perfuming and embalming
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:108243:302"/>
the Bodies of Chriſtians, and their dear Friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. At the <hi>Canary Iſlands they bury their Dead with a Bottle of Wine ſtanding by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. As concerning the manner of Apparelling the Dead, all Chriſtians uſe not the ſame practice; for ſome do only cover them with a large <hi>Winding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheet,</hi> as they do in <hi>France:</hi> And others dreſs them in the very ſame Cloaths they were wont to wear, as in <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſeveral other places.

            <head>THE Funeral Solemnity.</head>
            <p>I Might here inlarge upon Mourning for, and the Ancient Cuſtoms and Manners of <hi>Burying the Dead in all Nations,</hi> throughout all the habitable World.</p>
            <p>The Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> did uſe them that were dead after two manners, and they had two <hi>kinds of Obſequies;</hi> the firſt and moſt Ancient was to cover the dead with Earth, and to bury them as we do; the other to burn their Bodies, but this manner did not continue long.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> was the Inventer of Obſequies, and he Inſtituted a High-prieſt, who had the Charge. The firſt Honour which they uſed to perform in the Obſequies of Famous Perſons, was to commend the Party by an Oration. <hi>Valerius Publicola</hi> made a Funeral Oration on the death, and in the praiſe of <hi>Brutus.</hi> In like manner <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> being but Twelve years old, commended his Grandfather; and <hi>Tiberius</hi> at the Age of Nine years praiſed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ſecond Honour was to make Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>players to Fight. <hi>Marcus</hi> and <hi>Decius</hi> Sons to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Brutus,</hi> were the firſt that did practiſe this, in Honour of their Father. The third Honour was, to make a Feaſt of <hi>Magnificent Furniſhment.</hi> The fourth was a diſtribution of Meat to all the common People. And ſuch (as I have ſaid before) as could not be Buried with the like, and ſo great Pomp (for the Expences were inſupportable) were buried in the Night time, by the <hi>Veſpilions</hi> clothed all in white, who carried the dead Body to his Grave. They had likewiſe an Order, that
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:108243:304"/>
within ſome while after the Obſequies, they would ſtrew <hi>divers Flowers and ſweet Odours</hi> upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, as the <hi>Roman</hi> people did upon the Funeral Monument of <hi>Scipio.</hi> And alſo they accuſtomed yearly to Garniſh, Deck, and Adorn the Tombs or Graves of the Dead, with Poſies, Crowns and Garlands of all ſorts of Flowers. Husbands (ſaith Saint <hi>Jerom ad Pammachum</hi>) were wont to ſtraw; ſpread, or ſcatter over, and upon the Graves and Sepulchers of their deceaſed dear Wives, Violets, Roſes, Lillies, Hyacinths, and divers Purple Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; by which <hi>uxorious Office</hi> they did mitigate and leſſen the grief of their Hearts, conceived by the loſs of their <hi>Loving Bed-fellows.</hi> The like expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mutual Love Wives ſhewed to their buried Husbands.</p>
            <p>Now above all Flowers in theſe Ceremonious Obſervances, the <hi>Roſe</hi> was in greateſt requeſt, and had the ſole preheminence, as <hi>Kirman</hi> relates. To which <hi>Jo. Paſſeratius</hi> in his <hi>Roſa</hi> thus alludes.</p>
            <q>

               <l>The Roſe is grateful, of all Flowers the Head.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And <hi>Anacreon</hi> in praiſe of the Roſe thus ſings in one of his Odes: I will uſe the Latine Tranſlation.</p>

               <l>Roſa, caelitum voluptas.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And in another Ode in commendation of the Roſe more aptly to this purpoſe, thus,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Medicatur haec &amp; aegris,</l>
               <l>Defendit haec ſepultos.</l>
            </q>
            <q>
               <l>The Roſe full many griefs doth Cure,</l>
               <l>Defends Corps laid in Sepulture.</l>

            <p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:108243:304"/>The Ancient Ethnicks did hold the <hi>ſpringing of Flowers,</hi> from the Grave of a deceaſed Friend, an argument of his happineſs; and it was their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal wiſh, That the <hi>Tomb-ſtones</hi> of their dead Friends might be light unto them; and that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Spring-tide, of all kind of fragrant Flowers, might incircle their verdant Graves.

On this he talk'd, of this he pray'd, for this he long'd, and eſpecially when any bad News ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, his uſual Reflection thereupon would be, <q>Behold ſome of the Clouds in which we muſt look for the coming of the Son of Man.</q> At laſt his Lord, ſor whom he had been long wiſhing, <q>Lord come, I have been a great while ready for thy coming!</q> At laſt, I ſay, his Lord came, and fetched him away into the Joy of his Lord.</p>
                  <p>He fell into ſome Languiſhments, attended with a Fever, which in a few days brought him into the Pangs (may I ſay? or Joys) of Death: And while he lay in theſe, Mr. <hi>Walter</hi> coming to him, he ſaid unto him: <q>Brother, Thou art welcome to my very Soul.

is a work, which I have been Doing much and long about. But what was the word I ſpoke laſt? I recal that word, My Doings: Alas, they have been poor, and ſmall, and lean Doings, and I'll be the Man that ſhall throw the firſt Stone at them all.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has been obſerved, that they who have ſpoke many conſiderable things in their Lives, uſually ſpeak few at their Deaths. But it was otherwiſe with our <hi>Eliot,</hi> who after much Speech of and for God in his Life-time, uttered ſome things little ſhort of <hi>Oracles</hi> on his Death-bed; which, 'tis a thouſand pities, they were not more exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and recorded.
