            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

friends; I accordingly expect to see
these following particular Directions for
the taking of a <hi>Trout,</hi> to wait upon your
better and more general Rules for all
sorts of <hi>Angling:</hi> And, though mine be
neither so perfect, so well digested, nor
indeed so handsomely coucht as they
might have been, in so long a time as
since your leave was granted; yet, I
dare affirm them to be generally true:
And they had appeared too in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

more than ten days time to turn me in,
and rub up my memory (for in truth I
have not in all this long time, though
<pb facs="tcp:54531:3"/>
I have often thought on't, and almost
as often resolv'd to go presently about it)
I was forc't upon the instant to scribble
what I here present you: which I have
also endeavour'd to accommodate to
your own Method. And, if mine be clear
enough for the honest Brothers of the
Angle readily to understand; (which
is the only thing I aim at) then I have
my end; and shall need to make no
further Apology; a writing of this kind,
not requiring (if I were Master of any
such thing) any Eloquence to set it off,
or recommend it; so that if you, in your
better Judgment, or kindness rather, can
allow it passable for a thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
You will then do me honour if
the <hi>Cypher</hi> fixt and carv'd in the front

                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>Why then Sir, seeing I perceive you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54531:5"/>
to be a Stranger in these parts; I shall take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me to inform you, that from the Town you
last came through, call'd <hi>Brelsford,</hi> it is five
miles, and you are not yet above half a mile on
this side.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>So much! I was told it was but ten
miles from <hi>Derby,</hi> and methinks I have rode
almost so far already.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>O Sir, find no fault with large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of good Land, which <hi>Derby-shire</hi> abounds
in, as much as most Counties of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>It may be so, and good Land I confess
affords a pleasant prospect: but by your good
leave Sir, large measure of foul way is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
so acceptable.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>True Sir, but the foul way serves to
justifie the fertility of the soyl; according to
the Proverb: <hi>There is good Land, where there
is foul way;</hi> and is of good use to inform you
of the Riches of the Country you are come into,
and of its continual Travel, and Traffick to
the Country Town you came from; which
is also very observable by the fulness of its
Road, and the loaden Horses you meet every
where upon the way.</p>

                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>well Sir, I will be content to think as
well of your Country, as you would desire,
and I shall have a great deal of reason both to
think, and to speak very well of you, If I may
obtain the happiness of your company to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54531:5"/>
forementioned place, provided your affaire
lead you that way, and that they will permit
you to slack your pace out of complacency to
a Traveller utterly a Stranger in these parts,
and who am still to wander further out of my
own knowledg.</p>

                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, you invite me to my own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and I am ready to attend you: my
way lying through that Town; but my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
that is, my home, some miles beyond it:
however I shall have time enough to lodg you
in your Quarters, and afterwards to perform
my own Journey. In the mean time may I
be so bold as to enquire the end of your Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis into <hi>Lancashire</hi> Sir, and about
some business of concern to a near Relation of
mine: for I assure you, I do not use to take
so long Journeys, as from <hi>Essex</hi> upon the single
account of pleasure.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>From thence Sir! I do not then won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you should appear dissatisfied with the
length of the Miles, and the foulness of the
way: though I am sorry you should begin to
quarrel with them so soon; for, believe me
Sir, you will find the Miles much longer, and
the way much worse before you come to your
Journies end.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>Why truly Sir for that, I am prepar'd
to expect the worst; but methinks the way is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54531:6"/>
mended since I had the good fortune to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your good company.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>You are not oblig'd to my company
for that: but because you are already past the
worst, and the greatest part of your way to
your Lodging.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>I am very glad to hear it, both for
the ease of my self, and my Horse; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
because I may then expect a freer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of your conversation; though the
shortness of the way will, I fear, make me lose
it the sooner.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>That Sir is not worth your care; and
I am sure you deserve much better, for being
content with so ill company: but we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
talkt away two Miles of your Journey;
for from the Brook before us, that runs at the
foot of this Sandy Hill, you have but three Miles
to <hi>Ashborn.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>I meet every where in this Country
with these little Brooks, and they look as if
they were full of Fish; have they not Trouts

                     <p>That is a question, which is to be
excus'd in a Stranger as you are; otherwise,
give me leave to tell you, it would seem a kind
of affront to our Country, to make a doubt of
what we pretend to be famous for, next, if not
before, our Malt, Wool, Lead, and Cole; for
you are to understand, that we think we have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54531:6"/>
as many fine Rivers, Rivulets, and Brooks, as
any Country whatever, and they are all full of
Trouts, and some of them the best (it is said)
by many degrees in <hi>England.</hi>

                     <p>I was first Sir in love with you, and
now shall be so enamour'd of your Country by
this account you give me of it, as to wish my
self a <hi>Derby-shire</hi> Man, or at least that I might live
in it: for you must know I am a pretender to
the Angle, and doubtless a Trout affords the
most pleasure to the Angler, of any sort of Fish
whatever; and the best Trouts, must needs
make the best sport: But this Brook, and
some others I have met with upon this way,
are too full of Wood for that recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

like it, which you have past, and some
that you are like to pass, have scarce any name
amongst us: but we can shew you as fine Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and as clear from wood, or any other
encumbrance to hinder an Angler, as any you
ever saw; and for clear, beautiful streams,
<hi>Hantshire</hi> it self, by Mr. <hi>Izaak Walton's</hi> good
leave, can shew none such; nor I think and
Country in <hi>Europe.</hi>

                     <p>You go far Sir in the praise of your
Country Rivers, and I perceive have read
Mr <hi>Walton</hi>'s <hi>Compleat Angler</hi> by your naming
of <hi>Hantshire,</hi> and I pray what is your opinion
of that Book?</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>My Opinion of Mr. <hi>Walton's</hi> Book is
the same with every Man's, that understands
any thing of the Art of Angling, that it is an
excellent good one, and that the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Gentleman understands as much of Fish, and
Fishing as any Man living: but I must tell you
further, that I have the happiness to know his
person, and to be intimately acquainted with
him, and in him to know the worthiest Man,
and to enjoy the best, and the truest Friend any
Man ever had: nay, I shall yet acquaint you
further, that he gives me leave to call him Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and I hope is not yet asham'd to own me
for his adopted Son.</p>

                     <p>In earnest Sir I am ravisht to meet
with a friend of Mr. <hi>Izaak Walton's,</hi> and one
that does him so much right in so good and
true a Character; for I must boast to you, that
I have the good fortune to know him too, and
came acquainted with him much after the same
manner I do with you; that he was my Master
who first taught me to love Angling, and then
to become an Angler; and to be plain with
you, I am the very Man decipher'd in his Book
under the name of <hi>Venator,</hi> for I was wholly
addicted to the Chace; till he taught me as
good, a more quiet, innocent, and less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
diversion.</p>

                     <p>Sir, I think my self happy in your
acquaintance, and before we part shall entreat
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54531:7"/>
leave to embrace you; you have said enough
to recommend you to my best opinion; for my
Father <hi>Walton</hi> will be seen twice in no Man's
company he does not like, and likes none but
such as he believes to be very honest men,
which is one of the best Arguments, or at least
of the best Testimonies I have, that I either
am, or that he thinks me one of those, seeing
I have not yet found him weary of me.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>You speak like a true Friend, and in
doing so render your self worthy of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
May I be so bold as to ask your name?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes surely Sir, and if you please a
much nicer question, my name is—and I
intend to stay long enough in your company,
if I find you do not dislike mine, to ask yours
too. In the mean time, because we are now
almost at <hi>Ashborn,</hi> I shall freely, and bluntly
tell you, that I am a Brother of the Angle too,
and peradventure can give you some instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
how to Angle for a Trout in a clear River,
that my Father <hi>Walton</hi> himself will not disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
though he did either purposely omit,
or did not remember them, when you, and he
sate discoursing under the <hi>Sycamore</hi> Tree. And
being you have already told me whether your
Journey is intended, and that I am better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Country than you are; I will
heartily, and earnestly entreat, you will not
think of staying at this Town: but go on with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54531:8"/>
me six Miles further to my House, where you
shall be extreamly welcom; it is directly in your
way, we have day enough to perform our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
&amp; as you like your entertainment, you may
there repose your self a day or two; or as many
more as your occasions will permit, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
the trouble of so much a longer Journey.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, you surprise me with so friendly
an invitation upon so short acquaintance: but
how advantagious soever it would be to me,
and that my hast perhaps is not so great, but
it might dispense with such a divertisement as I
promise my self in your Company; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in modesty accept your offer, &amp; must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
beg your pardon: I could otherwise, I confess
be glad to wait upon you, if upon no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
but to talk of Mr. <hi>I. Walton,</hi> and to receive
those instructions you say you are able to give
me for the deceiving a Trout; in which art I
will not deny, but that I have an ambition to
be one of the greatest deceivers; though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forbear freely to tell you, that I think it
hard to say much more, than has been read to
me upon that subject.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>well Sir, I grant that too; but you
must know that the variety of Rivers, require
different ways of Angling: however you shall
have the best Rules I am able to give, and I
will tell you nothing I have not made my self
as certain of, as any Man can be in thirty years
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54531:8"/>
experience (for so long I have been a dabler
in that art) and that if you please to stay a few
days, you shall not in a very great measure see
made good to you. But of that hereafter,
and now, Sir, if I am not mistaken I have
half overcome you; and that I may wholly
conquer that modesty of yours, I will take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me to be so familiar as to say, you must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
my invitation, which that you may the
more easily be perswaded to do, I will tell you
that my House stands upon the margin of one
of the finest Rivers for Trouts, and grayling
in <hi>England;</hi> that I have lately built a little
Fishing House upon it, dedicated to Anglers,
over the door of which you will see the two
first Letters of my Father <hi>Walton's</hi>
name and mine twisted in <hi>Cypher;</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">as in the Title page.</note>
that you shall lye in the same Bed he
has sometimes been contented with, and have
such Country entertainment, as my Friends
sometimes accept, and be as welcome too, as
the best Friend of them all.</p>

                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>No doubt Sir, but my Master <hi>Walton</hi>
found good reason to be satisfied with his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
in your House; for you who are so
friendly to a meer Stranger who deserves so
little, must needs be exceedingly kind and free
to him who deserves so much.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>Believe me, no! and such as are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
acquainted with that Gentleman, know
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54531:9"/>
him to be a Man, who will not endure to be
treated like a Stranger. So that his acceptation
of my poor entertainments, has ever been a
pure effect of his own humility, and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and nothing else. But Sir, we are now
going down the Spittle Hill into the Town, and
therefore let me importune you suddainly to
resolve, and most earnestly not to deny me.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>In truth Sir, I am so overcome by your
Bounty, that I find I cannot, but must ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my self wholly to be dispos'd by you.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>Why that's heartily, and kindly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and I as heartily thank you; and being
you have abandon'd your self to my conduct,
we will only call and drink a glass on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
at the <hi>Talbot,</hi> and away.</p>

                     <p>Yes, 'Tis call'd <hi>Henmore,</hi> and has in it
both Trout, and Grayling; but you will meet
with one or two better anon. And so soon as
we are past through the Town, I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
by such discourse as best likes you to pass
away the time, till you come to your ill Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

we are now come to the <hi>Talbot,</hi> what will
you drink Sir, Ale, or Wine.</p>

                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, I am for the Country liquor,
<hi>Derby-shire</hi> Ale, if you please; for a Man
should not methinks come from <hi>London</hi> to drink
Wine in the Peak.</p>

                     <p>You are in the right; and yet let me
tell you, you may drink worse <hi>French-wine</hi>
in many Taverns in <hi>London,</hi> than they have
sometimes at this House. What hoe! bring
us a Flaggon of your best Ale, and now Sir
my service to you, a good health to the honest

into the Peak.</p>

                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>Why this Sir is called <hi>Bently</hi> Brook,
and is full of very good Trout, and Grayling;
but so encumbred with wood in many places,
as is troublesom to an Angler.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>Here are the prettiest Rivers, and the
most of them in this Country that ever I saw;
do you know how many you have in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>I know them all, and they were not
hard to reckon, were it worth the trouble;
but the most considerable of them I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
name you. And to begin where we now
are (for you must know we are now upon the
very skirts of <hi>Derby-shire)</hi> we have first the
River <hi>Dove,</hi> that we shall come to by and by,
which divides the two Counties of <hi>Derby,</hi> and
<hi>Stafford</hi> for many Miles together, and is so
call'd from the swiftness of its current, and
that swiftness occasion'd by the declivity of its
course, and by being so straitned in that course
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54531:11"/>
betwixt the Rocks; by which, and those very
high ones, it is hereabout for four, or five
Miles confin'd into a very narrow stream. A
River that from a contemptible Fountain
(which I can cover with my Hat) by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of other Rivers, Rivulets, Brooks, and
Rills, is swell'd, (before it fall into <hi>Trent</hi> a
little below <hi>Egginton,</hi> (where it loses the
name,) to such a breadth, and depth, as to
be in most places navigable, were not the passage
frequently interrupted with Fords, and Wires,
and has as fertile Bancks, as any River in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
none excepted. And this River from
its head for a Mile or two is a black water (as
all the rest of the <hi>Derby-shire</hi> Rivers of note, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
are, for they all spring from the Mosses)
but is in a few Miles travel so clarified by the
addition of several clear, and very great springs
(bigger than it self) which gush out of the
Lime-stone Rocks, that before it comes to my
House, which is but six, or seven Miles from its
source, you will find it one of the purest Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline
streams you have seen.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes in these parts; not in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but somewhere towards the upper end of
<hi>Stafford-shire,</hi> I think not far from a place call'd
<hi>Trentham,</hi> and thence runs down not far from
<hi>Stafford</hi> to <hi>Wolsly</hi> Bridg, and washing the skirts
and purlews of the Forrest of <hi>Needwood</hi> runs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54531:11"/>
down to <hi>Burton</hi> in the same County; thence
it comes into this where we now are, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by <hi>Swarkston,</hi> and <hi>Dunnington,</hi> receives
<hi>Derwent</hi> at <hi>Wildon,</hi> and so to <hi>Nottingham,</hi>
thence to <hi>Newark,</hi> and by <hi>Gainsborough,</hi> to
<hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Hull,</hi> where it takes the name
of <hi>Humber,</hi> and thence falls into the Sea: but
that the Map will best inform you.</p>

                     <p>Know you whence this River <hi>Trent</hi>
derives its name?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>No indeed, and yet I have heard it
often discourst upon, when some have given its
denomination from the forenamed <hi>Trentham;</hi>
though that seems rather a derivative from it;
others have said 'tis so call'd from thirty Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
that fall into it, and there lose their names,
which cannot be neither, because it carries that
name from its very Fountain, before any other
Rivers fall into it; others derive it from thirty
several sorts of Fish that breed there, and that
is the most likely derivation: But be it how it
will, it is doubtless one of the finest Rivers in
the World, and the most abounding with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Salmon, and all sorts of delicate
Fish.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>Pardon me Sir for tempting you into
this digression, and then proceed to your other
Rivers; for I am mightily delighted with this
discourse.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
                     <p>It was no interruption, but a very
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54531:12"/>
seasonable question; for <hi>Trent</hi> is not only one
of our <hi>Derby-shire</hi> Rivers, but the chief of them,
and into which all the rest pay the Tribute of
their names; which I had perhaps forgot to
insist upon, being got to the other end of the
County, had you not awoke my memory.
But I will now proceed, and the next River of
note (for I will take them as they lye Eastward
from us) is the River <hi>Wye;</hi> I say of note, for
we have two lesser betwixt us and it, namely
<hi>Lathkin,</hi> and <hi>Bradford,</hi> of which <hi>Lathkin</hi> is
by many degrees the purest, and most transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
stream, that I ever yet saw either at home
or abroad, and breeds 'tis said, the reddest, and
the best Trouts in <hi>England;</hi> but neither of
these are to be reputed Rivers, being no better
than great springs. The River <hi>Wye</hi> then has
its source near unto <hi>Buxtons,</hi> a Town some ten
Miles from hence, famous for a warm Bath, and
which you are to ride through in your way to
<hi>Manchester,</hi> a black water too at the Fountain;
but by the same reason with <hi>Dove,</hi> becomes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
soon a most delicate clear River, and breeds
admirable Trout, and Grayling, reputed by
those, who, by living upon its Banks are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to it, the best of any, and this, running down
by <hi>Ashford, Bakewell,</hi> and <hi>Haddon;</hi> at a Town
a little lower call'd <hi>Rowsly</hi> falls into <hi>Derwent,</hi>
and there loses its name. The next in order
is <hi>Derwent</hi> a black water too, and that not only
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54531:12"/>
from its Fountain, but quite through its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
not having these Chrystal springs to wash
and cleanse it, which the two forementioned
have; but abounds with Trout and Grayling
(such as they are) towards its source, and
with <hi>Salmon</hi> below; and this River from the
upper and utmost part of this County, where
it springs, taking its course by <hi>Chatsworth,
Darly, Matlock, Derby, Burrow-Ash,</hi> and
<hi>Awberson,</hi> falls into <hi>Trent</hi> at a place call'd
<hi>Wildon,</hi> and there loses its name. The East
side of this County of <hi>Derby</hi> is bounded by
little inconsiderable Rivers, as <hi>Awber, Eroways,</hi>
and the like, scarce worth naming, but Trouty
too, and further we are not to enquire. But
Sir I have carried you, as a Man may say by
water, till we are now come to the descent of
the formidable Hill I told you of, at the foot
of which runs the River <hi>Dove,</hi> which I cannot
but love above all the rest, and therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
your self to be a little frighted.</p>

                     <p>Sir, I see you would fortifie me, that
I should not shame my self: but I dare follow
where you please to lead me, and I see no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
yet; for the descent methinks is thus far
green, even, and easy.</p>

                     <p>You will like it worse presently when
you come to the brow of the Hill, and now we
are there, what think you?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>What do I think? why I think
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54531:13"/>
it the strangest place that ever sure Men, and
Horses went down, and that (if there be any
safety at all) the safest way is to alight.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
                     <p>I think so too for you, who are mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a Beast not acquainted with these slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
stones; and though I frequently ride down,
I will alight too to bear you company, and to
lead you the way, and if you please my Man
shall lead your Horse.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>Marry Sir, and thank you too, for I
am afraid I shall have enough to do to look to
my self; and with my Horse in my hand
should be in a double fear, both of breaking my
neck, and my Horse's falling on me, for it is as
steep as a penthouse.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
                     <p>To look down from hence it appears
so, I confess, but the path winds and turns, and
will not be found so troublesom.</p>

                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>Would I were well down though!
Hoist thee! there's one fair scape! these stones
are so slippery I cannot stand! yet again! I think
I were best lay my heeles in my neck, and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
down.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
                     <p>If you think your heeles will defend
your neck, that is the way to be soon at the
bottom; but give me your hand at this broad
stone, and then the worst is past.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>I thank you Sir, I am now past it,
I can go my self. What's here the sign of a
Bridg? Do you use to Travel with wheel-bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
in this Country?</p>

                     <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
                     <p>Not that I ever saw Sir, why do you
ask that question?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>Because this Bridg certainly was made
for nothing else; why a mouse can hardly go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it: 'Tis not two fingers broad.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>You are pleasant, and I am glad to see
you so: but I have rid over the Bridg many
a dark night.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>Why according to the <hi>French</hi> proverb,
and 'tis a good one among a great many of
worse sense and sound that language abounds
in, <hi>Ce que Diu garde, est bien gardé.</hi> They,
whom God takes care of are in safe protection:
but, let me tell you, I would not ride over it for
a thousand pounds, nor fall off it for two; and
yet I think I dare venture on foot, though if
you were not by to laugh at me: I should do
it on all four.</p>

                     <p>Well, if ever I come to <hi>London</hi> (of
which many a Man there, if he were in my

(which is a kind of a Riddle) always in it the
best Mault, and the worst Ale in <hi>England.</hi>
Come take away, and bring us some pipes, and
a bottle of Ale, and go to your own Suppers.
Are you for this diet Sir?</p>

tell you, this day proves so calm, and the Sun
rises so bright, as promises no great success to

last night to divert you, and was only in

look you, <hi>Sir,</hi> now you are abroad, does not the

that way. But look you <hi>Sir,</hi> now you are at

I would entreat you would run through the

you, that I am so far in love with you, your
courtesie, and pretty Moreland Seat, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve

                     <p>You cannot oblige me more than by
such a promise, and therefore without more
Ceremony I will begin to tell you; that my
Father <hi>Walton</hi> having read to you before, it
would look like a presumption in me, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
would do so in any other man, to
pretend to give Lessons for angling after him,
who I do really believe understands as much of
it, at least as any man in <hi>England,</hi> did I not pre-acquaint
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54531:18"/>
you, that I am not tempted to it by
any vain opinion of my self, that I am able to
give you better directions; but having
from my Childhood pursued the recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of angling in very clear Rivers (truly I
think by much (some of them at least) the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in this Kingdom) and the manner of Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
here with us by reason of that exceeding
clearness, being something different from the
method commonly us'd in others, which by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not near so bright, admit of stronger tac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle,
and allow a nearer approach to the stream;
I may peradventure give you some Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that may be of use even in your own Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and shall bring you acquainted with more
Flies, and shew you how to make them, and
with what dubbing too, than he has taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of in his <hi>Compleat Angler.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I beseech you <hi>Sir</hi> do, and if you will lend
me your Steel, I will light a Pipe the while, for
that is commonly my Breakfast in a morning

Which three ways, though they are all of
them (as I shall hereafter endeavour to make
it appear) in some sort common to both those
kinds of Fish; yet are they not so generally and
absolutely so, but that they will necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a distinction, which in due place I will
also give you.

                           <item>With a Cork, or Float.</item>
                        </list>

<list>
                           <item>With a natural and living Flie: or,</item>

                     <p>First then of the natural Flie; of which we
generally use but two sorts, and those but in
the two months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> only, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Green Drake,</hi> and the <hi>Stone-Flies;</hi> though
I have made use of a third that way, called the
<hi>Chamblet-Flie</hi> with very good success for <hi>Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
but never saw it angled with by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
after this manner, my Master only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
who did many years ago, and was one of
the best Anglers, that ever I knew.</p>
                     <p>These are to be angled with, with a short
Line, not much more than half the length of
your Rod, if the air be still, or with a longer
very near, or all out as long as your Rod, if you
have any wind to carry it from you, and this
way of Fishing we call <hi>Daping, Dabbing</hi> or <hi>Dib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
wherein you are always to have your
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54531:20"/>
Line flying before you up or down the River as
the wind serves, and to angle as near as you
can to the bank of the same side whereon you
stand, though where you see a Fish rise near
you, you may guide your quick Flie over him,
whether in the middle, or on the contrary side,
and if you are pretty well out of sight, either by
kneeling, or the Interposition of a bank, or bush,
you may almost be sure to raise, and take him
too, if it be presently done; the Fish will other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
peradventure be remov'd to some other
place, if it be in the still deeps, where he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in motion, and roving up and down to
look for prey, though in a stream, you may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
almost, especially if there be a good stone
near, find him in the same place. Your Line
ought in this Case to be three good hairs next
the hook, both by reason you are in this
kind of angling, to expect the biggest Fish,
and also that wanting length to give him Line
after he is struck, you must be forc't to tugg
for't; to which I will also add, that not an
Inch of your Line being to be suffered to touch
the water in dibbling; it may be allow'd to
be the stronger. I should now give you a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of those Flies, their shape and colour,
and then give you an account of their breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and withal shew you how to keep and
use them; but shall defer that to their proper
place and season.</p>

                     <p>In earnest, Sir, you discourse very rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
of this affair, and I am glad to find my
self mistaken in you; for in plain truth I did
not expect so much from you.</p>

                     <p>Nay Sir, I can tell you a great deal
more than this, and will conceal nothing from
you. But I must now come to the second way
of angling at the top, which is with an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Flie, which also I will shew you how to
make before I have done, but first shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you, that with this you are to angle with
a Line longer by a yard and a half, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
two yards than your Rod, and with both
this, and the other in a still day in the streams,
in a breeze, that curles the water in the still
deeps, where (excepting in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi>
that the best Trouts will lye in shallow streams
to watch for prey, and even then too) you are
like to hit the best Fish.</p>
                     <p>For the length of your Rod you are always
to be govern'd by the breadth of the River
you shall chuse to angle at; and for a Trout Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
one of five or six yards long is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough, and longer (though never so neatly
and artificially made) it ought not to be, if you
intend to Fish at ease, and if otherwise, where
lies the sport?</p>
                     <p>Of these, the best that ever I saw are made
in <hi>York-shire,</hi> which are all of one piece;
that is to say, of several, six, eight, ten or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54531:21"/>
twelve pieces, so neatly piec't, and ty'd together
with fine thred below, and Silk above, as to
make it taper, like a switch, and to ply with
a true bent to your hand; and these are too
light, being made of Fir wood, for two or
three lengths, nearest to the hand, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wood nearer to the top, that a Man might
very easily manage the longest of them that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I saw, with one hand; and these when
you have given over Angling for a season,
being taken to pieces, and laid up in some dry
place, may afterwards be set together again in
their former postures, and will be as strait,
sound, and good as the first hour they were
made, and being laid in Oyl and colour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your Master <hi>Waltons</hi> direction, will
last many years.</p>
                     <p>The length of your line, to a Man that
knows how to handle his Rod, and to cast it, is
no manner of encumbrance, excepting in woody
places, and in landing of a Fish, which every
one that can afford to Angle for pleasure, has
some body to do for him, and the length of
line is a mighty advantage to the fishing at
distance; and to fish <hi>fine, and far off</hi> is the
first and principal Rule for Trout Angling.</p>
                     <p>Your Line in this case should never be less,
nor ever exceed two hairs next to the hook,
for one (though some I know will pretend to
more Art, than their fellows) is indeed too
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54531:22"/>
few, the least accident, with the finest hand
being sufficient to break it: but he that cannot
kill a Trout of twenty inches long with two,
in a River clear of wood and weeds, as this
and some others of ours are, deserves not the
name of an Angler.</p>
                     <p>Now to have your whole line as it ought to
be, two of the first lengths, nearest the hook,
should be of two hairs a piece, the next three
lengths above them of three, the next three
above them of four, and so of five, and six,
and seven, to the very top: by which means
your Rod and tackle will in a manner be taper
from your very hand to your hook; your line
will fall much better and straiter, and cast your
Flie to any certain place to which the hand
and eye shall direct it, with less weight and
violence, that would otherwise circle the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and fright away the fish.</p>
                     <p>In casting your line, do it always before you,
and so that your flie may first fall upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and as little of your line with it as is
possible, though if the vvind be stiff, you will
then of necessity be compell'd to drown a good
part of your line to keep your flie in the water:
and in casting your flie, you must aim at the
further, or nearer Bank, as the wind serves
your turn, which also vvill be with, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you on the same side several times in an
hour, as the River vvinds in its course, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54531:22"/>
you will be forc't to Angle up and down by
turns accordingly; but are to endeavour, as
much as you can, to have the wind evermore
on your back, and always be sure to stand as
far off the Bank as your length will give you
leave when you throw to the contrary side,
though when the wind will not permit you
so to do, and that you are constrain'd to Angle
on the same side whereon you stand, you must
then stand on the very brink of the River, and
cast your Flie at the utmost length of your
Rod and Line, up or down the River as the
gale serves.</p>
                     <p>It only remains, touching your Line, to
enquire whether your two hairs next to the
hook, are better twisted, or open; and for
that, I should declare that I think the open
way the better, because it makes less shew in
the water, but that I have found an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
or two, or three, that have made me
almost weary of that way; of which one is,
that without dispute they are not so strong
twisted, as open; another, that they are not
easily to be fastned of so exact an equal length
in the arming, that the one will not cause the
other to bagge, by which means a Man has
but one hair, upon the matter, to trust to;
and the last is, that these loose flying hairs are
not only more apt to catch upon every twig,
or bent they meet with; but moreover the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54531:23"/>
hook, in falling upon the water, will very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
rebound, and fly back betwixt the hairs,
and there stick (which in a rough water espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
is not presently to be discern'd by the
Angler) so as the point of the hook shall stand
revers't, by which means your Flie swims
backward, makes a much greater circle in the
water, and till taken home to you, and set
right, will never raise any Fish, or if it should,
I am sure, but by a very extraordinary chance,
can hit none.</p>
                     <p>Having done with both these ways of fishing
at the top; the length of your Rod, and Line
and all: I am next to teach you how to make
a Flie; and afterwards of what dubbing you
are to make the several Flies I shall hereafter
name to you.</p>
                     <p>In making a Flie then (which is not a
Hackle or Palmer Flie for of those, and their
several kinds we shall have occasion to speak
every Month in the Year) you are first to hold
your hook fast betwixt the fore finger and
thumb of your left hand, with the back of the
shanck upwards, and the point towards your
fingers end; then take a strong small silk of the
colour of the Flie you intend to make, wax it
well with wax of the same colour too (to
which end you are always (by the way) to
have wax of all colours about you) and draw
it betwixt your finger and thumb, to the head
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54531:23"/>
of the shanck, and then whip it twice or
thrice about the bare hook, which, you must
know, is done, both to prevent slipping, and
also that the shanck of the hook may not cut
the hairs of your Towght, which sometimes
it will otherwise do) which being done, take
your Line, and draw it likewise betwixt your
finger and thumb, holding the Hook so fast,
as only to suffer it to pass by, untill you have
the knot of your Towght almost to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the shanck of your hook, on the inside
of it, then whip your silk twice or thrice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
both hook and Line, as hard as the strength
of the silk will permit, which being done, strip
the feather for the wings proportionable to the
bigness of your Flie, placing that side down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
which grew uppermost before, upon
the back of the hook, leaving so much only as
to serve for the length of the wing of the point
of the plume, lying revers't from the end of
the shanck upwards, then whip your silk
twice, or thrice about the root end of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
hook, and towght, which being done
clip off the root end of the feather close by the
arming, and then whip the silk fast and firm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the hook, and tought untill you come to
the bend of the hook: but not further (as
you do at <hi>London;</hi> and so make a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsom,
and, in plain <hi>English,</hi> a very unnatural
and shapeless Flie) which being done, cut
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54531:24"/>
away the end of your tought, and fasten it, and
then take your dubbing which is to make the
body of your Flie, as much as you think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
and holding it lightly, with your
hook, betwixt the finger, and thumb of your
left hand, take your silk with the right, and
twisting it betwixt the finger and thumb of
that hand, the dubbing will spin it self about
the silk, which when it has done, whip it about
the arm'd hook backward, till you come to
the setting on of the wings; and then take
the feather for the wings, and divide it equally
into two parts, and turn them back towards
the bend of the Hook, the one on the one side,
and the other on the other of the shanck,
holding them fast in that posture betwixt the
fore finger, and thumb of your left hand,
which done, warp them so down, as to stand,
and slope towards the bend of the hook, and
having warpt up to the end of the shanck, hold
the Flie fast betwixt the finger and thumb of
your left hand, and then take the silk betwixt
the finger, and thumb of your right hand,
and where the warping ends, pinch or nip it
with your thumb nail against your finger, and
strip away the remainder of your dubbing
from the silk, and then with the bare silk whip it
once or twice about, make the wings to stand in
due order, fasten, and cut it off; after which
with the point of a needle raise up the dubbing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54531:24"/>
gently from the warp, twitch off the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
hairs of your dubbing, leave the wings
of an equal length (your Flie will never else
swim true) and the work is done. And this
vvay of making a Flie (vvhich is certainly
the best of all other) vvas taught me by a
Kinsman of mine, one Captain <hi>Henry Jackson,</hi>
a near neighbour, an admirable Flie Angler,
by many degrees the best Flie maker, that ever
I yet met with. And now that I have told
you how a Flie is to be made, you shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
see me make one, vvith vvhich you may
peradventure take a Trout this morning, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithstanding
the unlikeliness of the day; for
it is now nine of the Clock, and Fish vvill
begin to rise, if they vvill rise to day; I will
vvalk along by you, and look on, and after
dinner I vvill proceed in my lecture of Flie-Fishing.</p>

                     <p>You perhaps may think now, that I
rake together this Trumpery, as you call it,
for shew only, to the end that such as see it
(which are not many I assure you) may think
me a great Master in the Art of angling: but
let me tell you here are some colours (as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
as they seem here) that are very hard
to be got, and scarce any one of them, which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54531:25"/>
if it should be lost, I should not miss, and be
concern'd about the loss of it too, once in the
year; but look you, Sir, amongst all these I
will chuse out these two colours only, of which
this is Bears-hair, this darker no great matter
what; but I am sure I have kill'd a great deal
of Fish with it; and with one or both of these
you shall take Trout or Grayling this very day,
notwithstanding all disadvantages, or my Art
shall fail me.</p>

pray observe then. You see first how I hold
my hook, and thus I begin. Look you here are
my first two or three whips about the bare
hook, thus I joyn hook and line, thus I put on
my wings, thus I twirle and lap on my dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,
thus I work it up towards the head, thus
I part my wings, thus I nip my superfluous
dubbing from my silk, thus fasten, thus trim
and adjust my Flie, and there's a Flie made, and

                     <p>In earnest, admirably well, and it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly

make the bodies of our Flies both much bigger

shall now, if you please, make a Flie your self,

twenty with one of mine. Give me that Bag
again, <hi>Sirrah;</hi> look you <hi>Sir,</hi> there is a hook,

is for a very little Flie, and you must make
your wings accordingly; for as the case stands
it must be a little Flie, and a very little one too,

therefore chuse always to make your Flies on
such a bright Sun-shine day as this, which also
you may the better do, because it is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

but I will not commend you too much, left I
make you proud. Come put it on, and you shall
now go downward to some streams betwixt the
rocks below the little foot bridg you see there,
and try your Fortune. Take heed of slipping
into the water as you follow me under this
rock: So now you are over, and now throw
in.</p>

                     <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
                     <p>And a precious catch you have of him;
pull him out! I see you have a tender hand:
This is a diminutive Gentleman, e'en throw
him in again, and let him grow till he be more
worthy your anger.</p>

and a Grayling. Why you have Fish
here at will.</p>

                     <p>Come, come, cross the Bridge, and
go down the other side lower, where you will
find finer streams, and better sport I hope than
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54531:27"/>
this. Look you <hi>Sir,</hi> here is a fine stream now,
you have length enough, stand a little further
off, let me entreat you, and do but Fish this
stream like an Artist, and peradventure a good
Fish may fall to your share. How now! what
is all gone?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>No, I but touch't him; but that was a

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
                     <p>Why now let me tell you, you lost that
Fish by yout own fault, and through your own
eagerness and haste; for you are never to offer
to strike a good Fish, if he do not strike him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
till first you see him turn his head after he
has taken your Flie, and then you can never
strain your tackle in the striking, if you strike
with any manner of moderation. Come throw
in one again, and fish me this stream by inches;
for I assure you here are very good Fish, both
Trout and Grayling, lie here; and at that
great stone on the other side, 'tis ten to one a
good Trout gives you the meeting.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>I have him now, but he is gone down
towards the bottom, I cannot see what he is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet
he should be a good Fish by his weight; but
he makes no great stir.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
                     <p>Why then, by what you say, I dare
venture to assure you, 'tis a Grayling, who is
one of the deadest hearted Fishes in the world,
and the bigger he is the more easily taken. Look
you, now you see him plain; I told you what
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54531:28"/>
he was, bring hither that landing net, Boy, and
now <hi>Sir,</hi> he is your own; and believe me a
good one, sixteen Inches long I warrant him,
I have taken none such this year.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>I never saw a Grayling before look so
black.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
                     <p>Did you not? Why then let me tell
you, that you never saw one before in right sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
for then a Grayling is very black about
his head, guills, and down his back, and has his
Belly of a dark grey, dappled with black spots,
as you see this is, and I am apt to conclude, that
from thence he derives his name of <hi>Vmber.</hi>
Though I must tell you this Fish is past his
prime, and begins to decline, and was in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
season at Christmas than he is now. But
move on, for it grows towards dinner-time, and
there is a very great and fine stream below,
under that Rock, that fills the deepest pool in
all the River, where you are almost sure of a
good Fish.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                     <p>Let him come, I'le try a fall with him;
but I had thought, that the Grayling had been
always in season with the Trout, and had come
in, and gone out with him.</p>
                     <p>Oh no! assure your self a Grayling is a
winter-fish: but such a one as would deceive
any but such as know him very well indeed;
for his flesh, even in his worst season, is so firm,
and will so easily calver, that in plain truth he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54531:28"/>
is very good meat at all times; but in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
season (which, by the way, none but an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergrown
Grayling will ever be) I think him
so good a fish, as to be little inferiour to the
best Trout that ever I tasted in my life.</p>

<hi>Pike-Pool:</hi> and young Mr. <hi>Izaac

as to draw it in Landschape in

                     <p>Yes marry has he Sir, and that again,
and again too, and in <hi>France</hi> since, and at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and at <hi>Venice,</hi> and I can't tell vvhere:

so soon as I can see him, which vvill be,
God vvilling, next Month. In the mean time,
Sir, to come to this fine stream at the head of
this great Pool, you must venture over these
slippery cobling stones; believe me, Sir, there
you vvere nimble or else you had been down;
but now you are got over, look to your self;
for on my vvord if a Fish rise here, he is like
to be such a one, as will endanger your tackle:

                     <p>I think you have such command here
over the Fishes, that you can raise them by your
vvord, as they say Conjurers can do Spirits,
and afterward make them do vvhat you bid
them: for here's a Trout has taken my Flie, I
had rather have lost a Crown. What luck's
this! He vvas a lovely Fish, and turn'd up a

Never concern your self for the loss of your

                     <p>Come Sir, having now well din'd,
and being again set in your little House;
I will now challenge your promise, and entreat
you to proceed in your instruction for Flie-fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which, that you may be the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
to do, I will assure you, that I have
not lost, I think, one syllable of what you have
told me; but very well retain all your directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
both for the Rod, Line, and making a
Flie, and now desire an account of the Flies
themselves.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
                     <p>Why Sir, I am ready to give it you,
and shall have the whole afternoon to do it in,
if no body come in to interrupt us; for you
must know (besides the unfitness of the day)
that the afternoons so early in <hi>March</hi> signifie ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little to Angling with a Flie, though with
a Minnow, or a Worm something might (I
confess) be done.</p>
                     <p>To begin then where I left off, my Father
<hi>Walton</hi> tells us but of 12 Artificial flies only, to
Angle with at the top, and gives their names;
of which some are common with us here;
and I think I guess at most of them by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
and I believe they all breed, and are
taken in our Rivers, though we do not make
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54531:31"/>
them either of the same Dubbing, or fashion.
And it may be in the Rivers about <hi>London,</hi>
which I presume he has most frequented, and
where 'tis likely he has done most execution,
there is not much notice taken of many more:
but we are acquainted with several others here
(though perhaps I may reckon some of his by
other names too) but if I do, I shall make
you amends by an addition to his Catalogue.
And although the forenamed great Master in
the Art of Angling (for so in truth he is)
tells you that no man should in honesty catch a
Trout till the middle of <hi>March,</hi> yet I hope he
will give a Man leave sooner to take a Grayling,
which, as I told you, is in the dead Months in
his best season; and do assure you (which I
remember by a very remarkable token) I did
once take upon the sixt day of December one,
and only one, of the biggest Graylings and the
best in season, that ever I yet saw, or tasted;
and do usually take Trouts too, and with a
Flie, not only before the middle of this Month,
but almost every year in <hi>February,</hi> unless it be
a very ill spring indeed, and have sometimes in
<hi>January,</hi> so early as New-years-tide, and in
frost and snow taken Grayling in a warm sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine
day for an hour or two about Noon; and
to fish for him with a Grub it is then the best
time of all.</p>
                     <p>I shall therefore begin my Flie-fishing with
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54531:31"/>
that Month (though I confess very few begin
so soon, and that such as are so fond of the sport
as to embrace all opportunities, can rarely in
that Month find a day fit for their purpose)
and tell you, that upon my knowledg these
Flies in a warm sun, for an hour or two in the
day, are certainly taken.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. A red brown with wings of the Male of
a Malard almost white: the dubbing of the
tail of a black long coated Cur, such as they
commonly make muffs of; for the hair on the
tail of such a Dog dies, and turns to a red
Brown, but the hair of a smoth coated Dog
of the same colour will not do, because it will
not dye, but retains its natural colour, and
this flie is taken in a warm sun, this whole
Month thorough.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is also a very little bright Dun
Gnat, as little as can possibly be made, so little
as never to be fisht with, with above one hair
next the hook, and this is to be made of a
mixt dubbing of Martins fur, and the white
of a Hares scut; with a very white, and small
wing; and 'tis no great matter how fine you
fish, for nothing will rise in this Month but a
Grayling, and of them I never at this season
saw any taken with a Flie, of above a foot
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54531:32"/>
long in my life: but of little ones about the
bigness of a smelt in a warm day, and a glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Fishes, and they are both taken the whole

Month ends, another almost of the same colour
begins with this, saving that the dubbing of
this must be of something a blacker colour, and
both of them warpt on with red silk; the dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
that should make this Flie, and that is the
truest colour, is to be got of the black spot of
a Hogs ear: not that a black spot in any part
of the Hog will not afford the same colour;
but that the hair in that place is by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
softer, and more fit for the purpose: his
wing must be as the other, and this kills all this
Month, and is call'd the lesser Red-brown.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Month also a plain Hackle, or pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-Flie

of black Spaniels furr, or the whirl of an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stridg</hi>
feather, and the red Hackle of a Capon
over all, will kill, and if the weather be right
make very good sport.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Also a lesser Hackle with a black body al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
silver twist over that, and a red feather o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all, will fill your pannier if the Month be
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54531:32"/>
open, and not bound up in Ice, and snow, with
very good Fish; but in case of a frost and
snow, you are to Angle only with the smallest
Gnats, Browns and Duns you can make, and
with those are only to expect Graylings no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
than sprats.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In this Month, upon a whirling round
water, we have a great Hackle, the body black,
and wrapped with a red feather of a Capon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim'd;
that is, the whole length of the Hackle
staring out (for we sometimes barb the Hackle
feather short all over; sometimes barb it only a
little, and sometimes barb it close underneath,
leaving the whole length of the feather on the
top, or back of the Flie which makes it
swim better, and as occasion serves kills very
great Fish.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We make use also in this Month of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great Hackle the body black, and rib'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with Gold twist, and a red feather over all,
which also does great execution.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Also a great Dun, made with Dun Bears
Hair, and the wings of the grey feather of
a Mallard near unto his tail, which is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the best Flie can be thrown upon a River this
Month, and with which an Angler shall have
admirable sport.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. We have also this Month the great blew
Dun, the dubbing of the bottom of Bears hair
next to the roots, mixt with a little blew
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54531:33"/>
Camlet, the wings of the dark grey feather of a
Mallard.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. We have also this Month a Dark-Brown,
the dubbing of the brown hair of the Flanck
of a brended Cow, and the wings of the grey-Drakes
feather.</p>
                     <p>And note, that these several Hackels, or
Palmer Flies, are some for one Water, and one
Skye, and some for another, and according to
the change of those, we alter their size, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and note also, that both in this, and all
other Months of the Year, when you do not
certainly know what Flie is taken; or cannot
see any Fish to rise, you are then to put on a
small Hackle, if the Water be clear, or a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
if something dark, untill you have taken
one, and then thrusting your finger thorough
his Guils, to pull out his Gorge, which being
open'd with your knife, you will then discover
what Flie is taken, and may fit your self accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                     <p>For the making of a Hackle, or Palmer Flie
my Father <hi>Walton</hi> has already given you suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
direction.</p>

Hackels, and Flies with the other, but you are
to make them less.</p>

1. We have besides for this Month a little
Dun call'd a whirling Dun (though it is not
the whirling Dun indeed, which is one of the
best Flies we have) and for this the dubbing
must be of the bottom fur of a Squirrels tail
and the wing of the grey feather of a Drake.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Also a bright brown, the dubbing either
of the brown of a Spaniel, or that of a Cows
flanck, with a Grayling.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Also a whitish Dun made of the roots of
Camels hair, and the wings of the grey feather
of a Mallard.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There is also for this Month a Flie, call'd
the Thorn Tree Flie, the dubbing an absolute
black mixt with eight or ten hairs of <hi>Isabella</hi>
colour'd Mohair, the body as little as can be
made, and the wings of a bright Malards fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
an admirable Flie, and in great repute
amongst us for, a killer.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There is besides this another blew Dun,
the dubbing of which it is made being thus to
be got. Take a small tooth comb, and with
it comb the neck of a black Grey hound, and
the down that sticks in the teeth, will be the
finest blew, that ever you saw. The wings of
this Flie can hardly be too white, and he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
about the tenth of this Month, and lasteth
till the four and twentieth.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. From the tenth of this Month also till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end, is taken a little black Gnat;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54531:34"/>
the dubbing either of the fur of a black water-Dog,
or the down of a young black water-Coot,
the wings of the Male of a Mallard as
white as may be, the body as little as you
can possibly make it, and the wings as short as
his body.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. From the Sixteenth of this Month also
to the end of it, we use a bright brown, the
dubbing for which, is to be had out of a Skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Lime-pits, and of the hair of an abortive
Calf, which the lime will turn to be so bright,
as to shine like Gold, for the wings of this Flie,
the feather of a brown Hen is best; which Flie
is also taken till the tenth of <hi>April.</hi>

                     <p>All the same Hackles, and Flies that were
taken in <hi>March</hi> will be taken in this Month also,
with this distinction only concerning the Flies,
that all the browns be lapt with red silk, and the
Duns with yellow.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To these a small bright brown, made of
Spaniels fur, with a light grey wing; in a
bright day, and a clear water is very well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We have too a little dark brown, the dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of that colour, and some violet Camlet
mixt, and the wing of the grey feather of a
Mallard.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:54531:34"/>
3. From the sixth of this Month to the
tenth, we have also a Flie call'd the violet Flie,
made of a dark violet stuff, with the wings of
the grey feather of a Mallard.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. About the twelfth of this Month comes
in the Flie call'd the whirling Dun, which is
taken every day about the mid time of day all
this Month through, and by fits from thence to
the end of <hi>June,</hi> and is commonly made of
the down of a Fox Cub, which is of an Ash
colour at the roots, next the skin, and ribb'd
about with yellow silk, the wings of the pale
grey feather of a Mallard.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There is also a yellow Dun, the dubbing
of Camels hair, and yellow Camlet, or wool
mixt, and a white grey wing.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. There is also this Month another little
brown, besides that mention'd before, made
with a very slender body, the dubbing of dark
brown, and violet Camlet mixt, and a grey
wing; which though the direction for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
be near the other, is yet another Flie,
and will take when the other will not, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in a bright day, and a clear water.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. About the twentieth of this Month comes
in a Flie call'd the Horse-flesh Flie, the dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of which is a blew Mohair, with pink
colour'd, and red Tammy mixt, a light colour'd
wing, and a dark brown head. This flie is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
best in an Evening, and kills from two
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54531:35"/>
hours before Sun set till twilight, and is taken
the Month thorough.</p>

                     <p>And now Sir, that we are entring into the
Month of <hi>May,</hi> I think it requisite to beg not
only your attention; but also your best pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
for I must now be a little tedious with
you, and dwell upon this Month longer than
ordinary; which that you may the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
I must tell you, this Month deserves,
and requires to be insisted on, for as much as
it alone, and the next following afford more
pleasure to the Flie-Angler, than all the rest;
and here it is that you are to expect an account
of the Green Drake, and stone-flie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
you so long ago, and some others that
are peculiar to this Month, and part of the
Month following, and that (though not so
great either in bulk, or name) do yet stand in
competition with the two before named, and
so, that it is yet undecided amongst the Anglers
to which of the pretenders to the Title of the
May-flie, it does properly, and duly belong,
neither dare I (where so many of the learned
in this Art of Angling are got in dispute about
the controversie) take upon me to determine;
but I think I ought to have a vote amongst
them, and according to that priviledg, shall
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54531:35"/>
give you my free opinion, and peradventure
when I have told you all, you may incline to
think me in the right.</p>

                        <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
                        <p>I have so great a deference to your

                        <p>Why that's encouragement enough;
and now prepare your self for a tedious Lecture;
but I will first begin with the flies of less esteem
(though almost any thing will take a Trout in
<hi>May)</hi> that I may afterwards insist the longer
upon those of greater note, and reputation;
know therefore that the first flie we take notice
of in this Month, is call'd the Turky-flie,
the.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The dubbing ravell'd out of some blew stuff,
and lapt about with yellow silk, the wings of a
grey Mallards feather.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. next a great Hackle; or Palmer-flie,
with a yellow body ribb'd with Gold twist,
and large wings of a Mallards feather dyed
yellow, with a red Capons Hackle over
all,</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Then a black flie, the dubbing of a black
Spaniels fur, and the wings of a grey Mallards
feather.</p>
                        <p n="4">4, After that a light brown with a slender
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54531:36"/>
body, the dubbing twirl'd upon small red silk,
and rais'd with the point of a needle, that the
ribs or rows of silk may appear through the
wings of the grey feather of a Mallard.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Next a little Dun, the dubbing of a Bears
dun whirl'd upon yellow silk, the wings of the
grey feather of a Mallard.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Then a white Gnat, with a pale wing,
and a black head.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. There is also this Month a flie call'd the
Peacock-flie, the body made of a whirl of a
Peacocks feather, with a red head, and wings
of a Mallards feather.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. We have then another very killing flie,
known by the name of the Dun-Cut, the dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of which is a Bears dun, with a little
blew, and yellow mixt with it, a large dun
wing, and two horns at the head, made of the
hairs of a Squirrels tail.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. The next is the Cow-Lady, a little flie,
the body of a Peacocks feather, the wing of a
red feather, or strips of the red hackle of a
Cock.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. We have then the Cow-turd flie; the
dubbing light brown, and yellow mixt, the
wing the dark grey feather of a Mallard. And
note that besides these abovementioned, all the
same Hackles and Flies, the Hackles only bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and the Flies smaller, that are taken in
<hi>April,</hi> will also be taken this Month, as also
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54531:36"/>
all Browns, and Duns: and now I come to
my Stone-Flie, and Green-Drake, which are
the Matadores for Trout and Grayling, and in
their season kill more Fish in our <hi>Derbyshire</hi>
Rivers, than all the rest past, and to come, in
the whole Year besides.</p>
                        <p>But first I am to tell you, that we have four
several flies which contend for the Title of the
May-Flie, namely,
<list>
                              <item>The Green-Drake,</item>
                              <item>The Stone-Flie,</item>
                              <item>The Black Flie, and</item>
                              <item>The little yellow May-Flie.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>And all these have their Champions and
Advocates to dispute, and plead their priority;
though I do not understand why the two last
named should; the first two having so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
the advantage, both in their beauty, and
the wonderful execution they do in their sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Of these the Green-Drake comes in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the twentieth of this Month, or betwixt
that, and the latter end (for they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
sooner, and sometimes later according to
the quality of the Year) but never well taken
till towards the end of this Month, and the
beginning of <hi>June.</hi> The Stone-Flie comes
much sooner, so early as the middle of <hi>April;</hi>
                           <pb n="66" facs="tcp:54531:37"/>
but is never well taken till towards the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of <hi>May,</hi> and continues to kill much longer
than the Green-Drake stays with us, so long as
to the end almost of <hi>June;</hi> and indeed, so long
as there are any of them to be seen upon the
water; and sometimes in an Artificial Flie, and
late at night, or before Sun rise in a morning,
longer.</p>
                        <p>Now both these Flies (and I believe many
others, though I think not all) are certainly,
and demonstratively bred in the very Rivers
where they are taken, our Caddis or Cod-bait
which lye under stones in the bottom of the
water, most of them turning into those two
Flies, and being gather'd in the husk, or crust,
near the time of their maturity, are very easily
known, and distinguisht, and are of all other
the most remarkable, both for their size, as
being of all other the biggest (the shortest of
them being a full inch long, or more) and for
the execution they do, the Trout, and Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
being much more greedy of them, than of
any others; and indeed the Trout never feeds
fat, nor comes into his perfect season, till these
Flies come in.</p>
                        <p>Of these the Green-Drake never discloses
from his husk, till he be first there grown to
full maturity, body, wings, and all, and then
he creeps out of his cell, but with his wings
so crimpt, and ruffled, by being prest together
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54531:37"/>
in that narrow room, that they are for some
hours totally useless to him, by which means
he is compelled either to creep upon the flags,
sedges, and blades of grass (if his first rising
from the bottom of the water be near the banks
of the River) till the Air, and Sun, stiffen and
smooth them! or if his first appearance above
water happen to be in the middle, he then
lies upon the surface of the water like a Ship at
Hull (for his feet are totally useless to him
there, and he cannot creep upon the water as
the Stone-Flie can) untill his wings have got
stiffness to fly with, if by some Trout, or Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
he be not taken in the interim (which ten
to one he is) and then his wings stand high,
and clos'd exact upon his back, like the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfly,
and his motion in flying is the same.
His Body is in some of a paler, in others of a
darker yellow (for they are not all exactly of
a colour) rib'd with rows of green, long slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and growing sharp towards the tail, at
the end of which he has three long small
whisks of a very dark colour, almost black,
and his tail turns up towards his back like a
Mallard, from whence questionless he has his
name of the green-Drake. These (as I think
I told you before) we commonly dape, or
dibble with, and having gather'd great store
of them into a long draw box, with holes in
the Cover to give them Air (where also they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54531:38"/>
will continue fresh, and vigorous a night or
more) we take them out thence by the wings,
and bait them thus upon the Hook. We first
take one) for we commonly Fish with two of
them at a time) and putting the point of the
Hook into the thickest part of his Body under
one of his wings, run it directly through and
out at the other side, leaving him spitted cross
upon the Hook, and then taking the other, put
him on after the same manner, but with his
head the contrary way, in which posture they
will live upon the Hook, and play with their
wings for a quarter of an hour, or more: but
you must have a care to keep their wings dry,
both from the water, and also that your fingers
be not wet when you take them out to bait
them; for then your bait is spoil'd.</p>
                        <p>Having now told you how to Angle with
this Flie alive; I am now to tell you next,
how to make an Artificial Flie, that will so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
resemble him, as to be taken in a rough
windy day, when no Flies can lye upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
nor are to be found about the Banks and
sides of the River, to a wonder, and with
which you shall certainly kill the best Trout,
and Grayling in the River.</p>
                        <p>The Artificial Green-Drake then is made
upon a large Hook, the Dubbing, Camels hair,
bright Bears hair, the soft down that is comb'd
from a Hogs bristles, and yellow Camlet well
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54531:38"/>
mixt together, the body long, and ribb'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with green silk, or rather yellow waxt
with green-wax, the whisks of the tail of the
long hairs of sables, or fitchet, and the wings
of the white grey feather of a Mallard dyed
yellow, which also is to be dyed thus.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Take the root of a Barbary Tree, and shave it,
and put to it Woody viss, with as much Alum as
a Walnut, and boyl your feathers in it with Rain
water; and they will be of a very fine yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have now done with the Green-drake ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
to tell you, that he is taken at all hours
during his season, whilst there is any day upon
the Sky; and with a made Flie, I once took, ten
days after he was absolutely gone, in a Cloudy
day, after a showr, and in a whistling wind,
five and thirty very great Trouts, and Graylings
betwixt five, and eight of the Clock in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
and had no less than five, or six Flies
with three good hairs a piece taken from me
in despite of my heart, besides.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. I should now come next to the Stone-Flie,
but there is another Gentleman in my
way: that must of necessity come in between,
and that is the Grey-Drake, which in all shapes,
and dimensions is perfectly the same with
the other, but quite almost of another colour,
being of a paler, and more livid yellow, and
green, and ribb'd with black quite down his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54531:39"/>
body, with black shining wings, and so dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous
and tender, cob-web like, that they
are of no manner of use for Daping; but come
in, and are taken after the Green-Drake,
and in an Artificial Flie kill very well, which
Flie is thus made, the Dubbing of the down of
a Hogs bristles, and black Spaniels fur mixt,
and ribb'd down the body with black silk, the
whisks of the hairs of the beard of a black Cat,
and the wings of the black grey feather of a
Mallard.</p>
                        <p>And now I come to the Stone-Flie, but am
afraid I have already wearied your patience,
which if I have, I beseech you freely tell me so,
and I will defer the remaining instructions for
Flie-Angling till some other time.</p>

                     <p>So, <hi>Sir,</hi> I am now ready for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>and I, <hi>Sir,</hi> as ready to give you the best
I can. Having told you the time of the Stone-Flie's
coming in, and that he is bred of a Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis
in the very River where he is taken, I am
next to tell you, that</p>
                     <p n="13">13. This same Stone-Flie has not the patience
to continue in his Crust, or Husk till his wings
be full grown; but so soon as ever they begin
to put out, that he feels himself strong (at
which time we call him a Jack) squeezes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
out of Prison, and crawls to the top of some
stone, where if he can find a chink that will
receive him, or can creep betwixt two stones,
the one lying hollow upon the other (which,
by the way, we also lay so purposely to find
them) he there lurks till his wings be full
grown, and there is your only place to find him
(and from thence doubtless he derives his name)
though, for want of such convenience, he will
make shift with the hollow of a Bank, or any
other place where the wind cannot come to
fetch him off. His body is long, and pretty
thick, and as broad at the tail almost, as in the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54531:40"/>
middle; his colour a very fine brown, ribb'd
with yellow, and much yellower on the belly
than the back, he has two or three whisks also
at the tag of his tail, and two little horns upon
his head, his wings, when full grown, are
double, and flat down his back of the same
colour, but rather darker than his body, and
longer than it; though he makes but little use
of them, for you shall rarely see him flying,
though often swimming, and padling with
several feet he has under his belly upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
without stirring a wing: but the Drake
will mount Steeple height into the Air, though
he is to be found upon flags and grass too, and
indeed every where high and low, near the
River; there being so many of them in their
season, as were they not a very inoffensive insect,
would look like a Plague; and these Drakes
(since I forgot to tell you before, I will tell
you here) are taken by the Fish to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
degree, that upon a calm day you shall
see the still deeps continually all over circles by
the Fishes rising, who will gorge themselves
with those Flies, till they purge again out of
their Guills; and the Trouts are at that time
so lusty and strong, that one of eight, or ten
inches long, will then more struggle, and tug,
and more endanger your Tackle, than one
twice as big in winter: but pardon this digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:54531:40"/>
This Stone-flie then we dape or dibble with
as with the Drake, but with this difference,
that whereas the green-Drake is common both
to stream and still, and to all hours of the day,
we seldome dape with this but in the streams,
(for in a whistling wind a made Flie in the deep
is better, and rarely, but early and late, it not
being so proper for the mid-time of the day;
though a great <hi>Grayling</hi> will then take it very
well in a sharp stream, and here and there a
Trout too: but much better toward 8, 9, 10. or
eleven of the clock at night, at which time
also the best Fish rise, and the latter the better,
provided you can see your Flie, and when you
cannot, a made Flie will murder, which is to
be made thus: The dubbing of bears dun with
a little brown and yellow Camlet very well
mixt; but so plac'd that your Flie may be more
yellow on the belly and towards the tail under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
than in any other part, and you are to
place two or three hairs of a black Cats beard
on the top of the hook in your arming, so as to
be turn'd up, when you warp on your dubbing,
and to stand almost upright, and staring one from
another, and note that your Flie is to be ribb'd
with yellow silk, and the wings long, and very
large, of the dark grey feather of a Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:54531:41"/>
14. The next <hi>May-Flie</hi> is the black Flie,
made with a black body of the whirle of an
Ostridg-feather, rib'd with silver twist, and the
black hackle of a Cock over all; and is a kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Flie, but not to be nam'd with either of the
other.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The last <hi>May-Flie</hi> (that is of the four
pretenders) is the little yellow <hi>May-Flie,</hi> in
shape exactly the same with the green Drake,
but a very little one, and of as bright a yellow
as can be seen; which is made of a bright yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Camlet, and the wings of a white grey
feather died yellow.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The last Flie for this month (and which
continues all <hi>June,</hi> though it comes in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of <hi>May)</hi> is the Flie called the Camlet-Flie,
in shape like a moth with fine diapred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-wings,
and with which (as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
I sometimes used to dibble; and Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
will rise mightily at it. But the artificial Flie
(which is only in use amongst our Anglers) is
made of a dark brown shining Camlet, rib'd
over with a very small light green silk, the
wings of the double grey feather of a Mallard;
and 'tis a killing Flie for small Fish, and so much
for <hi>May.</hi>

                     <head>June.</head>
                     <p>From the first to the four and twentieth, the
green-Drake and Stone-Flie are taken (as I
told you before.)</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the twelfth to the four and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
late at night is taken a Flie, called the Owl-Flie;
the dubbing of a white Weesel's tail, and
a white Grey wing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We have then another <hi>Dunne,</hi> call'd the
<hi>Barm-flie,</hi> from it's yesty colour, the dubbing
of the fur of a yellow dun Cat, and a grey
wing of a Mallards feather.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We have also a hackle with a purple bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
whipt about with a red Capons fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As also a gold twist Hackle with a purple
body, whipt about with a red Capons fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. To these we have this month a Flesh-flie,
the dubbing of a black Spaniels furre, and blew
wool mixt, and a grey wing.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Also another little flesh-flie, the body
made of the whirle of a Peacocks feather, and
the wings of the grey feather of a Drake.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. We have then the Peacock-flie, the body
and wing both made of the feather of that
bird.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:54531:42"/>
8. There is also the flying Ant, or Ant-flie,
the dubbing of brown and red Camlet mixt,
with a light grey wing.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. We have likewise a brown Gnat, with a
very slender body of brown and violet Camlet
well mixt, and a light grey wing.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. And another little black Gnat, the dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of black mohair, and a white Grey
wing.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. As also a green Grashopper, the dubbing
of green and yellow Wool mixed, rib'd over
with green Silk, and a red Capons feather over
all.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And lastly a little dun Grashopper, the
body slender made of a dun Camlet, and a dun
hackle at the top.</p>

                     <head>July.</head>
                     <p>First all the small flies that were taken in
<hi>June,</hi> are also taken in this month.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We have then the Orange Flie, the dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of Orange Wool, and the wing of a black
feather.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Also a little white dun, the body made
of white Mohair, and the wings blew of a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
feather.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We have likewise this month a Wasp-flie,
made either of a dark brown dubbing, or else the
furre of a black Cats tail, ribb'd about with
yellow silk, and the wing of the grey feather
of a Mallard.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Another flie taken this month is a black
Hackle, the body made of the whirle of a
Peacock's feather, and a black hackle feather
on the top.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We have also another made of a Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks
whirle without wings.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Another flie also is taken this month
call'd the shel-flie, the dubbing of yellow-green
Jersey Wool, and a little white Hoggs hair
mixt, which I call the Palm-flie, and do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it is taken for a Palm, that drops off the
willows into the water; for this flie I have
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54531:43"/>
seen Trouts take little pieces of moss, as they
have swam down the River, by which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the best way to hit the right colour
is to compare your dubbing with the Moss,
and mix the colours as near as you can.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. There is also taken this month a black
blew Dun, the dubbing of the furre of a black
Rabbet mixt with a little yellow, the wings of
the Feather of a blew Pigeons wing.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section">

                     <p>The same Flies with <hi>July.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Then another Art-flie, the dubbing of
the black brown hair of a Cow, some red warpt
in for the Tagg of his tail, and a dark wing, a
killing flie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Next a flie call'd the Fern-flie, the dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of the fur of a Hares neck, that is of the
colour of Fearn, or Brackin, with a darkish
grey wing of a Mallards feather, a killer
too.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Besides these we have a white Hackle, the
body of white Mo-hair, and wrapped about
with a white Hackle Feather, and this is assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
taken for Thistle-down.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:54531:43"/>
4. We have also this month a Harry-long-leggs,
the body made of Bears dun, and blew
Wool mixt, and a brown hackle Feather over
all.</p>
                     <p>Lastly in this month all the same browns
and duns are taken, that were taken in
<hi>May.</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. To which I shall only add a Camel-brown
Flie, the dubbing pull'd out of the lime of a

darkish grey Mallards feather for the
wing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And one other for which we have no
name; but it is made of the black hair of
a Badgers skin mixt with the yellow softest
down of a sanded Hog.</p>

                     <p>Few men angle with the Flie this month, no
more than they do in <hi>January:</hi> but yet if the
weather be warm (as I have known it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in my life to be, even in this cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
where it is least expected) then a brown
that looks red in the hand, and yellowish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
your eye and the Sun; will both raise
and kill in a clear water, and free from snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broth:
but at the best 'tis hardly worth a man's

And now <hi>Sir,</hi> I have done with Flie-fishing,
or angling at the top, excepting once more to
tell you, that of all these (and I have named
you a great many very killing flies) none are fit
to be compared with the Drake and Stone-flie,
both for many and very great fish; and yet there
are some daies, that are by no means proper for
the sport, and in a calm you shall not have near
so much sport even with daping, as in a whist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
gale of wind, for two reasons, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you are not then so easily discovered by
the fish, and also because there are then but
few flies can lye upon the water; for where
they have so much choice, you may easily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
they will not be so eager and forward
to rise at a bait, that both the shadow of your
body, and that of your Rod, nay of your
very line, in a hot calm day will, in spite of
your best caution, render suspected to them:
but even then, in swift streams, or by sitting
down patiently behind a willow bush, you shall
do more execution than at almost any other
time of the year with any other flie, though one
may sometimes hit of a day, when he shall
come home very well satisfied with sport with
several other Flies: but with these two, the
green Drake and the Stone-flie, I do verily
believe I could some daies in my life, had I not
been weary of slaughter, have loaden a lusty boy,
and have sometimes, I do honestly assure you,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54531:45"/>
given over upon the meer account of satiety of
sport; which will be no hard matter to believe,
when I likewise assure you, that with this very
flie, I have in this very River that runs by us
in three or four hours taken thirty, five and
thirty, and forty of the best Trouts in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
What shame and pity is it then, that
such a River should be destroyed by the basest
sort of people, by those unlawful ways of fire
and netting in the night, and of damming,
groping, spearing, hanging and hooking by
day, which are now grown so common, that,
though we have very good Laws to punish
such Offenders, every Rascal does it, for ought
I see, <hi>impunè.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude, I cannot now in honesty but
frankly tell you, that many of these flies I have
nam'd, at least so made as we make them here,
will peradventure do you no great service in
your Southern Rivers, and will not conceal
from you, but that I have sent flies to several
friends in <hi>London,</hi> that for ought I could ever
hear, never did any great feats with them, and
therefore if you intend to profit by my instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
you must come to angle with me here in
the Peak; and so, if you please, let us walk up to
Supper, and to morrow, if the day be windy,
as our daies here commonly are, 'tis ten to one
but we shall take a good dish of fish for din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

                     <p>Why, to tell you the truth, I am so
allur'd with the sport I had yesterday, that I
long to be at the River again, and when I heard

                     <p>Well, I am both glad you are so ready
for the day, and that the day is so fit for you,
and look you I have made you three or four
flies this morning, this silver twist hackle, this
bears dun, this light brown and this dark brown,
any of which I dare say will do; but you may
try them all, and see which does best, only I
must ask your pardon that I cannot wait upon
you this Morning, a little business being fal'n

me of your Company: but I'le come call you

that, seeing the wind curles the water, and

                     <p>In earnest, and so it is: and I have
one request to make to you, which is,
that as you have taught me to catch Trout and
Grayling, you will now teach me how to dress
them as these are drest, which questionless is
of all other the best way.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
                     <p>That I will <hi>Sir,</hi> with all my heart, and
am glad you like them so well, as to make that
request, and they are drest thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take your Trout, wash, and dry him with a
clean Napkin; then open him, and having taken
out his guts, and all the blood, wipe him very
clean within, but wash him not, and give him
three scotches with a Knife to the bone on one side
only. After which take a clean Kettle, and put
in as much hard stale Beer (but it must not be
dead) Vinegar, and a little Whitewine, and
Water, as will cover the Fish you intend to boyl;
then throw into the Liquor a good quantity of
Salt, the Rind of a Lemon, a handful of slic't
Horse-Radish root, with a handsom little fagot
of Rosemary, Time, and Winter-Savory. Then
set your Kettle upon a quick fire of wood, and
let your Liquor boyl up to the height before you
put in your Fish, and then, if there be many,
put them in one by one, that they may not so cool
the Liquor, as to make it fall; and whilst your
Fish is boyling, beat up the Butter for your Sawce
with a Ladle full or two of the Liquor it is boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in, and being boyld enough, immediately
pour the Liquor from the Fish, and being laid
in a Dish, pour your Butter upon it, and strew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it plentifully over with shav'd Horse-Raddish,
and a little pounded Ginger, garnish your sides
of your Dish, and the Fish it self with a slic't
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54531:48"/>
Lemon, or two, and serve it up.</hi> A Grayling
is also to be drest exactly after the same manner,
saving that he is to be scal'd, which a Trout
never is: and that must be done either with
ones nails, or very lightly and carefully with
a Knife for bruising the Fish. And note, that
these kinds of Fish, a Trout especially, if he
is not eaten within four, or five hours after he
be taken, is worth nothing.</p>
                     <p>But come <hi>Sir,</hi> I see you have din'd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if you please we will walk down again to
the little House, and there I will read you a
Lecture of Angling at the bottom.</p>

                     <p>So <hi>Sir,</hi> Now we are here, and set:
let me have my instructions for Angling
for Trout, and Grayling at the bottom; which
though not so easy, so cleanly, nor (as 'tis said)
so Gentile a way of Fishing, as with a Flie;
is yet (if I mistake not) a good holding way
and takes Fish when nothing else will.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
                     <p>You are in the right, it does so: and a
worm is so sure a bait at all times, that, excepting
in a Flood, I would I had laid thousand pounds
that I kill'd Fish more, or less with it, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Summer every day throughout the Year;
those days always excepted, that, upon a more
serious account always ought so to be. But
not longer to delay you, I will begin, and tell
you, that Angling at the bottom is also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
of two sorts (and yet there is a third
way of Angling with a Ground-bait, and to
very great effect too, as shall be said hereafter)
namely.
<list>
                           <pb n="90" facs="tcp:54531:49"/>
                           <item>By Hand: or</item>
                           <item>With a Cork, or Float.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>That we call Angling by hand is of three
sorts.</p>
                     <p>The first with a line about half the length of
the Rod, a good weighty plum, and three hairs
next the Hook, which we call a running Line,
and with one large Brandling, or a dew-worm
of a moderate size, or two small ones of the
first, or any other sort, proper for a Trout, of
which my Father <hi>Walton</hi> has already given
you the names, and sav'd me a labour; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
almost any worm whatever; for if a Trout
be in the humour to bite, it must be such a
worm as I never yet saw, that he will refuse;
and if you Fish with two, you are then to bait
your hook thus. You are first to run the point
of your hook in at the very head of your first
worm, and so down through his body till it be
past the knot, and then let it out, and strip the
worm above the arming (that you may not
bruise it with your fingers) till you have put
on the other by running the point of the Hook
in below the knot, and upwards through his
body towards his head till it be but just cover'd
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54531:49"/>
with the head, which being done, you are
then to slip the first worm down over the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
again, till the knots of both worms meet
together.</p>
                     <p>The second way of Angling by hand, and
with a running Line, is with a Line something
longer than the former, and with Tackle made
after this same manner. At the utmost extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of your Line, where the Hook is always
plac'd in all other ways of Angling, you are
to have a large Pistol, or Carabine Bullet, into
which the end of your Line is to be fastned
with a Peg, or Pin even and close with the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
and about half a foot above that, a branch
of Line, of two, or three handfuls long; or
more, for a swift stream, with a Hook at the
end thereof baited with some of the forenamed
worms, and another half foot above that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
arm'd, and baited after the same manner;
but with another sort of worm, without any
lead at all above: by which means you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
certainly find the true bottom in all
depths, which with the Plums upon your Line
above you can never do, but that your bait must
always drag whilst you are sounding (which
in this way of Angling must be continually)
by which means you are like to have more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and peradventure worse success. And
both these ways of Angling at the bottom are
most proper for a dark, and muddy water, by
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54531:50"/>
reason that in such a condition of the stream,
a Man may stand as near as he will, and neither
his own shadow; nor the roundness of his
Tackle will hinder his sport.</p>
                     <p>The third way of Angling by hand with a
Ground-bait, and by much the best of all other,
is, with a Line full as long, or a yard and half
longer than your Rod, with no more than one
hair next the hook, and for two or three lengths
above it, and no more than one small pellet of
shot for your plum, your Hook little, your
worms of the smaller Brandlings very well
scour'd, and only one upon your hook at a
time, which is thus to be baited. The point
of your hook is to be put in at the very tagg
of his tail, and run up his body quite over
all the arming, and still stript on an inch at least
upon the hair, the head and remaining part
hanging downward; and with this line and
hook thus baited you are evermore to angle in
the streams, always in a clear rather than a
troubled water, and always up the River, still
casting out your worm before you with a light
one-handed Rod, like an artificial Flie, where
it will be taken, sometimes at the top, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a very little of the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the water,
and almost always before that light plumb can
sink it to the bottom, both by reason of the
stream, and also that you must always keep
your worm in motion by drawing still back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54531:50"/>
you, as if you were angling with a flie;
and believe me, whoever will try it, shall find
this the best way of all other to angle with a
worm, in a bright water especially; but then
his rod must be very light and pliant, and very
true and finely made, which with a skilful hand
will do wonders, and in a clear stream is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
the best way of angling for a Trout,
or Grayling with a worm, by many degrees,
that any man can make choice of, and of most
ease and delight to the Angler. To which let
me add, that if the Angler be of a constitution
that will suffer him to wade, and will slip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the tail of a shallow stream, to the Calf of
the leg or the knee, and so keep off the bank,
he shall almost take what fish he pleases.</p>
                     <p>The second way of angling at the bottom is
with a Cork or float; and that is also of
two sorts.
<list>
                           <item>With a worm: or,</item>
                           <item>With a Grub or Caddis.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>With a worm you are to have your line
within a foot, or a foot and half as long as
your rod, in a dark water with two, or if you
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54531:51"/>
will with three; but in a clear water never with
above one hair next the hook, and two or
three for four or five lengths above it, and a
worm of what size you please, your plums
fitted to your Cork, your Cork to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the River (that is to the swiftness or slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it) and both, when the water is very
clear, as fine as you can, and then you are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to bait with above one of the lesser sort of
Brandlings; or, if they are very little ones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
you may then bait with two after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
before directed.</p>
                     <p>When you angle for a Trout, you are to do
it as deep, that is, as near the bottom as you
can, provided your bait do not drag, or if it
do, a Trout will sometimes take it in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture:
if for a Grayling, you are then to fish
further from the bottom, he being a fish that
usually swims nearer to the middle of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and lyes alwaies loose: or however is more
apt to rise than a Trout, and more inclin'd to
rise than to descend even to a Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bait.</p>
                     <p>With a Grub or Caddis, you are to angle
with the same length of Line; or if it be all
out as long as your Rod, 'tis not the worse,
with never above on hair for two or three
lengths next the hook, and with the smallest
Cork, or float, and the least weight of plumb
you can that will but sink, and that the swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54531:51"/>
of your stream will allow; which also
you may help, and avoid the violence of the
Current, by angling in the returnes of a stream,
or the Eddies betwixt two streams, which
also are the most likely places wherein to kill a
Fish in a stream, either at the top or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
                     <p>Of Grubs for a Grayling, the Ash-Grub,
which is plump, milk-white, bent round from
head to tail, and exceeding tender with a red
head; or the Dock worm, or Grub of a pale
yellow, longer, lanker, and tougher than the
other, with rows of feet all down his belly,
and a red head also are the best, I say for a
Grayling, because, although a Trout will take
both these (the Ash-Grub especially) yet he does
not do it so freely as the other, and I have usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
taken ten Graylings for one Trout with
that bait, though if a Trout come, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that he is commonly a very good
one.</p>
                     <p>These baits we usually keep in Bran, in
which an Ash-Grub commonly grows tougher,
and will better endure baiting, though he is
yet so tender, that it will be necessary to warp
in a piece of a stiff hair with your arming, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it standing out about a straw breadth at
the head of your hook, so as to keep the Grub
either from slipping totally off when baited, or
at least down to the point of the hook, by which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54531:52"/>
means your arming will be left wholly naked
and bare, which is neither so sightly, nor so
likely to be taken; though to help that (which
will however very oft fall out) I always arm
the hook I design for this Bait with the whitest
horse-hair I can chuse, which it self will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble,
and shine like that bait, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
will do more good, or less harm than
an arming of any other colour. These Grubs
are to be baited thus, the hook is to be put in
under the head or Chaps of the bait, and
guided down the middle of the belly without
suffering it to peep out by the way (for then (the
Ash-Grub especially) will issue out water and
milk, till nothing but the skin shall remain, and
the bend of the hook will appear black through
it) till the point of your hook come so low, that
the head of your bait may rest, and stick upon
the hair that stands out to hold it, by which
means it can neither slip of it self; neither will
the force of the stream, nor quick pulling out,
upon any mistake, strip it off.</p>
                     <p>Now the Caddis, or Cod-bait (which is a
sure killing bait, and for the most part, by much,
surer, than either of the other) may be put
upon the Hook, two or three together, and is
sometimes (to very great effect) joyn'd to a
worm, and sometimes to an Artificial Flie to
cover the point of the Hook; but is always to
be Angled with at the bottom (when by it self
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54531:52"/>
especially) with the finest Tackle; and is for
all times of the year, the most holding bait of
all other whatever, both for Trout, and Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                     <p>There are several other baits besides these
few I have nam'd you, which also do very
great execution at the bottom, and some that
are peculiar to certain Countries, and Rivers,
of which every Angler may in his own place,
make his own observation: and some others
that I do not think fit to put you in mind of,
because I would not corrupt you, and would
have you, as in all things else I observe you to
be a very honest Gentleman, a fair Angler.
And so much for the second sort of Angling for
a Trout at the bottom.</p>

                     <p>But Sir, I beseech you give me leave
to ask you one question, Is there no art to be

and in a manner compel them to bite at the
bait.</p>

                     <p>Not that I know of; or did I know
any such secret, I would not use it my self, and
therefore would not teach it you. Though I
will not deny to you, that in my younger days,
I have made tryal of Oyl of Ospray, Oyl of Ivy,
Camphire, Assa-faetida, juice of Nettles, and
several other devices that I was taught by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Anglers I met with, but could never find
any advantage by them; and can scarce believe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54531:53"/>
there is any thing to be done that way, though
I must tell you I have seen some men, who I
thought went to work no more artificially than
I, and have yet with the same kind of worms
I had, in my own sight taken five, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ten for one. But we'l let that business a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
if you please; and because we have time
enough, and that I would deliver you from
the trouble of any more Lectures, I will, if you
please, proceed to the last way of angling for a
Trout or Grayling, which is in the middle;
after which I shall have no more to trouble you
with.</p>

                     <p>Angling in the middle then for a
Trout or Grayling is of two sorts.
<list>
                           <item>With a Pink or Minnow for a Trout: or,</item>
                           <item>With a Worm, Grub or Caddis for a
Grayling.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the first, it is with a Minnow half a foot,
or a foot within the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the water,
and as to the rest that concerns this sort of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling,
I shall wholly refer you to Mr. <hi>Walton</hi>'s
direction, who is undoubtedly the best Angler
with a Minnow in <hi>England;</hi> only in plain
truth I do not approve of those baits he keeps
in salt, unless where the Living ones are not
possibly to be had (though I know he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kills with them, and peradventure more,
than with any other, nay I have seen him refuse
a living one for one of them) and much less of
his artificial one; for though we do it with a
counterfeit flie, me thinks it should hardly be
expected, that a man should deceive a fish
with a counterfeit fish. Which having said, I
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54531:54"/>
shall only add, and that out of my own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that I do believe a Bull-head, with his
Guill-fins cut off (at some times of the year
especially) to be a much better bait for a Trout,
than a Minnow, and a Loach much better than
that, to prove which I shall only tell you
that I have much oftner taken Trouts with a
Bull-head or a Loach in their Throats (for there
a Trout has questionless his first digestion) than
a Minnow; and that one day especially, having
Angled a good part of the day with a Minnow,
and that in as hopeful a day, and as fit a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as could be wisht for that purpose, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
raising any one Fish; I at last fell to't with
the worm, and with that took fourteen in a
very short space, amongst all which, there was
not to my remembrance, so much as one, that
had not a Loach or two, and some of them
three, four, five, and six Loaches, in his throat
and stomach; from whence I concluded, that
had I Angled with that bait, I had made a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
days work of't.</p>
                     <p>But after all, there is a better way of Angling
with a Minnow, than perhaps is fit either to
teach or to practice; to which I shall only
add, that a Grayling will certainly rise at, and
sometimes take a Minnow, though it will be
hard to be believ'd by any one, who shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the littleness of that Fishes mouth, very
nnfit to take so great a bait: but is affirm'd by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54531:54"/>
many, that he will sometimes do it, and I my
self know it to be true, for though I never took
a Grayling so, yet a Man of mine once did, and
within so few paces of me, that I am as certain
of it, as I can be of any thing I did not see,
and (which made it appear the more strange)
the Grayling was not above eleven inches
long.</p>
                     <p>I must here also beg leave of your Master,
and mine, not to controvert, but to tell him,
that I cannot consent to his way of throwing in
his Rod to an overgrown Trout, and afterwards
recovering his Fish with his Tackle. For
though I am satisfied he has sometimes done it,
because he says so; yet I have found it quite
otherwise, and though I have taken with the
Angle, I may safely say, some thousands of
Trouts in my life, my top never snapt, though
my Line still continued fast to the remaining
part of my Rod (by some lengths of Line
curl'd round about my top, and there fastned
with waxt silk, against such an accident) nor
my hand never slackt, or slipt by any other
chance, but I almost always infallibly
lost my Fish, whether great, or little, though
my Hook came home again. And I have often
wondred how a Trout should so suddainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage
himself from so great a Hook, as that
we bait with a Minnow, and so deep bearded,
as those Hooks commonly are, when I have
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54531:55"/>
seen by the forenam'd accidents, or the slipping
of a knot in the upper part of the Line, by
suddain, and hard striking, that though the
Line has immediately been recover'd, almost
before it could be all drawn into the water, the
Fish clear'd, and gone in a moment. And yet
to justifie what he says, I have sometimes known
a Trout, having carried away a whole Line,
found dead three, or four days after with the
Hook fast sticking in him: but then it is to be
suppos'd he had gorg'd it, which a Trout will
do, if you be not too quick with him when he
comes at a Minnow, as sure and much sooner
than a Pike; and I my self have also, once, or
twice in my life, taken the same Fish with my
own Flie sticking in his Chaps, that he had taken
from me the day before, by the slipping of a
Hook in the arming: but I am very confident
a Trout will not be troubled two hours with
any Hook, that has so much as one handful of
Line left behind with it, or that is not struck
through a bone, if it be in any part of his
mouth only; nay, I do certainly know, that a
Trout so soon as ever he feels himself prickt, if
he carries away the Hook, goes immediately
to the bottom, and will there root like a Hog
upon the Gravel, till he either rub out, or
break the Hook in the middle. And so much
for this first sort of Angling in the middle for a
Trout.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:54531:55"/>
The second way of Angling in the middle,
is with a Worm, Grub, Caddis, or any
other Ground-bait for a Grayling, and that is
vvith a Cork, and a foot from the bottom,
a Grayling taking it much better there, than
at the bottom, as has been said before; and
this always in a clear water, and with the finest
Tackle.</p>
                     <p>To which we may also, and vvith very
good reason, add the third way of Angling
by hand with a Ground-bait, as a third
way of Fishing in the middle, which is
common to both Trout, and Grayling, and
(as I said before) the best way of Angling
with a Worm, of all other I ever try'd whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                     <p>And now Sir, I have said all I can at
present think of concerning Angling for a
Trout and Grayling; and I doubt not,
have tir'd you sufficiently: but I will give
you no more trouble of this kind, whilst
you stay; vvhich I hope will be a good while
longer.</p>

but if I live till <hi>May</hi> come twelve
Month, you are sure of me again, either
vvith my Master <hi>Walton,</hi> or without
him, and in the mean time shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint

            <p>YOu Now see, I have return'd you, your
very pleasant, and useful discourse of the
Art of <hi>Flie-Fishing,</hi> Printed, just as 'twas sent
me: for I have been so obedient to your
desires, as to endure all the praises you
have ventur'd to fix upon me in it. And,
when I have thankt you for them, as the effects
of an undissembled love: then, let me tell you
<hi>Sir,</hi> that I will really endeavour to live up to
the Character you have given of me, if there
were no other reason; yet for this alone, that
you, that love me so well; and always think
what you speak, may not, for my sake, suffer by
a mistake in your Judgment.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Sir,</hi> I have ventur'd to fill a part of your
Margin, by way of Paraphrase, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

of your <hi>Fishing-House,</hi> and the pleasantness of
that you dwell in. And I have ventur'd also
to give him a Copy of Verses, that, you were

pleas'd to send me, now some Years past; in
which, he may see a good Picture of both;
and, so much of your own mind too, as will
make any Reader that is blest with a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Soul, to love you the better. I confess,
that for doing this, you may justly Judg me too
bold: if you do, I will say so too: and so far
commute for my offence, that, though I be
more than a hundred Miles from you, and in
the eighty third Year of my Age, yet I will
forget both, and next Month begin a Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
