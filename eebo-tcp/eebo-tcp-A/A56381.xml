         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Preface immediately apply my self to the serious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of my Taske, which I shall (following the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
your injunctions have prescribed me) perform in
three parts (1.) By giving you an account of the true
Nature and Extent of Gods Dominion. (2.) By laying
down a right Notion of his Goodness. (3.) By proving
the Groundlesness and Vanity of the Origenian Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
concerning the Preexistence of Souls. Of each

            <head>OF THE
NATURE and EXTENT
OF
Gods Dominion.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y Gods Dominion, I mean that
Sovereigne Right and Authority
residing in Him in reference to his
Creatures, or that Power and
Prerogative which he has to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of them according to his
own good-will and pleasure, and
this is indifferently expressed by these three terms
of <hi>Ius, Potestas,</hi> and <hi>Dominium:</hi> The minute and
precise differences whereof seems to lye herein:
that <hi>Ius</hi> nakedly signifies a right or freedom to act,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63493:4"/>
whereas the two latter imply, together with this,
a power or strength of acting; And then that
Power, which God hath in himself antecedently
to the Existence of any Created Being, is in rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and propriety of speech call'd <hi>Potestas;</hi> but
that which he has and exercises since the Creation,
<hi>Dominium.</hi> But not to insist upon such Niceties,
they all promiscuously import Dominion and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty.
Of which many definitions have been
attempted, but none of them seem to me more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
and comprehensive then Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s, when
he defines it to be <hi>Libertas propriis facultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
secundum rectam rationem utendi.</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Cive. l. 1. c. 1.</note>
Though what Exercises of Power are consistent
with right Reason, and what not, I shall discourse
anon. But if you fancy short definitions, 'tis the
lawful use of Power, and so implies two things,
first it supposes a power or strength to Act, and
then it imports the legitimate extent and use of it.
Now as for the Extent of this Power, 'tis Infinite
and Unconfined, as well as all the rest of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Perfections, and therefore it warrants God
to do any thing that will comply with the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his other Attributes. Whence 'tis that
the Beings and Subsistencies of all things are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
at his disposal: It was at his choice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would ever or never create any thing; and it
is still in his Power either to continue the frame of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63493:4"/>
things in the same state they are in, or to erect a
new one, and that better or worse then the present,
and any thing else, that is not inconsistent with the
perfection of his Nature and Attributes. But for
a fuller Evidence hereof, it is necessary to observe
that there is a twofold acceptation of Right, either
more loose, when it signifies a License &amp; Freedom
to do any thing; or more restrained, when it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
an Obligation to do any thing: The difference
between them is this, that the former signifies
Liberty, and the latter Duty; that is extended to
any thing that is not unlawful, this only extends
to things due, and requir'd by Justice and Equity:
For instance, there is a Right to demand Debts,
and a Right to pay them; the former may be done,
because no equity forbids it, but the latter must be
done because Justice requires it. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
(to give you this Notion by the way) every
man is bound to make good his Promises, though
not his Threatnings and Punishments, because pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
make us Debtors, but in reference to threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Penalties we are Creditors, for the Offendor
owes the punishment to the person Offended: But
though every man be bound to pay his Debts, yet
he is not bound to demand them, for he has a Right
to Relax as well as Challenge his due: The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
therefore consequent upon promises, being
Debts due from me, I am bound by the first sort
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63493:5"/>
of Right to pay them, but the Penalties consequent
upon Threatnings, being Debts owing to me, I am
permitted by the second sort of Right, either to
demand or remit them.</p>
            <p>And thus there is a twofold Right in God, the
one whereof referres to his Sovereignty, which is
nothing but an absolute Liberty to act or not to act,
as Himself shall see cause; the other to his Justice
and Holiness, whereby God is obliged to act suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to the Essential Rules of Justice and Equity.
For the Divine Justice is exercised only about things
Good and Just, but his Dominion about all things
that are not Evil or Unjust; things therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Objects of Gods Dominion, not because
they are Just, but because they are not Unjust, it
is extended to every thing that is not contrary to
Justice, <hi>i. e.</hi> to every thing that is not Evil. But
I shall wave all general considerations, and onely
consider the Extent of the Divine Prerogative in
reference to Mankind, not onely because 'tis most
pertinent to our present designe, but also because
what I shall discourse concerning the Extent and
Latitude of Gods Power over Men, may by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of Reason, be applied to all other Creatures
endued with Sense and Perception: Now, in
Treating of this matter proposed, I shall onely
consider,</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63493:5"/>
               <item>1. What God can do.</item>
               <item>2. What he can not do.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. First, Then God has Power to take back
from us all or part of what he has given us, <hi>i. e.</hi> He
can either utterly destroy our Beings, or take from
us so many Comforts of life, and inflict upon us
so many Calamities, as shall leave us in a condition
only preferable to that of Non-Existence; for all
that we have to render our conditions more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
then <hi>not Being,</hi> is the free Product of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power; But 'tis a certain and undoubted truth
that every Superiour Authority has Power to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
all the free Issues of its own Power, unless it
have abridg'd it selfe from the Exercise thereof by
some special compact or promise: For compact
and promise lay an obligation upon him that makes
it, and vests a Right in the Person to whom 'tis
made; and therefore where Benefits are bestowed
without these Instruments of conveighing Right,
there the Donor has the same Right to withdraw,
as he had to give them; and therefore that God,
who has given us our Beings, has full Power arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariously
to destroy them.</p>
            <p>But here it will be Objected, that destroying
the life of a guiltless person, is justly accounted the
most salvage and unmerciful piece of Injustice in
the World; that 'tis almost the only Instance,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63493:6"/>
which carries in it an undeniable Iniquity ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to all Humane Lawes and Sanctions. So
that when Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> asserts that in the State of
Nature, there could be no Injuries and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
Acted amongst Men, because they could
not have a Right of Propriety in any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had by mutual Compacts apportion'd
each mans share, if he had limited his asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to possessions of Lands, and all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties
Forreigne to a mans own person, it had
been equally true and blamelesse; for Nature
doth not assign this Moiety to <hi>Tuius,</hi> and that
to <hi>Caius,</hi> but leaves us to share the Earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our selves, and to Enclose what she had
left in Common, into particular proprieties, as
we shall agree among our selves. But when
he extends the forementioned assertion to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Men, his Errour is as palpable as 'tis
mischeivous, because every man has a right and
propriety in himselfe Antecedently to all Law
and Compact. There needs no Covenant to
appoint that I shall have a propriety in my own
person; nay, 'tis as impossible it should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
as that I should alienate my self from
my selfe; and all the grants of all the men in the
world cannot Vest me in a greater propriety to
my selfe then Nature has, because they cannot
make me to be more my selfe then I already
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63493:6"/>
am; so that though I were in Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
State of Warre; if he or any other man
should take away my life, without just cause, he
would do me at least as evident an Injury, as
if he should now, either by Fraud or Violence,
thrust me from mine Inheritance, to which I
have an unquestionable Right, both by his own
consent, and the Laws of that Civil Society, of
which we are Members, because he will Rob
me of that, in which I have as clear a Right
and Propriety, as 'tis possible for me to have
in any thing that depends upon Pact or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
Well then, it being thus Evident that
to take away the Life of an Innocent person,
is among men a most Enormous and Inhumane
piece of Injustice, and that antecedently to all
positive Sanctions and Contracts, why should
it not be so in reference to God, the Rules of
Equity being the same to all, Eternal, Unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and abstract from all Persons, States and
Relations?</p>
            <p>To which I answer, that notwithstanding there
are the same general Rules, and Principles of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
in reference to God, as to Men, that yet the
particular Instances are not the same; because
Gods Relation to the Creatures being infinitely
different from that, which they bear to each other,
the particular Actions and Displays of his Justice,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63493:7"/>
though measured by the same Rule, must needs
be of a widely different Nature, not because the
Measure is changeable, but because the relation of
the Persons suffers variety and alteration: For
God being the Supream Sovereign and Cause of
all, has upon that Account power to deprive any,
or all of his Creatures of what Perfections and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
he pleases, whereas the Creatures not
having any natural Dominion over one another,
they cannot take away from their fellow creatures
any thing which God has given them, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
Robbery, unless in such cases where the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Lord has been pleased to communicate any
part of his Power and Dominion. And so in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Societies, though there are the same Lawes
of Justice in reference to all men, yet there are
not alwayes the same Instances; for though it be
granted that every man has by right of Nature a
power of punishing any one that injures him, yet
having entered into Societies, either by Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
or their own consent, or both, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of this power is devolved upon some peculiar
persons whom we call Magistrates, in whose hands
every man has for the common good, deposited
his Authoritative Rights; its upon that account
just and lawful for the Magistrate to punish and
take away Delinquents, but unjust for the private
person to do the same, for that were to Usurp that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:63493:7"/>
Authority, which I have granted away to them
(unless in cases of necessity, as when I am assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by another, and have no other way to preserve
my own Life, then by destroying my Assailants,
there the Common-wealth is presumed to allow
me to exercise my natural right my self) but where
no such necessity urges, there the Governours of
the Society, in which I am, and to whom I have
passed away the Exercises of my Original Right,
are to Execute Justice for me: so that private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
not having power to punish Criminals, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
have, that action would be judged Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in those, which is accounted Justice in these,
notwithstanding that they are both subject to the
same common Rules and Maximes of Equity.

And thus there being so manifest a disproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Men, in reference to their propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
in, and dominion over the life of man; God
may have a right to act that, which no Creature
can do without the grossest and most exorbitant
Injustice: for seeing that propriety, which every
Man has in himself, is held from the free gift of our
Supream Lord, and that not confined by any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
or Covenant, he may cancel and reverse it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63493:8"/>
when he pleases, only by taking back what he has
given. And if we could stand in the same relation
to, or dependance on any creature, as we do to Him,
that creature would have as great a right to devest
us of the propriety we have in our own Essences, as
God himself has; but because the former can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be supposed, that's the reason the latter can
never happen.</p>
            <p>2. This Power and Dominion, which God has
over an Innocent persons life, and all its appendant
priviledges, may be exercised by occasion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans sin, for what God has a power to do
absolutely, he may certainly do upon any occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for this is only to make use of the Instances of
his Dominion, to serve other designs of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.<note place="margin">Exod. 20. ver. 5.</note>
Thus God threatens to <hi>Visit the
Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, unto
the third and fourth Generation; i. e.</hi> to punish the
Impieties of wicked Parents, by bringing their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
into those evil Circumstances, into which
he might have brought them by vertue of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Dominion, though not onely themselves,
but their Progenitors had been faultless. The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
of <hi>Cham</hi> was consign'd to slavery for their
Fathers Impiety. Seventy thousand men expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Davids</hi> folly; and <hi>Sauls</hi> sons were hanged for
their Fathers perfidiousness; and the sinne of <hi>Ahab</hi>
was visited upon his Children. Scripture supplies
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63493:8"/>
us with infinite more instances, where God makes
use of the Sons infelicity to punish the Fathers sin,
in which cases God onely makes his Sovereignty
minister to the designs of Justice, and if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as I have proved it is, for God to exercise his
Supream Dominion <hi>absolutely,</hi> surely it cannot be
unlawful to do it with <hi>respect</hi> to other ends of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
And such was the Origine of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
miseries of mankind: God created man at
first in a more perfect and happy state, but upon
occasion of <hi>Adams</hi> prevarication, he devested all
mankind of a great part of those priviledges and
perfections, with which he had endued humane
nature; And all this God might have done, though
<hi>Adam</hi> had never sinned, and therefore 'tis no Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
that God has made his Posterity the Heirs of
his misfortunes. The constitution of <hi>Adams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was probably so regular and harmonious, that
it had no natural propensions contrary to those of
his mind, but was entirely subject to all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of his understanding, his Organs clear and
well-disposed, his Spirits brisk and active, his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
spirituous and oylie; the ferments of his
body regular and steady in their motions, and not
infected with those malignant tinctures, that hurry
us into all manner of exorbitant passions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.
The Earth was fruitful, and of its own
accord, brought forth all sorts of wholesome and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63493:9"/>
pleasant Fruits: Man was surrounded with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and delights, and had nothing else to do but
to take his ease and enjoy them. But when <hi>Adam</hi>
fell, God disrob'd him of most of those great and
happy Priviledges, and cast him into a condition
of life uneasie and troublesome. Now our bodies
are unactive, sickly, and indisposed, and instead of
being Instruments to the actings of the mind, are
the greatest lets and hindrances; Paradice is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into a Wilderness, the Earth is barren and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed,
and man must earn his bread by the sweat
of his brows, and this has ever since been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Mankind: And though this be a sad sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
yet after all these losses, our condition is still
competently, or rather extreamly happy, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that, if we will but be considerate, and live
by the use of our rational faculties, we may enjoy
contentment enough in this world, to render our
lives pleasant and comfortable; God has prepared
for us most exquisite and ravishing delights in the
next, only if we will forbear to persue our Buitish
Appetites, from which he hath afrighted us by
the fearfulest threatnings, and resolve to follow
the dictates of Reason and Sobriety, to which we
are encouraged by the biggest Rewards and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises;
so that notwithstanding all the present
weaknesses and imperfections of our natures, a man
must be prodigiously absurd and sottish to make
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63493:9"/>
himself miserable. And if men will choose to be
wicked and miserable, against all the Principles of
Reason and Interest, they have no Reason to blame
the Condition of their Natures for that, which
proceeds purely from the choice of their Wills. So
that though God has punished the Prevarication
of <hi>Adam,</hi> by the evil Condition of all his posterity,
yet he has done nothing unjust, because he might
have placed us all in the same Condition, though
neither <hi>Adam</hi> nor our selves had prevaricated his
Sanctions.</p>
            <p>And this is no more then what is in some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or other practised in all Common-wealths.
As in <hi>England</hi> every man holding his Estate of the
King, and the right of all Tenures being derived
from his Grant with certain Conditions, if any of
the Grants fail in the performance of the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on their part, the Grantor may justly disseize
both them and their Heirs of their Estates. Thus if
any Person be convicted of Treason against the
Crown, he is thereupon attainted, and not only his
Estate esceats to the King as supream Lord, but
his Blood too is corrupted, so that his Posterity
are not capable of Inheritance, as deriving no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritable
blood, and consequently no Right from
him. In which case he that should have been next
Heir cannot justly think himself injured by being
deprived of his Inheritance; although himself had
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63493:10"/>
not by any misdemeanor forfeited it, yet he having
no right to it, but what was derived from his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
and that being rescinded by breach of those
Conditions, upon which it was suspended, he can
with no more equity claim a right in the Fee, then
he could though his Ancestors had never been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in it. And thus that Entail of Priviledges,
which God, of his free goodness, had settled upon
<hi>Adam</hi> and his Heirs for ever, upon Condition of
their Obedience to his Laws, was by the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of <hi>Adam</hi> cut off from himself and all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</p>
            <p>3. The Rights of Gods Dominion over sinless
Creatures, do not extend so far as to warrant his
dooming them to a condition more wretched and
forlorn then <hi>Non-existence.</hi> That he has power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them into a state not worse then Not-being
is already proved, but farther he cannot go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
transgressing all the lines of Goodness and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
because if he should, he would rob his
Creatures of more then he had ever given them;
And if this would not be an injurious Cruelty, I
must challenge all the world to tell me what would.
This Assertion is level'd against those men,
who are so hardy as to say that God might,
to shew the uncontrolableness of his Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
have decreed infinite myriads of faultless
Creatures to endless and insupportable Torments.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63493:10"/>
That ever such Thoughts could enter into the
minds of men! For what can we imagine more
repugnant to all the notions of goodness and equity
then to be the deliberate and sole Author of the
biggest misery to an innocent and harmless Person?
What more Heavenly wide from the nature of
true goodness? Tis a malice so near and abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
that it can reside no where but in the Breasts
of Fiends and Devils; nay 'tis the blackest Part of
their natures, and that very ingredient which
makes them what they are. Besides, how can God
be glorified in the eternal miseries of guiltless Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
How can their deserved damnation be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive
to his Interests? How can their unmerited
torments gratifie infinite goodness, or add to infinite
happiness? Could he promote his own Real Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
by the Infelicities of an innocent Creature,
yet we cannot imagine him so selfish spirited as to
effect it, much less for the meer ostentation of his
greatness. If God can damn his Creatures to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the absoluteness of his Dominion, why do we
raile at Tyrants and Devils, when they upon the
same account take pleasures in the miseries of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
God is supposed to delight in the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his own glory, but can we suppose him to
delight in the eternal miseries of Innocents? Was
there ever any Tyrant so salvage, as to please him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the endless and most exquisite Tortures
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63493:11"/>
of an harmless Infant? 'Tis the propertie of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
(whose malice is boiled up to an infinite ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and crueltie) to make anothers torment their
pleasure, and do mischeif for mischeifs sake; And
shall we fasten that upon God, which is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
Reproach? Shall he contrive Mischeif, feed
and recreate upon Misery, and glut his Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with Innocent blood? Shall he that delights
not in the Death of Sinners, seek Pleasure and
Glory in the Eternal Miseries of Innocents? This
is the very top and extremity of Cruelty; so that
were it thus, we must add Cruelty to the Divine
Attributes, and believe him as Infinite in that, as
in any other.</p>
            <p>Besides all this, meer Existence without Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
carries in it no more Goodness or Happiness
then Non-existence, and is only desireable before
it in reference to those Perceptive Capacities,
which are founded in it: 'Tis all one not to be,
and to be in a state of senseless inactivity; take
away Perception, and 'tis indifferent whether the
substance remain or utterly perish; as suppose the
Poets Metamorphosis had been as great Realities
as they were Fictions, it had been indifferent to the
Persons that suffered them, whether they were
chang'd into Trees, Stones and Flowers, or into
nothing, and it would have been the same thing to
<hi>Niobe</hi> whether she were petrified or annihilated.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63493:11"/>
Upon this account arose that ancient Dispute,
<hi>Whether never to have been born had not been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then to be?</hi> For they considering only the present
Stage of affairs, where these measures of good and
evil seem to be dispensed in equal proportions,
were doubtful which way to determine; but those
of them who thought the world to be more reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with ungrateful and displeasing objects then
the contrary, preferred Non-existence; the chief
assertors whereof were some of the melancholy Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
such as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and <hi>Empedocles,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the <hi>Tragedians,</hi> who in the Persons of
forlorn and miserable men are full of little sentences
and discourses to this purpose, and this opinion was
so ancient, <hi>ut Author &amp; Initium illius
prorsus ignoretur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ethic. l. 1. c. 1.</note> as <hi>Gassendus</hi> asserts.</p>
            <p>But they, who with more truth, counted the world
was fuller of pleasures then miseries, did with
more satisfaction esteem their existence a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
so that they preferred not, <hi>existence</hi> before
<hi>non-existence</hi> upon its own score, but upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of those pleasant perceptions which were
founded in it. Well then, it being evident that
existence is good or evil in order to the perceptions
that are founded in it, where 'tis the basis of nothing
but tormenting Perception, and where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuence
of life is nothing else but the continuance
of misery, there 'tis the greatest, because 'tis the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63493:12"/>
fountain, of all miseries. So that if God can cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
a Being only to make it miserable, and condemn
it to the Regions of sadness and eternal darkness,
his creation would be so far from being any kind of
benefit, that it would be the greatest ill-turn or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
he could possibly act. Nay, this still raises the
Crueltie, in that rather then want an object for it,
he would make one, and set infinite power on
work only to exercise an infinite crueltie, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
himself as absolute in Tyranny, as he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
in Power. From all this I suppose 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably
evident, that for God to Create an
innocent Creature to make it everlastingly mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
would be the highest act of crueltie imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>It was long since observed, that there was never
any opinion so absur'd, which was not maintain'd by
some of the ancient Philosophers, but yet there
are not to be found among them any such hateful
sentiments concerning Gods transactions with his
Creatures, as this I am discoursing against, which
carries in it such apparent contradictions to the
Divine Attributes, that it could never have
found entrance into the minds of men, had they
not thought it was suggested to them by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for the only thing that is pleaded on its behalf
is the grossly mistaken ninth Chapter of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which they apply to Gods
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63493:12"/>
eternal Decrees, although nothing can be more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
then that it treats of a quite different matter;
For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having discoursed of the universal
Apostacy, of both Jews and Gentiles, from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of true goodness; and of Gods merciful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signments
to pardon and receive them all into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
so they would be content to obtain it that
way, which he had made known to the world by
Jesus Christ, and not by the works of the <hi>Mosaick
Law;</hi> and also that many of the Gentiles had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of the conditions <hi>proposed</hi> to them in the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi>
and therefore that if the Jews should persevere
in their obstinate adherence to the Mosaick dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
God would cast them off, and take in the
Gentiles for his favourites: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having, I say,
discoursed of these things in the fore-going Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
he here supposes this would seem very strange
and absurd to his Country-men that God should
casheire his peculiar darling Nation, upon whom
he had bestowed so many signal priviledges; <hi>To
whom pertaineth the Adoption, and the Glory, and the
Covenants, &amp;c.</hi> To which he answers that the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Sovereign was not tyed to any peculiar Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but that he could adopt whom he pleased to
be his favourites, and that though the Jews had
been blest with greater advantages then the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
yet notwithstanding God might discard them,
and take in these; as he had made the Israelites his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63493:13"/>
peculiar People rather then the Edomites, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
they were of the younger Family, &amp;c.
And that this is the genuine scope of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>
discourse is unexceptionably evident from its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
<hi>verse 30, 31, 32. What shall we say then?
that the Gentiles which followed not after Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
have attained to the Righteousness which is of faith:
But Israel, which followed after the Law of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
hath not attained to the Law of Righteousness.
Wherefore? because they sought it not by faith, but as
it were by the works of the Law.</hi> Now what can be
more clear, then that he speaks of the rejecting of
the Jews, because of their obstinate adherence to
the Mosaick Law, and of the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
because of their Faith and closing with the
Gospel. But if you would see this improved to the
strength and evidence of a Demonstration, you need
only be at the pains to read over <hi>Episcopius</hi> his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrase
upon the Chapter.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude, I will endeavour a little more
fully to illustrate and confirm my fore-going Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
by a brief Arbitration of a late fiercely
argued dispute, <hi>viz.</hi> What is the
True Ground of Gods Sovereignty
over man.<note place="margin">Episcopeus, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellaeus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> For some assert that
it Bottoms upon the Benefit of Creation;
thereby the better to Controule that horrid Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that asserts, God might have made a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63493:13"/>
to no other purpose, than to make it Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
miserable, only to shew the Almightiness of his
Sovereignty; for (say they) God cannot exercise
more Sovereignty over his Creatures, then he has,
but he cannot have Right to more then he has
given, and therefore the utmost of his Right is
to destroy what he has made; but if he should
afflict an Innocent creature with Eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
he would go beyond the Right he
has acquired by its Creation; because he would
thereby take away more then he has given, and
place his Creature in a worse Condition then
that of Non-Existence, in which he found it.
Now because the benefits bestowed by God upon
his Creatures are finite, they infer that his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
resulting from them must be finite and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
and therefore that they have a Right, of
which God cannot Rob them without Violence
and Injury.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calvin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hobs.</hi>
               </note> But others ground the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Dominion upon the irresistibleness
of his Power, thereby to justifie that Right (or
Tyranny) they have fastned upon Him, arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to Reprobate and Damne his Innocent
Creatures. For, say they, Power Irresistible ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies
all actions really and properly, in whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be found, and therefore such Power being
in God only, it without other helps, is sufficient
Justification of any action He doth; so that if He
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63493:14"/>
had from all Eternity consign'd infinite Myriads of
innocent Creatures to Eternal flames, the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouleableness
of His Omnipotence would have
made good the Equity of such a merciless Decree.
And therefore they resolve the Maxime, that God
cannot Sin, not into his Holiness, but Power; His
very doing a thing never so Injurious and Irregular,
and that antecedently to all Law, making it just,
and consequently no sin.</p>
            <p>But for my part, I think both of them are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
mistaken, the former in their Principles, and
the latter in their Conclusions. To the first there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I reply, that it is apparent that the Divine
Right and Dominion over the Creatures, could not
be founded upon the Benefits of Creation, but upon
the absolute unlimitedness of his Power, because
God was from all Eternity invested with a Power
of doing any thing that was not misbecoming his
Divine Perfections, and therefore He acquired not
any new Right from his Creation, but only made
Objects to exercise his Eternal right upon; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
there is a Power acquired by benefits, where
there is none antecedently, because they bestow an
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Preheminence upon him that gives above
him that receives them; but God being alwayes
infinitely Perfect, could not acquire any new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
from the Worlds Creation, and therefore
the collation of Benefits cannot beget any new
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63493:14"/>
Power in Him; because the Power which He had
antecedently to all his Benefits, was not capable of
being made greater; for He alwayes had a Power
to Act any thing that lay within the bounds of just
and lawful; but his Power since the Creation is
not more then so, and therefore he acquired no new
Prerogative by it. And then, if the Creatures
should have a right to any thing, of which God
cannot deprive them, they would have something
of their own, to which God has no Right: But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every Creature is entirely Gods, &amp; can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which is not His gift, and can do nothing
which is not His debt; it cannot have a Right
where God has none, because He cannot but have
an entire Right in his own Works. And therefore
if in any thing Gods Supream Sovereignty seems
confined, 'tis not bounded by any Rights or Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
in the Creature, but only regulated by His
own Perfections.</p>
            <p>And this brings me to the latter sort, who ground
Gods Dominion in the Almightiness of his Power,
and infer thence, that He may do any thing though
never so Injurious and Irregular. I allow their
Principle, but deny their Inference, because God
is essentially Good and Just as well as Powerful;
take away his Justice and his Goodness, and you
take away his Divinity; without them he would be
but an Almighty Devil. And therefore, though
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63493:15"/>
the Rights of Gods Power be not streightned by
any External obligation, because that is tied on by
a Superiour Authority, and so cannot agree to him
whose Prerogative is Supream; yet they are boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by an Internal Principle, for Gods goodness
may be said to tye and restrain him not to do any
thing repugnant to it self. Now this is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a Restraint or Confinement superinduced
upon his Natural right, but is rather a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
set and chose by himself, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Transgress because he will not. Neither does
it limit the Divine Prerogative any more then his
Omnipotence is limited, because he cannot do any
thing that is absurd, &amp; unworthy the Wisdom of his
Understanding, or sinful &amp; repugnant to the Purity
of his Will: For as he can not do such things, not
because his Power is not Infinite, but because his
Wisdom and Holiness are so; (for its not from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Power, but from the Infiniteness of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Perfections, that He cannot act any thing
that's either Sinful or Foolish;) so neither is it for
want of Sovereignty, that he cannot do any thing
Indecent or Tyranical; but because he is infinitely
Holy as well as Powerful, he is thereby obliged to
do nothing unbeseeming his Holiness. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that God cannot Tyranize, 'tis not because
his Power has limits, but because his Goodnesse
has none. And so the Divine Will is the Measure
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63493:15"/>
of Justice, not because its absolutely Sovereigne,
but because its infinitely good, and that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
God wills or does, is therefore just, because
He wills it; derives not from the Sovereignty, but
from the goodness of his will. For if this be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, 'tis all one whether you call him God
or Devil; he may lye, and forswear, and act all
the Villanies in the world, and then what a brave
condition is mankind in, so repugnant to all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of piety, honesty, and policy, is that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that allows no essential Justice and Injustice,
but derives all goodness from arbitrary Power.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Nature of the Divine Goodness.</head>
               <p>HAving briefly explain'd the Nature and full
Extent of Gods Sovereigne Prerogative,
we come in the next place to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his Goodness and Benignity; of which
Attribute we must be careful to assign such a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as is not inconsistent with the former: Cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because the Idea of God consists mainly in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
and Sovereignty; The notion of him in
Scripture never refers to his Essence, but always
to his Power and Empire; and the names by
which he is there expressed do not so much denote
his Nature, as his Supream and Almighty Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative:
for all his Appellatives (except <hi>Iah</hi> and
<hi>Iehovah,</hi> which express his constancy and veracity)
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63493:16"/>
import only a Supream and Almighty Sovereign;
so that the Scripture represents God under no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
notion, then as the Supream Lord and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
of the Universe; and therefore we must be
wary of attributing any thing to him, that either
lessens or quite destroys the freedom and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulableness
of his Dominion; and may withal
conclude, that no property which complies not
with it, can be attributed to him, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that that's a false notion of his goodness, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terferes
with his Dominion. And therefore they
that assert Gods goodness to be a necessary Agent,
that cannot but do that which is best, and so make
all the Divine actions the necessary results of his
goodness, directly supplant, and destroy all the
rights of his Power and Dominion: For if all the
effects of Gods power be the natural Emanations
of his goodness, and depend not upon the free de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
of his will, it will follow that God
can have no liberty or dominion in relation to them,
because necessity is altogether inconsistent with the
liberty or freedom of Sovereign power; Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
bottoming upon a liberty and freedom of acting;
For how can he that has no Power and Dominion
over his own Actions, have power over any one
else, for in that there can be no power without a
liberty to use and exercise it, nor any exercise of
power but by acting, it necessarily follows that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63493:16"/>
that Agent that has no liberty or freedom of acting,
is utterly uncapable of any Power or Dominion.
And therefore if all Gods actions were the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Emanations of his goodness, it must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
destroy all the rights and liberties of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
and Dominion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Platonists</hi> assert, that Gods infinite goodness
necessitates him to do always that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is best, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>In Timaeo.</hi>
(sayes <hi>Plato</hi>) and therefore that all the Divine
works were produced by an irresistible necessity,
and that he had no more power not to do what he
has done, then the Sun has to withhold his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
or an overflowing fountain to keep back its
streams. And upon this foundation they erect any
Hypotheses that sute with their own fancies, but
cheifly that of the Pre-existence of Souls: Because
(say they) 'tis better they should Pre-exist, and
therefore Divine goodness, which does always that
which is best, must of necessity have given them
a better and happier state of life and self-enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
before they descended into these bodies. But
these mens minds are so excessively possessed with
thoughts of Gods goodness, as to neglect all his
other Attributes, advancing it to such an exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
Preheminence, as to make it not onely
Usurp upon, and invade the Rights and Priviledges
of other Attributes, but also to banish all other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63493:17"/>
from the Divine nature, and engross the
Deity wholly to it self. For this notion of Gods
goodness is most apparently inconsistent, not only
with his Power and Dominion, but with all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moral Perfections. But in order to a further
satisfaction herein, I shall give you a breif account
of the Divine goodness, and shew it to be not a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
but a free and self-moving Agent.</p>
               <p>The Divine goodness then is of three sorts,
either as 'tis taken for the perfection of his nature,
or for the sanctity and holiness of his mind, or for
the free bounty and beneficence of his will; Though
the two latter are properly but branches of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
Justice and Beneficence being absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the Infinite perfection of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The first sort I shall omit to discourse of,
as being impertinent to our present purpose, and
onely account for the two last, and first of the
former.</p>
               <p>Gods Sanctity or Holiness, is that natural or
essential Goodness, whereby he cannot but act
suitably to the excellence and dignity of his Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
nature: For the dignity of the Divine nature,
consisting in Reason and Wisdom, this is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the measure and rule of his Actions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis nothing else but that natural Justice, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and Rectitude, which is the measure of all
Gods transactions with his Creatures, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63493:17"/>
in doing every thing that right Reason requires,
and not doing any thing, that it forbids. Now the
Relation this Goodness has to the Divine Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
is to bound and regulate it in the exercise of
its Rights and Liberties; because God has power
to do any thing not inconsistent with it; so that the
true way to find out how far the Divine Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
extends, is to discover what is repugnant to the
Nature of goodness and equity; for every thing
beside is subject to the free disposal of the Divine
Will. Thus God cannot delight in the eternal
miseries and calamities of Innocent Creatures, he
cannot secretly resolve and take care that his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
shall act those Impieties, which himself o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
hates, forbids and threatens: he cannot lay
upon us Impossible Commandements: he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
violate his Faith, and not perform his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Oaths, and Covenants, because they are all of
them essentially evil, and contrary to the Natural
and Eternal Laws of Equity and Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Goodness,</hi> as its Equivalent with Benignity,
Bounty, or Benificence, is a free, constant and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
propension of will to do <hi>Good.</hi> And being sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Divine Will as one of its main Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
it must not be supposed to destroy the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of its Nature, but rather to participate of
it. For the Divine will is endued with the highest
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63493:18"/>
kind of Libertie, as it imports a freedome not only
from Forreign Violence, but also from inward ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;
For spontaneity or immunity from coaction
without indifferency carrys in it as great necessity as
those motions, that proceed from violence or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanism:
and a Beast, that of its own accord goes to
Pasture, would have as much Freedom as <hi>God</hi> has,
if his actions were only spontaneous, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not from a choosing and self-determining
Principle. And therefore when I assert the Divine
will to be Free, I mean that it is a Rational and
Active Facultie, that has Power and Dominion
over its own actions, and that can be determined
only by its own intrinsick energie, in so much that
all the external incentives requisite to its acting
being supposed, it yet remains so indifferent and
undetermined in it self, as that it is able either to
exert or suspend its action. For unless the divine
will enjoy this kind of freedom, it had as good
have none at all, all other sorts of Libertie being
fettered and determined by fatal Necessities. And
the Fatalist do but loose their Labour, when they
endeavour to invent ways of reconciling Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with Necessity, unless they can also make
Indifferency consistent with it; because all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of what nature soever implies a detemin'd and
unavoidable Fatalitie, which apparently destroys
all the foundations of Religion and Moralitie; For
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63493:18"/>
necessity is not inconsistent with moral Goodness,
because 'tis of this or that sort, but simply because
'tis necessity: for the only cause why a necessary
Agent is not capable of Moralitie, is because 'tis
not able to determine it self to Good or Evil, and
consequently not capable of being directed and
governed by Laws, Rewards and Punishments.
For what other reason can there be imagined, why
any Agent is incapable of being thus governed,
then that it has no power and command over its
own Actions, the Office of Laws being to enjoyn
them, to whom they are prescribed, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
themselves to act according to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions?
But to require this of a principle void
of any such power of self-determination, is as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
as to require it of Stones &amp; Trees, because the
absurdity of both consists in requiring obedience,
where there is no principle or capacity able to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it. And therefore unless they can reconcile ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
&amp; indifferency so, as that the same Principle
shall be necessarily determin'd to one extream, and
yet remain so indifferent, as to be able, if i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> please to
determine it self to the other, it will be altogether
fruitless to make other sorts of liberty not inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with necessity. But this they can never do,
unless they can bring the extreams of a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
together, and make it all one to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and undetermined in reference to the same
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63493:19"/>
Action. Thus (for Instance) that Principle that
is endued with no other Liberty, then what consists
in meer spontaneity and immunity from violence
is, without indifferency and a power of self-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
at as great a distance from moral Good
or Evill, as it would be, if it were acted meerly
by external force and violence, because the reason
why that which is moved only by force, is not a
principle capable of morality, is because it has no
power at all over its own motion, and so is moved
with a fatal and unalterable necessity, but a
spontaneus or unforced Action, if it proceed not
from an indifferent but necessary Agent, is as
fatal, and as necessary, as if it were forced, and
as little subject to the determination of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
from whence it flows, as it would though
it proceeded from a forreigne and violent one,
and by consequence is equally incapable of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
And so that principle, which is not only at
liberty from Co-action, but is also endued with
Reason and Understanding is, without indifferency
and a power of self-determination, not less unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of moral Good and Evil, then that which is
quite devoid of Rational faculties; because 'tis
acted by an equal necessity. For if the Judgement
and definitive sentence of the understanding be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and necessary (as it not only is, but is also u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimously
acknowledged to be) and if the wills
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63493:19"/>
following this Judgement be as natural and as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
as its self; then 'tis as extravagant to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the will not to embrace the object commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to it by the understanding, as 'tis to command
the understanding to judge otherwise of it then it
does, which is the same absurdity as to command
the eye to see an object, after another manner then
its represented to it, because they are both deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by an equal necessity. From all which it
follows by all the Laws of Inference, that if Gods
goodness should take away the Indifferency of his
will, it would certainly destroy not only his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but all his moral Perfections and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments:
which is my first Argument.</p>
               <p>2. If the Divine goodness or Benificence were a
necessary Agent, it would not only destroy the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the subject, in which it resides, but also,
what is more absurd, its own: for 'tis absolutely
necessary to the nature of Beneficence and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that it proceed from a free and elective prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
No courtesie can oblige, but what is free
and chosen, and the obligation of benefits is only
then acknowledg'd, when they are received from
one, that had a power not to bestow them, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they are owing not to his favour and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
but to chance or necessity. We make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of gratitude to the Sun for his kind visits,
and benigne Influences, because his emanations
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63493:20"/>
flow from a bare necessity of Nature: And <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuah</hi>
thank'd him not for standing still at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
and interest: I should think it a strange So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecisme
in Courtship, if any one should make me
retributions for a favour, that proceeded only from
some necessity of nature &amp; not from choise of will.
Because the reason of the obligingness of benefits is,
that they argue Benevolence and good Intentions in
the donor towards the person, on whom he bestows
them, but when they are the Issues of a necessary
and unelective cause, they flow not from Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
and argue no benevolence in their Principle,
but are the pure Results of Nature. And therefore
if all the Communications of Gods goodness be
necessary, they may argue the fulness of his nature,
but cannot the goodness of his will, because that
is founded upon choice and freedome. I have in my
former reason endeavoured to evince that a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of acting, of what sort soever, is not capable of
moral Good or Evil, because 'tis inconsistent
with a Dominion over ones own actions, in which
all morality is founded, for an Agent that has no
power and command over its own Actions, and
that acts because it must, whatsoever excellent and
commendable effects it may produce, is as unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of morality as those senseless Machins, that
move by the Laws of matter and motion, because
it produces its effects after the same manner as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63493:20"/>
mechanical causes do, namely, by a necessity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And if any artificial <hi>Automata</hi> were endued
with deliberative, elective and self-moving Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
so as to have power over their own motions,
they would in degrees of proportion be capable of
doing well or ill, but because they have no elective
and self-moving power, that's the Reason why
their motions are uncapable of being good or evil;
and consequently all causes, whose effects result
from the same necessity of Nature, and that have
no power, to restrain their emanations, are as
uncapable of morality as these liveless Engines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they lye under the same incapacity. Now
then Beneficence being a moral Excellency, it
must loose its morality, and consequently its nature,
when 'tis natural and necessary, and therefore if
all the emanations of the Divine Bounty be such,
it will unavoidably follow, that there is no such,
vertue or Beneficence and Goodness in God, so
that we may safely conclude that though the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
of Gods Goodness to his Creatures
be exceedingly agreeable to his Nature, yet to
make them necessary and naturall Results, is by
denying their being free, to deny their being Good.</p>
               <p>3. God can never act contrary to his necessary and
essential properties, as because he is essentially <hi>wise,
just</hi> &amp; <hi>holy,</hi> he can do nothing that is foolish, unjust
and wicked. And therefore if Gods Beneficence
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63493:21"/>
and Bounty were so natural, as that all its exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were necessary, he could never act otherwise;
but that he frequently does, as is evident in all the
Instances of his Anger and Severity, which not
only Reason but Scripture opposes to Benignity,
<hi>Rom. 11. 22. Behold therefore the Goodness and Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of God; on them which fell severity; but towards
thee Goodness.</hi> And <hi>Rom. 9. 13. Iocob have I loved, but
Esau have I hated:</hi> The reason whereof is, <hi>v. 15.
Because I will have mercy, on whom I will have mercy,
and I will have compassion, on whom I will have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.</hi>
The sole cause then why God shewed
greater bounty to <hi>Iacob</hi> then to <hi>Esau,</hi> was a free de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of his own will, without the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any extrinsique motive to incline it: For
<hi>v. 11. the Children were yet unborn, and had done nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good nor evil, that the purpose of God according to
Election</hi> [or choice] <hi>might stand.</hi> The Argument
suggested by the Apostles Discourse, beside his
express resolving Gods Beneficence into his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
is this, that if the flowings forth of Gods
Goodness were necessary, then <hi>Esau</hi> must have
been blest with as great expressions of favour as
<hi>Iacob,</hi> because there could be no cause, that could
make a difference: Not Gods Goodness, for its
exertions being necessary, it would stream forth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
into equal Capacities, and therefore if they
were equally capable, the emanations of the divine
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63493:21"/>
Goodness must have been equal, so that there was
nothing could put a difference, unless the Persons
themselves, but the difference was made before
they could make it, <hi>viz.</hi> before they were born,
or had done any good or evil, but were in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
equal. The Spirit of God has recorded in
Scripture almost as many instances of his severity,
as of his clemency, because the exercise of these
contrary vertues depends on his free will, which
being indifferent to either, sometimes displays the
one, and sometimes the other; whereas those at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
that are Physical and Necessary, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
one way antecedently to the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Will.</p>
               <p>From all which premises, we see (1.) that
Gods benignity, goodness, and beneficence, consist
in a gracious Propensity to let forth the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications
of his fulness to his Creatures, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lodged in the Divine will, does not only suppose
its freedom, but is also subject to its determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
so that though it may incline, yet it cannot
either command or destroy its liberty, because if it
should, it would not only interfere with Gods moral
accomplishmets, but would withal be inconsistent
with it selfe. And therefore it rather approaches
to the nature of a habit seated in the Divine will,
then to the condition of an Essential faculty; whence
a habit and custome of goodness and clemency are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63493:22"/>
frequently attributed to God in Scripture, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acts and single instances of severity; for though
contrary habits cannot lodge together in the same
faculty, yet single actions of the one may sometimes
issue from that Power, in which its contrary is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained:
and therefore though the expressions of
Gods bounty be his usual and constant work, yet
he sometimes lets forth the eruptions of anger and
severity, though with some unwillingness and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy:
for <hi>(Lament. 3. 33.) He does not willingly</hi>
(or from his heart) <hi>afflict the children of men;</hi> and
therefore the holy Ghost <hi>(Esa. 21. 21.)</hi> stiles it his
<hi>strange work,</hi> as if by reason of its seldom exercise,
he were unacquainted with it: so that though Gods
inclinations to acts of Beneficence and Goodness
be vastly great and vigorous, yet they are free, and
depending upon the determinations of his will, and
are upon this score consistent with Gods dealing
sometime with us by more severe and rigorous
measures, which God is pleased at certain seasons
to dispense according to the unsearchable Counsels
of his own will. (2.) That the Communications
of Gods goodness consist in the use and exercise
of his Dominion, for the good and benefit of his
Creatures; for they being all originally nothing,
all the advantages they enjoy to render their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
more desirable then Non-existence, are the
free gifts and effects of Divine goodness, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63493:22"/>
free and unconstrained, has distributed its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
with an infinite variety, having made innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
kinds of Beings, and endued them all with
perceptive faculties and capacities proportion'd to
their respective natures, and provided suitable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in order to their gratification, so that although
he has, according to the free pleasure of his own
will, created some in a more imperfect state then
others, yet he has provided liberally for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of them all, having furnished each order with
objects agreeable to their respective faculties, in
the perception and enjoyment of which, consists
all pleasure and satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Now, if we will measure how large and ample
the communications of Divine goodness are, they
are as vast as free, <hi>Psal. 145. 9. The Lord is good to
all, and his tender Mercies are over all his Workes.</hi>
Psal. 38. 5, 6. <hi>Thy goodness (O Lord) reacheth to the
Heavens, and thy faithfulness to the clouds. Thy
Righteousness is like the great Mountains; thy Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
(or works of Providence) <hi>are a great deep;
thou preservest man and beast,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i.e.</hi> Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is of equal extent with his works, as vast and
wide as the Universe, running through all parts of
the Creation. But to speak only of that goodness
which concerns our selves: how free and unstreit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
have been the expressions of Gods bounty to
mankind? Not to mention the pleasures and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63493:23"/>
of life it self, in which the Divine mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
has made provision, not only for our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
but for our delight and curiosity too; nor
the great variety of perceptive faculties he has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
us with; nor the innumerable instancies of his
Mercy, Clemency, Patience, Long-suffering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the sons of men, his slowness and unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to punish, and his readiness to pardon our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties;
nor his demanding only such homage and
service from us, as cannot be more our duty, then
tis our happiness, with infinite more inestimable
vouchsafements, and expressions of his tenderness
and good inclinations towards mankind. I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
instance in his rewarding that obedience that is
our debt, with such great and inestimable blessings,
<hi>viz.</hi> not only earthly and secular, but spiritual and
eternal pleasures: He might have sent us into the
world to act our parts a while, and have endear'd
our duty to us only by its own appendant delights,
and then have remanded us back into our pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent
state of not being: But that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
the bare discharge of our duties, with the
rewards of Heaven and Eternity, is such a stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
height of goodnesse, as not only puzzles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
but outreaches wonder and admiration. And
yet that which enhances the value of the Reward,
is not more its greatnesse then its freenesse, though
some are so arrogant as to challenge a natural and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63493:23"/>
necessary right in it: Arrogant, I say, because if
it were our due, we must derive it not from
Gods goodness, but from our own desert, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
beside Gods goodness, can create us a right
to future happiness, but our own Merits, which
from a Creature to its Maker implies the greatest
contradiction. And if in any respect Heaven be
our due, God would be obliged by the natural
measures of Equity to bestow it, and so our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
would not derive from the free grant of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
goodness, but from the prime and intrinsique
Laws of Justice. For if there were any natural
and eternal necessity that Happinesse should wait
on Vertue, that the Vertuous are happy, would
be no thanks to the Divine favour, because that
cannot be an act of favour, which is demanded by
Justice and natural Right. And therefore those
passages in Scripture, that seem to make our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
reward just and due, speak upon supposition
of Gods gracious Promise and Covenant with
mankind, as <hi>Heb. 6. 10. For God is not unrighteous, to
forget your work &amp; labour of love, which ye have shewed
towards his Name.</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 8. <hi>Henceforth is laid
up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord, the
righteous Iudge, shall give me at that day; and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me only, but unto all them also that love his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
In which, and other passages, the assured hope
of our future reward is therefore argued from Gods
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63493:24"/>
Justice, because 'tis essentially just that he should
perform his Promises, and therefore, although
Gods Promise or Covenant were not an act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
but of Grace, (for 'tis impossible for God to
enter into any Covenant with his creatures, but a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace) yet its performance, when made,
is absolutely just and necessary, and that in which
God cannot fail without gross deceit and falseness,
he having engaged his Veracity to discharge all the
debts of his Grace. And therefore (as some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Men have noted) this Justice in Scripture is
promiscuously expressed by Justice, Truth, and
Faithfulness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. they are all used to
express the same thing; And 1 <hi>Ioh. 1. 9. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins;</hi> Because if he be just and faithful, he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his Promise.</p>
               <p>If I were to prove the necessity of future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Punishment, from the nature of
any of the Divine Attributes, I should rather fetch
my Arguments from the Attributes of Wisdom
then any else; because they are (as might easily be
evinced) so hugely useful, and well-nigh necessary
to the Government of the World; whence the
<hi>Rabins</hi> reckon Paradice and Hell among those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Pillars, upon which they say God founded the
world, supposing it could not subsist without them:
But yet no one sort of means being absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63493:24"/>
to Almighty Power and Wisdom, in order
to any end, God could have found out in finite ways
to engage us to obedience, though he had never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
us with future Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
So that whatsoever Rationalities may be
drawn from the Divine Attributes, to prove a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
state, yet it depending wholly on the Divine
will, and the Divine will being absolutely free, we
can have no rational inducements to bring us to any
sufficient knowledge of it, but by a clear Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Divine will, and therefore God (to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the Instances of his Goodness) sent the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Jesus into the world to bring life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
to light, and to encourage us to Vertue and
Goodness by greater Rewards then were before
proposed to mankind. So that though we could
enhance the expressions of Gods love and bounty
to mankind, to their utmost pitch and value, yet we
have just reason to conclude, that the peculiar and
unequal'd eminency of the Divine benignity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
not so much in the greatness, as in the freeness
of its Emanations, as streaming forth from a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of free and self-moving Goodness.</p>

               <p>THough the foregoing Discourses are as use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and important Theories as any in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
(there being not any other Articles so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
interested in Theological Speculations as
these; nor any thing that has occasioned so much
Errour and Ignorance in other points, as false and
confused conceits, concerning these two grand At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of Dominion and Goodness:) Yet they
cannot be more important and concerning in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
then they will be useful and necessary for
the successful management of this ensuing discourse
against Preexistence; because the most plausible
Argument alleadged, on behalf of this Hypothesis,
is grounded upon such mistaken notions of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
goodnesse, as I have already (I think) evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough disproved in what I have discoursed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that Attribute; so that I am so far before
hand in the Dispute, as to have prevented the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
Objection I am liable to be Assaulted with.
This premised, I immediately proceed (1.) to give
an account of the Hypothesis it self, and the grounds
on which it bottoms; and then (2.) to give in my
exceptions both against it and them. And that
you may be sure of my faithfulness in the first, I
will perform it as near as I can, in the very words
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63493:25"/>
of its most Peremptory assertours. Their account
then is this,</p>
               <p>That the Souls of men are not then first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
when they are united to the Bodies prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for them by generation, but were created all at
first in an incomparably more Blessed and Divine
Condition of Life, then that they are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to in this sad Region of sin and misery, but
that at several times and occasions by their Revolt
from God &amp; his righteous laws they forfeited their
better life and condition, and so were thrust down
into these terrestial Bodies, partly to be punished
for their former prevarications, and partly that by
acting their parts well here, they might recover
that more happy state from which they lapsed into
this. And this they endeavour to prove,</p>
               <p>1. from the nature of Divine Goodness, which
(say they) is constrained alwaies to do what is best;
for the Souls of men being capable of eternall exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
and happiness backward as well as forward,
and it being much better that they should have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
the pleasure of their life and actions from
eternal Ages, then either to have layn so long in the
comfortless night of nothing, or to have been at
first created in so mean and wretched a condition,
as that is which they suffer in this Region of Death
and Misery; and then God being infinitely good
and gracious, and infinite Goodness doing by the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63493:26"/>
same necessity that which is best, as infinite fire
will necessarily burn whatever is combustible, if
put to it, it clearly and unavoidably follows (say
they) that they must have existed of old before
they came into these Bodies.</p>
               <p>2. From the Actions of Providence, which will
not otherwise correspond to those holy Attributes
in the Deity, Righteousness and Benignity, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to which he Governs and Orders the affairs
of all the World. And this Argument they make
use of two waies, <hi>viz.</hi> in respect of the place and
time wherein we are born, and of the temper
and disposition of the body, wherewith we are
born.</p>
               <p>As to the first of these, there is no man doubts
but that education, institution, and company, are of
such wonderful moment to the making us good or
bad, as that where vice and wickedness are in use
and practise, there seems little less then a necessity
of swimming down in the stream of our Countrys
Vices: And then the greatest part of the World
having been always over-run with all manner of
Lust and Barbarity, for God to send out of his
pure and holy hands an immaculate soul, capable
of living elsewhere, and fit for all virtue and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Wisdom, into an habitation in such parts of the
Earth, where reigns nothing but gross Ignorance
and Vice by which she cannot fail without a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63493:26"/>
to be over-born, what is this, say they, but
to betray his own off-spring unto unavoidable
miseries?</p>
               <p>As to the second of these they argue thus, seeing
there are in mankind strange &amp; fatal propensities to
all manner of vice &amp; wickedness, that flow from the
very intrinsick constitution of their Bodies, how can
it be consistent with the Goodness and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, the blessed spring of all virtue and
Holiness, and tender lover of all his Creatures, to
put innocent souls into such foul and untamed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which so fatally and necessarily hurry them
to that which alone of all things in the world he
disapproves of, and which he knows will be their
utter bane and miserable ruin.</p>
               <p>And here some of them argue more particularly
from the absurdity of the two opinions of the souls
immediate creation, or seminal traduction; for if it
begins neither of these waies, it must have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existed,
therefore (1) against the first of them,
they use the forementioned Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> that it
seems inconsistent with the Goodness and Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of God, to put pure and immaculate spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such Bodys as will presently defile them, pervert
all their powers and faculties, and incline them to
all manner of vice and impiety. And then (2) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the second, <hi>viz.</hi> seminal Propagation of souls,
they argue from the nature of the soul it self, for
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63493:27"/>
(say they) if the soul be generated then it must be
made of the soul of the Parent, which is against the
nature of an immaterial Being, the cheif proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of which is to be indiscerpable. These are the
most material considerations urged in behalf of
Preexistence, others that either depend on these, or
are less considerable, I shall have occasion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as I proceed, and withal, to replie to a few
passages of Scripture, that for the better counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the business, they press to serve in the
cause of this Controversie. Having given you this
brief, but comprehensive account of the Hypothesis
it self, I now proceed to give in my Exceptions.</p>
               <p>First then, although I am not oblig'd by vertue
of what I have discoursed in my fifth exception
against the Platonick Philosophie, to oppose this
Hypothesis by Counter-arguings, because 'tis out
of the sphere of Humane knowledge, and to be
ranked among <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
things meerly possible, and meerly contingent, and
so is sufficiently confuted by destroying the grounds
on which it stands, yet, to render my Triumph
over it more full and entire, I shall make my first
onset from an objection drawn from its ill corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponding
with the divine Attributes of Wisdome,
Justice, and Goodness, and that upon a twofold
account.</p>
               <p>1. In that it supposes God to inflict the severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63493:27"/>
of his Justice without attaining the ends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
for to what purpose is it to inflict penalties
upon any Person for offences, of which he is as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
as he could have been, though they had
never been committed? For assign they what ends
of Justice they please, this is most undenyably cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that to punish a guilty Person, that is invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly
ignorant of his sins, is as far from attaining
the ends of Justice, as to inflict the same Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon one that's guiltless, for if he has no
knowledge of his miscarriages, he has the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be faultless in his own esteem as he that is
really so: But for God to chastise with the rods
of his vengeance any Creature that is in the same
condition with the Innocent and guiltless (in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the ends of Justice and Punishment) bids
not a less defiance to the Reputation of his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
then to inflict the same Punishments upon
one that never deserved it. I conclude therefore
that if the calamities of this life were inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us only as punishments of sins committed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
Providence would have provided some effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
means to preserve them in our Memories;
and therefore because we find no remainders of any
such Records in our minds, 'tis (I think) sufficient
evidence to all sober and impartiall enquirers, that
our living and sinning in a former state is as false as
inevident.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:63493:28"/>
2. In that it would be an invincible Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to mankind to have hard and jealous thoughts
of Gods dealings with them. For when they see
themselves environed with miseries and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and feel the heavie strokes of divine Anger,
and yet are utterly ignorant that they have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, what more just and reasonable grounds
can they have not only to call in question but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to denie his Goodness and Equity. For if it will
not comport with Gods Righteousness and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity
to place us in these sad Circumstances we
are in, unless thereby to punish us for our former
prevarications (as the patrons of Preexistence
fiercely and clamarously contest) when we know
our selves to be in this sad plite, and yet are utterly
destitute of all knowledge how we deserved it, what
can we more naturally infer, then that God has,
contrary to all the Laws of Justice and Equity,
made us Wretched and Miserable? Should he
take the most lewd and debauched Vilain upon
Earth, and thrust him into the Dungeons of endless
misery, but withal take away all sence and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his former state and wickedness, would not
that miserable wretch have just reason to exclaim
against the Crueltie of his Maker, as supposing
himself created in that sad &amp; deplorable state? And
suppose it possible for God to have produced any
being in the same miserable condition the damned
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63493:28"/>
in Hell are supposed to suffer, that wretched Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
might as well argue for a state of Preexistence,
in which it had deserved the Torments it endures,
as any other being, that finds it self in that forlorn
condition, but is deprived of all knowledge of any
former scene of Life? Now God cannot in Reason
expect we should acknowledge his Justice and
Righteousness contrary to his actings; and therefore
if he has inflicted upon us those Calamities, that
cannot justly be inflicted upon any but sinners,
and yet not let us know we are such, what else can
we conclude but that we innocents are unjustly
doom'd to the sad and miserable Portion of the
Wicked? Perhaps it would not be difficult to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
many other not inconsiderable Objections,
but these are all that occurr to my thoughts at
present, &amp; all those I have met with in Authors are
most lamentably frivolous and impertinent. And
therefore I shall immediately pass on to the main
and only needful part of my Task, <hi>viz.</hi> to evince
the Groundlesness of this Hypothesis I oppose,
for if I can shew the Ratiocinations from whence
they conclude its Truth and Reality to be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
vaine and frivolous, I shall thereby sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evidence the vanity of the Hypothesis it self,
as being built upon vain and trifling Pretences. But
before I descend to their particular Examination,
it will not be impertinent to observe,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:63493:29"/>
1. That it would be no difficult task to erect
other much different or quite contrary Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Methinks that purely Phisical account which
<hi>Porphiry</hi> some where gives of the Souls descent into
these Terrestrial Bodies, is as neat and handsome
as the Origenian or Moral one, for as this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
our lapse Originally from our voluntary and
chosen Immoralities, that other derives them
meerly from a Physical necessity, which it illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
by this similitude. As a fruitful field, though
it may for a certain period of years yield good
Grain, yet at length it is exhausted and grows bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
and then if sit be laid fallow though it brings
forth nothing but weeds and tares, yet it thereby
recovers its ancient vigour and fruitfulness; so our
Souls having been for many ages impregnated with
the seed of Divine Ideas, by degrees spent, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in bringing forth large returns of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
till at length their Intellectual powers decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the higher part falls into a swoon, and they
can exert no acts but of Imagination, whence spring
forth the powers of the Vegetal life, which
cause in them strong and irresistible propensities
to an union with these inferior and terrestrial
Bodies, in order to the awaking of the higher
Powers, for because every thing in the Etherial
Regions is too calme and serene to awake them,
they are therefore conveyed into this place of noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63493:29"/>
and disturbance, and invessel'd in a body full of
rude and impetuous passions, by which they may
be chafed into life and sensation again. Or what
if I would, out of a perverse humour of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
assigne a quite contrary Hypothesis of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence,
and as they will have this world a place
of Punishment, and maintain the Soul came into
it by lapsing from a happier and more excellent
condition, so why may not I assert that 'tis a place
of Reward, and that God sends us hither to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
our vertuous actions in a lower and less hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
condition of life, or that they that had miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in a weaker and less advantageous state, might
once more try their fortunes in better and more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
circumstances? Which Hypothesis
would be as much, and perhaps more consistent
with it self, then the contrary. For seeing they
will needs have it the design of Providence, in thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
the Soul down into this Region of Misery, to
amend and reform, as well as chastise it, it seems
much more consonant to effect this, by raising it
to a more perfect state, then dooming it to a worse,
for 'tis a very preposterous way to Reformation, to
put the soul into such fatal propensities of sinning,
(as they say 'tis in here;) this being the directest
course utterly and irrecoverably to undo it. And
now had I a mind to set up for a Maker of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses,
(which you see is but an easie trade) I might
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63493:30"/>
so trim and adorn this with artificial and affected
Phrases, and so support it with a set of Theorems,
Pillars, and Fundamental Principles, as to make it
appear a competently handsome and well built
Structure. And withal, I think it would be able to
stand the shock of those Objections and Counter-evidences,
that would shrewdly shake, if not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
demolish the Origenian Hypothesis: But if
any Origenist shall disapprove my Hypothesis, I
only challenge him to confute it, for I am sure the
like arguments will confute his own: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to shew him the Vanity of inventing ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and imaginary Hypotheses, I will be so cross-grain'd
as not to abandon mine, as long as he shall
persist peremptory in his.</p>
               <p>2. The second thing I am to observe, is, that
they (which is the usual oversight of unwary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants)
dispute not more against their Adversaries
then themselves, in that the Arguments they use to
destroy all other Hypotheses and confirm their own,
do as evidently oppose it as them. For their own
account of our descent into this world is, that 'tis
onely a merciful provision and contrivance of the
infinite Wisdom and Goodness of God (the end of
all whose Councils is his Creatures Happinesse)
<hi>to put lost and delinquent Souls into a
capacity of acting their parts anew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lux. Orient. <hi>p.</hi> 41.</note> 
                  <hi>that
so, so many of his excellent creatures, might not be lost
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63493:30"/>
and undone irrecoverably, but that they might be in a
condition to recover the old happiness of their Celestial
state.</hi> Now is it not highly derogatory to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
and unbounded Wisdome of God, <hi>that he</hi>
should detrude those souls, which he so seriously
designs to make happy, into a state so hazardous,
<hi>wherein he seeth it to be ten thousand to one, but that they
will corrupt and defile themselves, and so make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
more miserable here, and to Eternity hereafter?</hi>
A strange method of Recovery this, to put them
into such a fatal necessitie of perishing. 'Tis but an
odd contrivance for their Restauration to happiness,
to use such means to compass it, which tis ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
to one but will make them infinitely more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable.
This is such a contrivance of Mercy, that
puts us in a worse condition, then it abandons the
Devils to, for if the conditions of our Recovery
be so near being impossible, our state is as bad as
theirs, and if the non-performance of these condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
be punisht with greater penalties, 'tis worse.
Better be abandon'd to an eternal dispair, then have
hopes to be rescued onely by such means, as 'tis
ten thousand to one but will exceedingly encrease
our Torment and Misery.<note place="margin">The Account of <hi>Orig. &amp;c.</hi> pag. 27.</note> Again, <hi>If
we call to mind the sad accounts we have
met withal in History, of times and places
almost all the world over, over-run with all manner of
barbarity and lust, adopted even into their Laws, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63493:31"/>
practised in their most solemn Religions, how can we but
think that the Soul then and there born and living, is
inevitably condemned to all Iniquity and Impiety?</hi> But
can we imagine that infinite Wisdom seriously pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
to restore us to our ancient. Holiness and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
when it places us in such a state, in which we
are inevitably condemned to all Iniquity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety?
If God had contrived to betray us into all
manner of vice and wickedness, how could he more
effectually have accomplish't it, then by putting us
into such a condition, as should inevitably condemn
us to all Iniquity and Impiety? That Father
would take a strange course to reform a debauch'd
and wretchless Child, that should go about to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it by abandoning him to the Society of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
and Villains. Pag. 28. <hi>For God therefore to send
an immortal Soul</hi> (whose happinesse is his greatest
design and contrivance) <hi>into an habitation in such
parts of the Earth, where reigns nothing but gross ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and vice, by which she cannot fail without a
miracle to be over-born, what is this but to betray his
own off-spring (for he is the Father of Spirits) unto
unavoidable misery,</hi> whilest he pretends to plot and
contrive their happiness, <hi>and so govern the world with
less prudence, then an ordinary discreet man would do.</hi>
Once more in their own words, Pag. 35. <hi>I would
aske them whether or no the condition of our nature consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
the strong inclinations naturally to that which is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63493:31"/>
evil, and those strengthned and further confirmed for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
years before we can come to have any considerable
use of our Reason, or arrive to any command over our
selves. Lastly, the way and manner how the Elections
of our will are performed, which we never find free,
where there is a custome or passion against it, and how
corporeal motions determine the thoughts and passions of
our minds; I ask them whether these things being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
it be not hundreds to one odds, that we shall
choose the ways of Vice rather then Vertue? Or let the
proportion be as little as they can with any colour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
they cannot clear the Wisdom and Discretion of
Divine Providence by their Hypothesis, which thrusts
the Spirits</hi> (it intends to make for ever happy) <hi>into
so great a danger of being defiled and corrupted by the
passions of the Body, and of soundly smarting for it
hereafter.</hi> Thus you see what strong Objections,
the Arguments they urge with most noise and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
are against themselves, if therefore these
Phaenomena be inexplicable without the Origenian
Hypothesis, they are so too with it; and if so, then
the result of all is, that they are not so much Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of Preexistence, as Aspersions of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
For whatever Hypothesis is true, they
charge Gods Transactions with mankind either of
Injustice or Folly; and therefore I shall attempt
their solution not so much to oppose the Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
of Preexistence, as to vindicate the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63493:32"/>
from so many contumelious and unworthy
Reproaches. After these more general conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
against the Hypothesis it self: I come now to
a particular Examination of the Arguments on
which 'tis founded.</p>
               <p>First then, as for that strong Demonstration (as
they stile it) taken from the Nature of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which they suppose constrain'd to do always
that which is best, 'tis so fully, not only answered,
but confuted, in what I have already discoursed, of
the nature and extent of Gods Goodness and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
that to subjoyn any formal Reply, would
be but a needless and troublesome Repetition. For
having made it apparently evident, that any state,
better then that of Non-existence, may be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Gods Dominion, and the effect of his
Goodness; every condition of Being, preferable
to that of Not-being, is not onely consistent with
the Divine Goodness, but a Product of it; and
therefore if they will make good this Argument
drawn from the Divine Goodness for their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
they must first either disprove the Truth
and Validity of my preceding discourses, or else
make it appear that the condition of Souls in this
life is more deplorable and less desirable, then the
state of Annihilation. And when they shall have
done either, they will deserve a farther reply, but
not till then.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:63493:32"/>
And yet I cannot forbear to super add this one
Consideration more, <hi>viz.</hi> that the boundless In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
of the Divine Goodness is consistent with the
existence of different Ranks and Orders of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
God being not constreined to make every
Creature the most Perfect he can, for then there
would have been but one sort of Beings, <hi>viz.</hi> the
highest and most consuminate Rank of all, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
we see the World replenish'd with divers species
of Creatures, some more, some less perfect. Now,
if notwithstanding the Infiniteness of the Divine
Goodness, there may be various kinds of Creatures
of various and unequal Perfections; then what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
or Reason imaginable is there, the Divine
Goodness should be constrain'd to let forth its lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
Emanations to mankind; for why may not our
species be of an inferiour Rank in the Order of
Beings? And if so, then what necessity is there we
should be endued with all possible Perfections? Are
there not several Ranks of Spirits or Immaterial
Beings? And are not the Assertors of Preexistence
the most Zealous Patrons thereof? And do they
not Marshal the Souls of Men in one of the lowest
and most imperfect Orders, as being united to the
grossest and most ignoble Body, <hi>viz.</hi> Terrestrial
matter, whilst all the rest reside in Bodies of Aire
or Aether? and therefore for men to deem the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Goodness less infinite, because its Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63493:33"/>
are not so great to them as they are to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
is as absurd as it was for the Figs in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that complain'd to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> because he had not
made them Grapes. Again, why might not all
these several Ranks of immaterial Beings be at first
created in the same estate they are in at present,
without lapsing from a higher to a lower condition
of life, as well as several sorts of material creatures,
which were at first disposed in the same order they
still hold? If God could, his Goodness notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
create such an innumerable variety of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects,
which are but imperfect and half Animals;
then why might he not also, notwithstanding the
same Goodness, create among spiritual Essences a
species not more perfect then humane Souls? For
if the boundlesness of Gods goodness does not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
but that some Creatures may exist in a much
more imperfect Condition then others, then
neither can it hinder but that the Souls of men
might be placed in a much lesse perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
then other immaterial Beings. From all
which it followes, that it cannot with the least
pretence of Reason, be argued from the Nature
of Gods Goodness, that the Souls of men did
once preexist in the happiest state, which Beings
of their Nature are possibly capable of enjoying.
As for their Arguments taken from the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, their whole force Centers in this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63493:33"/>
one difficulty, that God has not taken sufficient
care for the happiness of his Creatures, but has
left them too obnoxious to Sin and Miserie; now to
assoil and clear this Objection, I need only evince
that the Divine Providence has made not only suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
but large provisions for the Happiness of
Mankind. But I shall not be content nakedly to
answer their Objections, unless I can confute them
too; In order to which, I shall undertake to do
these two things, (1.) To propose a plain and easie
Hypothesis, that gives a rational and satisfactory
account of all the forementioned Phaenomina of
Providence. And then (2.) To shew that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is not only endued with such Faculties, by
the use whereof he may arrive at the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Vertue and Happiness; but also that we
have the greatest Endearments and Advantages in
the world, to engage and assist us in a diligent and
vigorous prosecution thereof.</p>
               <p>My Hypothesis is this, That it has pleased Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
to place mankind here in an immature and
more imperfect state, that so we might in a way
congruous to free and rational Agents by degrees
be fitted for, and at length arrive at a better and
more raised condition of life. As in nature all things
commence their Beings in a rude and immature
state, and make orderly progressions, to farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of maturity, 'till they arrive at the utmost
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63493:34"/>
perfections their Beings are capable of; so is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
Created and born into the World as it were in
the Spring, in a Budding and Blossoming season,
that so we may by proceeding forward in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Periods of our lives, grow up to higher and
more excellent Capacities, till at length we ripen
into a state of maturity and perfection. Our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are at first somewhat rough-cast, to the end
that they might be refined and polished by Vertue
and Religion; so that 'tis the main (and perhaps
only) designe of Religion to perfect and advance
our Natures, and make us capable of a higher and
more noble condition of life. Now I need not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
and expatiate upon the neatness and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency
of this Hypothesis, when we know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
that 'tis the way and method pitch'd upon
by Providence to conduct mankind to its Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it being an Oeconomy hugely agreeable to all
the designes and purposes of Religion, the Natural
tendency whereof is to raise us to higher Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and nearer approaches to the Divine Nature.
This gives a more general Reason of the present,
low and imperfect condition of mankind, but that
I may give a more certain and perspicuous account
thereof, and more close to the main Origenian
objection (<hi>viz.</hi> why God should put pure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate
Souls into these disorderly Bruitish Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)
I shall make my Hypothesis more distinct
and particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:63493:34"/>
Mankind then is an order of Beings placed in a
middle state between Angels and Brutes, made up
of contrary principles, <hi>viz.</hi> Matter and Spirit, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with contrary Faculties, <hi>viz.</hi> Animal and
Rational, and encompass'd with contrary Objects
proportion'd to their respective faculties, that so
they may be in a capacity to exercise the Vertues
proper and peculiar to their compounded and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogenial
Natures. For the perfection of humane
Souls does not consist in an effeminate Beauty,
and Physical proportions, but in a manly courage
and moral accomplishments, as at the Olympick
Games there was no regard had to Beauty and
Neatness, they only were capable of honour and
reputation, who had courage and patience enough
to combate. And the life of man in this world is
nothing else but an Olympick exercise, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
placed us here not to admire the native Beauty
and Perfection of our Beings, but to exercise our
selves in the conflicts and difficulties of Vertue;
therefore the worth and praise of the Soul, consists
in a Braveness and Gallantry of Spirit, when it
scorns to be usurp'd upon by those faculties that
ought to obey her, and checks and controules all
their unruly and tumultuous exorbitances by her
own sovereign and imperial Laws, and resolutely
defends its own Authority and Prerogative against
all the furious and rebellious attempts of Passion
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63493:35"/>
and Concupiscence. And therefore though humane
Souls be capable of subsisting by themselves, yet
God has placed them in Bodies full of bruitish
and unreasonable Propensions, that they might
be capable of exercising many choice and excellent
Vertues, which otherwise could never have been
at all; such as Temperance, Sobriety, Chastity,
Patience, Meekness, Equanimity, and all other
Vertues that consist in the Empire of Reason over
Passion &amp; Appetite, Religion is common to Men
and Angels, appertaining to them purely as Spirits,
but Vertue is proper to man alone, and belongs
to him as a Being made up of contrary principles,
whence spring contrary desires and inclinations, in
the good or bad Government whereof consists the
Nature of Vertue and Vice, &amp; upon this score 'tis
that Vertue is never attributed to God, because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a simple &amp; purely spiritual nature, he has no
unruly passions and sensual Appetites to Govern.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Platonists, though they place
all Intellectual Vertues <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the
abstracted Soul, yet they will have all moral ones
reside <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Composition, denying the
naked Soul to be capable of moral Good or Evil,
these belonging only to the whole which results from
Soul and Body; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> saies <hi>Plotinus.</hi>
And this (by the way) is their meaning, when they
unanimously resolve that grand perplexing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63493:35"/>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> into the terrestrial <hi>Hyle;</hi> because
our material Principle, by reason of its intrinsique
dulness and stupidity, naturally hinders and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs
the intellectual efforts of the mind, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
it to the love of material and sensual objects,
which if it suffer it self to be so far immerst into
matter as to persue only or chiefly the satisfaction
of its gross and sottish Propersities, thence natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
spring all those Irregularities that pass under
the name of Moral Vices. And this account of
the Origine of Evil, is not so devoid of Reason, as
some Learned men would perswade us. For (1) it
does not (as is objected) make matter to be essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
evil, but rather the occasion thereof from its
extra essential union with the soul. Nor (2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) does
it make the existence of evil natural and necessary,
for it dos not assert that it results from the nature
of matter (as they would make us believe) but only
an accidental effect thereof after its union with
the soul, in that from the sluggishnesse of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it inclines the soul to the love of gross and
material objects; and if the soul be so carelesse as
to yeild to its inclinations, it becomes the voluntary
cause of its own evil. But you will think my Pen
very unruly if it be so apt to flie out into Digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when 'tis in so great speed, and therefore I
return.</p>
               <p>Now because the nature of Vertue consists in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63493:36"/>
the minds governing the Bruitish and Animal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
and motions of the body, Providence has
furnish'd it with instruments convenient for that
purpose; for having its principal and commanding
residence <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, where the Nerves that convey
all motions and impressions backward and forward,
have their Original, 'tis able by its immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon them to command and bridle all the
Animal motions of the Body. Thus because all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of Passion consists in an irregular motion of the
blood; the Nerves (which the soul uses as its reins)
are twisted about the veins and arteries, that so by
contracting them, it may be able to refrain and
check the Impetuosity of the Bloods motion, and
consequently curb the eager and unruly passion;
as when for example such an object is presented to
us, that naturally provokes to anger, which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consists in a violent ebullition and fervor of the
blood about the Region of the Heart, which vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
hurrying from thence into the Brain, disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the motions of the Spirits there, and so by
confounding the phautasms that lodge therein, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
all its conceptions and operations; then does
it concern the Soul to abate and cool this unruly
heat, which is effected by restraining the violence
of the Torrent, which is effected by its influence
upon those Nerves that are the passage and high
way from the Brain to the Heart. And therefore
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63493:36"/>
the Providence of nature has made a peculiar
passage for commerce between the
Head and the Heart in Man,<note place="margin">V. <hi>Willis</hi> Cereb. Anat. <hi>cap.</hi> 26.</note> where
it has made none in Beasts, <hi>viz.</hi>
whereas the <hi>Praecordia</hi> of Beasts are furnished
with nervous branches only from the <hi>Par vagum</hi>
to supply the vital functions with spirits, in man
there are peculiar large branches, derived from the
<hi>Intercostal Nerve</hi> into the same region, only for a
way of commerce between the Brain and the Heart,
and passage of the Animal spirits from the one to
the other, as need shall require. In so much that
we may define Prudence and Virtue to be nothing
else but a due commerce between the Brain &amp; the
Heart (which <hi>Plotinus</hi> only expresses more abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly,
when he describes it to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>)
of which the fore-cited machless Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
supplys us with a clear Example, <hi>viz.</hi> that
dissecting a Changeling or Natural Fool, the
chief defect he could discover in him was, that this
<hi>Plexus</hi> of the <hi>Intercostal Nerve,</hi> which is proper to
the body of Man, and is the way of commerce for
the Animal spirits between the Heart and the
Brain was exceeding small, and its branches very
thin. By reason whereof, his Soul could have but
very little command over his Passions and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
in the impotency and irregularity whereof
consists the nature of Folly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:63493:37"/>
The result of all is this, that mankind is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of contrary Principles, endued with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
desires and inclinations, to the end that there
might be an order of Beings in the world (without
which there would perhaps have been one Species
wanting to compleat the Universe) capable of all
those Heroick Vertues, which consist in the
Empire of Reason over the brutish and sensual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
As also that by the right use and emprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our superiour Powers, we might be raised
to greater Capacities, and qualified for higher and
more divine Accomplishments. So that man seems
to differ from the Angels only in this, that he must
by conquest and industry win the happiness, which
is entail'd on their Natures; for when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in our dispositions, we shall be made
so too in our enjoyments; the Divine Goodness
having graciously appointed, that when the
Soul is so far advanced in Vertue, as to live
above the reach of all its Passions and Desires,
that then it shall be translated into a more
free and disintangled state, where it shall be
neither enticed nor vex'd with the importunity
of these lower and bruitish Appetites, but
shall enjoy the Serenity and Pleasures of a pure
and intellectual Being, as the Reward of its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Pains and Industry. As on the contrary, when
any man suffers his Passions and Brutish Appetites
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63493:37"/>
to beat Reason out of its Throne, and to run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
into an ungovernable Anarchy, he degenerates
from humanity, grows incorrigible in sin, and sinks
so deep into the Animal life, as to be made unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of acting Vertuously, and suitably to the ends
of his Being; and thence is congruously doom'd
to the Portion of degenerate and apostate Spirits,
as being fit for nothing else. So that the whole
designe of Providence, in sending us into this world,
is only that we may in a way congruous to ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Agents, prepare our selves for another; and
therefore the Souls of men shall at their departure
hence, be stated in a condition proportion'd to their
good or bad Qualifications. I am apt to be posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and dogmatical in this Hypothesis, not so much
because it gives a rational and satisfactory account
of Gods sending pure and innocent Souls into Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
full of brutish and irregular Inclinations, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it exactly agrees with the Condition of our
Natures, with the natural tendency of Vertue and
Religion, and with the whole Oeconomy of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in conducting mankind to their future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
Not to mention its consonancy with Saint
<hi>Pauls</hi> Hypothesis, in his Account of the Civil and
Intestine War between the law of the Mind and the
law of the Members.</p>
               <p>And now having laid my Hypothesis, I come
to shew (1.) that mankind is endued with such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63493:38"/>
by the use whereof, he may attain to the
highest degrees of Vertue and Happiness; (2) that
we have the greatest endearments and advantages
in the world to push us forward to a diligent and
vigorous Prosecution thereof. And if Vertue and
Happiness be in our own power, and if we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to pursue and endeavour after them by the
greatest endearments and perswasions, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Providence has placed us in a sufficient capacity
of being happy, and if it happen that we should at
last be abandoned to Misery, we must owe it to
our own choice and prodigious folly.</p>
               <p>1. First then, Mankind is furnished with such
faculties, by the use whereof he may arrive at Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Happiness. To evidence this, I require no
other Postulatum, then that which is the great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all Religion and Morality, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
Mind of man is endued with Reason and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
able to discern the essential differences of
Good and Evil; and with Liberty and Election,
able to choose and pursue the one, and eschew the
other. This (I say) is a <hi>Postulatum</hi> so just and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
as that it cannot be denyed without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
not onely the Nature of Good and Evil,
but of Man himself; For if in any thing we differ
from Brutes, 'tis in the Reason and Liberty of our
minds, all our other faculties we have in common
with them, 'tis these alone that are the peculiar
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63493:38"/>
Prerogatives of humane Nature, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them we may be Sheep or Oxen, but not Men.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>—Separat haec nos</l>
                  <l>A grege mutorum, atque ideo venerabile soli</l>
                  <l>Sortiti Ingenium, divinorumque capaces,</l>
                  <l>Atque exercendis capiendisque Artibus apti,</l>
                  <l>Sensum à caelesti demissum traximus Arce.</l>
               </q>
               <p>However these are the efficient Causes and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Foundations of all Morality; for no Action
can be morally Good or Evil, but what we can
choose, and concerning which we can deliberate,
because without them all our Actions would be
either Casual or Fatal, and the meer Issues of
Chance or Necessity, and by consequence, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of being moral, as those motions that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
purely from Mechanical Powers, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
(I think) demonstrated, in what I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
concerning the Freedom of the Divine
Goodness. And now, if the mind of man be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberative
and elective Principle, able to discern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Good and Evil, Happiness and Misery, and
to choose the one and refuse the other, then 'tis at
its own choice, and in its own power to be Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and Happy; for no body questions but that
Goodness and Happiness are much more eligible
then Vice and Misery, and therefore if men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to discern, and choose that which is best, their
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63493:39"/>
Happiness and Misery depend upon their own wills
and their Portion, whether good or bad, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of their own choice; and certainly they that
can be vertuous and happy if they will, are in a
fair capacity of being so.</p>
               <p>From hence it follows, that the mind and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
part of man is Superior and Predominant, not
only endued with Power, but also invested with
Authority to Govern the inferiour and brutish part,
which is of a slavish and servile nature, and made
to obey. Reason is uppermost, and has the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in its own hands, and is strong enough to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the wildest and most untractable Passions.
There's no appetite within us uncontroulable, no
inclinations so strong and fatal, which reason cannot
master; natural Propensities can only tempt, but
not command our Souls; they may encline, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
force them; and our minds are never vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but when they betray themselves. Briefly,
none of the charms of Concupiscence are so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and irresistible, but that Wisdom and Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can easily dissolve and disenchant them. The
Truth and Reality whereof, I thus Argue, Either
the rational Part of man is able to command the
lower Appetites, or 'tis not; if it is, then is he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
able to live well and happily, because
Vertue and Happiness are obtain'd by living up to
Reason, and being conducted by its Laws and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63493:39"/>
and therefore if our superiour Powers are able
to give check and controule to our brutish Lusts and
Passions; 'tis in our own Power to attain to vertue
&amp; happiness. But if the Superior part be not strong
enough to Govern the Inferiour, it destroys the
very Being and Existence of Good and Evil, and
renders mankind utterly uncapable of Goodnesse
and Morality. For (1.) our Irrational faculties
are unanimously acknowledged to be uncapable
of Moral goodness, because they are acted purely
by a necessity of Nature; and their Exertions, like
the Appetites of Brutes, and the Motions of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Engines, result meerly from the Mechanical
Powers of Matter. And hence 'tis that our <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Actions (i.e.</hi> those that do not issue imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from the Will it self, but are exerted at its
command, by some of the inferiour faculties that
owe it subjection) are devoid of all moral Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
as considered abstractedly in themselves, or
as proceeding from their immediate Cause, and
without respect to the wills Authority, because
when so considered, they are not free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary;
and therefore their being Morally good or
evil, is entirely derived from the Will, because they
act only in obedience to its Commands. Nor (2.)
would our Rational faculties in this case, be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Morality, as being fatally determined by the
stronger and irresistible motions of Lust and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63493:40"/>
But the Actions that proceed meerly from
force and forreign Violence, are of all others least
capable of being moral, because they do not only
not issue from a free and self-determining Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which is the greatest and most necessary foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all Morality, but also because they are
not at all determined from their own Principle, but
are forced thence barely by the Power of an exterior
Agent. Besides this, the moral Goodness our
Superior faculties are capable of, would consist in
their Commanding and Governing the Inferiour,
but if they are not able to master and rule them,
they cannot be supposed to be enjoyn'd to governe
them, because nothing can be obliged to impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities;
and therefore if our Superior Powers are
commanded to govern the Inferiour, they must
have strength enough to do it. Wherefore, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
fatal and boisterous our Bruitist propensions
are, if there be any such thing as Religion and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
goodness in the world, they must be subject to
the command and discipline of our Superior and
Governing faculties. From all which 'tis evident,
by a plain and undeniable deduction, that mankind,
notwithstanding the force of their brutish Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is placed in a fair capacity of living well &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily,
which utterly destroys all the forementioned
Arguments alleadged from this Phaenomenon of
Providence, on the behalf of Preexistence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:63493:40"/>
As for the other part of their Argument, taken
from the customary Vices and Impieties of the
World, <hi>viz.</hi> seeing that Custome and Education
have a great influence upon the manners of men,
to make them good or bad, as also that the greatest
part of the world has been always over-run with all
manner of lust and barbarity; for God to send an
Immaculate Soul into an habitation into such parts
of the Earth, where reigns nothing but Vice and
Wickedness, by which she cannot fail without a
Miracle to be over-born, is to betray his own of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
unto unavoidable Misery. 'Tis an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sets too mean a value upon humane Nature, and
supposes mankind no better then Mushrooms, as if
all men were but so many Engines moved by the
wheels of Custome, and had not faculties within
them able to discern of the good and evil of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
as well as of other things. I confess cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
has acquired great Power and Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the life of Man; because the lives of most men
are disposed of by chance and casual Principles,
they pursue those things with which custome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
their Fancies, without ever deliberating of
their Goodness and Decency. You know who has
Pictured mankind comming into the World upon
Hobby-horses; and truly (Sir) the Emblem would
perhaps have been as true, if he had represented
most of them going out so. <hi>Seneca</hi> long since com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63493:41"/>
that the World was not govern'd so much
by Reason, as by Custome; Men accounting that
most Honest, which is most in Practise; and Error
when it becomes Publick, becomes Truth. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
is almost every where so confident, as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
Reason, and charge it of singularity, as indeed
the Wisest men are the greatest Rebels to her
Usurped Empire, whilst she rides upon the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the People, who are almost universally, not
only, her Slaves, but her Idolaters: For the rude
and vulgar sort of people, every where, judge of
things barely by their conformity to the Modes and
Fashions of their own Country, and esteem all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Customes and Usages inept and barbarous,
purely for their disagreement with their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
manners; and therefore I account the
Boors of <hi>Attica,</hi> and the common people of <hi>Greece</hi>
(in its most refined age) not less barbarous then the
wild and unpolish'd <hi>Scythian,</hi> because they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
Idiotical, and lived by no other Rule then
Prescription, preferring the Customes of <hi>Greece,</hi> as
the Standard of Decency, and judging of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of things by their Correspondence with the
Manners and Fashions of their own Country, and
condemning all strange and forreign usages of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity,
because they agreed not with the Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pial
laws and customes of the Town they lived in.
But the plain and evident Reason of all this is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63493:41"/>
the Idiotical sort of Mankind are Fools, and
live below the dignity of their Natures. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Reason ought to take the upper hand of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
&amp; men that are <hi>wise</hi> &amp; <hi>considerate [i.e.</hi> those
that live as becomes men) will examine the nature
&amp; reasonableness of customs, &amp; not relie upon their
Warrantie till they are satisfied of their Goodness,
and adopt only those which they judge to be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and laudable. Opinion is the guid of Fools,
and to yield ones self up to the Government of
Custome is one of the the grossest instances of
Folly; and 'tis but a silly Apologie for fond or
vicious Practices, to plead that 'tis the Custome
of the World: For no man can tamely resigne up
the Authority of his Judgment to the power of
this little Monosyllable Tyrant (as <hi>Erasmus</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the quibling wit of his age terms <hi>Mos</hi>) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he renounce his allegiance to his Reason, &amp; live
the life of <hi>brutes</hi> that alwaies follow one another for
company. And therefore if Custome be the Empress
of the world, tis because men delight in slavery, and
abandon their Liberty to live in Chains, for if they
would continue faithful to their own faculties, and
own no other guide but their Reasons, (which
doubtlessly is the prime and fundamental duty of
mankind) they would scorn to suffer themselves to
be oppressed and imposed upon by so silly a thing
as Custom. So that if men would but live suitably
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63493:42"/>
to their Rationall Natures, the corrupted and
vicious manners of the Age and Place they live in,
could have no Influence upon their Practices; for
Custom is a thing without us, of the good or evil,
whereof we are as well able to judge, as of other
things, (for we are not Parrots, but men born with
rational Faculties) and therefore if we impotently
permit our selves to be seduced by it, we act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
the Faculties God has given us, and so
deservedly forfeit the Happiness that is due to our
Rational Nature. Here I might argue that if mens
Reasons were not able to bear them up against
the Torrent of their Countries Vices, it could be
no crime to be borne down by the violence of the
stream, but I have already prevented my self in this,
in what I have argued concerning the predominan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of our Rational Part over our lower Appetites;
for how great soever the power of Custom may
be, it cannot be more forcible then natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and 'tis much more easie to devest our selves
of superinduced habits, then to alter that which is
radicated in our Natures; and therefore if we are
able to correct the Vicious inclinations that flow
from the structure and composition of our Bodies,
we are much more able to reclaim or quit those
vicious habits, we have contracted only by casual
and accidental usages. We esteem it indeed a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
business for any man to discharge his mind from
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63493:42"/>
the prepossessions of Custom and Education be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis so rarely practised; but if we consider
the nature of the thing it self, nothing can appear
more easie and practicable; in that all men are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with rational and reflecting Faculties, and no
action costs less pains then a reflecting thought,
and nothing more obvious and palpable then the
different Natures and Consequences of Vertue
and Vice; and therefore every man that does not
choose a stupid In-advertency may with an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dilligence disabuse himself from all the false and
groundless Preconceptions of a customary Belief;
Superinduced disciplines may corrupt, but cannot
evacuate our natural Faculties, and therefore
though they may delude and inveagle our Infant
Reasons, yet when we are grown to an Age capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Rellishing morality, 'tis then as easie to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire
all absurd Customs, as it was before to be
cajol'd by them. As the Earth may steam forth
vapours gross enough to cloud the Sun, and for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
check the radiations of his light, yet the <hi>energy</hi>
of his Rays will at length vanquish, and in spite of
all their Resistance break through the thickest of
those benighting clouds, and enlighten that Globe,
which endeavour'd to darken him; And thus
though Custom, Prejudice, and Education, may
for a while cloud our Understandings, and intercept
the displays of our Reasons, yet so prevailing is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63493:43"/>
their innate Brightness and Vigour, that (unless
we our selves stifle their emanations) they will both
discover and dispel the grossest delusions.</p>
               <p>Having hitherto treated of the Forces within us,
I come now to discover our Auxiliaries without,
and to shew that as we are endued with Faculties,
by the use whereof we may attain at Virtue and
Happiness, so also that we are aided and asisted
herein by the greatest endearments and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the world, which is the next Theme I
proposed to discourse of.</p>
               <p>As Pleasure then is mans chiefest good, so Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is his highest Pleasure, the Divine Goodness
has made it our duty to be happy, all the restraints
that God has tied upon Mankind are so many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
to confine them within the compass of
their own Happiness, and whatsoever lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the lines of our liberty, lyes beyond the
limits of our content, and to transgress them is
to step into continual hazzards &amp; disquietudes. The
divine Wisdom has made the Portions of Vertue &amp;
Vice to be as distant as their Natures, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd
on the one nothing but Sorrow and Calamity
and on the other nothing but Joy and Satisfaction.
The evil effects of evil Practices are so spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and natural, that though there were no super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced
Penalties, Wickedness would be its own
Executioner. <hi>Malitia ipsa maximam partem veneni sui
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63493:43"/>
bibit;</hi> every vice exacts the Pennance of its own
folly. All Criminal Pleasures conclude in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and if men would but resolve to pursue
only <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, pleasures that expire not in
Repenting (which is all that <hi>Socrates</hi> prescribed
for the making men both vertuous and happy) we
should soon see wonderful alterations in the lives of
Men in spite of all those fatal Propensities, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which the Patrons of Preexistence make such
Tragical Declamations. Tranquility of mind and
Indolency of body, are the most natural, most easie,
and most durable pleasures in the world, these two
combined together, compose the most sovereigne
and standing delight of the life of man: And that
man that is so expert in moral Wisdom, as to be
able out of the Mass of all his transient delights, to
extract health and contentedness, is as happy as
this world can make him: And yet 'tis the very
designe of all moral Virtues, first to render us ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of this state and then to procure it. Whereas
they that intemperately indulge to their transient
delights, because they are more sensual, do but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
constant stable Pleasures for perishing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
ones, and such as conspire to create lasting
and permanent miseries. And therefore <hi>Epicurus,</hi>
who having casheir'd Providence and the Souls
Immortality, was consequently obliged to discard
all moral Goodness, yet set as high an estimate
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63493:44"/>
upon Vertue as any Philosopher of them all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he apprehended it so highly conducive to
Indolency of Body and Tranquility of Mind, in
which alone he expected his sovereign Felicity: so
big a lye is it that he placed mans supream Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
in Bruitish Pleasures.</p>
               <p>If in any respect Vertue and Religion intrench
upon the liberty of our Natures 'tis in the Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of sensuality, and yet in these there is no other
restraint laid upon us, then that we live by the
Rules and Measures of nature; and the Natural
Appetites of a Man are temperate and reasonable;
Nature desires nothing but what's useful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
and its satisfactions are as innocent as
necessary: So that whilst we follow the dictates
and appetites of humane nature, we do nothing
contrary to Vertue and Religion: But when the
Man is divided from the Beast, and his Reason se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the inferior and Bruitish Appetites,
then arise irregular and unreasonable desires, but
these proceed meerly from the bruitish part, and
are preter-natural and violent to the man: so
that till we abandon Reason and the better part of
our selves, Lust is a violence to our Natures and
so far from gratifying our natural Propensities,
that 'tis their greatest contradiction. But if we
should suppose that Vertue consisted in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Violence to all our Appetites and Inclinations,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63493:44"/>
yet its future reward being so great and glorious,
there is no advised and reflecting man, but would
exchange a short satisfaction of his present desires,
for the hopes and assurance of Infinite felicities
hereafter. It must be a strange piece of Folly and
Indiscretion to prefer the enjoyment of a short,
cheap, imperfect delight, before the hopes of the
Joyes of Heaven and Eternity: For sensual gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
are so low &amp; unsatisfying that to want them
can amount but to an inconsiderable miserie,
whereas the future pleasures that entertain our
hopes are as great as endless; and therefore to miss
them must needs be the saddest disaster man can
suffer. So that though I should grant the object of
our hopes to be inevident &amp; uncertain, yet any man,
that acts beyond the Indiscretion of a Child, will
rather choose to foregoe the present Enjoyment
of cheap and little pleasures, then the probable
hopes of the greatest and most satisfying Felicities:
For the naked hope and expectation of so great a
Blessedness, is more pregnant with present content
and satisfaction to the mind of man, then the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of the highest and most exquisite delights
of sense. But when the waies of Virtue are so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
reasonable, and advantageous in themselves,
as though they procure, yet they need not promise
the Blessings of another world, and yet are so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared
to us by their inesteemable appendant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63493:45"/>
as to make them delightful, though they
were unpleasant in themselves, then certainly are
they recommended to our choice by the strongest
motives and allurements that can work upon a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motional
Nature. Though the Prosecution of this
Argument be as pleasant as 'tis copious, yet (beside
that I have not now leasure to pursue it through all
its particular instances) the <hi>Pulpit</hi> has of late afforded
enough excellent discourses upon this <hi>Theme,</hi> to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percede
the necessity of any farther Performance of
it. But if you desire to see it discoursed of in a more
Philosophick way, I refer you to <hi>Tully</hi>'s Books <hi>de
Finibus,</hi> where 'tis as Rationally as Largely asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Torquatus</hi> the Epicurean. And now, If Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature be endued with Rational and refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
Faculties, if it be most natural and easie for
these Faculties to choose and pursue those objects
that are most agreeable to their own Natures, and
most conducive to Humane Felicity; If Vertue
be most natural, easie, and reasonable; if it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear'd
to us by present and future delights; If
vice be contrary to the Nature, Interest, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of men; if men have all the inducements and
Persuasions in the World to pursue Virtue and
Goodness, and as great discouragements to scare
and deter them from the Prosecution of Vice and
Impietie; if I say these things are so, then I appeal
to all Mankind whether the Divine Providence can
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63493:45"/>
be justly charged for leaving them too obnoxious
to sin and misery. But I easily foresee that you
will enquire, if all men have such pregnant engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Vertue, what is the Reason of the almost
unanimous viciousness of mankind, and that when
they have all the Reason in the world to engage
them in an indefatigable pursuit of Goodness?
whence comes it to pass, that they should with so
much eagerness thwart both their Reason &amp; their
Interests for the love of Vice and Wickedness. I
answer, that though sensual Inclinations, false Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
vicious Examples, and wicked Customes,
may be inducements and occasions of it, yet the
only proper cause is the wilful or stupid Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
of men. Inconsiderateness is that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as
the <hi>Rabins</hi> speak) the <hi>root</hi> whence all mischiefs grow:
'tis the spring &amp; head of that torrent of wickedness,
that has always overflown the greatest part of the
world. For if men would but look to the end of all
criminal Pleasures, they would easily discover in
them much more to avert, then to entice and court
their Passions; but when their Appetites are pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately
set upon them, they grow wild and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient,
and will enjoy though they know tis death
and misery they embrace. That no man miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
but by bruitishness and inconsideration, I might
demonstrate out of my precedent discourse; for if
every man be endued with Rational faculties; if he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63493:46"/>
can reflect upon the Essential differences of good
and evil, together with their natural Products; if
he can observe what things tend to his dammage,
and what minister to his advantage; And if it be
most apparent that vertuous Practices are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more conducive to the interests and happiness of
man then Vice and Luxury; then what other
Reason can possibly be assigned, why men are so
unanimously vicious, but only because they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
or carelesly unreasonable? But I need not
put my self to the Charge of an Elaborate Dispute
to prove a thing that is evidenced by the surest and
most obvious of Demonstrations, <hi>viz.</hi> an Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of particular Instances. For if we consider the
single Obliquities of every Individual man, 'tis not
only easie to observe how they descended from care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness
and inadvertency, but also to convince the
man himself, that had he but reflected upon the
natural results and events of his Criminal actions,
he would never have committed them: Take the
pevishest Humorist in his hottest and most trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
fits, and ask him whether it was not in his
own power to have refrain'd the folly of his Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
I never yet met with any person so unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
whom I could not at lenghth force to own
them as avoidable Indiscretions; but if any person
should be so cross-grain'd as to plead a brutish ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
it were very easie by laying afore him the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63493:46"/>
circumstances, upon which his Anger kindled, to
convince him that the Provocation was not irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
How few are so wise as to avoid a fruitless greif
and anxiety for past, and therefore not avoidable
disasters? And yet what proposition in <hi>Euclid</hi> more
pregnant with conviction then this, that 'tis the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdest
folly in the world to greive for losses and
misfortunes; in that nothing can be more evidently
irrational, then by labouring in matters gone and
irrecoverable; to double our miseries to no purpose?
And what Councel can be more unquestionably ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
then the Advice of the Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> about
Mourning for Deceased Freinds. <hi>Take no greif to
heart, for there is no turning again: thou shalt not do
him good, but hurt thy self,</hi> Eccles. 38. 17. And
yet all men are so foolishly inconsiderate, as upon
such contingencies, to afflict themselves with a
greif equally fruitless and troublesome. What
Vice assaults us with more peremptory and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Temptations then Intemperance, yet any
man that will be but at the pains of a Thought, to
represent to himself its unpleasant and direful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
cannot but confess, that its invitations
are so far from being irresistible, that no man can
comply with them without the imputation of the
most apparent Madness and Folly. For who but
Mad-men can be enamour'd of Gouts, Dropsies,
Catarrhs, Consumptions, broken Sleeps, restless
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63493:47"/>
Nights, loathing Stomacks, and every thing that
is destructive of health or life? And that these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
Symptomes are the natural Appendages of
Intemperance, both Philosophy and Experience
assure us. Whereas Temperance is a healthful
and delicious Vertue, moderate diet creates no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition
either to the Body or the Mind; the
Temperate man rises from the Table light and
chearful, and truly relishes the pleasures that the
Epicure designs; But Luxury, as it adds nothing
to the pleasures of Temperance, so it both afflicts
us with a present dulness, by loading the Brain
with crudities, and lays up materials for future di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
by loading the blood with raw and indigested
humours. Though I am not so Stoically vaine,
as to vye Power and Majesty with Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
yet sure am I that all the sumptuous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments
of Pallaces, afford not such exquisite
dainties as are serv'd up by Temperance; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
satiety makes us loath the most refined deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,
whilst hunger prepares such sawces, as <hi>Api<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
with all his witty Gluttony, could never tast of;
and therefore <hi>Epicurus</hi> (that great Exemplar of a
Philosophick Temperance) was wont to say, that
give him but Hunger, Pulse, and Water, and he
would vye delicates with <hi>Iove</hi> himself. Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
if men would but represent to themselves
the troublesome Appendages of intemperate eating
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63493:47"/>
and drinking; no morsel could appear so delicious,
or wine so pleasant, which they could not with
much less trouble forbear, then suffer all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
symptoms of a tired and overloaded Appetite.
And although this is obvious from every days ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
to every mans observation, yet how few
are they, that can stint their Appetites at the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of Nature, though they are certain that all
they devour beyond the satisfaction thereof, ends
in surfet and oppression, only because most men are
so bruitishly sottish, as to sacrifice all the contents
of their lives to a moments tickling of their Palates,
and like Beasts, grow wild and impatient to enjoy a
trifling pleasure, which they know will expire in
loathing and restlesness.</p>
               <p>The Mass and Community of Mankind, is but an
Aggregate of Individual men, of whom the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and mechanical sort of people (a word of a
vast extent) are incomparably the greater number;
who yet are utterly senseless and inconsiderate, and
suffer themselves to be disposed of purely by chance
and accidental Principles, and are so prodigiously
regardless, that they will not put themselves to the
trouble of thinking, whether the usages Custome
has taught them, are wise and rational. And hence
it is that they are always floating between contrary
Vices, and are not a less contradiction to themselves
then to Vertue; one while they are base and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63493:48"/>
another proud and insolent; now stubborn
and refractory, anon inconstant and changeable;
envious and malicious, yet sordid and senseless to
honour; credulous and talkative, yet morose and
sullen; ignorant and stupid, yet censorious and
scornful; Idolaters of custome, yet Seditious and
desirous of novelties: and hence as they chance to
be swayed by custome, or any accidental emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
they rowl to any extream without setting <hi>bounds</hi>
to their unruly progress; and if they be suffered to
run without restraint, they will break down all the
banks of Law &amp; Government; and therefore tis the
main wisdom and policy of Governors (who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by <hi>Divine Providence</hi> to understand and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for them) to check the violence of the Tide, by
swaying them <hi>backwards</hi> by contrary <hi>laws,</hi> &amp; to keep
them fluctuating between both Extreams, &amp; so by
alternate Fluxes &amp; Refluxes, to preserve the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
from popular Inundations. Thus
they must be kept from sinking into too much ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
or rising to too much knowledge in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of—for the former renders them salvage,
which is apparently destructive to Government;
the latter makes them proud, conceited, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
that breeds contempt of Governours, and sets
them upon headless plots and designs of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that usually proceed to Rebellion, and end in
a deluge of civil Wars, as the experience of all ages
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63493:48"/>
sufficiently attests, and our own too sadly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.
But the Reason of all this, and much
more, is because they are unreasonably wilful and
inconsiderate, for nothing but inadvertency distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
them from the wise and understanding part
of mankind. To conclude therefore, if a sottish
and regardless stupidity be the proper cause of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
single obliquity (of which every man will be
satisfied, that shall consider of every actions parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
circumstances) 'tis evident by a very easie In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
that all the wickedness in the world must
be its effect: For the cause of every Individual,
and the whole species is the same, and therefore
if every particular sin be the effect of Inadvertency,
all sin must be its issue.</p>
               <p>Of which the wisest and most experienced of
men, was long since eminently sensible, whence it
was that he has so earnestly recommended to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
consideration and advertency, for the wisdom,
he parabolically represents in his Book of Proverbs,
imports nothing but consideration, discretion, and
weighing of things in opposition to that folly and
stupidity which betrays men to those immoralities,
from which he there so assiduously dehorts the sons
of men. And that this is the only true and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
sense of that Book, any one that shall but read
it over with a mind clear of those rash and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
glosses Commentators have fastned upon
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63493:49"/>
it, will easily acknowledge, both by the Tenour of
the discourse, and by the original signification of
those terms, by which he expresses the wisdom there
Celebrated; and cheifly by those peculiar Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he attributes to it, many whereof can very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be applied to any thing else. And now, if folly
and inconsiderateness be the Origine of the general
and unanimous Apostacy of mankind, then judge
whether their crime be not of all others (not excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
even Peevishness and moroseness themselves)
the hainousest and most inexcusable, for beside that
'tis aggravated by all the circumstances that can
enhance its guilt, nothing can be baser and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of a man; for if the dignity of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
consists in Reason, then certainly nothing can
be more bruitish and unmanly then to abandon its
use, and thereby to disrobe our selves of our highest
Prerogative, to renounce the Glory and Priviledge
of our Natures, and in difiance of our Creatours
Goodness, who made us Men, to prefer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Bruits and unreasonable Creatures, and
in a word to dismount our Reasons, that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
has placed in the Sadle, that the Bruit might
Ride the Man.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>(Sir)</hi> have I replyed to, and clear'd off, the
main Ratiocinations urged on behalf off Preexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
and have not declined or shuffled of any
Argument for its difficultie, but have been careful
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63493:49"/>
that the Account I have given you might be as
faithful as satisfactory: If therefore I have omitted
any objections, 'twas not because I could not, but
because I need not answer them, either upon the
score of their being too inconsiderable, or of their
entire dependance on the Arguings, I have here
encountred; and therefore having undermined and
ruin'd their Foundation, I suppose it would be but
a fruitless and impertinent piece of service to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leager
them by a particular onset. I have <hi>(Sir)</hi> so
strong an antipathy against all Impertinency, that
in all enquiries I have the patience only to examine
the most weighty and considerable reflections, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which the less concerning matters will as little
want as merit Consideration, and therefore I have
not only waved all their pretty gay Probabilities,
apprehending them subjects too frivolous for seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and rational discourses; but have also forborne
all Duels or Personal Combats, having all along
only opposed the Hypothesis, not its Patrons; for
I have taken no notice of the particular miscarriages
of any Adversary, and have no where objected the
Inconsistency either of any Author with himself, or
of more of them with one another, unless where it
is apparently the fault of the Hypothesis, and not
the oversight of the Men. For I must confess <hi>(Sir)</hi>
I am so far from quarrelling either with the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
or Modern Patrons of Preexistence, that I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63493:50"/>
esteem and honour them as Persons more
then ordinarily Learned and Ingenious; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though I might perhaps have triumphed over
some weak passages of particular Authors, yet I
have scarce been less careful to pass by their weakest
then I have been to assault their strongest objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The most remarkable things I have purposely
omitted are those conclusions they draw from the
Nature and Substance of the Soul, all which I
have slighted, because we are so utterly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the nature of the Soul that 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to deduce any sure &amp; solid Speculations from
it: 'Tis I know as easie a business to imagine Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheses
concerning things, whose natures are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
beyond the Reach of Humane Inquisition, as
'tis for the <hi>Rosi-Crucians</hi> (for the confirmation of
their Frenzies) to tell us of strange Books, Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Inscriptions found in the inmost and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
parts of <hi>China, Iapan,</hi> and <hi>Tartarie,</hi> because in
such stories they are secure from all Contradiction:
But the difficultie is to give us evidence of the
Truth and realitie of their Conjectures; For when
they have contrived and polish'd a neat and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Idea of the Soul, how can they assure either
me or themselves of its agreement with the thing
it self? And therefore of them that pretend to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the world with true and real notions of its
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63493:50"/>
Nature, I demand by what means or methods they
attain'd their knowledge; for if they came by it in
a Rational way, they are able to shew by what
steps and Ratiocinations they arrived at it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this they have never performed, they must
give us leave to look upon their Hypotheses as the
meer Issues and contrivances of their own Fancies.
'Tis not therefore enough to coyn Ideas of the
Soul, and stamp it, with what essential Characters
and Properties they please, unless they can assure us
of their real Conformity to the thing it self (it being
otherwise precarious and uncertain) but as no such
assurancew as as yet ever given, so when I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the waies and methods of gaining acquaintance
with the Natures of things, I despaire that it ever
will: For though I may by Rationacination obtain
a clear and certain evidence of the Real Existence
of many things, of the Essential Ideas whereof I am
utterly ignorant, yet am I assured by diligent and
impartial Trials, that all the Objects and Ideas
I could ever with all my Industry understand were
conveyed to my mind through the Organs of sense.
But whether any certain knowledge of the
Nature and Substance of the Soul be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
or not, I am sure 'tis as yet undiscover'd, and
so altogether unqualified to be the Ground of any
true and certain Knowledge, in that where the first
and Fundamental Principles are inevident, all the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63493:51"/>
Ratiocinations depending on them (how coherent
soever in themselves) must of necessity be so too.
And therefore, for Instance, when they conclude
against the seminal Propagation of Souls, because
'tis one of the prime and cheifest Properties of a
Spiritual essence to be indiscerpible, they argue at
a high rate of confidence and impertinency, because,
though perhaps the soul may be indivisible, yet they
are not able to produce the least tollerable Evidence
thereof, being utterly unacquainted with its Nature
and Essence; and then though perchance it may be
indiscerpible in its primary and central substance,
yet who knows but it may, as well as the Body,
have its seminal Excrescencies? I am not more
concern'd for the Hypothesis of seminal Tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
then for the other of Immediate Creation,
for they are both to me equally uncertain, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
indifferent. For as the only material obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
they assault the former with, is that ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
one I but now mention'd, so they object no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
singly against the latter, but its inconsistency
with the Divine Goodness to place pure and spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
souls in such evil and sad Circumstances, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron
us in this life; but this objection as it equally
concerns all the Adversaries of Preexistence, what
other soever particular Hypothesis they adopt, so
'tis already abundantly answered. So that 'tis not
at all material whether the reality of either or nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63493:51"/>
of the forementioned Hypotheses be sure or
evident, for notwithstanding all that is objected
either of them may, and therefore 'tis of no
concernment which is.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>(Sir)</hi> though both my Patience and
my Pen begin to fail me, yet am I obliged as well
by my Promise as my Method, to consider the
most plausible passages of Scripture the Patrons
of Preexistence alledge on behalf of their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis;
but the application of the Texts, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to their designe, is so lamentably forced &amp; fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous,
that it will scarce excuse a serious answer
from being useless and impertiment. I know not any
one Theological speculation, that cannot boast of
more Favour and Countenance from Scripture,
then this pretends to. And if you will but parallel
the periods of Scripture made use of, in a small
Pamphlet you have, to prove <hi>Mulieres non esse
Homines,</hi> I am confident you will discern so
vast a disproportion in their evidence, as to
acknowledge that if the latter may be accounted
probable inducements, the former will amount to
Demonstrations. And therefore perhaps I may
render my self not less ridiculous by encountring
them with a serious Reply, then that grave Dutch
Doctor, who has with mighty transports of zeal
opposed himself to that waggish Pamphlet, and has
conjured up all his Dutch or Systematick Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63493:52"/>
to confound that blasphemous Heresy as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
stiles it. But having begun, I must to avoid all
suspicion of shufling, plunge through; And though
their Scipture-evidences do not merit a refutation,
yet through some mens Ignorance and others Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
they need it. Had I been left to my own
choice, I should not have at all concern'd the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Divine Oracles in this dispute. For
so sensible am I of that violence and injury they
suffer from our presumptuous forcing them to be
parties in our own trivial and imaginary speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that I am exceedingly averse from making any
use of their suffrage, unless it be in matters of grand
importance, and with all very evident and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to its main intendment. 'Tis the fashion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Opinionists to Argue in a reversed order,
first they contrive Opinions and then Arguments,
they adopt Hypotheses, and then suborn Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
out of the sacred Volume to vouch them:
like <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> who (as <hi>Laertius</hi> records) was wont
to say, that he only wanted opinions to vent, but
would never want Arguments to defend his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And thus the Assertors of Preexistence seem
first to be enamoured with the Prettiness of their
Hypothesis, and then to seek our for Scripture
expressions to countenance it. For all the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
they alledge would never have afforded the
least intimation of it, had it not first prepossest their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63493:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fancies: Of which some of them are so sensible as
to confess, that though they do not perswade their
Hypothesis, yet they are applicable to it. But I
wish they could name any opinion, howsoever vain
and unwarrantable, that cannot boast as much;
what's more easie then for Fancie to make pretty
applications of Scripture to purposes vastly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from its own, especially if we consider how
large and miscellaneous a composure the Holy Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
is? They who are acquainted with the
Customes and Tenets of the Modern Jews, know
what pretty Analogies they fetch from Scripture
to abet their fond and ridiculous usages, indeed their
prettiness is so odd and surprising, that were it in
any other matter, they would be as delightful as
impertiment.</p>
               <p>But tis time to advance to a closer and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
engagement, the few hours that remain obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
me to a quick and (I fear) overhasty dispatch:
but before I clear off the Texts they object, I will
represent a passage or two on my own behalf. And
first methinks that's a shrew'd one <hi>Rom. 9. 11. For
the Children being not yet born, neither having done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good or evil, that the purpose of God according to
election might stand, not of works but of him that calleth.</hi>
They that were not in a Capacity of doing either
good or evil before they were born, neither existed
nor sin'd before; But neither <hi>Iacob</hi> nor <hi>Esau</hi> were
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63493:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in a capacity of acting well or ill, before they were
born into this life, and therefore nor they, nor (by
consequence) any others preexisted. For (1.) 'tis
too pittiful a shift to say that all other men, <hi>Iacob</hi>
and <hi>Esau</hi> only excepted, were in Being before their
Appearance upon this stage of life. And (2.) 'tis
most expresly against the whole designe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
Argument; the Purpose of whose Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse
is to shew that Gods vouchsafing greater
Instances of his Favour to <hi>Iacob</hi> then to <hi>Esau</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not from any extrinsique motive of greater
merit in him, but purely from the free deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
and beneplaciture of his own will,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Now this he proves
because the Choice was pitch'd upon before they
were born, and so before they had done either good
or evil. But if the souls of men had been in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of acting morally, before their descent into
this life, then has the Apostle argued at a strange
rate of inconsequence, when he concludes that
Gods different dealing with <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not on their own Actions, because the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
was resolved on before they were born, and
consequently before they had done good or evil. If
therefore the Apostles conclusion be consonant to
the Laws of Inference, it must be unquestionably
certain that the Souls of men never acted before
they were born into these Bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:63493:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
There are a brace of Texts more, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
would, without any torturing, give in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
against Preexistence, but I find that its Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
have already suborn'd them to speak in their
Cause, and therefore I that am a modest man
must be content to give up my Right in their
Testimony, and to Encounter them as objections.
The first is our Saviours reply to his Disciples
enquiry about the man born blind, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 3. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
has this man sin'd nor his Parents, but that the
works of God should be made manifest in him. In
which words he expresly affirms, that that mishap
was not inflicted upon the man as a Penalty for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
miscarriages he had been guilty of in any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
state, but that it was design'd by the Divine
Providence upon a special score, namely, that he
might be a fit object to evidence our Saviours mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Power. And yet from this very passage
they argue with no small confidence against us, in
that the question supposes the man might have sin'd
before his Terrestrial Birth, and that the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis
of Preexistence was an Opinion much in Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
among the Jews, and therefore when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
had so fair an occasion of rectifying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
belief, and yet said nothing against it, his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
is almost as argumentative in favour of it as
a positive Approbation. I answer (1.) 'tis far from
being evident that the Disciples question supposes
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63493:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him capable of sinning before his birth: for might
they not, if they had any notions of the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
suppose that God foreknowing what kind
of person this blind man would prove, had ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
his punishment. Or why might they not
intend his Original sin, which the Jews supposed
to be the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in every individual man; so that
when they enquired whether the man was born
blind for his own or his Parents sin, they might on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ask whether that particular Judgment was the
effect of any miscarriage in his Parents, or of his
own original Pravity. (2.) It was not the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence,
but the Metemphychosis or Transmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Souls that was the common Opinion of
the Jews; 'tis stiled by the <hi>Rabins</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
of Souls</hi> in opposition to their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Revolution of the Dead,</hi> whereby they meant the
Rowling of the Carcasses of Jewes, (that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be Interred in the polluted Earth of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles)
through the secret Caverns of the Earth to
<hi>Palestine,</hi> where they believe all Jews shall arise at
the last Resurrection; and hence some of them
have in their old age travelled to the Holy Land to
lay their Bones there, to avoid the disturbance of
their Subterraneous Pilgrimage; and <hi>R. Salomon</hi>
tells us the Reason why <hi>Iacob</hi> charg'd his Son <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
to conveigh his Corps from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi>
was partly that his dust might not afterwards be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63493:54"/>
turn'd into Lice, (a cleanly old man!) and partly
to escape the trouble of this posthumous Journey:
But their impertinencies tempt me to be so too.
Now that the opinion of Transanimation obtain'd
among the Jews, is proved from the testimony of
<hi>Iosephus lib. 2. de Bello Iud. cap.</hi> 7. where he relates
among the dogmata of the Pharisees, that the souls
of good men did not perish, but did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
and <hi>Tisbi</hi> relates that 'tis the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Circumcised Doctors that every Soul
animates three Bodies, which they (after their usual
rare of arguing) prove from that passage in <hi>Iob. 33. 29.
All these things God worketh with man,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>tribus vicibus.</hi> And by vertue of this Vicissitude,
they assert the Soul of <hi>Adam</hi> to have inform'd the
Body of King <hi>David,</hi> and that the Soul of <hi>David</hi>
will by secret Revolutions, wind it selfe into the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> which they think is clearly intimated by
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> being compounded of the Initial Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Adam <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, David</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Messiah</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. As also that
those two mighty zealots <hi>Phinees</hi> &amp; <hi>Elias,</hi> were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
with the <hi>same</hi> spirit because of the <hi>resemblance</hi>
of their Zeal; and that <hi>Labans</hi> Soul was translated
into <hi>Balaams, Abels</hi> into <hi>Seth;</hi> and <hi>Abravanel</hi> that
bold Jew asserts, that it was <hi>Esau</hi>'s Soul that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
our Saviour. <hi>Manasse Ben Israel</hi> cites several
of their old Books and Authors to this purpose.
And therefore, if this passage proves any thing, it
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63493:55"/>
proves too much, <hi>viz.</hi> not onely the Preexistence,
but also the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or perpetual revolution of
Souls: For if they can infer any thing in favour
of Preexistence from our Saviours silence in so apt
an occasion to have rectified the common Errour
concerning it, they may with the same reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
his Approbation of the Transmigration of
Souls, this being the common Opinion of the Jews,
and so as probably implyed in the Disciples Quere.
(3.) It was not our Saviours custom to take notice
of every impertinent Question, much less the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
on which they relyed. Thus when his
Apostles asked him, <hi>Acts 1. 6. Lord wilt thou at this
time restore again the Kingdom to Israel.</hi> Though it
was an important Question, and bottom'd upon a
grand and dangerous mistake, he makes no reply to
it, but only takes occasion thence to discourse of
matters of a widely distant nature, but that more
closely toucht their concerns. And therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be fairly inferred from our Saviours si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
especially when he had replyed so fully to
the direct scope of the Question, there was not
any necessity he should take notice of the Theories
it collaterally implied: And if the Hypothesis of
Preexistence were so principally implied in the
main scope of the question as is pretended, then is
it expresly enough destroyed by our Saviours plain
and unlimited Negation. To conclude, he had as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63493:55"/>
good ground to take occasion from their Enquiry,
to discourse of the Equity of punishing Posterity
for their Ancestors sins, it being one of the main
Phaenomena of Providence, and of as grand impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
as they can presume the Hypothesis of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence
to be, and yet, notwithstanding the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the opportunity, and the weightiness of the
subject, 'tis evident he took no notice of it. The
other Resembling Passage I meet with in <hi>Iob</hi> 38. 4.
where the Almighty undertakes to pose <hi>Iob</hi> through
all the Phaenomena of Nature, and among other
particulars of the true Origine of things, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him of his ignorance, he tells him he was so
far from being acquainted with it, that he was then
shut up in the dark state of Non-existence, <hi>Where
wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth,</hi> &amp;c.
Now, if all Spirits had been in Being when the
foundations of the Earth were laid, as our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
conclude from the ensuing words, <hi>When the
morning Stars sang together, and all the Sonnes of God
shouted for Ioy.</hi> By the former whereof (say they)
is intended the Angels, by the latter the blessed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
Souls. But if this gloss were as true as 'tis
precarious, then <hi>Iob</hi> might have justly replied to the
Almighty, that himself was present among the Sons
of God at the laying the Foundations of the earth,
and joyn'd in that great and unanimous Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63493:56"/>
And then the Almighty having discoursed of
each particular mystery and contrivance of Nature,
he concludes with this bafling Ironie, <hi>Knowest thou
them because thou wast then born, because the number of
thy days is great?</hi> And yet they conclude from
hence for Preexistence, because the 70 render it
without the Interrogation, <hi>I know that thou wast then
born, for the number of thy days is many.</hi> A various
Reading may serve for a subterfuge to escape the
force of an objected Testimony, but certainly 'tis
a pitiful Argument that relies barely on the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a Version, when it not only contradicts the
Original, but the plain design of its own Context.
For if <hi>Iob</hi> had then been born, how could God
have convinced him of his unacquaintedness with
the Origine of things, because he was not then in
Being? so that unless Reason it self be out in its
Logick, our Adversaries are.</p>
               <p>Having thus gain'd back these Texts to our side,
I pass on to the rest of their objections. And first,
as for that pasage <hi>Ier.</hi> 1. 5. urged with so much
Jewish confidence by <hi>Manasse Ben Israel, Before I
form'd thee in the Belly, I knew thee; and before thou
camest forth out of the Womb I sanctified thee, and I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
thee a Prophet unto the Nations.</hi> It implies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but Gods designment of <hi>Ieremy</hi> to the
Prophetick Office; for his knowing of him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63493:56"/>
in its native and most unstrained sense, meerly
his foreordaining him to that employment, and then
his sanctifying of him signifies in its genuine and
most proper use, only the separating or devoting of
him to that peculiar Office, which is exegetically
expressed in the last branch of the Period. <hi>I ordained
thee to be a Prophet.</hi> Besides, this passage is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
applied to the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> in opposition
to any other, but should it have referred to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence,
there had been no peculiarity, forasmuch
as God would not only have known him, but the
whole Mass of mankind before they were formed in
the Belly. And now what shadow of favour do
these words cast upon the Origenian Hypothesis,
No man could ever have discern'd the least colour
for Preexistence here, whose mind was not afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
tinctured with its belief. Here's not the least
foundation for an Argument, unless this supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were first laid, <hi>viz.</hi> That God cannot fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordain
a Person to any special employment before
he exists. And therefore to conclude, that because
God had consign'd <hi>Ieremy</hi> to the Prophetick Office
before he was born, that therefore he preexisted, is
an Inference fit for none but a <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and upon that
score I have taken notice of it only as his, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men have urged it with as great a grace as he.</p>
               <p>And for that passage, <hi>Phil. 2. 5. Let this mind be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63493:57"/>
in you which was in Christ Iesus, who being in the form
of God, did not think equality with God a prey or spoil,
but made himself of no Reputation, and took upon him the
form of a Servant, and was made in the likeness of
men,</hi> &amp;c. Its plain and palpable meaning is onely
this, That though the Blessed Jesus was invested
with the Divine Power and Authority, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd
the person of a Deity, being made Sovereign
Lord of all (in which alone consists the Scripture
notion of God) yet he did not boast and triumph
in his Greatness, but made his appearance to the
world only in a servile condition of Poverty, and
made himself so subject to those that seem'd his
Superiours, that in obedience to their Authority
he yielded himself up to a most reproachful death,
not opposing his Almighty and Irresistible Power
to rescue himself from their equally ignominious
and merciless Decrees. And what's all this to
Preexistence?</p>
               <p>In the next place they urge us with some passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
out of Saint <hi>Iohn, And now O Father Glorifie me
with thine own self, with the Glory I had with thee before
the world was. I come forth from the Father, and
am come into the world: Again I leave the world, and
goe to the Father, &amp;c.</hi> Whence they argue, that
the Glory our Saviour prays to be restored to,
seems to concern his Humane nature only, for the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63493:57"/>
Divine could never be disrobed of it, and therefore
it supposeth that he existed in his Humanitie
before, and that his Soul was of old before its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
in a Terrestriall Body. <hi>Ans.</hi> (1.) The
most these places can pretend to prove, is barely
our Saviours Preexistence, but to conclude thence
the Preexistence of all mankind is a very wide
and gaping Inference; and we may as well prove we
were all born of Virgin-Mothers because he was.
Our Saviour was a singular person designed for an
extraordinary Employment, and therefore may be
supposed to have transacted with his Father about
it, before he undertook it, and therefore we may
as well Attribute all his personal Properties to
Mankind in general, as argue for their Preexistence
from his. (2.) Those Praedicates that in a strict
and rigorous Acceptation agreed only to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, might by a communication of Idioms
[as they phrase it] be attributed to his humane;
or at least to the whole Person compounded of
them both: Then which nothing is more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
in things of a mixt and heterogeneous Nature,
as the whole man is stiled immortal from the
deathlesness of his soul. We ought not therefore
to understand these and the like passages in a nice
and metaphisical rigour of this or that nature, but
in a familiar sence of the Person of Jesus Christ.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63493:58"/>
The instances hereof in Scripture are so frequent,
that few texts concerning our Saviour (supposing
his double nature can well be understood without
it. (3.) Methinks <hi>Grotius</hi>'s sence is very easie and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<hi>viz.</hi> that the Glory he had with his Father
before the world began, was only in the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Divine decree: as, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 20. Revel.</hi>
13. 8. he is said to be a <hi>Lamb slain from the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the world,</hi> not that he was really slaughtered,
but because he was then marked out in the divine
decree to be a sacrifice for Mankind. It being a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial
from of speech among the Jews, to express
matters of great moment only resolved upon in the
Divine Decree, as if they were really existing: thus
they say the <hi>Messias</hi> is ancienter then the Sun, and
the <hi>Mosaick law</hi> older then the world, not as if they
apprehended them <hi>really</hi> so, but only to express their
absolute usefulness and necessity. Now Scriptures
are not to be interpreted in an exact and strictly
literal sence, but in a familiar manner suitably to
the Idiom and manner of speaking used in the Age
and Place, in which they were written. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being a vulgar form of speech to express the
Important usefulness of a thing existing only in
decree, as if it had been as long in actual existence,
as it was in Futurity; the glory our Saviour here
prays for, and which he had before the world was,

as it could not, so it need not be his essential lustre,
but was that honour, with which God had from
all eternity design'd to dignisie the Messias. Thus
have I satisfied all their Scripture Objections, that
can need an answer, but as for their Applications
of Parables and Cabalistical interpretations, they
are too impertinent to bear one.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>(Sir)</hi> having evinced the Precarious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Origenian Hypothesis from the Nature
of the thing it self, and its uncouthness from some
of the Divine Attributes, having shewn the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and lamentable defiency of that evidence
they produce for it, having engaged the suffrage of
the Divine Oracles against it, and having given a
hansome, rational and certain account of the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomina
of <hi>providence</hi> without it. I hope 'tis sufficient
to convince your self or any other ingenious and
unpossest inquirer, that for any thing we are able to
know, this is the first Stage upon which the Souls
of men ever appeared and that there is no need of
recurring to a former scene, to solve the perplexed
difficulties of Providence, and to make the plot
thereof seem neat and consistent enough to be a
contrivance not unworthy the Divine Wisdome.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Sir</hi> methinks I ought not bluntly to
conclude this tedious Discourse, and it would be
but good manners to complement you with unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63493:59"/>
excuses, or some other little pieces of
Court-ship; but you know I have long since re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
to these common ceremonies of the
world. And though I had a mind to trouble you
with Apologies, or News, or anyother impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
yet I have not time (being just now upon the
very point of my departure for <hi>London</hi>) to add any
more, then that I am as much as I ought or
