            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

M. D. LXI. wherein we are nowe, the thirde after the feaſt of the birth of Chriſt, that is on childermas day: there appeared ouer our citie and all the borders of Swicerlande, two houres afore day the aire beyng clear a very red fyre, in maner whole toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that white furrowes or ſtra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes came betwene, and it ſtretched out longe and brode almoſt a furlong brode, although in another place it ſe med narower, but in lengthe three or foure times ſo muche.

               </gap>ye, by litle and litle it vaniſhed out of ſight being firſt gathered together at San gallie in maner of a great tower. By this ye may eaſly coniecture that this fyre was on the higher parte of the aire, becauſe it was ſene ſo far of, and almoſt folowed the mouinge of the aire, &amp; yet not on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> higheſt aire y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there like vnto the comets or blaſing ſtarres might be kindeled by the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire.

                  <item>2 The bredeth and bignes of it was notable, through which it was ſene euery where long and brode, and as it were euery where nere hand, wher of we diuine and pronunce a greate euyll to folowe, and that not to one region alone, and therin al men to be perplered and doutfull, to what place they maye chiefely goe, and where they may reſiſt the ragyng fyre.</item>

            <p>Aboute the ſame tyme, the maner of a longe hiſtorye was ſene in the cloudes: whiche afterwarde was ſet furth in a picture, drawen out and pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bliſhed at Belgicke, in thys maner hereafter folowyng.</p>
            <p>There appeared an armed man on horſebacke wyth a ſpeare charged in his hande, and readye for to runne a courſe. And beſydes thys, was ſene the lykeneſſe of the Emperour Char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les the fyfth, with a crowne vpon his heade: and neare vnto it a hogges ſnoute, ſomwhat hygher there was ſene two Lyons rampynge and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping agaynſt thre other Lions: and a lytle beneth them, two great Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons ſpuyng out flames of fyre.</p>
            <p>And after thys was ſene great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of men of warre, aſwell by ſea as by lande, and euerye where was
<pb facs="tcp:10675:25"/>
cruell burning of townes and caſtels and villages. And ther was alſo ſene in the ayre a Pecocke wythout feete hauyng no wynges: and neare vnto hym there was a Dragon. Alſo in the ſame place was an Egle hauyng the greateſt parte of hym hyd behynde a banke: and aboute the banke was a lytle Egle. Lykewiſe was ſene a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on crowned lying on hys backe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Cocke dyd ſtrycke on the throte. After this there were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many and diuers beaſtes, wyth horrible formes and ſhapes: and all monſterous beaſts, except the wylde Vnicorne which the Grekes doe call <hi>Monoceros</hi> and a verye fayre and great huge Elephant. By and by another armye of men appeared agayne bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng and deſtroying: and a Cocke defendyng hym ſelfe agaynſt a Lyon whoſe head was ſemed to be cut of.</p>
            <p>And laſte of all, there was ſene a great lake, in the whych were drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (as they doe declare) townes, and great Churches, theyr ſteples beyng ſene to appeare aboue the water: and a Camell was ſene alone vpon the
<pb facs="tcp:10675:25"/>
bancke, with his head in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lake dryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge. Wonderfull many flamyng Dragons were ſene, breathynge out flames of fyre and much venym eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where.</p>
            <p>Vnto me truly theſe thynges ſeme not vnpoſſible to chaunce, ſpecially and chiefly to thoſe people whyche doe trouble and moleſt the worlde in this oure age, with great vexations and ſore afflictions.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, it is declared vnto vs, that thys yere there are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye monſterous byrthes, bothe of mankynde, and alſo of many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other kyndes of beaſtes.</p>
            <p>Amonge the which, was the notable great Monkecalfe (that is a calle like a Monke) and before hym an Aſſe, a man, and a fiſhe, of mixed formes and diuers ſhapes. And after that there came furth another monſter whiche was a fyſhe lyke a Monke.</p>
            <p>For in the bowels of the man was founde iron (as we haue often tymes proued it trew) what doth that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie but inwarde commocion or ciuill hatred or ſtryffe?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10675:26"/>Therefore theſe thynges ſhewyng them ſelues ſo often tymes, and ſo wonderfull, verelye we ought to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande and to thynke, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing and workyng of nature is wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted out of frame, and the ſtate and condicion of men to be tourned out of courſe, &amp; that the effectes of nature be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing weake &amp; ſicke may no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue nor endure: for euen as monſte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous byrthes doe not lyue longe, ſo likewyſe the degenerate and monſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſtate of thys corrupt world ſhall not laſte longe.</p>
            <p>As I doe remembre (and as I ſayd before to certayne men whiche tolde me, that a mayde at Rhenie lyued wythout meate and drynke) I dyd tel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how that ſhe could not lyue long nor continue without foode: as if one ſhoulde ſaye, it were a wonderfull and a merueylous thyng to be done, yf that common wealthe ſhoulde not decaye and peryſhe, where the rulers (which ought onely to noriſhe and to vpholde the ſame) eyther be not able to gouerne it, or elles be farre abſent and a great way from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10675:26"/>But we ſee moſt manifeſt ſignes and euident tokens of forewarnyng.</p>
            <p>For as by the ryſyng and the goyng downe of the Sunne, we knowe the commyng of the day &amp; the nyght. So in lyke maner I doe ſuppoſe, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the breakyng vp and diſſoluynge of the lawe and diſcipline of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian common wealth, ſome great fall and deſtruction muſte of neceſſitie folow, and after lyke ſort we maye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture other ieoperdyes and daungers for to come.</p>
