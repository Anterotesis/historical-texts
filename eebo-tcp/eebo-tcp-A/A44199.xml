         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>When the Charge went up
against the Judges, I was appointed
to carry up the desire of the House
Concerning, S. R. C.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lords, These Gentlemen have represented
unto your Lordships the sad object of justice
perverted, liberty oppressed, of judgement
turned into wormewood, the lawes which
should be the barres of our <unclear>gates</unclear>, to protect
us, keepe us, and all that is ours <unclear>in</unclear> safety, made weake and
impotent, to betray us into the hands of violence, instead
of props to support us, become broken reeds to deceive
us, and runne into our sides when we leane upon them,
even so many snares to entrap and entangle us.</p>
            <p>And all this by the perfidiousnesse of those, who are
entrusted with our lawes, who call themselves the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
and the Interpreters of the Law, but by their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
glosses have confounded the Text, and made it
<pb facs="tcp:96679:3"/>
speake another language, and another sence, then ever
our Ancestors the Law-makers intended.</p>
            <p>Our Ancestors made lawes to keepe themselves, their
posterity after them in the possession of their estates;
these Judges could make the Law it selfe rob us and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoileus
of our estates. Were we invaded and persecuted
at any time for pretended crimes, or rather because they
were free from crime? and did we put our selves upon a
legall defence, and shelter our selves under the buckler
of the law, use those lawfull weapons, which Justice and
Truth and the common right of the subject did put into
our <unclear>hands</unclear>; would this availe us? no, these Judges would
make the Law wrest our weapons from us, disarme us,
take away all our defence, expunge our answers, even
binde us hand and foot, and so expose us naked &amp; bound,
to the mercilessenesse of our oppressors; were our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
forced and imprisoned by an act of power, would the
law relieve us, when we appealed unto it? No, it would
joyne hands with violence, and adde bitternesse to our
sorrow; these Iudges would not heare us when we did
cry, no importunity could get a <hi>Habeas Corpus;</hi> nay, our
cryes would displease them, and they would beat us for
crying, and overdoe the unjust Iudge in the Gospell, with
whom yet importunity could prevaile?</p>
            <p>My Lords, The Commons of England finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in this lamentable condition, by the wickednesse of
these Iudges; it is no wonder that we complaine of them;
it is no wonder, if the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses
assembled in Parliament, have sent up some of their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to stand upon Mount Ebal to curse these Iudges; to
denounce a curse upon them who have removed our land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markes,
have taken away the bound stones of the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he subject, have left no <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum,</hi> but he that
<pb facs="tcp:96679:3"/>
had most might, had most right, and the law was sure to
be of his side.</p>
            <p>It hath beene the part of these Gentlemen who have
spoken before me, to pray for justice upon those men,
who would not doe justice to others. My Lords, I come
upon an other errand, and yet for justice too, for there is
justice upon Mount Gerezim, as well as upon Mount
Ebal. It is as great a point of Iustice to give a blessing, a
reward, where it is due, as punishment where punishment
is due: For reward and punishment, <hi>Praemium &amp; poena,</hi>
be the two legges that Iustice walkes on, and reward is
her right legge, the more noble and the more glorious
supporter of that sacred and divine body, that which
God himselfe the fountaine of justice doth more delight
in.</p>
            <q>Tardior ad poenas Deus est, ad praemia velox,</q>
            <p>Punishment is good, as Phisick in the consequence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
as wholesome and nourishing food, in the essence;
the one we do, because we must do it as necessary, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because we love to do it as being pleasing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull.</p>
            <p>Your Lordships then, I doubt not, will as willingly
joyne with the Commons, in doing good to a good
Iudge, as in punishing of the bad.</p>
            <p>My Lords, we honour them and reckon them Martyrs
for the Common-wealth, who suffer any thing by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sending
the common right of the subject, when they will
not part with their own goods contrary to law; when
indeed their private interest goes along with it, or rather
before it, and the publique concernement seemes to come
but in a second place, such were those many, whom these
<pb facs="tcp:96679:4"/>
Iudges have oppressed; yet these men we magnifie and
judge worthy of praise and reward.</p>
            <p>But what honour then is he worthy of, who meerely,
for the publick, hath suffered himselfe to be divested and
deprived of his particular, such a Iudge as would lose his
place, rather then do that which his conscience told him
was prejudiciall to the Common-wealth: is not he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of double honour?</p>
            <p>And this did that worthy reverend Iudge, the Chiefe
Iudge of England at that time, Sir <hi>Randol Crew,</hi> because
he would not by subscribing countenance the loane in
the first yeare of the King, contrary to his oath and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
he drew upon himselfe the displeasure of some
great persons about his Majestie, who put on that project,
which was afterwards condemned by the petition of
right, in the Parliament of <hi>tertio</hi> as unjust and unlawfull,
and by that meanes he lost his place of Chiefe Iustice of
the Kings bench, and hath these fourteene yeares by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his innocency lost the profit of that office, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a just calculation in so long a revolution of time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to 26000<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or thereabouts.</p>
            <p>He kept his innocency when others let theirs go, when
himselfe and the Common-wealth were alike deserted,
which raises his merit to a higher pitch; For to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
when every body else is honest, when honesty is in
fashion, and is Trump, as I may say, is nothing so meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious;
but to stand alone in the breach, to owne hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
when others dare not do it, cannot be sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded,
nor sufficiently rewarded. And that did this
good old man do: in a time of generall desertion he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
himselfe pure and untainted.</p>
            <q>Temporibusque malis ausus is esse bonus.</q>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96679:4"/>My Lords, the House of Commons are therefore sutors
unto your Lordships, to joyne with them in the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of this good mans case unto his Majestie, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to beseech his Majestie to be so good and gracious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, as to give him such honour (the quality of this
case considered) as may be a noble marke of soveraigne
grace and favour, to remaine to him and his posterity,
and may be in some measure a proportionable compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the great losse he hath with so much patience
and resolution sustained.</p>
