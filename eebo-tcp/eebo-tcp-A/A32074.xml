            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Argument methinks carrys a great deal in it. Simplicity and Gravity are the moſt becoming Ornaments of Divine Worſhip; to fancy the great God pleas'd with Theatrical Pomp, and a noiſy Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation in paying him publick Homage, were to repreſent him tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd with human Vanity and Folly; which fills Converſation with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Ceremonies and complemental Addreſſes, that are but mere air and ſhew. But as they are nauſeous to Men of ſenſe, ſo may it well be concluded that any thing parallel to them, needs muſt be the like to the All-wiſe and Heart-ſearching God. 'Tis true in Humane Converſation, Men may be very complaiſant and yet hearty; and in Divine Worſhip they may be Ceremonious and Formal, and yet truly Devout and Serious: but Likelihood in ſuch caſes is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable than Poſſibility. Men of Brains and Thought, altho they either through the tincture of Education, may really be fond of a pompous way of Worſhip; or for fear of ſingularity, may cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily fall in with ſuch Ritual Obſervances as they don't much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, are yet ſufficiently guarded againſt ſo groſs a weakneſs, as the reſting in an outſide Homage would imply: but what will become of the poor Vulgar? They uſe their Eyes and their Ears more than their Reaſon, and underſtand not the Art of Abſtraction; when therefore they find the Divine Worſhip ſo contriv'd and ordered as to give them entertainment in their own way, gratifying their ſenſes, and tickling their Fancies, inſtead of elevating their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and warming their Hearts, they'l be ſtrangely apt to reſt in the former, and over-look the latter, and ſo the great end is loſt. He that queſtions this, ſeems little to know Mankind.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I am far from being a friend to Slovenlineſs, or an enemy to Decency: I abhor Irreverence in Divine Worſhip out of a pretence to Spirituality; and yet am for guarding againſt too great a Prevalence of ſenſual part, leſt it degenerate into mere Form. And therefore cannot but fall in with that which appear'd the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe of the Company, that it were better for our Cathedrals to imitate, than be propos'd as patterns to our Pariſh Churches.</p>
            <p>That I remember, which the Doctor moſt harpt upon, in his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums of the Cathedral way (compar'd to which he ſeem'd to look upon our Pariſh Worſhip as mere babbling) was Antiquity and Authority. There he had us at every turn, when he had not an Anſwer at hand to our Reaſons. There he thought he had a ſafe Retreat: Thither (according to your deſire) I have ſince purſu'd him, and can find no ground for ſuch mighty Boaſts. I have made the beſt ſearch into the matter that I was able, with that aſſiſtance
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57917:2"/>
which my poor Library would afford, and muſt declare that I can find no footing of the modiſh Worſhip of our Cathedrals in the Chriſtian Church, either in the days of the Apoſtles, or for ſome after-Ages; that if my Authors don't miſinform me, (and there call in who you pleaſe to be Judges) it prevail'd not till the fourth Century was drawing to a cloſe, and came not to perfection till <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the Great's days: and was warmly oppos'd by ſundry Perſons of great Worth and Eminence for a long time before, at, and after the times of the Weſtern Reformation. If I can ſet this in a juſt light, I doubt the Doctor muſt lower his Top-ſail, and abate of his Pretenſions, leſt his Zeal prove too ſtrong for his Judgment.</p>
            <p>His Plea from the Church, when Truth lies at ſtake, is with me of ſmall account. I honour the Reformation becauſe bottom'd upon a free ventilation of Truth, to which whoſoever attempts to put a ſtop, undermines our Foundations, and endangers a relapſe into Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Superſtition, from which we ought to be thankful that we are ſo happily eſcap'd. I honour our Church, but cannot think that thoſe befriend her, who would advance her to a practical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, admitting of no Alterations and Amendments: and cannot (when I review times paſt) forbear eſteeming her unhappy in many of her Sons that have appear'd moſt Dutiful, who have outdone her greateſt Enemies; and in her choiceſt Patriots, who have prov'd real Betrayers. For over-doing is undoing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am well ſatisfy'd that Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> with his Heat and Bigotry, was a greater Enemy to our Church, than <hi>Tho. Cartwright</hi> or any of his Abettors, with all their Admonitions and vehement Invectives. This I think the Event hath verify'd.</p>
            <p>It is eaſy to be obſerv'd, when Men are once fond of a Notion, how buſy they are in ſearching for ſomething to defend it; how apt to turn all things almoſt they meet with into Proofs to ſerve their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Take for inſtance, thoſe whoſe Ears are fill'd with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Chanting, and whoſe minds are ſtill running on its delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Melody and Harmony; give them the New Teſtament, and turn them to thoſe places where mention is made of ſinging Pſalms and Hymns, and they'l preſently fancy themſelves in the Quire, with their Singing-Boys about them; and 'tis ten to one but they can find Organs too, and other Muſical Inſtruments: they'l think they can preſently thence confute you, even tho they can find no fair Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um for an Argument. But this is a Phaenomenon that is eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd into a ſtrong prepoſſeſt imagination.</p>
            <p>Perſons may if they pleaſe aſſert, that when our Bleſſed Saviour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57917:3"/>
ſang a <hi>Hymn</hi> or <hi>Pſalm</hi> after his firſt Inſtitution of the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 30.</note> he divided his Diſciples for the greater Advantage, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſix on one ſide, and ſix on the other, giving them their parts to ſing <hi>Antiphonally,</hi> while he himſelf was the <hi>Praecentor;</hi> for my part, I ſhould put them off with a compaſſionate Smile, as not thinking the matter would bear an Argument. If they at the ſame time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> who <hi>ſang Praiſes unto God in the Stocks,</hi> ſang alſo like Choriſters, rebounding their Parts from one to t'other, I <note place="margin">Acts 16. 25.</note> would not bear hard upon them; 'tis pity methinks they ſhould be envi'd the Pleaſure of their profound Diſcoveries. When they urge St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Authority, I am not, I muſt confeſs, much mov'd: For tho I know he charges the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to <hi>ſpeak to themſelves, in Pſalms and Hymns and ſpiritual Songs, ſinging and making Melody in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 19.</note> 
               <hi>their Hearts to the Lord;</hi> and the <hi>Coloſſians to teach and admoniſh one another in Pſalms and Hymns,</hi> &amp;c. yet I can't ſee but this charge of <note place="margin">Col. 3. 16.</note> his may be fully comply'd with, without any alternate ſinging af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the Quire. <hi>Baronius</hi> indeed informs us, that the Apoſtle here preſcribes the Form of Eccleſiaſtical ſinging: But I <note place="margin">Ad An. 60. Num. 24.</note> think ſo important a matter needs better vouchers. Chriſtians <hi>ſpeak to themſelves, and admoniſh one another</hi> in Pſalms and Hymns ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, by devout Pſalmody in their Church-Aſſemblies and Private Families, while they thereby warm their own Hearts, and quicken and excite each other by their common Ardour. But for ſinging alternately and by turns, I can ſee nothing of it without Spectacles, which I am not fond of uſing for fear they ſhould ſpoil my Eyes.</p>
            <p>The moſt plauſible Scripture-Allegation they produce is from the Book of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> where the Apoſtle repreſents the four Beaſts that were about the Throne above, as crying out inceſſantly, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty,</hi> &amp;c. which they ſtrengthen <note place="margin">Rev. 4. 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 6. 3.</note> by a parallel Paſſage in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who brings them in as crying ſo one to another; to which cry of the Beaſts, the 24 El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders give a ſort of an Antiphonal Anſwer, ſaying: <hi>Thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, O Lord, to receive Glory, and Honour, and Power,</hi> &amp;c. But we muſt have a better Key to the Prophetick Viſions than hath yet bin found, before we can warrantably argue from them in dubious matters. I can't find but the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> is yet a Sealed Book, notwithſtanding the great Labour and Pains of ſo many ſcores of Commentators to open and unfold it: who, as far as I can diſcern, know better how to overthrow one anothers Schemes and Hypotheſes, than how to ſix with any certainty when they have done. But as to the matter in hand, 'tis no way needful to labour for an Anſwer. The Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57917:3"/>
in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> plainly refers to the Antient Temple-Worſhip, which can't be admitted a Precedent for Chriſtian Practice, till better proof is brought, that it was deſign'd, and is fit ſo to be, than is as yet to be met with. And it is withal generally agreed, that the Images in the Apocalyptic Viſions are fetcht from the Law, and not from the Goſpel: conſequently what in them relates to Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, refers to the Jewiſh and not the Chriſtian Mode of it: which takes away the force of any Argument that might hence be drawn, with reference to the practice of the Apoſtles or their Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as to the uſing any alternate Singing in their publick Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>But if what is wanting in Scripture Proof, could be made up by Authentick Primitive Records, I ſhould be ſilent. For tho I can't fall in with thoſe who repreſent all the Antients as Giants, and all Moderns as Dwarfs, and confine Senſe, Learning and Piety, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Times, yet I have a juſt Veneration for Antiquity; and can't particularly for bear having a great regard to the Sentiments and Practice of the Primitive Chriſtians. But the worſt of it is, many of the Allegations with reference to the matter in hand, out of the early Ages of the Church, run in ſo viſionary a ſtrain, that it requires more Credulity than I am maſter of, to lay any ſtreſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: and as for the reſt, they are liable to ſo many Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that I ſee not how they can amount to any thing like ſufficient Evidence.</p>
            <p>I have indeed read, that both the Apoſtolick College, and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment from the Celeſtial Hierarchy, made up the Quire at the Celebration of the Funerals of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> the Mother of our Lord; whoſe remains with a mournful Ditty both of Angels and Apoſtles were depoſited in <hi>Gethſemane,</hi> where the Angels af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards continu'd ſinging for three whole days together: which comes from no meaner an Author, than the famous <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus;</hi> who I find was a great Patron of Image Worſhip, and <note place="margin">Jann. Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen. Serm. 2. de Dorm. Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parae.</note> therefore ſo much in favour with the Bleſſed Virgin, that when his Hand was cut off, 'twas through her Interceſſion miraculouſly join'd to his Body again. And (tho my Author informs me not, yet) I ſuppoſe this might be the hand which afterwards in a way of Gratitude, ſignaliz'd it ſelf by committing to Writing, and conveying to Poſterity, the foregoing Account of the Funeral Solemnity of his great Benefactrix. An admirable Story this to ſupport the Quire! what pity 'twas it remain'd ſo long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known! Had it bin publiſh'd to the World four or five hundred years ſooner, it might have done good Service, and effectually
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57917:4"/>
ſilenc'd all Objections againſt the Cathedral way: but having his kept ſecret 730 Years, it loſes its force, and all that I can ſay is, <hi>Fides ſit penes Authorem.</hi> Let him look to the truth of it. The ſame Author elſewhere very gravely relates a pleaſant Paſſage concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Original of the famous Antient Hymn call'd the <hi>Triſagion:</hi> The Story is this: In the time of <hi>Proclus</hi> the Archbiſhop, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">De Fide Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxâ, Lib. 3. cap. 10.</note> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were making ſolemn Supplications on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome portentous Signs, which had a threatning Aſpect While they were full of Concern and Horror, a Boy being ſnatcht from amongſt them, was taught by the Angels to ſing that celebrated Hymn, which ran thus; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. i. e. <hi>Holy God, Holy and Strong, Holy and Immortal, Hare mercy upon us.</hi> The Boy when return'd, related what he had bin taught by his Celeſtial Maſters, and inſtructed the Multitude, who freely ſang after him, and ſo averted the Judgments which threatned them. But ſuch ſort of Narratives are not food for my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, with how confident an Air ſoever they are vented; tho for any thing I know there may be ſome in the World, to whom ſuch a Paſſage as this may ſufficiently evince the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Singing-Boys.</p>
            <p>But to be as grave as the matter will allow me, I find it poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted, and that a great many Ages ago, that the Church-Pomp had its firſt riſe from Heaven: For <hi>Ignatius the third Biſhop of</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och <note place="margin">Socrat.

               <hi>the glorious Seraphims ſinging in this alternate manner: So that it is not unlikely that ſo great a Saint and Martyr might have ſuch a Viſion.</hi> Do but obſerve how fond theſe Men are of Viſions! 'Tis pity but they ſhould have their fill of them: Let them turn to the <hi>Golden Legend,</hi> and they'l find a thouſand as pretty Tales as this. But in Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Comber,</hi> I reply, 'tis beyond all queſtion that <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> liv'd in an Age of Miracles: but that God by miraculous Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, after the Apoſtles deceaſe, ſettled any thing of publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in the Church, as to which they had given no direction, is too dangerous a Notion to be admitted among Articles of Faith: the Apoſtolical Commiſſion was large and full; they were to fix the Church upon a ſtable bottom, both as to Doctrine and Practice; and to provide for the ſafe propagating Chriſtianity to after Ages. Had they inſtituted any Artificial Singing like that of our Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals in worſhipping God, they might have bin ſafely appeal'd to about it, their Commiſſion would have born them out, there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Viſions to have eſtabliſh'd and made way for it: But ſuppoſing them to have bin altogether ſilent, to go to ſupply their defects by after Viſions, opens a door to great Extravagancies, and gives ſcope for the introduction of the weakeſt Dotages, ſhould but any have the Confidence to aſcribe them to a divine Original. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was indeed a great Saint, and famous Martyr; but it doth not thence follow that he muſt have ſuch a Viſion: Many a great Man hath had thoſe things father'd upon him, of which (could he have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen them) he'd have diſcover'd his abhorrence. If this Story prove a Fiction, it reflects not upon <hi>Ignatius. Socrates</hi> is moſt bound to anſwer for it; for he firſt reports it: and he, if we have any regard to the Opinion of the great <hi>Photius,</hi> was not very accurate in his Notions, and may therefore very well be ſuppos'd weakly to <note place="margin">Cod. 28.</note> have taken the matter upon truſt from others, without canvaſſing the truth of the Fact. Withal, 'tis obſervable that he firſt ſtarted the Notion of this Viſion in the year of Chriſt 440, above 300 years after <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Death, which alone makes it very ſuſpicious, and weakens the Credit of it, there being no mention made of it by any of the Writers who went before him. The Doctor indeed gently touches upon the ſilence of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> (who was the elder Church-Hiſtorian of the two) and endeavours to excuſe it; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it might proceed from his taking it for granted, and ſuppoſing it was generally own'd and known. But what room is there for ſuch a ſuppoſition, when the ſilence is ſo general? How often do our antienteſt Hiſtorians relate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>things leſs material, as generally
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57917:5"/>
known as this could be? Why then ſhould ſo famous a Viſion, of ſuch importance, be overlook'd by all of them but <hi>Socrates,</hi> had they either heard of it, or thought it worth inſerting? Why par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſhould <hi>Euſebius</hi> be ſilent, who firſt collected the ſcatter'd Fragments of Church-Hiſtory? His Diligence was ſuch, that ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable a Paſſage as this could hardly have eſcap'd him; and ſuch was his readineſs to put together, whatſoever he met with that had any appearance of Antiquity, that had he heard of it he would ſcarce have baulkt it. His ſilence alone (to one that knows the Man) is a ſufficient Argument, that he had no notice of this Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: if ſo, how could it be ſo generally own'd and known as the Doctor ſuppoſes?</p>
            <p>I'd e'en adviſe our Cathedraliſts therefore to be content to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe their admired Service to a lower Original, and not to ſoar ſo high; to let the Angels alone, and to own it had its riſe from this Earth, where it hath more Admirers than I doubt it hath in the upper Regions. Here we ſhall ſtand upon a level, and may better ſee our way. I'll give you a brief view of their moſt applauded Humane Authorities, as I find them produc'd by their moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Writers.</p>
            <p>They in the firſt place mightily boaſt of the Egyptian <hi>Therapeute,</hi> whoſe Manners and Cuſtoms are largely deſcrib'd by <hi>Philo,</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a great many other peculiarities, gives this Account of them: <note place="margin">De vitâ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templat.</note> 
               <hi>That they had a Quire of two ſides, ſinging alternately; ſo that when one had begun to ſing, the reſt anſwer'd him, by repeating the ends of the Verſes, in imitation of thoſe at the Red Sea. Euſebius</hi> will needs have theſe <hi>Therapeutae</hi> to have bin Chriſtians, and the Diſciples of <note place="margin">Hiſt. Eccleſ. Lib. 2. cap. 16, 17.</note> St. <hi>Mark,</hi> who preach'd the Goſpel among the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> In them therefore, and their Practice, both Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> and the three foremention'd Doctors, <hi>Hammond, Beveridge</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> think they meet with an early authentick Proof of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Cathedral way: The Narrative wherein this occurs, being written by <hi>Philo</hi> within 60 Years after the Birth of our Saviour. Now I'll ſuppoſe (tho I can as yet ſee no neceſſity to grant it) that theſe People did make a Chriſtian Profeſſion, yes am I to ſeek for a Proof that their Practice was binding; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an evident revival of <hi>Judaiſm.</hi> The utmoſt this matter on amount to is this: that there were in <hi>Philo</hi>'s time a numerous party in and about <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of the Converts of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> who mixt Judaiſm and Chriſtianity together.

               <hi>meaning thoſe in his Days who of Hebrews were become Chriſtians, who yet liv'd after the Jewiſh manner, and obſerv'd their Rites.</hi> This need not ſeem ſtrange to any that know that there was in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, a ſort of People called <hi>Nazarenes</hi> or <hi>Nazarites;</hi> who join'd Chriſt and <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Law and Goſpel, Baptiſm and Circumciſion together. We have early intimations of ſuch an inclination, in St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Compendium of Church-Hiſtory: and <note place="margin">Acts 15. 1, 8.</note> thoſe who have bin at all converſant with the Accounts given of after-times, cannot but obſerve how mightily this inclination prevail'd among thoſe Hebrews who embrac'd the Principles of the Chriſtian Faith, who were very unwilling to be diſſwaded from their old Cuſtoms and Obſervances; of which the pompous way of their Temple-Worſhip was none of the leaſt belov'd, or leaſt conſiderable. Suppoſing theſe People Chriſtians of this ſtamp, (and it's plain by the whole Series of <hi>Philo</hi>'s Diſcourſe, and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi>'s after him, which give an Account of ſo many inſtances of plain <hi>Judaiſm</hi> retain'd amongſt them, that they could be of no other) I can't ſee how much can be gain'd by them. For it can no more be groundedly concluded from their Practice, that the Antiphonal way of Singing was uſual in publick Chriſtian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in thoſe days, or that the way of the Antient Temple was to be retain'd in Chriſtian Churches; than it can from the Cuſtom of a few Judaizers be inferr'd, that Circumciſion was to be a ſtanding Inſtitution even under Chriſtianity, and a diſcriminating badg as formerly. But after all, it's very juſtly queſtionable, whether or no theſe People were Chriſtians even of this ſortment. <hi>Scaliger</hi> aſſerts, (and brings a great many Arguments to prove) <note place="margin">De Emend.

If all this weakens not the force of this Allegation, 'twould to me
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57917:6"/>
be very ſtrange: it hath not the face of an Argument left; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe People were Chriſtians, or mere <hi>Jews.</hi> Take which ſide you will, I am very indifferent; they are unfit Precedents for our Practice. If they were mere <hi>Jews,</hi> of the Sect of the <hi>Eſſenes,</hi> (as is aſſerted by ſundry of the Learned) how are we concern'd in them? What have we to do with them? Which way can they ſatisfy us as to the Practice of the Chriſtian Church? If they were Chriſtians, they were but Judaizers: who cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted our Religion by ſundry unlawful and improper mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; were bitter enemies of the Converted <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very unfit Perſons to be our Precedents. Their Practice ſhould rather be us'd as a Caution to us, than urg'd as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for us to imitate.</p>
            <p>Another Teſtimony I meet with commonly produc'd by the Idolizers of the Cathedral way, to prove its Antiquity, is a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in an Epiſtle of the younger <hi>Pliny</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Trajan,</hi> about the Primitive Chriſtians; wherein (among other things) he <note place="margin">C. Plin. Epiſt. Lib. 10. Ep. 94.</note> tells him, <hi>it was cuſtomary with them to meet together on a certain day before it was light, and ſing together an Hymn to Chriſt as God:</hi> which he thus expreſſes; <hi>Carmenque Chriſto quaſi Deo, dicere ſecum invicem;</hi> the meaning whereof they will have to be this, <hi>that they ſang alternately, and by turns,</hi> after the manner of the Quire. But methinks 'tis a little odd and unaccountable, that a Heathen ſhould firſt take notice of this as a common Cuſtom of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and that their own Writers for a long time after ſhould paſs it over ſilently, even when they were giving an Account of what related to their Worſhip, and often had ſo fair an Occaſion to mention it. But waving this, I'll give you an inſtance of unfair dealing, in that great Patron of the Quire, the learned Dr. <hi>Comber.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of Liturgies,</hi> Oct. p. 23.</note> He urging this Paſſage of <hi>Pliny</hi> againſt his Antagoniſt, draws an Argument from the Phraſe <hi>Carmen Dicere,</hi> in proof of the Hymns being in a ſet form of words, wherein I verily believe he hath the right of his ſide. To back his Aſſertion, he produces the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the famous old <hi>Gerard Voſſius;</hi> and preſently after thus argues: <hi>Since it was ſung alternately, it is certain it muſt be a preſcribed</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Voſſii Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. in Ep. Plinii de Chriſtianis.</note> 
               <hi>Form;</hi> when yet he overlooks what follows but a Leaf or two after in <hi>Voſſius,</hi> when he is opening the ſenſe of <hi>Pliny's ſecum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicem;</hi> which he explains not by any thing of an alternation (which the Doctor thought fit to take for granted) but repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents this as its meaning; that the Prieſt did not ſing alone, but others alſo that join'd in Divine Worſhip, did by Singing ſtir up
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57917:6"/>
and quicken one another. So eaſy it is for a Man to take or leave what he apprehends is for or againſt him.</p>
            <p>But two Conſiderations, ſo far as I can perceive, may ſufficiently clear this Paſſage of <hi>Pliny,</hi> to ſuch as are willing to receive ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the ſignification of the word <hi>invicem</hi> is not univerſally the ſame. I pretend not to any great accuracy in Criticiſm; but as far as my inſight into the <hi>Roman</hi> Tongue will help me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, am of Opinion, that the ſenſe of this Particle varies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it ſtands in Conjunction. For as it ſometimes ſignifies, <hi>one after another,</hi> and <hi>by courſe;</hi> ſo doth it at other times, <hi>again;</hi> and in other Caſes it implies no more than either a <hi>joint conſent in Action,</hi> or <hi>an accidental coincidence of Events.</hi> Let <hi>Laurentius Valla</hi> here be conſulted, and others of the like Stamp, if there <note place="margin">De Linguae Lat. Elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ, l. 2. c. 59.</note> be leiſure and inclination. The moſt that can fairly be made of <hi>ſecum invicem,</hi> in the Paſſage referred to, is this; <hi>that they ſang together, and with one conſent.</hi> And therefore commend me to Dr. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>In his Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>of the Live, of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Fathers.</hi>

               <hi>Cave,</hi> who tho no enemy to the Quire, yet was not for ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by a quibbling Criticiſm, but fairly renders this Paſſage thus: <hi>they were wont upon a ſet ſolemn Day, to meet together before Sun riſe, and to ſing among themſelves an Hymn to Chriſt, as the God whom they worſhip'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond thing to be noted is this, That the Roman Prieſts us'd to ſing alone in their moſt ſacred Solemnities; none bearing a part in the Service but themſelves: the <hi>Carmen Saliare</hi> (which was the moſt antient and celebrated of any) was wont to be ſung by the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> in their particolour'd Coats, while <note place="margin">Roſini Antiq. Rom. l. 3. c. 20</note> they were dancing about the <hi>Forum;</hi> none joining with them in the Song but thoſe of the Fraternity. The caſe was the ſame in their other Songs of the ſame Nature. Becauſe therefore the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Prieſts were the only Singers in their Sacred Worſhip, did <hi>Pliny</hi> think it ſtrange to hear that among the Chriſtians all bore a part, and all the Aſſembly with joint Conſent and Harmony ſang their Hymn? And yet now alas among Chriſtians (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be of the beſt Reformed Church in the World) do we find a body of Men that are grown weary of letting all God's ☜ Worſhippers bear a part in his Praiſe, and are better pleas'd with the Heathen Cuſtom, of confining it barely to the Prieſtly Fraternity, and their Attendants. And thus the World runs round.</p>

I am no great admirer of ſuch ſort of Proof; however ſhall ſcan it, and ſee what it amounts to: <q>The aim of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> in that ſecond Book to his Wife, was to admoniſh her (ſuppoſing that ſhe ſurviv'd him) to take heed of marrying a <hi>Gentile.</hi> He urges therefore upon her the Apoſtle's charge, to marry in the Lord, which believing Women could not be ſaid to do, who link'd themſelves with Heathens. He tells her that thoſe who engag'd in ſuch Marriages were to be debarr'd the Privilege of Chriſtian Society; for that they could not with any convenience anſwer the demands of Chriſtian Diſcipline, nor forbear expoſing Divine things to contempt; nor avoid either the being infected with ſome idolatrous Leaven, or at leaſt being diverted from thoſe Sacred Engagements that became Chriſtians. Among theſe he reckons ſinging the Praiſes of God, which is moſt undoubtedly a neceſſary Duty, and very advantageous, whether it be perform'd in Publick or Private.</q> Now ſays <hi>Tertullian,</hi> how can a Man and Wife of ſuch oppoſite Principles, as are thoſe of Heathens and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which run as wide as Heaven and Earth, join together in that Divine Employment? Let the Man ſet himſelf to ſing, and he'll preſently vent what the Wife abhors, and would not join with him in for all the World: Let the Wife on the other ſide attempt to ſing the Chriſtian Pſalms and Hymns, and the Husband will ſtorm, becauſe he'll find contempt pour'd on the Objects of his Veneration. How can there be any compliance with the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Charge of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>Teaching and Admoniſhing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Pſalms and Hymns,</hi> &amp;c. which as it ſhould be extended to all that are join'd in any thing of a Religious Society, ſo comes with a ſpecial force on ſuch as are join'd together in ſo near a Relation, as that of Husband and Wife? But alas, ſo far are they from being capable of any Harmony in ſuch an Engagement, that any attempts towards it would be likely to iſſue in Strife and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, and wretched Confuſion. This Paſſage of <hi>Tertullian</hi> thus taken, runs ſmooth and even; is free from Difficulties, and needs no force, and is very appoſite, and much to the purpoſe. But on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57917:7"/>
the other ſide, it muſt be ſtrain'd and forc'd, before it can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do the Quire any Service; and after all is not very pertinent. In order to the making way for any other Gloſs, it muſt be ſuppos'd that 'tis either publick or private Singing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Husband and Wife, that is here intended; and either ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition hath its difficulties. If publick Singing be here referr'd to, and that in the alternate manner; then muſt it be ſuppos'd that there was a particular Addreſs of the Husband to the Wife, and Wife to the Husband, during the Service in Chriſtian Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, which ſo unſutable a Conjunction as he was ſpeaking of would prevent: But this were to aſſert what could not be prov'd, what we have no where any hint of, and that little to the ſervice of the Cauſe to be befriended; by reaſon it would bring in a ſet of Women-Singers into the Quire, which would not be much for its Reputation. On the other hand; if it were private Singing that <hi>Tertullian</hi> meant, (which ſeems much the moſt likely) then, if their not being able to ſing together, or to ſing to each other upon occaſion, for Excitation, or Exhilaration, won't ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy as the ſenſe, but an Argument muſt hence be drawn for the publick Uſe of the Cathedral way in thoſe days, in order to its having any force, it muſt be ſuppos'd that every Man kept a Quire in his Houſe, to train up his Children and Servants for Choriſters for the Benefit of the Publick, and ſo divided them at the time of Worſhip into two oppoſite ſides, himſelf heading one, and his Wife the other: which is ſo large and wild a Suppoſition, that by virtue of the ſame Figure, I dare undertake any where almoſt to fetch Arguments for Proof, in whatſoever Cauſe I eſpouſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the principal Authorities, to prove the Uſe of the Cathedral way in the three firſt Centuries, that are produc'd by its moſt ſenſible Patrons: But were I concern'd with them, I muſt declare I ſhould be aſham'd to claim ſo great Antiquity, if I could not better prove my Title. However there are others, who are no ſmall Friends to the Cauſe, who run yet lower, and urge the <hi>Apoſtolical Conſtitutions;</hi> wherein (under the preſcrib'd Order of Divine Worſhip) 'tis requir'd, that <hi>after the two Leſſons, one ſhould ſing</hi> David<hi>'s Hymns or Pſalms, and the People ſhould fall</hi>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veregii in Can. S. Apoſt.</note> upon him hath ſufficiently evidenc'd his antedating them, when he ſo vehemently contends for their being extant before the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> He that at this time of the day lays any ſtreſs upon theſe ſpurious <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> is not to be argued with: the like I ſay as to <hi>Dionyſius the Areopagite of the Hierarchy of the Church,</hi> and other ſuch Authors, out of whom Paſſages of the like nature are often cited; they are ſo generally eſteem'd ſpurious by all that have any guſt of Antiquity, and are ſo far from deſerving regard, that they are not worth the mentioning.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> let's conſider how far we have advanc'd. It's requir'd by all the Rules of Reaſoning, that he that affirms any thing dubious, ſhould give good Proof of it before he can expect to gain credit to his Aſſertion. Thoſe therefore who ſo poſitively affirm the Uſe of the Cathedral way of Worſhip, in the three firſt Centuries, muſt produce good Evidence; and if their proof be not cogent, there are good Grounds for a denial. The ſtrongeſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that uſually are produc'd, have bin conſider'd and weigh'd; and (I think I may without Vanity ſay) prov'd weak and inſufficient. Till therefore they either bring better, or better ſtrengthen and ſupport theſe, they can't reaſonably refuſe to allow us to withhold our Aſſent. The Negative is not in any Caſe equally capable of Proof with the Affirmative, ſuppoſing it true; and yet ſometimes may be attended with ſtrong Probabilities, the force of which is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57917:8"/>
not eaſily avoided. And I think I am not deſtitute of Reaſon to aſſert that this is the caſe in the preſent Argument. For tho there's no poſſibility of demonſtrating that the Cathedral Service was not ſo Antient as is pretended, to thoſe who are unwilling to be convinc'd; yet are there ſundry things that make it probable, that the Antiquity aſcrib'd to it, is but imaginary and ſuppoſititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And here I ſhould deſire that three things were conſider'd by thoſe who are open to Light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The State of the Church in the three firſt Centuries is not to be forgotten. Chriſtianity was then traduc'd, contemn'd, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign'd, and perſecuted, with the utmoſt Subtilty and Malice, Rage and Violence. The great work of its Votaries, was to defend its Principles by the ſtrength of their Writings; to wipe off its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach by the Holineſs of their Lives; and to bear Teſtimony to its Truth and Divinity, by their chearful Sufferings. The Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Chriſtians were in thoſe early days ſo preſling; ſo great were the hazards they daily ran, and the fatigues whereto they were expos'd, that it's ſcarce conceivable they ſhould have inclination, leiſure, or opportunity, to introduce ſo pompous a Worſhip as that of our Cathedrals. The privacy of their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings would not allow of any ſuch Magnificence, nor their ſtrait Confinements of ſuch Art and State. The whole contrivance of that ſort of Service ſhows it to be the work of Men at eaſe, and not under the Hatches, as it's well known Chriſtians generally were before the days of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſilence of thoſe Primitive Writers who would have bin moſt likely to have mention'd it, is not to be overlook'd. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> in his particular Account of the Chriſtian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in his time, mentions their praiſing God heartily and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, <note place="margin">In Apologiâ ſecundâ.</note> but gives not the leaſt intimation of any Pomp or Art in that part of the Service. <hi>Irenaeus, Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> are altogether ſilent as to the Cathedral Service. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and induſtrious Dr. <hi>Comber</hi> (who takes all Occaſions, joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Liturgies, to recommend alternate Singing after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Quire, as of equal Antiquity) would hardly have overlook'd it, could he have met with any thing in them to the purpoſe. <hi>Tertullian</hi> often mentions the ſinging of Pſalms in the Lord's Days Solemnities, in the publick Aſſemblies: but not a <note place="margin">Tertul. de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimâ cap. 9. &amp; Apolog. c. 2. &amp;cap. 39.</note> word is produc'd from him as to the Alternate way, ſaving the foremention'd Paſſage of his, which won't much ſerve the Cauſe. The like may be ſaid as to others their Contemporaries. Now
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57917:9"/>
what Account can be given of this general Silence, were the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Service known in thoſe early Ages? It can't be ſaid they conceal'd it for the ſame reaſon as they did many of their Sacred Myſteries; for it would not hold in this caſe. What they did keep ſecret, and upon reſerve, was with a deſign to heighten Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and prevent Contempt; (tho I muſt confeſs that is an Artifice of which I ſhould not be over fond) But how the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Pompous ſort of Service could be conceiv'd likely to guard againſt diſlike and contempt, I can't imagine: its airineſs, and gaudineſs, and fancifulneſs, would have bin much more likely to have procur'd it Reſpect and Approbation among both the ceremonious <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſuperſtitious <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſuppoſing it had bin generally known and publiſh'd. Their Ignorance of it, and utter unacquaintedneſs with it, will to any one who fairly conſiders Circumſtances, appear a much more probable Cauſe of their ſilence concerning it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſolemn Dedication of Churches in thoſe Halcyon days, which attended the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s embracing the Chriſtian Faith, deſerves alſo a Remark. To have the Emperor of their ſide, was a ſurpriſing Bleſſing to the poor Chriſtians, who had gone through ſo many Perſecutions: they hardly knew how to contain themſelves for Joy, being as it were on a ſudden rais'd from the Dead. They had now an Opportunity of ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the World to the beſt Advantage, and they were not backward to improve it. Among other particulars, they dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated their publick Churches in all parts with great Joyfulneſs and Feſtivity; nothing was wanting that could be thought of that might add to the Pomp and Magnificence of thoſe Solemnities: and had any ſuch ſort of Singing as that of the Quire, bin then ever heard of or us'd among Chriſtians, we have a great deal of reaſon to ſuppoſe we ſhould have met with it upon thoſe Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or that if it was omitted in one place, it would have bin found in another: whereas there appears not the leaſt footſtep of any ſuch thing to be trac'd. <hi>Euſebius</hi> is here very large in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. In the general he tells us <hi>that all with one Soul, and one</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hiſt. Eccleſ. lib. 10. cap. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Conſent, ſang Hymns to God; loudly eccho'd his Praiſe in Pſalms; heard the other divinely inſpir'd Writings, and receiv'd the Symbols of our Redeemer's Paſſion; and that the ſeveral Preſidents of the Churches made Panegyrical Orations, with all the Eloquence of Joy whereof they were capable.</hi> But he gives not the leaſt hint of any Antiphonal Singing, in parts, and by turns, with Muſical Symphony, in a The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrical
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57917:9"/>
way. The Oration at the Dedication of the Church of <note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Tyre,</hi> gives an Account of the Form and Parts of that Edifice (which were very different from what had before bin uſual among Chriſtians) and ſundry other particularities: but makes not the leaſt mention of any thing like our Cathedral Service, as then in uſe; for which there was ſcope ſufficient. At the Dedication of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there was (by virtue of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Letter) <note place="margin">Euſ. de Vit. Conſtant. l. 4. c. 43, 44, 45.</note> a Convention of about ſixty Biſhops, who were ordered upon this Occaſion to adjourn thither from the City of <hi>Tyre;</hi> where they were met in Council about the Affair of the great <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> The Ceremonies us'd upon that occaſion were peculiarly pompous, and a famous Oration was made by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> which is yet extant at the cloſe of his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory: But ſtill there's no mention of that ſort of Service, which hath ſo ingroſs'd the Affections of our Cathedraliſts. <hi>Finally,</hi> The ſame Author gives us alſo a large Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <note place="margin">Cap. 70, 71.</note> of the Funerals of this Famous firſt Chriſtian Emperor, tells us of the Reception of his Corps by the Clergy in a body, at the Church of the Apoſtles; takes notice of the mournfulneſs of the Solemnity, their ſorrowful Praying on that Occaſion, and the Praiſes that were univerſally given to the Deceaſed; but is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſilent as to any ſuch Ceremonies, as are in our Days uſual, when the Relicks of Perſons of Note and Eminence are depoſited in our Cathedrals. Which Conſiderations put together, make it highly probable that the Cathedral Service came not into the Church, till after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> left the World; which was in the 337th Year of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Matters being thus far clear'd, I'll now proceed to give you the beſt Account I am able, of the true Riſe of that way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which our Cathedraliſts ſo much extol; and in compariſon whereof they reckon the Worſhip of thoſe who ſtatedly wait on God like honeſt Chriſtians in their Pariſh Churches, to be poor, mean, and beggarly. I'll omit no material Circumſtances I have met with in the narrow compaſs of my Reading, which may either ſeem to make for their Cauſe, or help to afford any Light; and make a few Reflections as I go along, that I mayn't ſeem heavy, flat and tedious.</p>
            <p>After all the ſtir that hath bin made, the firſt certain hint that can be fix'd on in Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, of Cathedral Chant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> during the Adminiſtration of <hi>Leontius,</hi> who was advanc'd to that See <hi>A. C.</hi> 347. and continued in it till the Year 356. in which interval of time, <hi>Flavianus</hi> (who
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57917:10"/>
was afterwards himſelf advanc'd to this See) and <hi>Diodorus</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Biſhop of <hi>Tarſus) divided the Quire into two Parts, and made them ſing the Pſalms of</hi> David <hi>alternately: which Cuſtom</hi> (ſaith <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret) began firſt at</hi> Antioch, <hi>and thence ſpread it ſelf to other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and reach'd even to the ends of the World. Leontius</hi> the Biſhop <note place="margin">Theod. Hiſt. Eccl. Lib. 2. cap. 24.</note> was an <hi>Arian,</hi> and ſubtilly undermin'd the <hi>Nicene Faith;</hi> of which <hi>Flavianus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſet up for zealous Defenders. They were both engag'd in a Monaſtick Life, and in great repute for Piety; and therefore altho (as the Hiſtorian obſerves) they were as yet mere Laymen, and not in Orders, yet they had a great many Followers; and their way of Antiphonal Singing, which they ſet up in ſeparate Aſſemblies, was generally ſo taking, that they drew all the People from <hi>Leontius</hi> their Biſhop, who thereupon deſir'd them to bring their new faſhion Service into the Church. So that this ſo much admir'd Service, was firſt ſet on foot in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ☞ to the enticing People from the <hi>Arians,</hi> to pleaſe the Mob, and keep them from running after thoſe by whom they'd be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd. But for my part I muſt declare I am rather for leaving thoſe Arts and Shifts to perſons of Sectarian Principles: Let Truth make its own way, I can't apprehend it any great Service to it, to gain it Proſelytes by any ſuch enticing Methods. And I very much queſtion, whether thoſe who are attracted merely by the pompouſneſs of Worſhip, are like to prove any great Credit to the party they fall in with. However, thus ſtands Fact. At <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> where Perſons were firſt call'd Chriſtians, were Chriſtians firſt taught to turn the Church into a Stage. There was that way of Singing firſt introduc'd, which hath turn'd the Worſhip of God into an artificial contrivance; and which, ſhould it univerſally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, would transform Religion into mere Mechaniſm. Of this <hi>Flavianus</hi> was the great occaſion. A Man who ſtands branded in Eccleſiaſtick Hiſtory, for the breach of a moſt ſolemn Oath, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">Sozom. Hiſt. Eccl. Lib. 7. cap. 3. c. 11.</note> (for the preventing a perpetual Schiſm in the Church of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och)</hi> he and five more ſtood bound, not to covet the Biſhoprick of that See, and not to accept it altho elected, while <hi>Paulinus</hi> and <hi>Meletius</hi> were alive: Notwithſtanding which Oath, he after the Death of <hi>Meletius,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Paulinus,</hi> (who yet ſurviv'd) readily accepted the Biſhoprick when 'twas offer'd him: for which notorious Perjury, he was deſervedly deteſted by all the Weſtern Biſhops. I know 'tis pleaded on his behalf, that he herein acted with the Advice and Approbation of a Synod of the Biſhops of the Eaſt, who unanimouſly elected him, when they were met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57917:10"/>
in Council at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But that only proves that thoſe who poſſeſt the chief Dignities of the Church, began betimes to act more out of Intereſt than a Principle of Conſcience, (of which there are alas but too many inſtances) but proves not the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Fact. Our Cathedraliſts have no great Cauſe to be proud of their Founder, who in ſo ſcandalous a manner mounted the Epiſcopal Throne. However, tho he was looſe in his Morals, yet he was very fond of Ceremonials: an unhappy Conjunction! too oft to be met with in every Age! He ſeems to have reckon'd his Anthems a ſort of Magical Charms, proper to appeaſe both God and Man. We meet with a remarkable inſtance of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon their Virtue, when he was ſent as a publick Agent to the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> The Caſe was this: The City of <hi>Antioch</hi> had by a popular Sedition incurr'd the Emperor's Diſpleaſure, and was afraid of the conſequences. Whereupon <hi>Flavianus</hi> was by common Conſent, deputed as their Mediator with him, to pacify <note place="margin">Sozom. Hiſt. Eccl. l. 7. c. 23.</note> his Anger, and implore their Pardon. He undertakes the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and thinking nothing could be more ſoftning than his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd Church-Muſick, ordered the uſual Service to be ſung before the Emperor at his Table, and for once makes a Quire of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Dining-room. The Deſign ſucceeded, the Emperor took Pity, he wept moſt tenderly, and the City was receiv'd into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Behold here an inſtance of the charming Power of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Service! How could the <hi>Antiochians</hi> forbear having a mighty Eſteem and Reverence for their late Invention, which they found had ſuch a melting Virtue! How eaſily were they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that it was likely to be as moving to God, as they found it had bin to Man! What wonder then, that this City was ſo fond of Alternate Singing! No where do we hear ſo much of it as there. In the days of the Emperor <hi>Julian,</hi> they convey'd the Corps of St. <hi>Babylas</hi> the Martyr, from <hi>Daphne</hi> (where the Daemon could not bear his Neighbourhood) and carri'd it through their <note place="margin">Socrat. Eccl. Hiſt. l. 3. c. 18. Theod. lib. 3. c. 10.</note> City in Triumph, ſinging all the way they went with great Joy, after the manner of the Quire; the whole Company joining in this reſponſe, at every Period, <hi>Confounded be all they that worſhip Graven Images.</hi> The ſame ſort of Reception they gave alſo in the Reign of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> to the Corps of their Biſhop <hi>Meletius,</hi> which <note place="margin">Soz. Hiſt. Eccl. l. 7. c. 10.</note> was depoſited near that of St. <hi>Babylas.</hi> And many other ways did they ſhow their fondneſs of it. The prevalence of Antipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Singing in ſuch a City as <hi>Antioch,</hi> which was the Metropolis of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57917:11"/>
               <hi>Syria,</hi> a place of great reſort, and of a mighty Influence, much further'd its ſpreading in other Parts.</p>
            <p>Between the year of Chriſt 360, and 370, there was a Council held in the City of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> upon what Occaſion is not now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known. Among other things 'twas then determin'd, that <note place="margin">Concil. Laod. Can. 15.</note> 
               <hi>there ſhould be Canonical Singers, and that they ſhould ſing out of Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Books, and that none elſe ſhould ſing in the Church.</hi> Who had the framing of theſe Canons, and what Biſhops met in this Council, I cannot find out; but meet with this Reaſon aſſign'd by <hi>Baronius,</hi> for this particular Canon about Singers: <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Baron. ad An. 60. N. 28.</note> 
               <hi>the People and Clergy ſang promiſcuouſly, through the unskilfulneſs of the Singers it oft fell out, that by the diſorderly ſound of Voices, the diverſity marr'd that harmonious Singing, which was congruous to the Churches Dignity: therefore it was prohibited the People in the Church; and ordered that none ſhould ſing, but thoſe unto whom this Work was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd. Zonaras</hi> alſo intimates as much, telling us that theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Singers were reckon'd a part of the Clergy. But <hi>Balſamon</hi> (who in Dr. <hi>Cave</hi>'s Judgment was the beſt skill'd in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Canons, of any that ever <hi>Greece</hi> produc'd) tells us in his <note place="margin">Hiſt. Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Pars 1. p. 687.</note> 
               <hi>Scholia,</hi> that <hi>before the</hi> Laodicean <hi>Council, the Laity would many times in contempt of the Clergy, begin ſuch Hymns and Songs in the Church as were crude and unuſual: to obviate which practice it was ordered in that Canon, that none ſhould begin to ſing but thoſe that were appointed, and whoſe Office it was: Not but that the Laity might follow them, and ſing with them in the whole Service, which he declares was not intended to be thereby prohibited.</hi> So that the true meaning of this celebrated Canon is no more than this, that the Clerks in all the Churches ſhould read the Pſalms, out of a Pſalm Book; and none elſe ſhould preſume to begin a Hymn, or ſet a Tune but they. Whence it appears to me a better Evidence of the Antiquity of <hi>Pariſh Clerks,</hi> than of the extent of the Cathedral Service, on the behalf where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of 'tis commonly produc'd.</p>
            <p>But whatever becomes of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Canon, great boaſts are made of the Patronage of three moſt celebrated Names, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> who were all fond of the Quire; recommended, ſpread, and diffus'd the new Mode of Service, whereſoever they had an influence, and handed it down to Poſterity with Encomiums. Be it ſo, muſt we therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be frighten'd out of our Wits? Are they too eminent to have their Sentiments canvaſs'd, and their Actions ſcann'd? Is a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57917:11"/>
thing therefore true becauſe they ſaid it, therefore good and laudable becauſe they did it? For my part I think I have them in a juſt Veneration, and yet cannot reach ſuch a pitch of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance. I can't be content to part with my own Eyes, for the uſe of other Mens, were they ever ſo eminent, great or good. I find the beſt have ſo many failures, that I can't ſatisfy my ſelf to follow any blindfold, for fear they ſhould lead me into a Ditch. None that are at all vers'd in Antiquity, can be ignorant, that towards the latter end of the <hi>4th</hi> Century, and the beginning of the fifth, through the ignorance of ſome, the negligence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the haughtineſs and ſtiffneſs of others, and a ſpreading love of Pomp and Magnificence, a variety of Corruptions crept into the Church, which in proceſs of time roſe to a far greater height, than could have bin at firſt imagin'd by thoſe who had the greateſt hand in introducing them. Witneſs the undue admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Celibacy, the fondneſs of Reliques and Pilgrimages, the Invocation of Saints, the ſetting up Images in Churches, the overgreat Veneration of the Croſs, and Prayers for the Dead; ☜ which about this time had their riſe. Why mayn't the Service of the Quire, which gain'd ſo much about this time, be of this number; when, how honeſt and laudable ſoever were the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of its firſt Patrons and Abettors, it came by degrees to be ſo manag'd, as to render the Divine Worſhip perfectly ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and would, if it univerſally prevail'd, bid fair for the juſtling real Worſhip out of the World? However I can't paſs by the three Perſons mention'd without a few Remarks.</p>
            <p>As for St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> he had part of his Education at <hi>Antioch;</hi> he was there made Deacon by <hi>Meletius;</hi> was a continual Spectator of the pompous Worſhip of the Quire, which was there ſo much in vogue; he was us'd to it, and it ſuted his Genius, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he reſolv'd to ſpread it. At the ſame time, being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a great Aſcetick, mighty fond of Retirement, and full of Zeal, he ſet up for a Patron of the Monaſtick Life, for which he was the firſt who fixt Laws and Conſtitutions to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated to Poſterity: but they muſt have much worſe thoughts of ſo great a Man than I can give way to, who imagine he would have bin fond either of one or t'other, could he have foreſeen the Damage they'd have done to real Religion in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. 'Tis however obſervable that he was reckon'd an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator, and charg'd as an introducer of Novelties, in ſetting up
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57917:12"/>
Monachiſm, and being ſo fond of the new way of Pſalmody, and ſo induſtrious in ſpreading it: He was even then forc'd to apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize for himſelf. And his Apology (in an Epiſtle to the <hi>Neocae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarean</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Baſilii Ep. 63.</note> Clergy, ſtill extant) was indeed (like the Man) very warm and vehement. <q>As for his forming Men into a Monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Life, he declares he was ſo far from reckoning it a fault, that he thought it to be his Glory, and the great Buſineſs of his Life: and he fetches Precedents out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Palaeſtine.</hi> And as for the new way of Pſalmody, at which they were offended, he declares 'twas now become a common practice in the Chriſtian Church; the People riſing before day, and going to Church; where having made their Confeſſions and Prayers, they proceeded to the Singing of Pſalms, in which Holy Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, the Quire being divided into two Parts, mutually anſwer'd one another, the <hi>Praecentor</hi> beginning, and the reſt following after. And tells them that if this were a fault, they muſt blame many pious and good Men in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Libya,</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bais;</hi> in <hi>Palaeſtine, Arabia, Phaenicia</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and many other places. They objected againſt him, that 'twas not thus in the time of their Biſhop <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus,</hi> for whom they had a great Veneration. He anſwers, that neither were the Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies then us'd known in his time.</q> But that methinks is no Argument, but that both that ſort of Pſalmody and the Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies too, might be novel Inventions. <q>Withal, he accuſes them of not following their admir'd <hi>Gregory</hi> in other things; and therefore charges them with ſtraining at a Gnat, while they ſwallow'd a Camel, in that they in the mean time made ſuch a noiſe about his Pſalmody.</q> But how could their being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of other faults, make them incapable of being in the right, in their oppoſing the Service of the Quire as a Novelty? Nay rather his inability to produce Evidence of the Antiquity of that which they oppos'd as an Innovation, (which appears from his not having done it) ſhows that they were herein in the right: and his diverting thence to other things, looks very like his ſeeking for a ſubterfuge. After all, St. <hi>Baſil</hi> was a great Man; and yet 'tis well known, that tho he made ſo ſtrict a profeſſion of Humility, and had ſpent ſo much time in learning Mortification, he was as little able to bear a Contradiction as his Neighbours.</p>
            <p>From him I paſs to St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who was on a ſudden tranſlated from the Civil Tribunal to the Epiſcopal Throne; and who was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57917:12"/>
the firſt that brought the Antiphonal way of Singing into the Weſtern Parts, as is expreſly aſſerted by St. <hi>Auſtin, Iſidore Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palenſis,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Confeſſ. l. 9. c. 7.</note> and ſundry others. He was a conſiderable Man in his time, but abundantly more ſo on the account of his Gravity, Simplicity, <note place="margin">De Eccl. Off. l. 1. c. 7.</note> and Piety, than his Depth and Solidity: he was too great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whom he follow'd blindfold. It hath long ſince bin obſerv'd of him by St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> that he often tranſcribes the Greek Fathers in his Writings; no wonder therefore if he follow'd them in Ritual matters. He had particularly a great Veneration for St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> in imitation of whom he introduc'd the Service of the Quire at <hi>Milan;</hi> of which we have this Account. <q>When he was perſecuted by the Empreſs <hi>Juſtina,</hi> the People watch'd all Night in the Church; and then he appointed that Pſalms and Hymns ſhould be ſung, after the manner of the Oriental Countries, leſt the People ſhould pine away with the tediouſneſs of Sorrow; and from that time forward the Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom was retain'd, and ſpread to all the Weſtern Parts.</q> But I muſt be excus'd if I can't lay ſo great a ſtreſs on this honeſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Judgment and Practice, as ſome others may do: for a Viſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Inclination is with me, wherever I meet with it, a great mark of weakneſs. Of this we have in him a notorious Inſtance, in one of the moſt remarkable Paſſages of his Life; which relates to his <note place="margin">Ambroſii Lit. 22.</note> management of the Relicks of St. <hi>Gervaſius,</hi> and St. <hi>Protaſius;</hi> of which he himſelf gives this Account: <q>Having built a Church in the City of <hi>Milan,</hi> he was deſir'd to Conſecrate it in the ſame manner as he had done the Roman Church, <hi>(i. e.</hi> another Church that was near the Roman Gate.) He promis'd it, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he found any Relicks: and thereupon got ſome Officers to dig about the Rails that encompaſs'd the Tombs of St. <hi>Felix</hi> and St. <hi>Nabor</hi> the Martyrs. Digging, they found the Bodies of two proper Perſons beſprinkled with Blood, which with great Solemnity were carried and interr'd in the new-built Church, after having wrought a great many miraculous Cures.</q> In his two Sermons which he preach'd upon this Occaſion, (which I'd commend to the peruſal of all thoſe who reckon Things and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt, if Antient, be good of courſe) he tells his Hearers, that theſe were the Bodies of St. <hi>Gervaſius,</hi> and <hi>Protaſius.</hi> And tho he did not think it neceſſary to acquaint them how he came to know ſo much, yet St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (who was at that time at <hi>Milan)</hi> tells us he had his Intelligence in a Viſion. For my part, I'm <note place="margin">Confeſſ. l. 9. c. 7.</note>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57917:13"/>
clearly for plain ground, for I find Precipices dangerous. Once admit Viſions in the Caſe of <hi>Relicks,</hi> and I ſee no reaſon why they ſhould be refus'd on the behalf of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> or any other Dotage. If we have <hi>a ſure Word of Prophecy,</hi> let us ſtick to it. Should a Man bring his Viſions into the Pulpit in our times, either in the Court, City, or Univerſity, he'd at once forfeit whatever Reputation he was maſter of. And why we ſhould give a Letter of Licence to an Antient, and deny it to a Modern Preacher, I can't imagine. In a word, I honour the Piety of St <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> yet cannot but be loth to admit him a Precedent, where any thing dubious is under Conſideration: for I am ſatisfi'd we have many an honeſt Country Parſon, that is able to ſee as far as he.</p>
            <p>The third admir'd Patron is the great St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom 'tis to be obſerv'd, that he was born and bred at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> where we have found the Cathedral Chanting was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd. He was made a Deacon there by <hi>Meletius,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Presbyter by <hi>Flavianus</hi> (the Founder of the Service) of whom he is ſaid to have bin a great admirer: So that he imbib'd the love of Antiphonal Singing, almoſt with his Mother's Milk, and was all along bred up in the Uſe of it: and he muſt be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unacquainted with humane Nature, who knows not the Force and Power of Education. When he was once advanc'd to the See of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he ſoon found occaſion to introduce the Antiochian Cuſtom. Hiſtorians relate it thus: <q>The <hi>Arians</hi> in that City were grown very inſolent: They kept their Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles <note place="margin">Socrat. l. 6. c. 8.</note> out of Town, but were wont upon Saturdays and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, <note place="margin">Sozom. l. 8. c. 8.</note> (which were conſtant times for the Publick Aſſemblies) to come within the City; and dividing themſelves into Companies, they walk'd about the Publick Portico's, ſinging as they went along Hymns compos'd in defence of their own Principles, one part reſponding to the other; adding petulant Reflections on the Catholicks. Thus they did the greateſt part of the Night, and early the next Morning they march'd through the heart of the City, ſinging their Antiphonal Hymns, and ſo went out to their own Meeting-houſe. St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in oppoſition to them, deliver'd Hymns to ſome of his People, to be ſung in the Night in the ſame manner: and that the buſineſs might be manag'd with the greater Pomp and Solemnity, procur'd Croſſes of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be made at the Empreſſes Charge; and order'd that they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57917:13"/>
ſhould have lighted Torches born before them, and got <hi>Briſo</hi> the Empreſſes own Eunuch, as <hi>Praecentor,</hi> to walk before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: which was the occaſion of a great Scuffle and Sedition in the City, that iſſu'd in the utter Expulſion of the <hi>Arians.</hi>
               </q> But <hi>this way of Singing thus introduc'd, was</hi> (as <hi>Sozomen</hi> obſerves) <hi>us'd at</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>from that day forward.</hi> Which is to me a plain Argument that it was not introduc'd there before; for otherwiſe he'd hardly have taken ſuch particular notice of it. However, it had not bin long there, before it was manag'd in ſo unſeemly a manner, as made the good Man who firſt brought it in, perfectly aſham'd: For the Singers affected ſuch mimical Geſtures, and boiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Clamors, as turn'd the Church into a mere Stage: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he with great Vehemence, Warmth, and Gravity reproves them: <q>Telling them that their rude Voices, which gave an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain <note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> ſound, rather became Theatres than the Church of God; <note place="margin">Hom. 1. de Verb. Iſaiae 1. 5. p. 128.</note> becauſe they were borrow'd from thence, and were unſeemly for the Church, in which all things are to be done with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, becauſe of his tremendous Preſence, who obſerves the Motion of every one there: yea he declares he reckons thoſe rude Voices in Singing, for tokens of an uncompoſed Mind; which declare that Men are rather mad, than humbly confeſſing their Sins to God, and with a becoming lowlineſs, begging his Pardon for them.</q> Which was a ſort of a retractation of his former Fact, when he ſaw the Profaneneſs to which it gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and intimates an abatement of his fondneſs for the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Service, when he found how much Religion, and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God was like to ſuffer by it. We may very well conclude, that the ſame fervent Piety and Zeal for God, could he have known the Miſchief it occaſion'd in ſucceeding Ages, would have made him as forward to throw it out, as ever he was to bring it in. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole, there's no great room for boaſting of theſe three Patrons; for the firſt was reputed an Innovator in that very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, wherein our Cathedraliſts urge his Authority: The ſecond in things of this nature, made more uſe of other Mens Eyes than his own: and the third in a little time ſaw cauſe to repent his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs in that for which they commend him; and in effect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted it.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you a brief View of the firſt Riſe of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonal Singing, at <hi>Antioch,</hi> at <hi>Caeſarea;</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the Eaſt; and at <hi>Milan</hi> in the Weſt: whence by degrees it was ſpread
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57917:14"/>
to other places. You may perhaps wonder, I have not in all this time brought it to <hi>Rome,</hi> where there was from the firſt Riſe of Chriſtianity, a great fondneſs of Pomp and Magnificence obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, and a forwardneſs to outdo all other Churches. But the truth of it is, I am for dealing impartially: <hi>Rome</hi> hath enough in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to anſwer for, it need not be charg'd falſly. Other Cities were before it in the time of admitting the Cathedral Service: but when once it was receiv'd there, it was quickly ſo improv'd that no time ſeem'd loſt, while it remain'd unknown. If we'll believe the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> 'twas Pope <hi>Damaſus</hi> who firſt ordain'd that Pſalms ſhould be ſung both Day and Night by the Clergy. <note place="margin">Conc. T. 1. p. 496.</note> There is in St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Works a Letter of this Pope, <hi>wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires him to ſend him an Account of the</hi> Grecian <hi>manner of Singing; and he gives this Reaſon, becauſe it was not as yet us'd amongst them, neither was the Grace of an Hymn known in their Mouth. Baronius</hi> calls the truth of this Epiſtle into queſtion; but the <hi>Pontifical</hi> aſſerts, and gives Credit to it. In his time therefore, that is about the Year of Chriſt 380, Antiphonal Singing was brought in at <hi>Rome</hi> alſo. And there it was ſo cultivated, that it made mighty advances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of ſeveral Popes ſucceſſively; till at length it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as hard a matter for any one to manage a Part in the Quire, as on the Stage; nay requir'd more time and pains for a Perſon to learn to ſing the Praiſes of God in the Church, than to ſing in a Theatre.</p>
            <p>Should I pretend to give you an Account of the ſeveral Emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Augmentations, and gradual Alterations, of the Cathedral Service in the Roman hands, I ſhould ſoon expatiate beyond the bounds of a Letter, and therefore I'll forbear; and only obſerve that in the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, (that is, about the Year of Chriſt 620) it was brought to Perfection; and thence-forward call'd <hi>Cantus Gregorianus,</hi> in Engliſh the Gregorian <hi>Cant.</hi> He ſent it into our Nation by his Truſty Emiſſary <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, who found ſuch a ſtiffneſs among the Britiſh Clergy, that he was quite at a loſs: they were not to be perſwaded to forſake their own Rites of Worſhip, and receive the Romiſh Trumpery, and among others things their new model'd, and much admir'd Cathedral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; whereupon he was the Occaſion of the ſlaughter of twelve <note place="margin">Bede Hiſt. Eccl. l. 2. c. 2.</note> hundred of them at once, being reſolv'd they ſhould pay dear for their unmuſical Diſpoſition. One would think this ſhould be but a ☞ poor encouragement to the Survivors, to dance after his Pipe! And
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57917:14"/>
that the Remembrance of it ſhould damp our preſent Clergy in their moſt pompous Service, and abate their fondneſs of the Quire, which was in this Iſland founded in ſo much Blood! Our old <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> however for a good while after kept their ground; tho <hi>Auſtin</hi> had got the better of them they would not yield: they would not conform to the Roman Cuſtom, ſo much as in the time of celebrating the Paſchal Solemnity; much leſs would they comply in changing that plain and ſimple manner of Divine Worſhip which prevail'd among them, for a Gaudy, Pompous, and Theatrical ſort of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which was all made up of Art and Shew. But about the year of Chriſt 670, Pope <hi>Vitalian</hi> ſent <hi>Theodore</hi> a Grecian into <hi>England,</hi> to fill up the Vacant See of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> who by his Subtilty and Artifice outwitted the poor <hi>Brittans,</hi> to the full ſatisfaction of thoſe who employ'd him. He held a Synod at <hi>Hartford,</hi> wherein the <hi>Eaſter</hi> Controverſy was ſettled to the Pope's Mind, and the <note place="margin">Spelman. Concil.</note> way pav'd for the introduction of the Cathedral Service with all its Pomp. To this Pope <hi>Vitalian,</hi> to whom our Nation is oblig'd for this Archbiſhop <hi>Theodore,</hi> muſt we pay our Acknowledgments alſo for <hi>Organs</hi> in Divine Worſhip; of which (if <hi>Platina</hi> be to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited) he was the firſt introducer.—Some time after, when <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Platina in vitâ Vitalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</note> was in the Pontifical Chair, <hi>Benedict,</hi> who had built a Monaſtery here in <hi>Britain,</hi> went to <hi>Rome</hi> to be confirm'd in the honour of his Abbacy. He was kindly receiv'd, and the Pope ſent one <hi>John</hi> (who was chief Singer at St. <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and Abbot of the Monaſtery <note place="margin">Baron. ad An. 679. N. 10.</note> of St. <hi>Martin)</hi> back along with him; who introduc'd into his new built Monaſtery, the whole Service that was us'd at St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, and taught his Singers the art of Chanting, in conformity to the Roman Method. This was about the year of Chriſt 679; which is the earlieſt certain date of the Cathedral Service in this our Land. Our <hi>Brittans</hi> had for ſome Ages worſhip'd God accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably enough without it, and might have continued ſo to do had they never known it. But <hi>Rome</hi> had then ſet up for the Mother-Church, and with great zeal ſpread an Uniformity of Service among all her reputed Daughters; till in proceſs of time ſhe had made them all as bad as her ſelf.</p>
            <p>But <hi>France</hi> was not even yet conformable: Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took the Advantage of the Obligation he had laid on <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> by making him Emperor of the Weſt, in order to the engaging him to introduce the Gregorian <hi>Cant</hi> into the <hi>Gallick</hi> Church. About which <hi>Baronius</hi> gives us this memorable Paſſage:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57917:15"/>
               <q>In the Year 787, the Emperor kept his <hi>Eaſter</hi> with Pope <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Baron. ad An. 787. N. 106.</note> at <hi>Rome;</hi> and in thoſe days of Feſtivity there aroſe a great Contention between the Singers of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> ſort. The <hi>French</hi> pretended to ſing more gravely and decently; the <hi>Romans</hi> more melodiouſly and artificially; and each mightily undervalu'd the other. The Emperor yielded to the Pope, and made his own Servants truckle; and thereupon carry'd back with him <hi>Theodore</hi> and <hi>Benedict</hi> (two expert Roman Singers) to inſtruct his Countrymen. The Pope alſo gave him the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Antiphonary,</hi> which he promis'd ſhould be generally us'd in his Dominions. And upon his return into <hi>France,</hi> he plac'd one of theſe Artiſts in the City of <hi>Metz;</hi> ordering that the Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould from all the Cities of <hi>France,</hi> repair thither to him to learn his Art of Singing, and playing on the Organs.</q> And thus you ſee (in part) how the Cathedral Service ſpread in theſe Weſtern Parts, by means of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had then ſet up for Adminiſtrator General of the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I'll forbear troubling you with the various Conſtitutions of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral National Councils about this ſort of Service, leſt I treſpaſs upon your Patience: tho if they were conſulted (I find by ſundry inſtances) they would diſcover a ſenſe even among the Clergy, as bad as 'twas, of the Corruptions which prevail'd in it. But in lieu of it, I'll give you the Cenſures of ſundry particular Perſons of Note and Eminence all along in the Church.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Comber</hi> in the heat of his Zeal for the Service of the Quire, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of Liturgies,</hi> Oct. p. 88.</note> poſitively aſſerts, that no Chriſtians, before our <hi>Diſſenters</hi> appear'd, ever found any fault with it. As for the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> I undertake not their Patronage; tho this I'll venture to ſay for them, that the moſt rational and ſolid of them (with whom I have had any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe) lay a greater ſtreſs on the Objections to which our <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> is liable, than thoſe that may be ſtarted againſt our <hi>Mode of Worſhip</hi> in our Pariſh Churches. But as for the Worſhip of our Cathedrals, there are a great many who never deſerted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, nor never intended it, who are as much againſt it as any of the Diſſenters. And, but that I a little know the World, it would have amaz'd me, that a Man ſo converſant with Books as Dr. <hi>Comber,</hi> ſhould pretend the Objections againſt it are of late Date: for alas it hath met with oppoſition ever ſince it appear'd in the World, and bin objected againſt in every Age. I'll mention a few Inſtances of many.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:57917:15"/>
The <hi>Neocaeſarean</hi> Clergy (abovemention'd) excepted againſt it as a Novelty, when it was ſo induſtriouſly ſpread by St. <hi>Baſil;</hi> and that not many Years after its firſt appearance.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (when his Mind was calm) was much afraid of it. I know indeed there is a Paſſage of his often made uſe of in favour of the Quire; and it can't be deni'd but he once commended it. For ſpeaking of the firſt Introduction of Antiphonal Singing at <hi>Milan,</hi> at which he was preſent, he thus expreſſes himſelf: <q>How <note place="margin">Confeſſ. l. 9. c. 6.</note> abundantly did I weep before God, to hear thoſe Hymns of thine; being touch'd to the very quick by the Voices of thy ſweet Church-Song! The Voices flow'd into my Ears, and thy Truth pleaſingly diſtill'd into my Heart, which caus'd the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of my Devotion to overflow, and my Tears to run over; and happy did I find my ſelf therein.</q> This was his firſt Apprehenſion before he had weigh'd matters in an even ballance. But St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was not aſham'd to change his Judgment; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his <hi>Book of Retractations.</hi> He at firſt miſtook the natural work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Paſſions, thrô the influence of Muſick, for the fervent work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ☜ of a vigorous Devotion: (a common miſtake I doubt among the frequenters of Cathedrals!) But when he came to himſelf, he ſaw his danger: <q>and thereupon cenſur'd himſelf ſeverely, <note place="margin">Conf. l. 10. c. 33.</note> for being ſo tickled with ſenſual Delight in Divine Worſhip, and heartily bleſt God for being deliver'd from that Snare. He withal expreſly declares, that he often wiſh'd that the melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Singing of <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalter with ſo much art, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from his and the Churches Ears: and that he thought the Method which he had often heard was us'd by <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was the ſafeſt; who caus'd him who read the Pſalm to uſe ſo little a variation of the Voice, that he ſeem'd more like to one pronouncing, than ſinging. And elſewhere he declares, that the ſame way of Singing as was us'd in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> prevail'd throughout all <hi>Africa.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Ep. 119<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> charges it upon himſelf as a great fault, that he was more mov'd with the pompous ſort of Singing, than the thing ſung; and that he gave more reſpect to muſical Delights in the Church than was ſeemly; to which he was very prone; and which he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents as a great inconvenience of nicely manag'd artificial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in that part of Divine Worſhip. I wiſh thoſe who profeſs ſo great a Reverence for Antiquity, could but ſee the force of this Objection as coming from ſo noted a Father as St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:57917:16"/>

            <p>And now, Sir, what think you of Dr. <hi>Comber</hi>'s Aſſertion, that none objected againſt the Cathedral Service, till the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd? I doubt the Doctor would not willingly have them grac'd with ſuch Patrons as the Perſons mentioned.</p>
            <p>I know indeed 'twill be reply'd, that the forecited Cenſures were level'd againſt the Service of the Quire in the Popiſh Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: but till it can be made appear that it is even in our Proteſtant Churches free from the things excepted againſt, their Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have an equal force. And really, tho I have bin abroad, and had Opportunity of ſeeing the Popiſh way, yet (bating the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) I can diſcern little difference between their Worſhip and ours, as manag'd in our Cathedrals.</p>
            <p>I'll add one Authority more, which with ſome poſſibly may out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh all the reſt; and 'tis that of the 32 Commiſſioners, who were in the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 8. and <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. appointed by Act of Parliament to examine all Canons, Conſtitutions, and Ordinances, Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Synodal; and to draw up ſuch Laws Eccleſiaſtical, as ſhould be univerſally obſerv'd.
