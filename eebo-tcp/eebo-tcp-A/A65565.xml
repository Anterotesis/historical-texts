         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div type="account">
               <head>An Account of the Earthquake.</head>
               <p>IN <hi>Hodenſtein</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the circumjacent Countrey near the
Confines of <hi>Hungary,</hi> the winds had been exceeding high, and
the weather tempeſtuous; ſo that by the violence of thoſe blaſts the
Countrey men were much incommoded, ſome of their houſes were
uncovered, and many trees torn up by the roots. Theſe fierce winds
had not continued above a fortnight; but on the 10 of <hi>March,</hi> about
eleven of the clock, the winds were laid on a ſudden, and there was
a wonderful calm: but notwithſtanding this ſudden calm, the Sun
appeared not all that day. About 12 at night we all perceiv'd the
Earth to move, tremble and ſhake, and this trembling continued all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38220:3"/>
night, and until 10 of the clock the next morning, and then it ceas'd.
This movement of the earth did exceedingly terrifie and conſternate
the whole Village, and I dare ſafely avouch it upon my oath, that
there was not one perſon in the whole Town, but his fears and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of danger caus'd him to riſe and betake himſelf to his
prayers. On the next day, which was <hi>March</hi> the 11. the winds were
quiet and ſtill, and the Sun ſhew'd not himſelf all that day, and at
nine in the evening the earth began to tremble again, and continued
ſo all night until morning. The next day the Sun appear'd moſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly,
which remov'd our fears and apprehenſions, and added new
life to our conſternated ſouls. But we are certainly inform'd upon
the Atteſtations and Depoſitions of ſeveral credible and worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who were publickly examin'd about the truth of this matter,
that this <hi>Earthquake</hi> went by degrees and ſucceſſively as far as <hi>Buda</hi> in
<hi>Hungary;</hi> where on <hi>March</hi> 15. 'twas ſomthing more violent than with
us, but ſtill without any conſiderable miſchief to the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The diſcourſe of this <hi>Earthquake</hi> began now to be laid aſide, and
every one now forbore any further to diſcourſe of it, until the third
of <hi>April,</hi> when his Imperial Majeſties <hi>Envoy</hi> (who had ſome months
before been ſent to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court with an expreſs concerning
ſome important Affairs of the Empire) return'd, who gave a more
particular and fuller account of the progreſs, continuation and end
of this <hi>Earthquake,</hi> as alſo of the vehemency and diſmal effects of it,
as he had carefully remark'd them in his travels from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
to <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> This worthy Perſonage affirm'd, that about
ſix miles on this ſide <hi>Adrianople,</hi> there was a little Village on the ſide
of a hill, call'd by the <hi>Turk Imreſt,</hi> which was wholly abſorpt and
ſwallow'd up in the dreadful <hi>hiatus</hi> or opening of the earth, caus'd
by the violence of the <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and that ſtill there comes forth
great quantity of ſmoak, and in the night flames, to the great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and aſtoniſhment of the inhabitants round about. This noble
Perſon had not paſs'd half a days journey further, but he heard
more diſmal news of the dire effects of this vehement <hi>Earthquake.</hi>
Here he ſaw multitudes of people, men women and childring, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
about in a moſt deſolate and ſad condition, bemoaning bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their hard fortune, and the loſs of their eſtates and houſes which
were conſum'd by fire which broke out of the earth, and part of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38220:3"/>
houſes were abſorpt and ſwallow'd up by the opening of the ground.
Here was about ſeven ſmall Towns wholly conſum'd together, the
chief of which is call'd by the <hi>Turks Ingelters.</hi> The poor inhabitants
had timely notice of the enſuing calamity, for above three days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
before they deſerted the Villages, the Sun was obſcur'd and
darken'd, there was continual thundring, moſt dreadful concuſſions
and commotions of the earth, by the vehemence whereof moſt of the
houſes were pitiouſly defac'd and ſhatter'd. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> being
apprehenſive of the bad conſequents which might follow theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
ſigns, quitted their houſes, and betook themſelves to the open
plains: and it was well they did ſo, for the very night following <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
Nature</hi> fell again into a moſt terrible Convulſion, her very
bowels were rent aſunder by Subterranean fire, ſmoak and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
blaſts of wind; fire was vomited up, and ſuch a continual
and huge quantity of ſmoak, that for ſome days together it almoſt
wholly obſcur'd the Sun.</p>
               <p>As this Perſon of Honor paſs'd along towards <hi>Belgrade,</hi> he ſaw no
more conſiderable miſchief produc'd by this Concuſſion of the
earth, until within almoſt a days journey of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> upon the plains
of <hi>Siuſdt,</hi> where there was a vaſt <hi>Chaſma</hi> or aperture of the ground,
caus'd by the impetuous eruption of theſe Subterraneous blaſts: but
here was no belching up of flames, no ſmoak, or any other diſmal
effect, beſides a vaſt <hi>hiatus,</hi> or opening of the ground only. Neither
the <hi>Envoy</hi> nor any of his Attendants were ſo hardy as to approach
this <hi>Chaſma</hi> to look into it, or give us any further account of it. In
ſeveral Towns &amp; Villages the houſes were much ſhatter'd in all his
journey along to <hi>Buda.</hi> But from <hi>Buda</hi> to <hi>Germany</hi> the effects of the
Earthquake were very inconſiderable, the earth only trembling and
ſhaking, but not ſo much as one houſe ruin'd.</p>
               <p>It is evident by what we ſaw with our own eyes at <hi>Hodenſlein,</hi> and
what this <hi>Imperial Envoy</hi> remark'd in his voyage from <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
to <hi>Vienna,</hi> that this was all one <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and that 'twas caus'd
by an impetuous ſpirit or blaſt of wind included in the bowels and
caverns of the earth, which run ſo many hundreds of miles through
the blind caverns of the earth, before it could get vent. You may
find a parallel example of the like continuation of an <hi>Earthquake,</hi>
even from <hi>Hungary</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> reported by the noble and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38220:4"/>
learned <hi>Aug. Giſlenius</hi> of <hi>Busbeck (vide Busbequii Epiſt. 3. de Legat
Turcic. pag.</hi> 147.) which was about 100 years ago in the reign of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi>
the <hi>Magnificent,</hi> to whom <hi>Busbequius</hi> was ſent by this Court
as <hi>Ordinary Ambaſſador.</hi> Thus much concerning matter of fact, and
concerning the late great Earthquake in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Turky.</hi> Now I
intend briefly to lay down the Sentiments and Opinions of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
concerning the nature, the different ſpecies, and the ſeveral
cauſes of Earthquakes in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> in his <hi>Natural Queſtions (lib.</hi> 6.) and <hi>Pliny</hi> in his <hi>Natural
Hiſtory (lib. 2. cap.</hi> 79.) unanimouſly conclude, that an <hi>Earthquake</hi> is
the very ſame thing in the earth, that a <hi>Thunderclap</hi> is in the clouds,
and that the <hi>hiatus</hi> and <hi>rupture</hi> is caus'd when the tumultuous blaſt
or ſpirit impetuouſly breaks forth and gains its liberty. And this is
partly the Sentiment of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the whole School of <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
as is evident in their Works and Writings, who generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
the efficient cauſe of Earthquakes to be ſubterranean and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous
blaſts of winds, included in the bowels and caverns of
the earth, and violently forcing a paſſage out. <hi>Thales Maleſius</hi> that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Philoſopher affirm'd, that water was the cauſe of <hi>Earthquakes.</hi>
This man, as <hi>Seneca</hi> reports of him (<hi>Natur. Queſt. lib. 6. c.</hi> 6.) did aſſert,
that water was the firſt principle of all things, and that the whole
earth did float up and down upon the Ocean like a huge Veſſel or
Ship, and that an <hi>Earthquake</hi> was nothing elſe but a violent agitation
or toſſing of the earth upon the Sea. The chief reaſon which mov'd
<hi>Thales</hi> to embrace this opinion, was, becauſe in many great <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes</hi>
there is an eruption of new ſprings, fountains and rivers. See
more of this opinion in the fore-cited place of <hi>Seneca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> in the enſuing Chapter, tells us of ſome other Philoſophers
who affirm'd, that water was the efficient cauſe of <hi>Earthquakes;</hi> but
not after the ſame manner as <hi>Thales</hi> maintain'd. Theſe men were of
opinion, that in the bowels of the earth there was an immenſe quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of water, vaſt lakes, and ponds, and navigable rivers; and that this
Subterranean water was the material cauſe of the eruption and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
emanation of ſprings and fountains in divers parts of the
world: and that theſe Subterranean waters by their perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and courſe, did by degrees eat away and conſume their banks,
and undermine the pillars and foundations of the earth; ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence

that when theſe pillars of the earth fall, there neceſſarily
follows a ſinking, collapſion or concuſſion of the earth: and thus
they ſay <hi>Earthquakes</hi> are caus'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> in his 9 <hi>Chapter</hi> tells us, that ſome of the Ancients affirm'd,
Subterranean fire to be the cauſe of <hi>Earthquakes:</hi> which by burning,
waſting and conſuming the inward parts of the earth, cauſes a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or ſudden ſinking down of ſome parts of the Earth. So that by
theſe mens reckoning the Subterranean fire doth cauſe an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
<hi>ruina &amp; collapſu partium,</hi> by the ſudden fall or ſubſidence of
the earth, when its props and pillars are conſum'd by ſire. And they
endeavour to make this opinion probable by alledging and inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
that in ſeveral <hi>Earthqukes</hi> there has been great and terrible
eruptions of fire, flame and ſmoak from out of the <hi>Chaſmata</hi> and
<hi>apertures</hi> of the earth.</p>
               <p>The ſame Author in the 14 <hi>Chapter</hi> of his ſixth Book of <hi>Natural
Queſtions</hi> tells us, that there were ſome Philoſophers who held, that
the earth was a living Creature, endu'd with a rational ſoul, and
conſequently with ſenſe and motion, ſo that an <hi>Earthquake</hi> was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a <hi>ſudden Qualm</hi> or <hi>Trembling</hi> of this huge Animal; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a <hi>Convulſion Fit,</hi> or <hi>Madam Nature</hi> oppreſs'd with the <hi>Fit of an
Ague.</hi> And this opinion was embrac'd and defended by many of
the <hi>Pythygorean, Platonick</hi> and <hi>Stoick Philoſophers,</hi> who generally
held the earth to be a <hi>living Creature.</hi>

                  <hi>Calliſthenes</hi> a learned man, and an intimate Companion to <hi>Great

man ſays, that vapors and winds do inſinuate into the blind ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
of the earth, which afterwards being pent in, and finding no

he ſays happens moſt frequently to maritime Countreys. And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
it is from hence that <hi>Homer</hi> calls <hi>Neptune</hi>

               <p>Among modern Authors, <hi>Cardanus</hi> a learned Phyſician of <hi>Milan</hi>
in <hi>Italy</hi> denies (in his Book <hi>de Subtilitate, lib.</hi> 2.) all theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Ancients, and thinks that neither Air, Earth or Water
are the efficient cauſes of an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> but he aſſerts, that 'tis
caus'd by Fire; <hi>i. e.</hi> by Brimſtone and other Subterranean Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
that participate of the nature of Gunpowder; and when theſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38220:5"/>

of this great Earthquake.</head>
               <p>THis <hi>Earthquake,</hi> as has been already related, began on <hi>March</hi> laſt paſt at
<hi>Hodenſtein,</hi> a Town in <hi>Germany,</hi> and near the confines of <hi>Hungary</hi> (the
place of my preſent abode:) It began, I ſay, in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in a matter of
14 or 15 days ran through the blind caverns and paſſages of the earth even
to the very heart of the <hi>Turkiſh Empire:</hi> the Subterranean ſpirit forbearing to
break forth or vent its malice upon Chriſtians, but reſerving its moſt prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fury for the wretched <hi>Mahometans.</hi> When I reflect upon theſe things, why
may we not conclude, that this portends good and proſperous ſucceſs to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and that the powes of Hell are kept in, and not permitted to vex or diſquiet
<hi>Chriſtendom?</hi> If this Subterranean ſpirit was forcibly kept in, and not ſuffer'd
to break forth upon Chriſtians, but fain to run ſo many hundred of miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it could force its paſſage out of the bowels of the earth, and then to bring
ſuch deſolation and calamity to the miſerable <hi>Turks,</hi> why may we not conclude,
that this does plainly ſignifie, that the infernal powers ſhall be converted and
turn'd againſt one another, and that the <hi>miſcreant Turks</hi> by inteſtine wars and
diviſions ſhall tear the very heart of the <hi>Ottoman Empire</hi> in ſunder? Again, if
the <hi>Subterranean ſpirits</hi> and <hi>Infernal powers</hi> afflict and perſecute the <hi>Turk,</hi> why
may we not alſo conclude, that the Celeſtial powers, and the Stars in their courſes
ſhall aſſiſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> &amp; fight againſt this <hi>Siſer<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> this enemy of the Lord of hoſts?</p>
               <p>For my part, although I pretend to no gift of Prophecy, yet methinks by
theſe great commotions of the earth it does evidently and manifeſtly appear that
this <hi>Luciferan Emperor of the Turks</hi> is ſuddenly to be humbled and brought
down. He that has hitherto been invincible, and proudly inſulted over Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Kings and Princes, now the very earth (the loweſt, baſeſt and vileſt of all
Creatures) ſcorns to bear him, and begins to ſhake him off. Now (good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Readers conſider) now, I ſay, when the very earth, the loweſt, the baſeſt
and dulleſt of all Creatures, does with ſuch vigour, and ſo much animoſity
denounce open war againſt this great Enemy of Chriſtianity, why do Chriſtian
Princes ſit ſtill, and not conjoyn their forces in this very nick of time? Now
when the <hi>Subterranean ſpirit</hi> makes a paſſage through the blind caverns of the
earth, and travels ſo many hundreds of miles under ground, that he may <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jori
impetu</hi> with more fury atsacque the very heart of the <hi>Ottoman Empire</hi>
Why do Chriſtians ſit ſtill, and not come from the uttermoſt parts of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom
to aſſail this proud Tyrant? <hi>So let the Enemies of the Lord periſh.</hi>
