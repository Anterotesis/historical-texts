         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>On the occasion of the Intimation of a

Passed upon Mr <hi>JOHN GIBSON,</hi> late
<hi>Incumbent</hi> there.</p>
            <p>According to the Order of the Brethren of the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> of

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>The Text, Ezra 9. 9.</bibl>
               <q>For we were bondmen, yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but
hath extended mercy unto us, in the sight of the Kings of Persia, to give us a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
to set up the House of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and
to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WE think it not needful to resume what the Author of this Sermon delivered
in way of Introduction to his Text, it being so obvious to any that art ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Scripture story, that at this time, when <hi>Ezra</hi> appeared so Active
and concerned for the publick Interest of his Nation, the People of God were now
under a begun Deliverance from the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, and in thoughts of
improving the present Season for <hi>Restoring and repairing the Desolations
in</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jerusalem. Therefore passing any farther <hi>Preface,</hi> we come
now to enter upon the <hi>Text,</hi> as he Divided, Explained and Prosecuted it.</p>
            <p>1, WE have in this Text, a Reflection on the past Calamitous
condition of the People of God. <hi>We were Bondmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2, We have a grateful acknowledgement, of their present more
comfortable Condition. which is amplified in two or three Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.

                  <item>2, But hath extended mercy to us in the sight of the Kings of Persia.</item>
                  <item>3, Hath given us a reviving.</item>
                  <item>4, Hath given us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.</item>
               </list>
3, We have also in the Text, the <hi>End</hi> why God gave them a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving,
or the Improvement pointed at, that they should make of the
opportunity of a breathing Time put in their Hand.

                  <item>1, To set up the House of God.</item>
                  <item>2, To repair the Desolations thereof.</item>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the Kings of Persia] i. e.</hi> Our
God who hath the Hearts of Kings, and of all Men in his Hand, to
turn and sway them as he pleaseth, hath so influenced and inclined
even the <hi>Heathen</hi> Kings, to Act and Do in favours of his Church, that
herein lies a great deal of the <hi>Wonder</hi> and <hi>Mistery</hi> of this <hi>Mercy,</hi> that
God hath imployed such <hi>Tools</hi> and <hi>Instruments,</hi> to accomplish his Great
and Gracious Purposes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:103994:3"/>
               <hi>By the reviving in their bondage</hi>] Here we may understand, either Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Inspirations of the Almighty, whereby they were quickned from
a backsliden Languide Disposition of Spirit, to set about the Work of
the Lord in Earnestness and Zeal, hence <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 5. We read that
God raised the Spirits of the chief of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>Priests</hi> and
the <hi>Levites</hi> to build the House of the Lord; or rather we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Lord's giving them Freedom and Deliverance from the
Thraldom and Tyranny of their cruel Enemies, who had long keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in hard Bondage and Captivity, which was to them as a
Resurrection from the Bands of Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To set up] i. e.</hi> To raise out of the Rubbish, and restore to a fair and
more splendid Condition; but more afterward for the explication of
this Clause.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The House of God] i. e.</hi> The material Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where God
used to Dwell in the Symbols and Manifestations of his presence. <hi>Hagg.</hi>
1. 8. 2. 7. <hi>Go up to the mountain and bring wood, and build the House, and I
will fill it with Glory. And give us a wall</hi>] Some understand thereby the
<hi>Favour</hi> of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> whose <hi>Edicts</hi> so especially concerning them,
were under God, their Bulwark and Security against the Efforts of
their malicious Enemies, who essayed by all means to impede their
Settlement and Welfare: Others rather understand, the protection of
the Watchful and propitious Providence of God, who is said to be <hi>A
wall of fire round about Jerusalem.</hi> Zech. 2. 4, 5. <hi>Doctrine.</hi> When God
in his merciful Providence, gives a Reviving and Breathing Time, or
a fair Opportunity, we should put to our Hands to set up, and repair
the House of God. To this piece of Wisdom and Duty <hi>Mordecai</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
<hi>Esther chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 31, 14. And saith the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>As
we have therefore oportunity, let us do good.—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In prosecution of <hi>this</hi> Doctrinal Observation, we will give some <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> of the Doctrine, which may be improven as so many <hi>Arguments</hi> and
<hi>Incentives</hi> to ply the Duty pointed at in our Text, and then we will
come to some Use and practical Application of the Point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reasons</hi> why we should improve an Opportunity to set up and repair
the House of God.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Reason,</hi> We may come to incurr the Character of Foolish and
Unwise towards God, if we slipp an <hi>Opportune</hi> offer of Providence to
advance the House of God. A great deal of <hi>Wisedom</hi> lies in knowing
and discerning a fit <hi>Season</hi> for Action, and no less <hi>Prudence</hi> and Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the active improvement of a seasonable <hi>Juncture;</hi> But he is a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103994:3"/>
very Fool, sayes the <hi>Wise-man,</hi> who hath a price in his Hand to get
Wisdom, yet hath no Heart to it. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 16.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Reason, Opportunity</hi> is precious, but <hi>passing,</hi> of great value but <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
like the <hi>Wind,</hi> we know not how soon it may change; therefore
will all wise and considering Men, strike in with Time and Tide, that
neither by Power or Policy can be gained to await our Leisure or
Pleasure; But moreover as <hi>Opportunity</hi> is in a moment <hi>variable,</hi> so for
ever <hi>irrecoverable,</hi> therefore sayes the wise <hi>Cato lib.</hi> 2. <hi>distich.</hi> 26.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Rem tibi quam noscis aptam, dimittere nolis,</l>
               <l>Fronte capillata, sed post occasio calva.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> seems to mind us of the same thing, when he
advises <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. to be not sloathful in Business, fervent in Spirit
serving the Lord, where, for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> many Greek Impressions
have <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>i. e.</hi> Improving the present <hi>season</hi> of Service.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Reason,</hi> If we neglect an <hi>Opportunity</hi> of setting up the <hi>House</hi> of our
God in this our day, our <hi>Posterity</hi> may come to pay dear for our Error,
and will <hi>Curse and Abhor our memory;</hi> our Bowels should be stirred in
thoughts of these that come of our Bowels, that we entail not upon
them Spiritual Plagues and Punishments, that ordinarly follow the
want of Gospel Ordinances, it were better we left them unprovided of
Estates and Fortunes for their Temporal happiness, then endanger
them of wanting the helps and means of atchieving their Souls eternal
Felicity, O let us dread bringing forth a seed to the Murderer.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>R,</hi> The <hi>Laws of the God of Heaven</hi> are express that we should sett <hi>up
the House of the God of Heaven,</hi> and should not his Charge and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
have weight with us, to Sway and Perswade us to our Work?
<hi>Ezr:</hi> 7: 23. <hi>Hag:</hi> 1: 8.</p>
            <p>5 <hi>R,</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> severely <hi>Challenges</hi> and Threatnes the Negligent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
<hi>God</hi> is hudgly Offended when a People either in disrespect of <hi>him,</hi>
or overrespect to their own <hi>Interests</hi> and <hi>Projects,</hi> are carless of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns;
O! unworthy of the Priviledge of admission into the House of
<hi>God,</hi> who so far contemn the <hi>God</hi> of their Privileges, as to carrie In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
in his Work and Affairs, 'tis surely the greatest Priviledge
the Creature can be capable of to be Instrumental for the Honor and
service of the <hi>Creator;</hi> yet behold as if there were not a <hi>God</hi> or <hi>God</hi>
had no Work for Men in the World, the People of the World mind
so much their own things, that the things of <hi>God</hi> has smal share of
their cares. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2: 31. At which kind of People we may be assured,
<hi>God</hi> is verie angrie, as may be gathered from his way of upbraiding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103994:4"/>
such, <hi>Hag:</hi> 1: 4, 5: <hi>Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ciled houses, and
this house lie waste?</hi> and v: 9: He plaugeth them, <hi>because of mine House
that is wast, and ye run every Man unto his own House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6 <hi>Reason,</hi> To obviate Dicouragments, and Encourage the faint and
fearful, <hi>God</hi> hath graciously <hi>Promised his presence</hi> and Assistance; and
who would not be Workers together with <hi>God,</hi> or who needs to fear
the misgiveing of a Work, at which is the Hand of the Almighty
<hi>Hagg:</hi> 1: 13. 2. 4. 5. 9. 10. <hi>&amp;c. Chron:</hi> 22. 11: 17. 19.</p>
            <p>7 <hi>Reason,</hi> We will be <hi>Brought to an account</hi> of our Neglected, slighted
Opportunities; every good <hi>Talent</hi> of God, is a treasure committed to
our <hi>Trust,</hi> with our Mal and Misimprovments whereof we will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
be charged in the great day of Count and Reckoning <hi>Math:</hi>
29. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After a long time the Lord of those servants cometh and rek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth
with them.</p>
            <p>Now as we proposed, we come to some practical Improvment of
this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. of <hi>Information,</hi> what, <hi>Setting up the House of God</hi> doth Imply 1:
In order to setting up, there must be a <hi>carrying away the rubbish</hi> that is
ready to Impede the Work, or a Purging of the House of God; ye
know this is very Usual and Obvious to your daily Observations, that
when an old Ruinous House is about to be repaired, the first Piece of
Work is to remove the heaps of Redd and Rubish that so there may
be fair Ground to go upon for Leying the Foundation and rearing up
the <hi>Superstructure,</hi> and therefore 2. <hi>Chron:</hi> 29: 5. We read of <hi>Carrying
forth the filthiness out of the holy place,</hi> and also 2 Chron: 34. 3: 8. <hi>Iosiah
purged Iudah and Jerusal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m from the high Places, and Purged the Land and
the House, and then Repaired the House of the Lord his God.</hi> To our purpose
we may also apply a passage Nehem: 4: 10. <hi>The strength of the Bearers
of Burdens is decayed, and there is mucb Rubbish, so that we are not able to
Build the Wall;</hi> Now my Friends with an alas, I desire to make a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
on this Scripture, applaying it to our selves at this time, I
say alas for we have few Bearers of Burdens; and these that are seem
either to want strength, or to want skill, or to want will which is
worst of all; I grant there is need both of much Grace, and of much
Witt, how to Manage this hard Piece of Work of <hi>Purging</hi> the House
of God, there are so many obvious <hi>Dangers,</hi> and Insuperable like
Difficulties on all hands, <hi>hinc illae Lachrymae! but heroick Zeal will say
fiat Justitia, ruat Coelum; floreat Religio, ruat Mundus,</hi> let all go to all, let
Gods Honour still <hi>be minded,</hi> let <hi>Gods way</hi> still be followed, this is our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103994:4"/>
               <hi>Providence,</hi> this is our <hi>Wisdome,</hi> this is our undoubted <hi>Interest, he that
walks uprightly, walks surely.</hi> I would also have you to advert to what
the Lord sayes, Ezek. 20. 37, 30. <hi>That when he brings his People into the
bond of the Covenant, he will purge out from among them the Rebells;</hi> and who
may justly be reputed Rebels, by Declaring, Swearing, and Railing
against God, and Religion in the power of it? &amp;c. <hi>Verbum sapienti fas
est.</hi> 2 <hi>Setting up</hi> doth imply a preparing of Materials for the Work,
and to work by. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. Throughout. 3. <hi>Setting up</hi> doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imply, a falling closs to work, every Man doing something in his
Place and Station, for rearing up and repairing the <hi>House of God,</hi> as
we use to say, <hi>in communi periculo, omnis homo miles,</hi> so, <hi>in opere communi,
omnis homo opifex.</hi> This is both a Shame and a Sin, when there is so
much work to be done, and that of so common and great concern,
that yet any should be found to stand all the day idle; though I wish
that on the contrare extreme, some may not be found to be too too
busie, endeavouring to cast down as fast as is built; But, to return
again, that every Bodie should contribute their share of service, to
their Ability, within their proper Sphere, I hope all serious Godly
Persons will easily grant, for God is calling aloud at this day, to <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel,</hi>
to <hi>Joshua,</hi> and to all the <hi>People</hi> of the Land to work, and <hi>build
the House of the Lord,</hi> Hagg. 1. 8. 2. 4. And this leads us to another use.</p>
            <p>2. Use of Exhortation, To two or three sorts of Folk, to put to their
Hands to set up the <hi>House of God.</hi> And first, be exhorted <hi>O ye Magistrates,</hi>
whom God hath advanced to a <hi>Sphere of Activity</hi> above others, to set
up the <hi>House of God;</hi> 'tis no disparagement to you, were ye higher
then the highest upon Earth, to stoup if it were so low as to remove
the filthiness of the Sanctuary, in that way that is proper and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
for you, the <hi>greatest</hi> of Men, the <hi>best</hi> of Men have been thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
Employed, as <hi>David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Josiah, Nehemiah,
Zerubbabel,</hi> all Kings and principal Rulers, eminent in their day both
for <hi>Power, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Piety;</hi> O <hi>Magistrates,</hi> I say appear and Act,
foreward in this Work. 1. Because your example will mightily work
upon the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and may sway others to do as ye do; If a <hi>Prince,</hi> or
<hi>Royal Person</hi> venture himself in the Front of a Battle, how doth it ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the <hi>Inferiour Souldiery,</hi> and put Spirits in the dullest Souls to r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
sharers of his Dangers; if the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of a City stand brisk and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
for the <hi>Ancient Pridiledges</hi> of it, what backing does there present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear of the concerned <hi>Citizens,</hi> ready to venture their All for the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103994:5"/>
same cause; I say again the Influence of the <hi>Magistrates example</hi> is most
Forcible and Operative. <hi>Regis ad exemplum totus componitur Orbis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Because they are most <hi>able</hi> to <hi>perfect great things to purpose,</hi> when
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> make a happy Concurrance together, O what mighty
Feats will they atchieve, when <hi>Piety</hi> without <hi>Power</hi> will avail very little
(I mean with respect to those, who want a solid Principle of Grace to
work by) for the <hi>Sword of Steell</hi> will do more then the <hi>Sword of the Spirit</hi>
with the most part of Men, <hi>the Word of God,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastick Discipline</hi>
being much in contempt with this perverse Generation, and I will not
say, but some Reason of this may be, because the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi>
has to do with <hi>Rebels,</hi> but the <hi>Sword of steell</hi> with <hi>Subjects,</hi> at least
who fain subjection for fear of Hazard; Now, <hi>O ye Magistrates,</hi>
seing God hath put <hi>Power</hi> in your Hand, ye should not bear the <hi>Sword</hi>
in vain, but imploy it in a suitable way to your calling, to help fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the work of the Lord. 3. Because God has <hi>deputed</hi> you for
this effect to act as his <hi>Vicegerents</hi> and <hi>Representives,</hi> so that as ye
cannot but know, that God is concerned to have his House set up
and Repaired for the glory of his great Name, after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
should ye account it your Concern to do in his Name
and Authority, what is Incumbent one you for the same Purpose.
And on this occasion O ye Inferior <hi>Magistrates, I</hi> tell you, there lies an
undeniably great part of the Encouradgment to move in this Work,
Seeing God has given us a <hi>King</hi> in his mercie, so happily disposed, as to
see to the Settlment and Consult the welfare of Gods Church in the
Land, which is one of the greatest Blessings that Gracious Bountifull
Providence hath conferred on this Unworthy Unthankful Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
And to be sure all that think themselves concerned in the Peace
and Prosperitie of <hi>Zion,</hi> in their Daily addresses to the Throne of Grace,
do seriously Pray, GOD Save King VVILLIAM and
Queen MARY, and overthrow all their Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
Be exhorted. <hi>O Ministers to set up the House of God.</hi> You special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stand interessed in <hi>this Work,</hi> by your peculiar <hi>Charge</hi> and <hi>Character,</hi>
ye may remember how Zealous was <hi>Jehojeda,</hi> how active was <hi>Ezra,</hi>
and how concerned was <hi>Joshua</hi> the <hi>High Priest;</hi> For <hi>Church-men,</hi> not to
be concerned for the <hi>Church,</hi> were a strange thing, for <hi>Builders</hi> not to
help in the <hi>building,</hi> what a Crime and Infamy were it, <hi>deserving to be
extruded</hi> the House of God for ever; And first, <hi>O ye Ministers,</hi> a part of
your work is, to tell who are <hi>Enemies</hi> of the Work, and what are the
Stopes and Impediments of it. <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 1. <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>to</hi> 7 <hi>verse.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:103994:5"/>
4. 14, 15. Another part of your <hi>Work</hi> is, <hi>To pray for God's Blessing on
the Work,</hi> that the Labourers may come good speed and prosper; with
Zeal and Wrestling should ye Pray over this Prayer: <hi>Psal.</hi> 122. 6, 7,
8, 9. <hi>Pray for the Peace of Jerusalem,</hi> even that Peace may be within her
Walls, and Prosperity within her Palaces, <hi>and seek the Good of the House
of the Lord our God forever.</hi> 3. <hi>Encourage the People</hi> with the most Proper
and pressing <hi>Arguments</hi> ye can Invent, that you may Excite and Stirr
them up to Zeal, Courage and Activity; O what an Incredible back-sett
may the work of the Lord sustain from dashes and discouragements
at the Hands of <hi>Ministers,</hi> who should lift up the Hands that hang down
and confirme the feeble Knees, <hi>Hag:</hi> 2: 4: 4ly: <hi>Ministers</hi> should not only
<hi>say</hi> to others, <hi>do thus, and thus,</hi> but themselves should <hi>Do as they say,</hi> they
must also Work, and Work more aboundantly. In the last roome,
<hi>People of all Rankes and Degrees</hi> should assist in <hi>Setting up the House of God,</hi>
that which concerneth all, all should be concerned in, not only <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats
and Ministers</hi> share of the Priviledges of the House of God, but all
the <hi>People</hi> of the Lord. <hi>Ezr:</hi> 1: 5.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Vse of Caution,</hi> Having exhorted to set up the House of God, I
would have you cautioned against two or three sorts of Folk, who I fear
may prove <hi>unluckie</hi> and <hi>unmeet Tools</hi> for this work, if not <hi>Opposites;</hi> you
may see <hi>Ezra</hi> 4 What was the Temptation of the Builders of the
House of God at that time, and how they behaved towards their crafty
disembling Adversaries. They came to <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and to the chief
of the Fathers, and said unto them, let us Build with you for we seek
your God as ye do, you see here their fair plausible Pretensions, but
their underhand design was, to weaken the Hands of the People of
<hi>Judah,</hi> and to trouble them in Building, and frustrate their purpose,
but the People of God being aware of their ill designes, return them
this Answer, <hi>You have nothing to do with us, to build an house unto our GOD,
but we our selves together will build unto the Lord;</hi> v: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. From
whence we may learn that we cannot be cautious enough; Therefore,
I, <hi>have a care of these that had an active hand in casting down the house of
GOD;</hi> such are not to be trusted, except we see some eminent appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of their serious Repentance, and grief for their former ill
Deeds. 'Tis true, <hi>Paul</hi> preached the Faith that once he destroyed, and
persecuted, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 23. But it is as true, he had a sound through Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for the Havock he made of the Church of God, and gives
this satisfying Demonstration of his seriousness and candor therein, that
to his own shame he leaves on publick record, <hi>in futuram rei memoriam,</hi>
a particular Confession of his Impieties and Scandals. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103994:6"/>
am not meet to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God;</hi> and
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>I was before a Blasphemer, a Persecuter, and Injurious;</hi> And
it is also true that <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 26. When <hi>Saul</hi> essayed to joyn himself unto
the Disciples, they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he
was a Disciple; they were not too credulous, neither would they trust
before they tried. 2. <hi>Have a care of Gallios and Neutralists,</hi> who have laid
it down as a Principle of their Religion, to be keen for no Religion;
O but these of this stamp be Odious and Useless, unworthy to live in
God's World, they are unprofitable burdens of the Earth. Such readily
in all the Stirrs and Revolutions that are about Religion, carry with a
piece of <hi>Carelesness</hi> and <hi>Indifferency,</hi> whither Religion sink or swime;
Would you know <hi>Gallios Motto,</hi> this is it, <hi>Floreat Religio, nil mihi curae;
Ruat Religio, nec mihi curae; mea est Religio, curare meipsum;</hi> ye need not much
care for such carless ones, for they care not whether ye care for them, or
not, neither does the care of the Churches any thing toutch their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<hi>and</hi> Gallio <hi>cared for none of those things</hi> Acts 18: 17. 3. <hi>Have a care of
the greedie mammonist,</hi> whose heart and Soul seemes to be sett upon <hi>Gold,</hi>
not upon <hi>God,</hi> or upon <hi>Gold</hi> for his <hi>God,</hi> never expect that Man will
give <hi>Gold</hi> to Build <hi>the Sanctuary,</hi> who makes <hi>Gold his Sanctuary</hi> trusting
in uncertain Riches; a gripping <hi>Worldling</hi> will not quite a gripp of
any thing to Build the House of God, for he is a Man much concerned,
to add Field to Field, and House to House, so <hi>That could he gett a claught
of the House of God it self,</hi> he would <hi>Sacrilegiouslie add it to his Inheritance;</hi>
they are deceived who look for a good turn in the work of GOD, from
an avaricious, gripping worldling. 4. <hi>Have a care of the craftie politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi>
he is too <hi>politick to be pious;</hi> he has his <hi>own house and familie to build,</hi>
though it were upon the <hi>ruines of the house of GOD;</hi> Interest, <hi>Interest is
the great Diana of such Ephesians;</hi> The <hi>Politician</hi> may pretend fair for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but expect it no longer than Religion has <hi>fair weather;</hi> he will
seem to build the house of GOD, but only, when the foundation is
the Princes favour to the Work; dyes his King? his Religion dies
with him, and he turns <hi>Sceptick in the interreigne,</hi> till he see what Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the next King professes, and of that Religion will he be, be it good
or bad, for this is the <hi>Politicians maxime</hi> he goes by, to be still of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
that is upmost, and obtaines in the <hi>Chappel Royal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly, Have a care of debauched Profanists,</hi> whose life and conversation is
checkered with Vices and Immoralities, such will be so far from setting
up the work, that if there were no more but their guilt and sins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived
at, 'tis enough to procure GODS displeasure against the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and eat the stones of the wall, and consume the timber of the house;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103994:6"/>
Men that have been notoriously debauched, and have given no satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appearances of Repentance, should not be entrusted, or honoured
with such a piece of service. A very Heathen could say, <hi>procul, hinc,
procul esto profani.</hi> Now to come to a close of this subject in the last place
I offer to the consideration of those that are concerned to set up the
house of GOD, some few Directions as to the manner and way of
managing their work.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Direction,</hi> Set up the house of GOD <hi>unanimouslie,</hi> with that concord,
good agreement, and oneness in mind and Measures that is desireable
and necessary, <hi>Vnity,</hi> is the Bond of <hi>Society,</hi> and keeps all the several
parts conjoyned iu one firm compact Body; many Hands makes
light work, if they draw all one way, but if they draw contrare wayes
one to another, they will either pull the Rope in pieces, or pull one
another down to the Ground; Many Shoulders with their united
strength may carry a great Burden, the which may come to break the
Back of but one or two Bearers; O how good a thing it is, to see Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
build a House together in Peace, and also to see them dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in Peace in the House which they have Built; as <hi>Vnity</hi> is the
Cement of <hi>Society,</hi> so <hi>Division</hi> is the <hi>Destructon</hi> of it, a House divided
against it self cannot stand, so Builders divided among themselves shall
never bring a Structure to the Copestone, it was the division of Tongues
that putt a stopp to the Building of Babel; Let us fear the Errors of
others who have Marred their Work with their Jarrs and Janglings,
therefore to this Purpose is that Text, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6: 7. there was neither
Hammer, nor Ax, nor any Tool of Iron heard in the House while it
was in Building, upon which take Mr <hi>Pool</hi>'s Exposition, this says he
is of Mystical signification, that it is the duety of the Builders of the
Church, as farr as in them lyes, to take care that no noise of contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or division, or violence be heard in that Sacred Building, <hi>Ezra</hi>
3: 1. Tells us when the People were to meet about Building the
Temple, they gathered themselves together as one Man to <hi>Jerusalem;</hi>
Mind also what the Historian sayes, <hi>Concordia, res parvae crescunt, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia
maxima dilabuntur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Direction,</hi> Sett up the House of God <hi>Prudently and Discretly, Prudence</hi>
forsees evil things, and evites them, and secures against them, she also
industriously provides good things, and carefully preserves them; <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
freely passeth from <hi>Punctilios,</hi> least there be a loss, or prejudice in
things of <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Consequence; Prudence</hi> leisurely Deliberats, and
quickly Dispatcheth Business, <hi>Prudence</hi> rather suffers Injuries, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously
persecutes Offenders, in all cases <hi>Prudence</hi> is as a Moderatrix,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103994:7"/>
to Consult, Guide, and Direct how to use the best means, to attain the
best Ends and Purposes; what should I say more, I find its <hi>Imprudence</hi> in
me, to essay the Commendation of <hi>Prudence,</hi> I can say so little to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
being defective in <hi>Experience.</hi> But alas after all that can be said,
here lies a great difficulty, to judge and discern <hi>What is true Prudence;</hi>
with the most part <hi>Carnal Policy</hi> passes for <hi>Prudence,</hi> and that wisdom of
the World, that advanceth worldly Interests, that Master-piece of
truest <hi>Prudence</hi> is too much neglected, he that walketh uprightly walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
surely; Godly <hi>Simplicity</hi> is nick-named <hi>Silliness,</hi> and <hi>Fraud and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
pass for Prudentials.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Direction, <hi>Set up the House of God Zealously,</hi> and with a fervent
mind; <hi>Zeal</hi> is an active Principle that prompts to forwardness in action;
<hi>Zeal</hi> transcends all Difficulties, and briskly carries through Troops of
Discouragements; <hi>Zeal</hi> makes a Man mind the things of God, with
the hazard of neglecting his own; <hi>Zeal!</hi> Alas <hi>Zeal</hi> where is it? It seems
to be cooled and gone; yea <hi>Zeal</hi> is fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uted at all Hands, and a strick
Godly <hi>Zealot stigmatized</hi> with the most <hi>Odious Characters; Zeal</hi> is buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under the Moold and Earth of <hi>Carnal Prudence,</hi> and this so Deified
in our Day, that <hi>Zeal</hi> must be sacrificed to her Devotion, and for her
pleasure this <hi>Heavenly Fire</hi> extinguished; However we see that a Spirit
of <hi>Zeal</hi> has been wont to be at work in the dayes of Old, esp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cially in
turning times. <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 21, 22. 36, 5, 6. <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. 68. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 4. 6.
And sayes the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>It is good to be Zealously affected al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in a good thing,</hi> And what better thing can we be <hi>Zealous</hi> in, then
the setting up and repairing the House of God?</p>
            <p>5. Direct. <hi>Set up the house of</hi> GOD <hi>dependingly,</hi> looking unto GOD for Counsel, Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Assistance; 'tis GOD who gives the work-men, He sendeth forth Labourers; 'tis
GOD who gives to will and to work of his good pleasure; He works all our works in us, and
for us; and to be sure if we depend not on him in all our Essayes in his work, our work is <hi>but
labour in vain,</hi> Psal. 127. 1. <hi>Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Direct. <hi>Set up the house of GOD Prayerfully,</hi> ordinatly a building time with the People of
GOD is also a <hi>Praying and Wrestling time,</hi> upon the first Intentions that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
the D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>solations of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he makes his Prayer to GOD to prosper his Project
and Enterprize, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 11. compared with <hi>chap.</hi> 2 <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 5. and <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 8, 9. when the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
conspired to hinder the work, we made our Prayer unto Our GOD, says <hi>Nehemiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Direct. <hi>Set up the house of GOD univeariedly,</hi> going on with the work till it come to a
happie Period; look <hi>Nehem.</hi> 4 21, 23. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 58.</p>
            <p>Now my Friends, having thus at large Discoursed of <hi>Setting up and Repairing the house
of GOD,</hi> I leave you with <hi>Davids</hi> pithy Prayer, and excellent exhortation to his son <hi>Solomon.</hi>
Psal. 51. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 1. Chron 22. 16. <hi>O Lord do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion, build thou
the walls of Jerusalem: Arise therefore and be doing, and the Lord be with thee.</hi> Amen.</p>
