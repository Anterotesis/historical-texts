            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This made him professe a daily <hi>Commerce with Angels,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, the terrible <hi>Fits</hi> incident to his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,</hi> as <hi>holy extasies,</hi> in which God did mind him of the way and meanes, how to lead his People. And according to this Patterne, a <hi>Law</hi> was founded, so suitable to the highest Taste of humane Sensuality, and obvious to a carnall apprehension, that it was swallowed by this Rabble for the undoubted and pure <hi>Will of God,</hi> and he looked upon for his most holy <hi>Prophet.</hi> To the advancement of which <hi>Beliefe</hi> their <hi>Ignorance</hi> did mainly contribute, found by experience, the strongest assertor of what she confidently believes, though in it selfe never so improbable. And after some farther commerce had throughly estated their Consciences in this perswasion, they grew zealous, that is, affectionate,

and desirous to propagate where ever they came, such opinions as their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors had contracted them to, out of no higher sanctity at first, then to keep them entire and chast in their worldly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>

Or if any <hi>crosse event</hi> was apprehended relating to them, they put it off as if it onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned their <hi>Remisnesse</hi> in the intended <hi>Worke of the Lord,</hi> which was to spoile others, and enrich themselves. This a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates the wonder of their Victories, who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60432:8"/>

And to preserve this childe of his Ambition, from being stifled in the swadling cloaths, through an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying of Neighbours (who were called in prudence to the crushing of such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, had they not been rendred deafe by the janglings between the <hi>Greek</hi> &amp; <hi>Latine</hi> Churches) <hi>he gathers the chiefest ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of his Institutes out of the Gardens, both of the Jewish and Christian Religion:</hi> Leaving his Sectarists in grosse, to their more loose and acceptable primitive <hi>Heatheuisme;</hi> inserting few Novelties, but what respected his owne person, which he doth not stile a God, though he arrogates to himselfe a Supremacy over all his Prophets.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Yet did he not only forbid the use of <hi>Images,</hi> as may be thought, in imitation of <hi>Moses</hi> (who by that bred such a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred

in the <hi>Jewes</hi> against all Nations, as hath kept a considerable part of them from mingling to this day) but out of as deep a Reason of State, in relation to continuance: Since it is impossible, if a Nation once attaines an universall pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but that the deceitfull <hi>knack</hi> of such a carnall adoration must needs grow loathsome, or lye obvious to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, that shall make it their full em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to finde faults; and after an opportunity is easily gained, to foment a change, by discovering to the people <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities</hi> in their <hi>Worship;</hi> which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prevented in one directed, as his is, to the onely invisible and omnipotent <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi> whose Nature and Power is so far remote from the weake apprehensions of men, as the sharpest reason is not able to batter a Faith built solely upon it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And by this prudent election, he hath so far prevailed against the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Innovation</hi> (a Rust all other Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions have contracted in lesse time) as no considerable <hi>Schisme</hi> hath yet broke out amongst them: For that between the <hi>Turke</hi> and <hi>Persian,</hi> lies rather in the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie of their Prophet,</hi> then the body

of the Beliefe he first founded. At such time, lest Novelty and want of Proofe should detect him too apparently, he takes <hi>Abraham</hi> into his Party, whom he ownes for the Father-of himselfe and his Followers; giving a no lesse honourable Character of <hi>Christ</hi> and his Mother, to please the <hi>Christians,</hi> then of <hi>Moses</hi> to amuse the <hi>Jewes;</hi> yet hath no milder designe, then the destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them both: And by this universall <hi>complyance,</hi> he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his detestable <hi>Errors</hi> more glib to the wide swallow of that <hi>Ignorance,</hi> the world did then gape withall; The cause his Doctrine was embraced by as unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd a beliefe, as that of the <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Christian,</hi> whom they looke upon as ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of more improbable Opinions, then theirs, and lesse tending to the honour of that universall Goodnesse, which respects the profit and well-being of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

so often and grosly practised, as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to the multitude, who are apter to follow the <hi>Example</hi> of their <hi>Kings,</hi> then the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of their <hi>Teachers;</hi> and might, (if any apparition of Justice or Religion were extant in their Governors) have their Passions, as the <hi>Turkes,</hi> stirred up to approbation or dislike, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the more or lesse dismall relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons their <hi>Priests</hi> read to them out of their <hi>Mahumetan Legend;</hi> so much the more excusable, because the awe borne to these, though but <hi>Fictions,</hi> doth help to spare the more ungratefull Rod, the too frequent use of which, hath in all times produced more Feare then Love.</p>

               <p>1. THe Preface; <hi>Mahumet</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Turkish Empire: his Story disadvantagiously recorded, for want of Pens of their owne. 2. The time lucky for his Attempts. 3. His Followers ignorant, and (so) apt to take any Religious impression. 4. Crosse Accidents hindred not their Progresse. 5. 7. His chiefe Rites gathered out of Judaisme and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. —6. Images prohibited, and why. —8. The institution and Use of (the Jewish &amp;) their Sabbath, And — 9. Priests. 10. Their Policy directed more to the Princes Interest, than the Priest's — 11. Who are to be kept in a Mediocrity. 12. The Aliaron, by whom interpreted. 13. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers more frequent then Preaching. 14. In what Uses their Doctrine ends, —15. Not to expect happinesse here, but in another world. —Their Practise not so bad as some Christians. 16. The advantages to the State
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60432:65"/>
from Oaths and Religion. — 17. Though a false one; and from Church-men, who yet drive on their owne interest. — 18. The Mahumetan Rites not chargeable or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vons to Nature. — Sacrifices, why omitted. 19. Their Abstinence from Wine, and the Reasons thereof. 20. Their Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to their Primitive Institutes; the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe of Change, and — 21. Their Provisions against it. — 22. Reasons of State for the Mufiy's Advancement and — the Emperour's honouring him in publique. 23. (<hi>Meca</hi> within his owne power.) — 24, Which yet cannot allwaies secure him from his Jealousie; but upon occasion he makes him away privately; yet without aspersing his Fame, and why. — 25.

Of the Custome for the Grand Seniour to strangle his Brothers. 28. Lust and Covetonsnesse tolerated by the Turks. — 29. Christians more impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litickly intent upon Penall Lawes. — 30. Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments in <hi>Turky</hi> not so common as severe: popular Incendiaries removed out of the way, privately. — The Folly of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>races, Hunting, &amp;c. — avoided (much) by their Poligamy. 35. Their publick Buildings magnificent; which some Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians demolish: Advice to publick Spirits, rather to build Bridges, and mend Highwaies. 36. In order to augmentation of Empire, their interest promotes three things. 37 First, Obedience, either sacred, to the Mufty, &amp;c. — 38. or Civill <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

Quarter seldome granted, or not till after full victory, — 44. which they will not throw away upon poore places. 45. Their Ordinance. 46. Their Food not dainty. 47. Their Expeditions why in Summer: Their Armies so strong, as not to need Reserves, 48. Upon a losse they retreat, without hazarding another, and why. 49. They are able to keep the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60432:66"/>
employed. 50. The Cavalry en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; a Feud between them and the Foot; which prevents Conspiracies; the like doth their being raised out of severall Nations. 51. Forts pernicious to such great Princes, though of use to weaker ones. 52. Religion, why not proclaimed the cause of War. <hi>Constantinople</hi> unworthily lost. 53. They fight not so couragiously against those of their owne beliefe. Successe an ill Judge of Truth. 54. The Sword an unfit instrument to Plant Religion. —55.

They count Fate inexorable, yet pray: though Praise were more proper. 57. Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans and Jewes abhor Christians for their Images and Reall presence. 58. The Turk subtill in his Treaties, and if neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated to break his word, charges the blame upon his Ministers. —59. Yet by reason of his strength, is seldome driven to such base shifts, as weaker Princes make use of. Perjury of latter times more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quant among Christians, which these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels

avoid (in judiciary Trials) by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining witnesses apart, &amp;c. instead of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their testimonies upon Oath. 60. Why Jewes must turne Christians, before they may become Turks. 61. Opinions of Strangers indulged, and — Courtesans to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated. 62. The Grand Seniors Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue employed in his Wars, — his Pleasure. 63. His Wars, by reason of his strength, effensive, and — openly proclaimed, why. The Venetians impolitickly deserted. A Combination of Christians against the Turk, — how unlikely to succeed upon severall accounts: — who should head it? — The Pope, — The Emperour, — The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> — The Venetians. Expedients to weaken the Turk, — The Jesuits (if the Pope could spare them) to foment Schisme, &amp;c. among the, — To shelter some of the younger Royall Branches, or Grandees, that may head an Army, &amp;c. — 64. Why the Turk seldome makes Leagues, — sends Ambassadors, or — marries Forraigners, — though he take many Wives. 65. Why the Grand Senior appeares not in publique, but on horsback, and in such splendor; yet takes his Repast and pleasures privately in the Seraglio; The contrary use how disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60432:67"/>
to Christian Princes. 66. His vast Traine in Progresse; yet — affable and winning carriage. 67. For Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and such like Grievances he useth Instruments. — 68. Whom, upon occasion, he either delivers up to the fury of the People, or removes farther off. 69. His Wrath fatall. 70. The Turkish Priests cry up all strange Events for Miracles, as well as the Papists — whose Juggles have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the Learning of this last Age. — 71. Which, together with Printing, the Turk tolerates not; A reflection upon Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity-Customes. 72. Those Sciences the Turks have, are taught in the Seraglio onely. The multitude of Grammer-schooles among us do more hurt than good. In <hi>Turky</hi> the Offices of Priest and Lawyer are united; as the Lawes of the Jewes, both Divine and Civil, were into one Body by <hi>Moses,</hi> — The best form of Government. 73.

            <p>Pride is the roote of all Evill; which Princes do not onely foster in themselves, but water by preferments in all others they find able to promote the ends of it: whose effects cannot be comprized in a narrower circle, than the whole Masse of Impieties, <hi>Ambition</hi> is able to commit: That prompted <hi>Phocas</hi> to kill his Master the <hi>Emperour; Caesar</hi> to ruine the most glorious <hi>Republique</hi> ever the Sun saw; It teacheth Children to pull undecently the Crownes from their Fathers Heads; it is this that fills Hell with Soules, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

Helme in any State, who in all ages were his Peeres, &amp; could not therefore in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty take up a stone against him. Bad advice, without Execution, hurts onely the Giver: Besides, I cannot believe, the generality of those that cry out upon him, in publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, ever saw or read his <hi>Writings,</hi> but take their Clamour upon trust, as they do against <hi>Julian,</hi> stiled the <hi>Apostate,</hi> how tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I leave to such as are better able to judge, than thousands of men so impudent as to extend incomparable Wits upon the erring Rack of <hi>Common Fame,</hi> in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their ignorant' Ancestors, who looked upon <hi>Mathematitians</hi> as Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; though Wisdome hath justified these her Children so farre, as to informe the world, that no Learning is a greater ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Falshood then theirs.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Machiavell</hi> is so modest as to ask, Who had not rather be <hi>Titus</hi> then <hi>Nero?</hi> But to him that will be a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth a way least prejudiciall to his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Estate: As if he should say, Thou art already at defiance with Heaven, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to preserve thee in an earthly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, no mean is left but to be perfectly wicked, a task not higherto performed, no not by the worst of <hi>Usurpers;</hi> it being as
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60432:75"/>
far beyond example, that any Tyrant hath done all the mischiefe requisite to his own and Childrens safety, as that the best of Kings have, in any age, put in execution all the good. Now of the first he proposeth <hi>Caesar Borgia,</hi> for the most absolute pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, who used all Artifices to removeevery impediment standing between him and his desires, but his owne being sick at the time of his Fathe'rs death, which perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his affaires so, as he could not bring in a <hi>Pope</hi> of his owne <hi>Faction;</hi> for want of which; his so well-built Designes / as he fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supposed) fell to the ground, as most of their do, that prosecute Empires by obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que meanes; into whose lap Divine Justice not seldome throwes Destruction, or some louder Discontents, that over-vote the pleasure, Ambition takes in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of her ends.</p>
            <p>But since it is sometime the will of God (for Reasons best knowne to himselfe) to give a happy successe to bad meanes wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrived, why should this <hi>Florentine</hi> be so bitterly inveyed against, who cannot be denyed but to have had at least as ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Principles, for a <hi>Member</hi> of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixt, that

            <p>
               <hi>Worldly Wisdome</hi> is recommended to us in the person of the <hi>unjust Steward;</hi> &amp;, I pray, what doth <hi>Machiavell</hi> say more of <hi>Caesar Borgia,</hi> but that he was a <hi>perfect Tyrant?</hi> And if he presume so far on your (better supposed) Honesty, as to propose him for an <hi>Example,</hi> yet it is still of <hi>Evill;</hi> and what fitter pattern can there be for an <hi>Usurper,</hi> than one of his owne Coat.</p>
            <p>Neither are the <hi>Rules</hi> he layes down, waved by the best of men if wise; for who executes not <hi>ingratefull actions, by Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, acceptable in Person?</hi> And all these his <hi>Documents</hi> he gives onely to a <hi>Prince;</hi> for had he assigned this practise to a <hi>Son,</hi> or any else circumscribed in a narrower roome than a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> he might be more justly condemned: But undertaking to make a <hi>Grammar</hi> for the right understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Dialect</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> why is he blamed for setting downe the most <hi>Generall Rules,</hi> and such as all Statesmen make use of, either to benefit themselves
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60432:76"/>
or hurt others? That they make no consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of falsehood, is manifest by <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, that learned Father in <hi>King-craft</hi> who pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced him ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the way to live, that knew not how neatly to deceive.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Breach of Faith</hi> in <hi>private Persons,</hi> is not only destructive to wel-being but also damnable, he cannot deny: but <hi>Princes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend larger Charters in relation to a more universall Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>merce; which they extend to <hi>Embassadors,</hi> &amp; Ministers of State; as coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all things honourable that are safe: &amp; if this be an <hi>Evill,</hi> it is the <hi>Kings,</hi> and no way curable, but by the King of Heaven.</p>
            <p>To conclude, a <hi>Body Politick</hi> is like that of a <hi>Man,</hi> which when it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, shewes outwardly a beautifull and comely sight; but search into the Entralls from whence the true Nourishment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, and little is to be found but Blood, Filth and Stench: The truth is, <hi>Machiavell</hi> is observed to have raked deeper in this, than his Predecessors, which makes him smell, as he doth, in the nostrills of the nice and ignorant; whereas those of more Prudence and Experience, know it is the most naturall savour of the <hi>Court,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where the Prince is of the <hi>first Head;</hi> of which, such as come in by Succession may abate much.</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE UPON PISO <hi>and</hi> VINDEX, Who both conspired the Death of NERO, Though with a contrary Successe.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>PISO</hi> a <hi>Noble-man</hi> borne, beloved of the People, drawn into the <hi>Action</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the perswasion of others, than his owne affection, associated with the <hi>choisest Wits</hi> in the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the <hi>bravest Spirits,</hi> and armed with <hi>pretences</hi> that were proof against all the darts Reason or Religion could cast at them; yet <hi>miscarried</hi> in the midst of these Advantages, falling soone after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same Grave, he had most justly measured out for <hi>Nero,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The foundation of whose Ruine was laid by <hi>Vindex,</hi> that had no stronger ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials to work his destruction, than what he hammered out of his owne invention, &amp; the advantage he took from the love of a broken <hi>Legion,</hi> no way considerable in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60432:82"/>
respect of the rest of the Princes Forces, that stood at this time firme to him, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had their affections newly warmed by divers <hi>Largesses</hi> and a dayly <hi>Impunity;</hi> stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger engageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in such corrupt times, than all the vertue &amp; piety incide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to flesh.</p>
            <p>It's true, <hi>Vindex</hi> never lived to see the effect of his brave attempt, as the most stately Fabricks are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly least enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those that build them: Yet the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why his beginnings did succeed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Piso's,</hi> may be some of these.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Of which the <hi>first</hi> lies hid in the dark Book of <hi>Fatality,</hi> where all things are kept from perishing till they are arrived at the utmost period <hi>Providence</hi> hath set them; which is for that time as constant in the <hi>preservation</hi> of the Instruments of her wrath, as the Dispensers of her Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy: But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the criticall minute, appointed for their <hi>destruction,</hi> is come, they lie levell with their feet, whose hands before were not able to reach them</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Piso's</hi> attempt, which was to <hi>assasinate Nero:</hi> An endeavour no lesse indecent for men of Honour, than unproper for a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> who as he is Enemy to all, so ought he to perish by the hands of all;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60432:82"/>
which, by a <hi>Clandestine</hi> dispatch, had not only lost the pleasure, but the example of their Revenge. Neither was it in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of possibility likely to be concealed; &amp; therefore the harder to succeed, having been communicated to so many, and of so different tempers, who out of hatred to others or love to themselves, could not choose but reveale it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the body of Man, be it never so sound, is maintained in being by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of humors, the bloud flying to the heart upon any sudden assault: But if a Bruise be made in a <hi>remote</hi> place, it falls not out so, but affords the virulent matter leisure togather. Thus are bad Princes with more ease and safety destroyed by a remote and open hostility, than a sudden and private attempt: For, neere, men see dayly so many effects of their cruelty, that they are afraid, studying more their own safety than the freedome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.</p>
            <p>Besides the <hi>familiarity</hi> with <hi>Tyranny</hi> makes it so domesticall, that those within the <hi>Verge of the Court</hi> know not well how to live without it: Therefore they must be tender of his preservation, to maintain
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60432:83"/>
their own power, having rendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves either actively or passively as odious to the people as their Master.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As any thing that ministers occasion of discourse, the farther it extends, the more sound it makes; and he that gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>Snow,</hi> hath a <hi>Ball</hi> proportionable to the <hi>distance</hi> he rolls it in: So those that cry out <hi>a farr off,</hi> upon the abuses of the <hi>Court,</hi> doe not onely draw attention from some about them, but tickle the eares, and stir up the Spirits of all such as have felt, or do feare the weight of Oppression. Nay, such persons themselves, as at a neerer distance, would, out of hope or feare, labour to quench it, will, a great way off, look upon a combustion, with delight: <hi>Novelty</hi> being of that nature (especially following things ill) that it raiseth more expectation of good, than it can destroy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Open force</hi> doth assure the <hi>Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,</hi> that there is pretence made of no more than what is cordially intended; to which the soft whispers of a few confederates cannot enough perswade: It being the ordinary practice of tyrannicall Governours, by such instruments to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap others for whose lives and estates
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60432:83"/>
they long. But in this case, <hi>Report,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents nothing in its due proportion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the danger that <hi>is,</hi> musters up all that <hi>may be:</hi> And in this the concerned Tyrant seconds her; who looking through the false Spectacles of guilt &amp; feare, reads his fortune worse, than possibly it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and above prevention; so farre, as though <hi>Hope</hi> (the last friend in such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities) cannot quite be shook off, she fixeth upon lower objects, than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of his former power. This flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Nero,</hi> that though they drave him out of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet for pity, or to satisfie his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they might be drawn to leave him <hi>Egypt</hi> quiet: As foolish an opinion in him, as it had been madnesse in them, to think any power meet to be left in the hands of an exafperated Prince; whose <hi>Revenge</hi> cannot be buried but in his grave, especially if it respects his Subjects: For though himselfe might be of a nature to forgive it, those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him cannot, but will be ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite him to take it upon all occasions.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Where there are <hi>many</hi> that <hi>conspire,</hi> the apprehension of any one will soone <hi>detect</hi> the rest; whereas the like resolution taken by a single person, and not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60432:84"/>
seldome failes, being secure from all feare, and hastened by no acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent but what opportunity presents.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Ill Counsell</hi> is rather to be hearkened unto, than <hi>none</hi> at all; there being a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to mend it with better: whereas a <hi>dull suspension</hi> looseth time, a thing it reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable; and doth not only assure the <hi>Adversaries,</hi> but disheartens <hi>Friends,</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them leisure to listen to the free offers of the contrary Party.</p>
            <p>It may be <hi>observed</hi> in the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Nero,</hi> that <hi>the meanest Conspiracy is not to be slighted.</hi> For in a crazed Common wealth, the least jangling will bring the multitude about the eares of their Governour; who, having offended all, knowes not whom to trust, that hath any power with the people: And this perceived by his own; they desert him, or by his destruction la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to purchase their particular safety: For what hope can another have in him, that distrusts himselfe?</p>
            <p>He that hath lost the <hi>love of his people,</hi> cannot be certain of his present safety or moderate ruine when it comes; for the most part sudden in regard of his owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, though presaged and wished by all the world besides.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60432:84"/>
No prudence can maintaine a <hi>Tyrant</hi> long in power: for though he may divert the people from making inspection into his disposition, by exposing his Agents to their mercy; yet at last the succession of the same <hi>abuses</hi> will direct them to the true cause; which being once discovered to lye in his Nature, nothing he doth shall please, but he suspected for more evill, than it can in probability produce: The worlds <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> exercising no lesse authority over Kings, than meaner men. Besides, the <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering up men in Authority to the rage of the People,</hi> like letting of Blood, may stop the progresse of a present Fever, but much weakens the power of the Prince, to resist a future distemper.</p>
            <p>After the disorders of a Tyrant are laid before the eyes of the people, it turnes thousands his enemies in an instant, that out of Custome or Conscience prayed for him the day before. Who are more solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to advance his <hi>destruction,</hi> than care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to choose a <hi>Successour</hi> that might be fit to govern. Their <hi>Discretion</hi> extending no farther than their <hi>Nourishment,</hi> which they only receive fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>hand to mouth.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the use that can be made of this
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60432:85"/>
popular Monster is, during their first heat: For, their expectations deloded (being incapable of honour or reward) they are ready, with the Dog, to lick up the same <hi>Nero</hi> they had vomited out. And, that it is easier to expell a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> than to finde a Prince in all points worthy to succeed, appeared by <hi>Galba:</hi> And by <hi>Otho</hi> we find, when the multitude are up in <hi>Swarmes,</hi> they care not, what <hi>Bush</hi> they light on.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Seneca</hi> had got the Emperiall Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem from under <hi>Piso,</hi> it is uncertain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had been able to have kept it: Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue having shewed her selfe as great an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to a <hi>fresh Family</hi> as Vice, to whom <hi>Cruelty</hi> is for the most part more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than <hi>Clemency,</hi> especially towards the <hi>Nobility,</hi> who are observed to carry the most naturall affection to the <hi>old line,</hi> that first wound them up to honour.</p>
            <p>I would be loath to blame <hi>Seneca</hi> wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, though the immense <hi>Treasure</hi> he left behind him doth, not onely, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, accuse him of too much <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonsnesse,</hi> as some Authors are bold to lay <hi>Ambition</hi> to his charge; which the worse became him, because unpossible to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied but at the cost of his Maker. But
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60432:85"/>
admit this <hi>Stoick</hi> in outward Profession, though an <hi>Epicure</hi> in his Gardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be as good as he desired to be thought, yet if he had not restored to the <hi>Romans</hi> their lost <hi>liberty,</hi> but sought to establish the <hi>Government</hi> in his owne <hi>house,</hi> he had onely imitated their Charity, that take a Slave out of one cruell Family to put him into another, that might in a smal time prove as bad: or if he had gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned moderately all his life, it had been like the good day in a <hi>Feaver,</hi> which is so short and uncertaine, that it takes away all tast of Ease and Delight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The Cause of this may be deduced from Gods eternall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, That nothing in Nature should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main idle and without <hi>motion:</hi> This also extends to the <hi>Children of Grace,</hi> who goe more nimbly about the works of their heavenly Calling, being driven by the stormes of <hi>Persecution,</hi> than when they have nothing but the smooth voice of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity</hi> to allure and perswade them.

God never made a larger promise of his continuing <hi>Truth</hi> in any place, than to the Nation of the <hi>Jewes:</hi> Yet how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do we find it buried in the rubbish of Errors and Impiety? Their Kings and Priests either teaching, or at least tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Idolatry: The Church being driven into so dark and narrow a corner, as the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> could not discover a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man: Neither was <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in better plight, which had the <hi>Temple,</hi> and in that the <hi>Oracles</hi> of God, in possession. For if it did scape profanation during the worser dayes of <hi>Solomon</hi> his son <hi>Rehoboam</hi> saw it plundered, and in most of his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors raignes it lay neglected or misimploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that if a stranger, led by the glorious title the <hi>Jewes</hi> had, to be <hi>the people of God,</hi> should have conformed himselfe to their worship, he had scarce mended his markt, though he were before never so great an Idolater. Yet God never gave a larger <hi>Charter</hi> to any <hi>Church;</hi> part of it being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in these words, <hi>I have hallowed this House which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever.</hi> This proves Gods <hi>Promises</hi> conditionall, and that outward <hi>Felicity</hi> seldome accompanies inward <hi>Integrity;</hi> or
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60432:87"/>
if they have the luck to meet, they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part; mens hearts being ordinarily to nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to entertain goodnesse and worldly pomp.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Churches</hi> we read of in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> with whom the Holy Ghost was so familiar, as to direct particular <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> unto them, are not now to be found. Onely <hi>Rome</hi> brags, she remains the same in purity of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> though for <hi>Manners</hi> she is as corrupt as her elder Sister <hi>Sodome,</hi> so that if <hi>Italy</hi> be a Circle of Impiety, the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> is the Center. Yet these plead their Title with God himselfe, grounding it upon the tottering Foundation of worldly <hi>felicity:</hi> Forgetting that it is against the example of all times, that any Nation, much lesse a Church, should so long saile under the merry gale of earthly prosperity, &amp; not long ere this discharge herselfe of that rich lading she was fraught with all, when she traded for Soules, under the Fathers of the Primitive times. There having been such a succession of imperious greatnesse in that <hi>Chaire,</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> is now more like the proud &amp; triumphant Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> than the poore and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church of God. All the calamities that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60432:87"/>
have of late fallen upon her, may be said to have dropt from her owne Ambition, in seeking to enlarge her power at the cost and prejudice of others, and therefore more naturally to be styled Punishments than Persecutions.</p>
            <p>You cast your eyes on no Story where the <hi>villany</hi> of <hi>Popes</hi> is not at large disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; who can then believe that the pure Spirit of God should indow with infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of judgment Monsters so visibly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted? We finde, the Holy Ghost did under the <hi>Law</hi> hate and forbid all impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity though in meer outward <hi>Ceremony;</hi> how then should he under the brighter light of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> suffer himselfe to be poured out of one uncleane Vessell into another; beginning again with a <hi>Conjurer</hi> where he left with a <hi>Sodomite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet they say, <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>the true Church,</hi> out of which there is no Salvation: Not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that the holy Scripture, Charity and Reason tell us, Gods <hi>Church</hi> is as <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall</hi> as the Earth; and shall one day be gathered together under Christ the Head. Now in the meane time, that <hi>harmony</hi> of Opinions they pretend to, may be rather wished, than hoped for. In <hi>Pauls</hi> time
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60432:88"/>
some made conscience of eating things <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to Idols,</hi> others of <hi>Circumcision;</hi> yet he condemnes them not for schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall. And it is but a weak evasion to say, He bare with them in regard of the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Church: For in these dayes of knowledge she is as infantine in some places, as she was then: where he that taught had the strength of <hi>Miracles</hi> to justifie his Doctrine, which these want, and are driven to this shift in lieu of them, to cozen the people with such as are suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sititious Now if there be no salvation out of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> not to speak of our selves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what Charity is it to think all the Water cast away, that is poured in Christs name, upon the faces of those Christians in <hi>Greece, Rushia,</hi> and remoter places, to which this Ages curiosity &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse hath taught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the way? This makes me think there is no room for such monopolizing Opinions: But I leave this to Divines, returning to the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the <hi>Piety</hi> of the first <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had purchased them <hi>Reputation,</hi> and that God had not onely opened the hearts of <hi>Potentates</hi> to receive the <hi>Gospell,</hi> but their hands to build and endow <hi>Churches:</hi> They
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60432:88"/>
being advanced first to the Dignity of <hi>Arch bishops,</hi> thence to <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> &amp; so at last to the <hi>Papal</hi> Supremacy (a name deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Pater Patriarcharum,</hi> which for brevities sake was written <hi>Pa Pa</hi>) exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Piety for Promotion. It being the Custome of fraile Humanity, to conclude goodnesse at the beginning of Felicity.</p>
            <p>For taking the advantage of new kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Zeale,</hi> wisely observed by them to be the hottest, the <hi>Popes</hi> were able to lead King and People whither they pleased, &amp; in the interim had the opportunity to proportion what power or riches they thought fit for themselves.</p>
            <p>Now as <hi>Policy</hi> is not able to keep long the right way to <hi>Heaven,</hi> so at last it led them into a world of Impieties, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching, under pretence of Religion, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on higher Jurisdiction and Power than could naturally belong to Subjects: which wanting strength of their own to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they sheltered them under the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of such <hi>Princes,</hi> as had no better titles to their <hi>Crownes,</hi> than was derived from an <hi>Vsurpation</hi> over the weaknesse of those in former possession; glad of the <hi>Popes</hi> Protection, because they found the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60432:89"/>
of men, either out of Religion or Ignorance, made their estimate of the truth or falshood of the Titles, and lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Claims of Princes,</hi> according as they were more or lesse current in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their <hi>Clergie,</hi> whose judgements depended wholly on the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who afforded his approbation to their il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legitimate <hi>Titles,</hi> out of no weaker Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of State, than they at first desired it: Laying up with all diligence their <hi>Petitions</hi> and his <hi>Grants,</hi> to remain as Precedents for their posterite to be guided by: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no wonder, why these <hi>Tyrants &amp; Usurpers</hi> should strengthen the power of the <hi>Pope,</hi> since the foundation of their own was laid upon the exorbitant excesse of that of <hi>Rome:</hi> which is so improved, as the <hi>Emperour</hi> hath, for many ages, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his <hi>Crowne</hi> from their Successors, to whom his Predecessors had formerly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the <hi>Miter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The cloud of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> that did then cover the face of the world, was a great help to keep their jugling undiscovered: For that little <hi>Learning</hi> extant in those times was wholly included in the <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Clergie,</hi> (the <hi>Laity</hi> being intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60432:89"/>
nothing but Wars and Pleasure) so as they had opportunity to make all <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Records</hi> speak in their favour; which being <hi>Manuscrips,</hi> &amp; so but in few hands, it was no hard matter to corrupt them. Besides being prohibited <hi>Marriage,</hi> they did neither respect nor acknowledge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Posterity or Alliance, than those to succeed in the same places, of whom they had so religious a care, as they thought none merited well of the Church, that did not leave them endowed with more <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Immunities</hi> then they found them: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it an Article of the faith they owed to their Profession, <hi>to suppresse the Laity, &amp; advance the Clergie:</hi> And if this was the End, they esteemed no Means ill, condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to it.</p>
            <p>Thus by Time, the Indulgency of good, and Necessity of wicked and illegitimate <hi>Princes,</hi> they freed their whole <hi>Society</hi> from the Jurisdiction of the temporall <hi>Magistrate,</hi> not suffering them to be liable to any <hi>punishments,</hi> but those eternall, &amp; such as their own superiours shall think fit to lay upon them; seldome suitable to the fault, unlesse in case of <hi>Schisme</hi> from their generall Tenents: &amp; in this their Jealousie,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60432:90"/>
no lesse than prudence makes them very severe. Now having purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Ease, Honour,</hi> and <hi>Impunity,</hi> such as were <hi>Poore, Guilty,</hi> or <hi>Ambitious,</hi> besides <hi>Younger Brothers,</hi> and those <hi>in Debt,</hi> ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their <hi>Fellowship;</hi> which freed them from present want, and feare of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for former Offences, how capitall soever: And these being, for the most part, of the best naturall abilities soon learned the skill, so to work on the consciences of Dying people, and those affrighted with their sins, that the <hi>Church</hi> was left Heire of the best part of <hi>Christendome.</hi> And ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king encouragement from the blinde Zeale then raigning, (which till <hi>Printing</hi> had opened a way to Knowledge, rendred all things possible unto them) they did not onely make use of such profitable <hi>Errors,</hi> as their fore fathers left them, but brought in new ones of their own contriving, gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them with the spendid titles of <hi>things necessary</hi> &amp; of <hi>religious use;</hi> Amongst, which were <hi>Images,</hi> brought in at first only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage others to imitate their constancy, whom they saw painted, with the manner of Death they had been put to by the Persecuters of those Times: Of the <hi>Crosse,</hi>

wore anciently only for a <hi>Cognisance,</hi> they have made a Tutelary <hi>God,</hi> looking no higher in their Extremities: The blessed <hi>Saints</hi> were scandalized with the Worship given to them &amp; their <hi>Reliques:</hi> whom, in a full imitation of the Heathen, they made <hi>Protectors</hi> of their <hi>Cattell,</hi> and smaller <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi> as <hi>Hawking, Hunting,</hi> &amp;c.

I know it is not onely in the power, but the practise of God, to raise his ends out of ill means; Yet it were presumption in men to shape out his work, though he be able to fit our endeavours to his own Honour.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> seeks to make the

people believe, that, notwithstanding these Considerations, after the <hi>Masse of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyGhost</hi> is said, he is as really present in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> as he was with the eleven Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, when they chose a Successor to <hi>Judas,</hi> who betrayed <hi>Christ.</hi> In which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge themselves either <hi>Atheists,</hi> or presumptuous <hi>fighters against God;</hi> For if the Choice be his, how dare they interpole their mediation, or hope the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spanish Factions</hi> can possibly prevail; one side ever interrupting because both cannot be pleased. They have of late been made, sometimes by the other which must conclude the Holy Spirit sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to humane Endeavours, or no more friend to this Choice, than to that of the <hi>Grand Seignior.</hi>

            <p>Here you may see how they labour to hire or force the <hi>HolyGhost</hi> to fix upon so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e such subject, as may be most auspicious to the prevalent Party; who is invoked out of Ceremony, leaving the rest to be hewed out by themselves. Before these Monarchs grew so potent, the troubles in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave</hi> were rather more than lesse: For the <hi>Cardinalls</hi> made Elections so tedious by their towsing, that sometimes the <hi>Romans,</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:60432:93"/>
sometimes other Princes, forced them to resolve. And to avoid such constraint, they did often pitch upon <hi>Impotent men,</hi> such as for <hi>Age</hi> or <hi>Weakness</hi> were not likely to hold out long (as this <hi>Leo,</hi> who died in few weks after his assumption) during whose time the Pretenders are at leisure to concoct their Designes better; which is ordinarily done by <hi>Bribes,</hi> or in case they prevaile not, by <hi>Poyson,</hi> nay the Devill is not left unsought to: So as <hi>Balzac,</hi> saith, <hi>None, on this side the Alpes, labour more to look well, than some of them, to seem-sickly and weake;</hi> hoping by that means to obtain the <hi>Chaire</hi> which is able, of a gouty <hi>Cardinall,</hi> to make a sound <hi>Pope.</hi>

            <p>In antient time the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> were chosen by the <hi>Parish Priests</hi> of that City; And how, since, <hi>Cardinals</hi> came in, is no more known, (though not antient) tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the date of many Novelties, that have most shamefully been imposed upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church: Yet to this day, no <hi>Ecclesiasticall Cardinall</hi> (for they have others) but retains among his titles, the name of one of the <hi>Parish Churches</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> though he be ordinarily called by his own name, or else some other <hi>Bishoprick</hi> or Dignity, he hath in <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>

By the institutions of a former <hi>Pope,</hi> which for shame they dare not revoke, all his Actions that gets into the <hi>Chaire</hi> by <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> are null: Now what are all these si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister Endeavours, but so many severall sorts of <hi>Simony?</hi> If <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by <hi>Policy,</hi> mediation of <hi>Friends,</hi> or <hi>Flattery,</hi> to have obtained the Gift of the <hi>HolyGhost,</hi> should his fault have been lesse, or not rather greater; <hi>Money</hi> being the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest offer he could make, and most sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the <hi>Apostles</hi> wants, which he saw others, indued with the same Spirit, daily cast at their feet?

And wise men may here justly take occasion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that no <hi>Pope</hi> doth think, or ever thought, he had a power of not erring: For

if such a Spirit were an usuall companion of that <hi>See, Paul the Fifth</hi> would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the operation of it, and not have troubled a State to so little purpose, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the assistance at least of a Revelation.</p>
            <p>He that desires to be informed of the <hi>Illnesse</hi> of Modern <hi>Popes,</hi> may be abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied, if he Consult Historians, who are not dumb in declaring the <hi>faults</hi> of the <hi>Court of Rome.</hi> The truth is, were it not for the <hi>strict</hi> (or if you will, call them <hi>pious) Lives</hi> of a few melancholick <hi>Friars,</hi> it is impossible so much wickednesse should not be booted out of the world.</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE IN VINDICATION OF <hi>Martin Luther.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HE may be suspected of <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,</hi> if not <hi>Atheisme,</hi> that too suddenly leapes out of one Opinion into another; It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impossible for meer flesh and blood, to pull up all at once a <hi>Religion</hi> rooted by Costome and Education in the Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which must be convinced, before it can let in another with any cordiall wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. I speak not of the antient and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Callings of God, but those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented in our times, in which over much hast doth often-times bewray De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; As appeared in the Bishop of <hi>Spalatto;</hi> who in my dayes left <hi>Italy</hi> for fear of <hi>Paul the fifth,</hi> his enemy, and reconcil'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the <hi>Church of England;</hi> but the old <hi>Pope</hi> being dead, and his <hi>Kinsman</hi> in the <hi>Chaire,</hi> he resumes his former Errors, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60432:100"/>
goes to <hi>Rome,</hi> in hope of Preferment, where contrary to promise, he dies miserably. When Falshood is fallen-out with for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other respect, than Love of Truth, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to Atheisme, and is so far from men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Condition of the Convert, that it renders it worse.</p>
            <p>None ever shewed greater signes of Gods Spirit, than <hi>Luther</hi> did; who observed such <hi>Gradations,</hi> as it may appear he found faule with nothing; he was not first led to by the dictates of Conscience: Falling first upon the abuse of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> too apparent an Impiety, to passe by so acute a Judgment undiscovered; From this he ascended to higher Contemplations, which afforded him the opportunity to take notice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter and deeper Errors. His <hi>Wit &amp; Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> having that vast advantage over the stupid Ignorance of those times, that he bare down all before him, without any other <hi>Opposition,</hi> than the contrary Faction was able to raise out of power; much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by the desire all <hi>Princes</hi> had, to set limits to the <hi>Pope's</hi> daily <hi>Usurpations.</hi> And as for the <hi>Books,</hi> then writ against him, they did rather shar pen, than blunt the desire of Change: For the <hi>Friars</hi> had so long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60432:101"/>
a free current of their Doctrine, without interruption, that they were more intent on the reaping of such Fruit, as grew from the Errors sown by their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors, than upon Arguments to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So as if Princes, that were weary of the Yoak of <hi>Rome,</hi> had wanted the guidance of <hi>Luther,</hi> it is not easle to say, whither they might have wandered. And though <hi>Charls the fifth,</hi> then <hi>Emperour,</hi> to keep his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in obedience, did seem to discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the <hi>Schism</hi> (as they call'd it) yet he was content to shut up the <hi>Pope</hi> in the Castle of S. <hi>Angelo.</hi> Which proves his small affection, and the truth of this <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> that if ever <hi>Christendome</hi> falls under one <hi>Monarch,</hi> or turns into <hi>popular States,</hi> the power of the <hi>Pope</hi> will be lost, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to <hi>Rome;</hi> being at this day onely kept up, like a Shittle-cock, by the bandying of Princes.</p>
            <p>'Tis <hi>objected</hi> against <hi>Luther,</hi> That <hi>he was too passionate,</hi> using <hi>irreverent speeches</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards some in Authority? Yet so much of this fault, as <hi>Zeale</hi> leaves unexcused, may be imputed to his <hi>Education.</hi> All can be said, is, He was but a <hi>Man,</hi> and subject to Common Infirmities; And because his ene
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60432:101"/>
mies do so often object this, it is strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be presumed, his worst fault. I could have wish'd, he had not <hi>married a Nun:</hi> but I believe he did it to shew People, The Quarrell was irreconcilable, as <hi>Absalom</hi> projected when he polluted his Fathers bed: And in this sense, the benefit takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way much of the blame; which lay not in the <hi>unlawfullnesse,</hi> but the <hi>inexpediency</hi> of the fact. And to shew, God did not curse his <hi>Match</hi> (Though he might participate of the fate of other <hi>learned men,</hi> who seldom finde their <hi>abilities,</hi> represented in their <hi>Issue;</hi> yet) he left <hi>three</hi> such <hi>Sons,</hi> as did not give his enemies occasion to upbraid his memory with them.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Reall Presence,</hi> maintained by him in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> it doth not so much condemn his <hi>Judgement</hi> in this, as it justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his <hi>Integrity</hi> in all the rest: He being as resolute to vindicate what he thought true, against the perswasions of his Friends, as he was against the threats and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of his Enemies: For if any by-respect could have warped him, it would have been a desire to appease the hot Dispute, the retention of this error raised in his Own Party, wholly of his judgment but in this
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60432:102"/>
particular, in which <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> and the <hi>Helvetian Church</hi> did oppose him. And if this be not enough to wash him clean from the imputation of Self-ends and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse, the Proverb used in <hi>Germany</hi> may, That <hi>Poore Luther made many rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he was <hi>protected</hi> from a number of <hi>apparent mischiefs,</hi> so the same had freed him from many <hi>hidden,</hi> in respect of the eyes of the world; it being impossible, that he, who had gall'd so many <hi>Grandees,</hi> should not have Revenge laid in wait for him, in every corner: Experience proving, that <hi>Kings</hi> themselves can scarce whisper against the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> but the <hi>Knife</hi> is ready to give them a finall Answer. His <hi>Death</hi> was with as little Molestation, as his <hi>Life</hi> was full: For being call'd to the County of <hi>Mansfield,</hi> the place of his birth, to determine a Case in controversy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two <hi>Princes</hi> of that <hi>Family,</hi> he <hi>died</hi> there in the sixty third year of his Age.</p>
            <p>Had the <hi>Apostles,</hi> nay our <hi>Saviour</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe been alive, and maintained what <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> did, they had been persecuted by the <hi>Clergie:</hi> Therefore the <hi>Crucifying of Christ</hi> is no prodigy in Nature, but daily practis'd: among men: For he that can find the heart
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60432:102"/>
to stigmatize and whip his Brother, for an <hi>Error meerely in Judgment,</hi> would never have spared <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> coming with no more visible Authority then they had. But this is not the way to suppresse an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy,</hi> since most are jealous of that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which useth the <hi>Sword</hi> for her <hi>Defence; Truth</hi> having been long since determined to be <hi>most strong:</hi> And where Oppression is, there for the most part, she is supposed to be. This shews as little Discretion as Charity in such as <hi>persecute</hi> those, that may be in the Right; or; if not, shall by this means, be kept the longer in the Wrong. If a Horse starts, the more he is beaten, the harder he is kept in the way; but let him stand, &amp; have leisure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what he blanched at, &amp; he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is a Block, &amp; so go on. Yet it is neither cruelty nor imprude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to restrain such furious Spirits (as they do Dogs) that will bawl &amp; fly at all they do not know: But I should be utterly against <hi>burning their Books in publick,</hi> if they have once gained the light: which onely adds to their price, &amp; saves them a labour; because, if the State did not put them in credit, by their notice, they would perhaps, after a while
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60432:103"/>
for shame, burn them themselves. The <hi>Whip</hi> reforms not so much as he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures it; but is taken as a triumph by the Faction, increasing their animosity, if not their number; So that in effect it proves a punishment to none but the honest and tender-hearted of the people, who cannot choose but be scandalized, to see the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God defaced, by <hi>cutting Eaves,</hi> and <hi>slitting Noses,</hi> &amp;c. And this raiseth a strong suspition, that the Hand of Justice would not lie so heavy onely on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciser fide, but that something inclines it that may at last turne to the subversion of the most moderate part.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> though they <hi>tolerate all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions</hi> &amp; Tenents, yet none increased to their prejudice, till they strove to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the <hi>Arminians,</hi> who are in tast as like the <hi>Papists,</hi> as Scallions are to Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; all the difference is, that the latter is the stronger: Yet since they have let them alone, this Opinion is observed to be lesse numerously attended.</p>
            <p>Had the <hi>Pope</hi> seasonably reformed the Error <hi>Luther</hi> discovered so apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the publication of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and rewarded him a <hi>Bishoprick.</hi> for his <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:60432:103"/>
and <hi>Zeale,</hi> let him afterwards have said what he pleased: it would have been looked upon by the people as of no credit: who like nothing so well, as what goeth crosse to the grain of Authority.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Treasurer Cecil,</hi> having been unsufferably abused by <hi>Libels,</hi> sent for the <hi>Poet,</hi> and, after he had ratled him sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, began to take notice of the poor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes good parts, saying,, <hi>It might be, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious poverty compelled him to make use of false, though common Rumours, given out by such as hated all in Authority;</hi> To ease which he gave him 20 pieces, promising to take the first opportunity to advance him. This favour (most contrary to his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, who would willingly have given one ear to have saved the other) did so worke with him, and the rest of the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillers</hi> of the time, that, till the <hi>Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> death, none used the like Invectives. <hi>Bancroft,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> used the like demeanour towards some Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that had laid the imputation of <hi>Sodomy</hi> to his Charge, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clemency</hi> seldome causeth repentance in an established Kingdome, or if it proves a fault, it is easily mended; Whereas <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty</hi>

can never be recalled, raising a far greater Party out of a thirst of <hi>Revenge.</hi> than ever yet could be mustred up from the hope of <hi>Impunity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore to conclude, since <hi>Luther</hi> alone had the power to do so much, let us not be thus severe against others, that having their zeal kindled (though perhaps at the wrong end) run madding through the world; but rather pity them, if they be in an errour: Because they something re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the first Messengers of Truth.</p>
