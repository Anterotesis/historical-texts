            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN Hiſtorical Preface.</head>
            <p>§ 1. THE matter of fact occaſioning this ſecond Defence, hath been formerly, and is after here opened in part. I need now but briefly tell the Reader, that after the long difference between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelatiſts, and thoſe that deſired Reformation and Diſcipline; the moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters who were in poſſeſſion of the Pariſh-Churches from 1646, till 1660, obeyed the Parliament, ſo far as to diſuſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book of Common-Prayer, and Subſcription, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Dioceſan Epiſcopacy; ſome of them being moſt for Church-Government by Synods of Parochial Paſtors, and aſſiſting Elders, and moſt for a Reconciling of the ſeveral divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Parties, thinking ſomewhat in the Epiſcopal, Presbyterian, and Independent Parties to be good, and ſomewhat in each of them unwarrantable.</p>
            <p>1. They were ſo far Independent as to hold, that particular Churches aſſociated for Perſonal Communion in faith, worſhip, and holy living, were of Divine Inſtitution (ſuch as true Pariſh-Churches are) and that each of theſe Churches ought to have its proper exerciſe of that Diſcipline which is deſcribed by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and in other Texts of holy Scripture, and was exerciſed in the days of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and ſo on for many hundred years; ſome part of it ſtill remaining even to the times of Popery. Therefore they held, that the Paſtors of ſuch Churches muſt be ſuch as had power to exerciſe the ſaid Diſcipline. And they held, that Pariſh-Bounds were of great convenience againſt diſorder, though not of Divine Inſtitution; not taking all that dwell in a Pariſh to be <hi>eo nomine,</hi> of the
<pb facs="tcp:97268:3"/>
Church, but ſuch of them as were capable, by continued own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Baptiſmal Covenant, not nullified by proved Hereſie, or inconſiſtent wickedneſs. And they held, that no unwilling perſon was capable of a ſealed Pardon of ſin, and ſo of Church-Communion, nor yet of the true receiving of the uſe of the Paſtoral office: And therefore that none but <hi>free Conſenters</hi> ſhould have the Sacrament, nor be related to the Paſtor, as his Flock of that Church: but the reſt ſhould be conſtrained to live as Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens, or Hearers, as they were capable, in peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (and ſuch as the Magiſtrate found meet to be tolerated in other Churches, who only were uncapable in that).</p>
            <p>2. They were ſo far for Presbytery, as to hold, that 1. If men of competent ſufficiency, were made by ordination Elders, <hi>ejuſdem ordinis</hi> with the chief Paſtor, to be his Aſſeſſors and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, though they ſeldom, or never Preached publickly, but helped him in Catechizing, or private over ſight, and in judging perſons and caſes; and though in neceſſity they laboured with their hands, it would not be unlike the ancient Government. 2. And they judged, that all Gods work ſhould be done in the greateſt concord, and with the beſt mutual counſel and help that might be; and therefore that Synods are to that end of great uſe: and if they were appointed at ſtated times and places, it would by order, be a furtherance to their ends: But they were not for their aſſuming a proper Regent Power, by Majority of Votes over the <hi>minor</hi> part, or the abſent Paſtors; and thought that when ſixedneſs occaſioned that uſurpation, occaſional Synods <hi>pro re natâ,</hi> were better. And 3. They judged, that Presbyters are <hi>ejuſdem ordinis</hi> with Biſhops, and that no Biſhops have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right to govern without the Presbyters aſſiſtance, nor to deprive them of any of their power, nor their Churches of true Diſcipline or Worſhip, nor the people of their Rights; much leſs to uſe any forcing power of the ſword on any.</p>
            <p>3. They were ſo far for Epiſcopacy, as to hold it lawful, and convenient, that the particular Churches have one that ſhall have a Priority, and in many things a Negative Vote, as the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
<pb facs="tcp:97268:3"/>
in each Pariſh hath among his Curates a ſort of power. And that the Presbyteries and Synods have their Moderators; and if they were fixed <hi>durante vitâ,</hi> and had a Negative Vote in Ordinations, they could conſent; ſobeit they were duly choſen as of old, and had no forcing power by the ſword, but only a Miniſterial, teaching, guiding power. And ſome of them thought it of Divine right, that the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts have Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in the ordinary parts of their office; and that to have a ſpecial ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of many Churches, and their Biſhops and Elders are ſome of that ordinary part.</p>
            <p>4. And to the <hi>Eraſtians</hi> alſo they granted, that the King is the Supreme Governour of the Church, by the ſword, or force; and that we muſt obey him, not only when he enforceth the Commands of Chriſt, but in all acts of outward circumſtance and order, left by God to his determination, and not appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the Miniſters office. Theſe were the thoughts then of the far greateſt part of the Miniſters that I had then knowledge of.</p>
            <p>§. 2. Before the King returned, many Epiſcopal Doctors and great men, perſwaded theſe Reconcilers, that thus much would be accepted to our common concord, if the King were reſtored<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But ſome ſaid, They do but decieve you; there are ſuch men now got into chief credit on that ſide, that will ſilence you all, and ruine you, unleſs you will follow <hi>Grotius,</hi> or be of the <hi>French</hi> Religion, or unite in the Pope, as <hi>Principium unitatis,</hi> and obey him, as the <hi>Weſtern Patriarck,</hi> &amp;c. And when you are all turned out, what men have they to ſupply your places?</p>
            <p>§. 3. But when the King came in, and encouraged the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilers with the promiſe of his help, they made the attempt in 1660, and 1661. the Hiſtory of which I need not repeat, Since that foreſeeing what the ſilencing of ſo many Miniſters, and the afflicting of the people of our mind would unavoidably cauſe, we pleaded, we petitioned the Biſhops to have prevented it, by thoſe neceſſary means which they might have yielded
<pb facs="tcp:97268:4"/>
to, to their own advantage: But it was all in vain.</p>
            <p>§. 4. When the Act of Uniformity came out, of about 9000 Miniſters that kept in, and had laid by the Liturgy before, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 7000 Conformed (to the altered Liturgy, before any of them ever ſaw it, ſave a few) by declaring their <hi>Aſſent</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> (the Act being known before the Book could be Printed:) and about 2000 were ſilenced by that Act. How they behaved themſelves ſince then, is ſo well known, and I have here, and oft declared; and how the Plague firſt, and the burning of the Churches next, and the Kings Licenſes next, did give them the opportunities and calls which made more publick Preaching ſeem to them a duty, that I ſhall not make recital of it.</p>
            <p>§. 5. All this while abundance of invectiues were poured out againſt them, by many of the Conforming Clergy, in Preſs and Pulpits; and eſpecially in the ears of great men, to whom we had no acceſs, but ſeemed what ſuch men deſcribed us to be. The new Laws againſt Conventicles, and the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinement had been added to the firſt: Many were hunted up and down, their Goods and Libraries diſtrained; many were impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned; ſome there died: The Informers and Proſecutors grew weary: They ſaw the ſeverity came moſt from the Prelates, and the Parliament, the King being not for ſeverity therein: The Juſtices grew unwilling of Execution; the Preachers reprove them, and call on them to put the Laws in Execution; they are greatly offended at the Kings Licenſes; they continue to accuſe us for Schiſm at leaſt, and ſome of Sedition; though we invaded none of their Temples, nor askt them for any part of their maintenance. And the Parliament and Prelates were ſo ſharp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, that we durſt not tell the world <hi>what we refuſed</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi> and <hi>why,</hi> leſt we put them upon more ſeverity; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>could we do it,</hi> the Preſs was lockt up by ſo great penalties. But while we were forced to ſilence, we were lowdly called to, to ſay <hi>what we ſtuck at,</hi> and <hi>what it was that we would have.</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:97268:4"/>
after 17 years ſuch calls, I ventured to name the things; and hence is the ſtorm of the preſent indignation.</p>
            <p>§. 6. I had before proved the wilful deſertion of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, eſpecially when the King Licenſed us, to be odious Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg: To this I am told, of mens power to ſilence ſuch as they think deſerve it: I grant it, if they truly think ſo: ſo may they on juſt cauſe alienate Churches, and Church-lands, and hang Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors: but not when no ſuch cauſe is given, nor at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>§. 7. When in the fitſt <hi>Plea for Peace</hi> I had ſtated the caſe of our Nonconformity, I intended to bring the Proofs of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſuppoſed ſinful, as I after found occaſion. And meeting with abundance that accuſed us of diſloyal, rebellious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I largly delivered my own, and many others judgment of Civil and Ecceſiaſtical Authority, the power of Princes, and the duty of Subjects; and therein alſo wrote ſome Anſwer to Four Accuſations brought againſt us. 1. That we pretend Grace againſt Morality. 2. That we hold, that things Indifferent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came unlawful, if commanded. 3. I largly confuted Biſhop <hi>Morley</hi>'s falſe Accuſation of my Doctrine, of the Magiſtrates power to command things unlawful by accident; and Dr. <hi>Parker</hi>'s Doctrine of Scandal. 4. I confuted them that extend our Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity to things which we refuſe not. All this in the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Plea for Peace;</hi> which none yet, that I know of, have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
            <p>§. 8. And leſt any ſhould think that we are all for Negatives, I wrote a Treatiſe of the <hi>only Terms of Univerſal Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi> which I value above all the reſt, being aſſured that the Churches will never otherwiſe be healed, than by that impartial, ſure, and eaſie Catholick way, which ſome have reviled, but none ſince, that I know of, confuted. One Learned Biſhop (that had a chief hand in our preſent Impoſitions and ejection)
<pb facs="tcp:97268:5"/>
I deſired to tell me, <hi>which is the way</hi> of Chriſtian concord, if this be not: And he maintaineth, That <hi>the only way is to obey the Colledg of Paſtors, who are to govern the Catholick Church through all the world, per Literas formatas.</hi> Where this Colledg, as one governing power do meet, or how they ſignifie their Majority of Votes, and in what caſes, and who muſt gather the Votes (from <hi>Abaſſia</hi> to <hi>Moſcovie</hi>), and in how long time, and how <hi>they</hi> ſhall come to all men with certainty; and whether the eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ſilenced, and excommunicated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may appeal to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I could not learn.</p>
            <p>§. 9. In the ſame Book I ſufficientiy confuted Mr. <hi>H. Dodwell</hi>'s great Book, which denyeth not only the Churches and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, which are not by uninterrupted Epiſcopal Ordination, but alſo the ordinary ſalvation of all ſuch Churches, as having no covenant promiſe, by valid Sacraments delivered them. He hath pretended ſome defence in a late Book of Letters: to which, if they can be Printed, I hope to give eaſily a ſatisfactory reply.</p>
            <p>§. 10. In the ſame book he Publiſheth ſome old Letters of his to me, for the Dioceſan frame of <hi>Government; the notice of which beforehand</hi> given me, cauſed me to Publiſh a <hi>full Treatiſe of Dioceſan Epiſcopacy,</hi> containing the Reaſons why we cannot ſwear to it, or approve it, or ſwear never to endeavour any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming alteration of the frame here ſetled, and exerciſed. And whatever Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> pretendeth to the contrary, if this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe do not fully anſwer his Letter, and juſtifie us in this part of Nonconformity, I am unable to judg of the Cauſe, but am willing to recieve any better information.</p>
            <p>§. 11. And becauſe I find falſe Hiſtory, not the leaſt cauſe of ordinary miſtakes, and men cry up Dioceſan Prelacy, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and chief cure of Schiſm; I gathered an Abſtract of the hiſtory of Biſhops, and their Councils, that the true matter of fact might not be ſo commonly miſtaken as it is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97268:5"/>§. 12. At the ſame time came out againſt me, Firſt, a book of Mr. <hi>John Cheyneys,</hi> the miſtakes of which I manifeſted in an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: And afterward old Letters of Mr. <hi>Hinkleys,</hi> to which I had an old Anſwer, which I caſt by, and now Publiſhed: and another Accuſer, abounding with untruths, called the <hi>Impleder;</hi> and another called <hi>Reflections,</hi> or <hi>Speculum,</hi> &amp;c. And another Book of Mr. <hi>Cheneys,</hi> full of moſt pitiful miſtakes; All which, with Juſtice <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange</hi>'s Dialogue, and ſomeothers, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered together in a Book called the <hi>Third Defence ef the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>§. 13. But the Accuſations of Dean <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his Sermon, made the loudeſt noiſe: In the Anſwer to which, I chiefly deſired to have come to ſome underſtanding agreement with him, about the true ſtate of our Caſe and Controverſie; and to that end, craved his anſwer to ſeveral neceſſary queſtions; but was not able to procure it. And now in his large Book, where I hoped to have found an Anſwer to them, I look for it in vain. Yea, though Mr. <hi>Hikeringhill</hi> roughly provoked him but to expound his own Text, and tell us intelligibly, what <hi>the ſame Rule</hi> is, which the Apoſtle would have all walk by, he will not do it; but inſtead of that, with unuſual gentleneſs tells me, he will <hi>not differ about it,</hi> if I do but grant, that it is a <hi>Rule that binds us all to do all that lawfully we can for peace,</hi> which I cheerfully grant; And if it be <hi>not lawful</hi> for peace and concord to forbear ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing us, impriſoning us, accuſing us as odious for not wilful ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and urging Magiſtrates to execute the Laws againſt us, and making us ſeem Schiſmaticks for not forbearing to Preach the Goſpel, to which we were vowed and conſecrated by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; I know not lawful from unlawful: I cannot yet get him to tell us, what he would have the many ſcore thouſands do on the Lords Days, that have no room in the Pariſh-Churches; with many ſuch, which our caſe is concerned in.</p>
            <p>§. 14. I thought his Book had been an Anſwer to mine, and other mens Prefaces; but I find that I was miſtaken: Indeed he <hi>nameth</hi> five Books written againſt his Accuſation: what he ſaith to Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Alſop,</hi> I leave to themſelves to conſider of: The
<pb facs="tcp:97268:6"/>
Countrey Gentlemans Caſe, in ſenſe, was this, <hi>Whether all they that think Pariſh Communion, under the preſent impoſitions, to be ſin, are bound, till they can change their judgment, to forbear all Church-worſhip, and live like Atheiſts, and ſo be damned?</hi> And who can find any Anſwer to this?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Barret</hi>'s Queries out of his Books, he ſaith, next nothing to, but a dark retracting his <hi>Irenicon:</hi> And far be it from me to blame him for growing wiſer. But why took he no notice of his own words, cited in the Epiſtle, out of his late Book againſt Idolatry, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us all with no leſs than damnation, if <hi>me prefer not the pureſt Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to my <hi>Defence,</hi> his Book is nothing like an Anſwer, unleſs his naming me, and citing out of that, and other Books, a few broken ſcraps, which he thought he could make ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of, may be called an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>§. 15. I confeſs he hath made ſome attempt to tell me <hi>what the National Church of</hi> England <hi>is;</hi> but ſo Independently, as I doubt his party will diſown it with great offence. In ſhort, he holds, that there is no ſuch thing as a Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the uſual Political ſenſe, having any Conſtitutive, Eccleſiaſtical, Supreme Power, Monarchical, or Ariſtocratical, or Democratical, but it's only the many Churches in <hi>England,</hi> aſſociated by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Parliament, &amp;c. Remember that he and I are ſo far agreed.</p>
            <p>As I was writing this, I ſaw a Book againſt him of a friend, too much for me, and ſomewhat freely handling the Dr. which in this point would help them, by ſaying, that the <hi>Convocation having the Legiſlative Church-Power, may be the Conſtitutive, Regent part:</hi> But he confeſſeth to me, that he ſpake not <hi>what is,</hi> but <hi>what he counts ſhould be, or wiſheth;</hi> for the Dr. himſelf had before told us, that the Convocations of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York</hi> are <hi>two,</hi> and not united to make <hi>one National, ſupreme power;</hi> ſo that this proveth <hi>no one political Church of England</hi> at all, but only 2 Provincial Churches in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 16. The Dr. hath ſo judiciouſly and honeſtly pleaded our Cauſe in his defence of A. Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and his Book againſt Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that I have made his words the firſt Chap. of this Book, which if he candidly ſtand to, I ſee not but our principles are the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97268:6"/>§. 17. His book is made up of 3 parts. I. Untrue Accuſations. II. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true Hiſtorical Citations (abundance). III. Fallacious Reaſonings.</p>
            <p>Would you have an undeniable Confutation, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> in few words?</p>
            <p>I. As to his <hi>Principles,</hi> he ſaith himſelf as aforeſaid, <hi>Of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi> p. 7. <hi>We are ſure that wilful ignorance,</hi> or <hi>chooſing a worſe Church before a better, is a damnable ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. As to his Hiſtory of the old <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> read A. Biſhop <hi>Bancrofts</hi> dangerous Poſitions, and <hi>Heylins</hi> Hiſtory of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, charging them odiouſly with the clean contrary, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons made againſt them on that ſuppoſition.</p>
            <p>III. As to his Hiſtory, and Doctrine againſt the Election of Bp<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, which I pleaded; (as I have fully proved his abuſe of Hiſtory in it,) I repeat Mr. <hi>Thorndikes</hi> words, <hi>Forbear. of Penalty. It is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to talk of Reformation of the Churchtoregular Government, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſtoring the liberty of chooſing Biſhops, and priviledg of enjoying them to the Synods, Clergy and people, in the making of thoſe of whom they conſiſt, and by whom they are to be governed, that I need make no other reaſon of the neglect of Epiſcopacy, than the neglect of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O pray hard to God to provide greater ſtore of skilful, holy and peaceable Labourers for his Harveſt, that by the ſound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a better world, have overcome the deluding love of the honours, proſperity and pleaſures of the fleſh, and wholly live to God and Heaven.</p>

            <p>DR. <hi>Edward Stillingfleet Irenic. P.</hi> 114. <hi>ſaith,</hi> The Epiſcopal men will hardly find any evidence in Scripture, or in the practice of the Apoſtles, for Churches conſiſting of many fixed Congregations for worſhip, under the charge of one Paſtor; nor in the Primitive Church, for the Ordination of a Biſhop, without the preceding Election of the Clergy, and at leaſt, conſent and approbation of the people; and neither in Scripture nor Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the leaſt foot-ſtep of the delegation of Church-power; ſo that upon the matter all of them at laſt make uſe of thoſe things in Church-Government, which have no other foundation but the principles of humane prudence, guided by Scripture; and it were well if that were obſerved ſtill.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97268:7"/>
               <hi>P.</hi> 370. Surely then their Dioceſſes we re not very large, if all the ſeveral Pariſhes could communicate on the ſame day, with what was ſent from the Cathedral Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 361. I doubt not but to make it appear, that <hi>Philippi</hi> was not the Metropolis of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and therefore the Biſhops there mentioned could not be the Biſhops of the ſeveral Cities under the juriſdiction of <hi>Philippi,</hi> but muſt be underſtood of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops reſident in that City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 157. There muſt be a form of Eccleſiaſtical Government o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Nation, as a Church, as well as of Civil Government over it as a Society governed by the ſame Laws.—For every Society muſt have its Government belonging to it, as ſuch a Society: And the ſame reaſon that makes Government neceſſary, in any particular Congregation, will make it neceſſary for all the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, joyning together in one viſible Society, as a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar National Church: For the Unity and Peace of that Church ought much more to be lookt after, than of any one Congregation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 131. The Churches power, as to Divine Law, being only directive and declarative; but as confirmed by a Civil Sanction, is juridical and obligatory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 113. Where any Church is guilty of corruptions, both in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and in practice, which it avoweth, and profeſſeth, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the owning them, as neceſſary conditions of Communion with her; there a Noncommunion with that Church is neceſſary, and a total and poſitive ſeparation is lawful and convenient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 117. Where any Church retaining purity of Doctrine, doth require the owning of, and conforming to any unlawful, or ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted practice; men may lawfully deny Conformity to, and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with that Church in ſuch things, without incurring the guilt of Schiſm-. <hi>P.</hi> 119. Let men turn and wind themſelves which way they will, by the very ſame argument that any will prove ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> lawful, becauſe ſhe required unlawful things as Conditions of her Communion; it will be proved lawful not to Conform to any ſuſpected, or unlawful practice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>-. They lay the imputation of Schiſm on all them who require ſuch Conditions of Communion, and take it wholly off from thoſe who refuſe to Conform for Conſcience ſake.</p>

            <head>A Premiſed explication of the Equivocal word <hi>CHURCH.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE word [<hi>CHURCH</hi>] being Equivocal, is unfit for our diſputation, till explained: It ſignifieth (being a <hi>Relative</hi>) <hi>ſeveral</hi> ſorts of related Aſſemblies: which are diſtinct. I. In their <hi>Matter:</hi> A Church of <hi>Jews, Turks, Chriſtians,</hi> of Orthodox, and of Hereticks, being not one thing.</p>
            <p>II. In the <hi>Efficient:</hi> A Church of <hi>Gods</hi> inſtituting, or a Church of mans.</p>
            <p>III. In the <hi>Fnds.</hi> 1. A Chriſtian Aſſembly at a Fair, or Market, or Court, or Army, &amp;c. is not the ſame with an Aſſembly for Religious exerciſes. 2. Nor an Aſſembly for <hi>Legiſlation</hi> about Religion (in Parliament), or <hi>Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in Synods, or <hi>Diſputation</hi> in Schools, the ſame thing as an Aſſembly for ſtated worſhip. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. In the <hi>Form,</hi> or Conſtitutive Relation to the Correlate: And ſo the great difference which now concerneth us to note is, that a <hi>Church of Equals in Office</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> is one thing, and a <hi>Political Society,</hi> related as <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> and <hi>governed,</hi> is another.</p>
            <p>The firſt, is either an <hi>accidental Aſſembly,</hi> or elſe a <hi>deſigned Aſſemby</hi> by conſent.</p>
            <p>This laſt is either an Aſſembly of <hi>Lay-men,</hi> which may be agreed hereafter to come under Government; and may meet to worſhip God without a Paſtor; and this in Politicks is uſually called, a <hi>meer Community.</hi> 2. Or an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Rulers or Paſtors in equality (as to Government there): And this is called, a <hi>Council, Synod, Dyet, Parliament, Convention,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>V. A <hi>Governed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or <hi>Political Church</hi> is of Three ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> (at leaſt) as there are three <hi>Species</hi> of ſuch Government.</p>
            <p>I. A <hi>Chriſtian Family,</hi> conſiſting of the <hi>Family-Government,</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> living together in holy faith, love, worſhip, and obedience to God; the Maſter being their Teacher, Ruler, and Guide in worſhip.</p>
            <p>II. A <hi>Paſtoral-Church,</hi> conſiſting of one, or more Paſtors, and Chriſtian people correlated as his flock, for the benefit of his Paſtoral office, which eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially containeth a <hi>power to teach them, lead them in worſhip,</hi> and <hi>govern them by the Keys,</hi> as a Miniſterial Judg, who is fit for that Commmunion. All together is called alſo, the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Keys,</hi> and is ſubordinate to Chriſts <hi>Teaching, Prieſtly,</hi> and <hi>Ruling</hi> Office.</p>
            <p>III. A <hi>Royal,</hi> or <hi>Magiſtratical Church,</hi> conſiſting of a <hi>Chriſtian Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Subjects,</hi> to be ruled by his ſword, or forcing power under Chriſt, and his Laws, for the ſpiritual and temporal welfare of the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and the glorifying, and pleaſing the Lord Redeemer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97268:8"/>And IV. The <hi>Univerſal Church</hi> comprehendeth all theſe three as parts, and is moſt excellently, properly, and fully called, <hi>the Church, conſiſting of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the chief Paſtor (<hi>Teacher, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> an eminent perfect <hi>Policy</hi>) with all Chriſtians, as the ſubject part: It is viſible in that the ſubjects, and their profeſſion, and worſhip are viſible; aod Chriſt was viſible on earth, is viſible in the Court of Heaven, his Laws, and Providence are viſible, and he will viſibly judg the world, and reign for ever: And it is no further viſible. The conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive, eſſential parts, are only <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>ſubject-body:</hi> The nobleſt, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical parts of that body, are Prophets, Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, and Teachers.</p>
            <p>In all this, note 1. That we have no difference, that I know of, about the Church in any of theſe ſenſes before mentioned, except,</p>
            <p>1. How far men may invent Church-forms for Gods ſervice (without Gods particular preſcript, or inſtitution).</p>
            <p>2. Whether it be true, that the King is ſo <hi>perſona mixta,</hi> as ſome hold, as to be <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and to have the power of Church-Keys, and Word, and Sacraments.</p>
            <p>3. Whether over and above the <hi>loweſt Paſtoral Churches</hi> Chriſt hath inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a direct, ſuperior Paſtoral ſort of Churches, to rule the inferior, in <hi>Faith, Worſhip,</hi> and the <hi>Keys</hi> of Diſcipline, over Paſtors and people? And if ſo, what are theſe ſuperior Paſtoral Churches, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther Dioceſan, Provincial, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, Patriarchal, Papal, or all? And if <hi>Chriſt</hi> made no ſuch, whether <hi>men</hi> may make them?</p>
            <p>2. And note, that we are certainly agreed, that the <hi>Magiſtratical form</hi> of <hi>forcing power,</hi> and the Paſtoral form of <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> power of the Keys, are two, though the ſubjects ſhould be the ſame (though uſually the <hi>Church</hi> is in the Commonwealth, as part): And none of us deny a <hi>Chriſtian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> Monarchical, Ariſtocratical, or Democratical; and though this <hi>power</hi> be <hi>over the Paſtoral Church,</hi> it is but <hi>Accidental,</hi> and not <hi>Eſſential</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>3. And note, that the chief questions which I put to the Dr. about this, were, <hi>1. What is the Paſtoral ſpecifying form of the Church of</hi> England? And 2. Whether it be of <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>humane Inſtitution:</hi> And I have brought him to maintain, that <hi>there is no ſuch Church of</hi> England at all. And of the Royal Church or Kingdom we are Members as well as he.</p>
            <p>4. And Laſtly, Note, that as to a <hi>Paſtoral Church,</hi> we agree, I ſuppoſe, in diſtinguiſhing a <hi>Tranſient,</hi> and a <hi>fixed</hi> relation. And as he that is a Licenſed Phyſician, acteth as ſuch where he cometh, though related fixedly to no Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; ſo if a lawful Miniſter of Chriſt, either fixed in another Church, or in none but the Univerſal, be called, <hi>pro tempore,</hi> for a day, to do his office in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Church, he acteth as Chriſts Miniſter, and their Paſtor for that day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: And if a travelling Chriſtian joyn with them, he is a Member for that day:
<pb facs="tcp:97268:8"/>
Yea, if the whole company intend to meet but that one day in the ſame relations, to the ſame ends, it is a temporary, tranſient Paſtoral Church. But fixed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants for order and edification, ought to fix their relation and practice.</p>
            <p>Though moſt of this be ſaid after, where he calls me to it, I thought meet here to premiſe the Explication of the word [<hi>Church</hi>] (as in divers books largely I have done of the word [<hi>Separation</hi>] leſt I imitate him in leaving my explication to the hinder part, and we ſhould diſpute about a word, which the Reader, and perhaps our ſelves underſtand not.</p>
            <p>But we have a greater controverſie than this, riſen ſince A. Biſhop Laud's, and <hi>Grotius's</hi> Reconciling deſign, <hi>v z.</hi> what the <hi>Catholick viſible Church</hi> is?</p>
            <p>1. Proteſtants have hitherto held, as the first point of difference from the Papiſts, that the <hi>Univerſal Church hath no conſtitutive Head, or ſupreme regent Power but Chriſt.</hi> He hath ſetled no one, Vicarious, or deputed ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, Monarchical, Ariſtocratical, or Democratical.</p>
            <p>2. Accordingly they noted the difference of two ſorts of Papiſts, ſome that ſet the Pope as ſuperior, above Councils; others (as the Councils of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> that make the General Council ſupreme, the Pope being Preſident, as the chief of the Patriarchs, and having many priviledges, as Primate to the Univerſal Church.</p>
            <p>3. But that in truth, the Catholick governing power of Pope, and the other four Patriarchs, was but a humane form of Church Policy ſetled in one Empire as a National kind of Church, and the Councils were Univerſal as to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but not to all the Chriſtian world (which I have proved againſt <hi>W. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> fully) called by the Emperour that had no power over other Nations, and ſubſcribed by his ſubjects.</p>
            <p>4. That the grand cheat that hath ſet up Popery, is the <hi>turning this Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church into an Univerſal Government of all the Chriſtian world;</hi> and pretending that Chriſt, or his Apoſtles ſet up that power over all, which Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, and Imperial Councils ſet up only over one Empire.</p>
            <p>5. We are ſworn againſt Forreign Juriſdiction by the Oath of Supremacy. For the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire is diſſolved, and if it were not, we are no ſubjects of it.</p>
            <p>6. Yet we hold that all Chriſtians ſhould live in all poſſible love and concord, counſelling, and helping one another for the edification of the Church; and that ſuch Councils are uſeful thereto, as may be had without more hurt than good. But that no Univerſal governing power beſides Chriſts (for Legiſlation, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Execution) is needful to that concord; nor is a Government of the whole Chriſtian world by any <hi>one Political ſupreme, Pope</hi> or <hi>Council,</hi> or <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Paſtors,</hi> or <hi>Cardinals,</hi> any more poſſible or lawful to be ſought, than that all the Kingdoms on earth have one humane civil Soveraign; though all Kings, as well as all Biſhops, are bound to ſerve God with the greateſt concord that they can attain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97268:9"/>But now he that will read many late Divines of <hi>England,</hi> will find, that they are come to this, 1. To take the foreſaid <hi>Conciliar,</hi> and <hi>French Papiſts</hi> to be <hi>no Papiſts;</hi> and ſo to make it a controverſie, <hi>de nomine</hi> (in which, for me, let them have their liberty). 2 To take it for a neceſſary thing, to believe that the <hi>Univerſal Church in the world hath one ſupreme governing power under Chriſt,</hi> and is a <hi>Society,</hi> that is, <hi>therein viſibly one.</hi> And 3. That this <hi>one ruling power</hi> is either a <hi>General Council,</hi> or the <hi>Colledg of all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops on earth.</hi> 4. And that the Imperial Church-form was, and is to be the true Univerſal Church form, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>General Council,</hi> where the five Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs are by themſelves, or by conſent. 5. And that the Pope is <hi>Preſident,</hi> and <hi>Principium unitatis,</hi> and <hi>chief Patriarch,</hi> and ſo to be obeyed by us. 6. And that there is no true way to Univerſal concord but by being of <hi>this one Church, ſo formed,</hi> and <hi>obeying its Univerſal Laws,</hi> which they ſay, chriſt hath given them power to make. 7.

            <p>A great deal more of this nature is built on this principle, that the <hi>Church in all the earth is one, as under one humane ſupreme Government, under Chriſt,</hi> and that <hi>all are Schiſmaticks that are not of it,</hi> and <hi>obey it not.

For can any one imagine it ſhould be a fault in any to keep off from communion, where they are ſo far from being obliged to it, that they have an obligation to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary from the principles of their common Chriſtianity? And where men are bound not to communicate, it is impoſſible to prove their not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to be Schiſm. For there can be no Schiſm; but where there is an obligation to communion; Schiſm being nothing elſe but a willful violation of the bonds Chriſtian communion. And therefore whenever you would prove the Proteſtants guilty of Schiſm, you muſt do it by prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were bound to communicate with your Church in thoſe things which they are Proteſtants for diſowning of, or that there is ſo abſolute and unlimited an obligation to continue in the ſociety of your Church, that no conditions can be ſo hard, but we are bound rather to ſubmit

to them, then not joyn in Communion with you.</q>
               </p>
               <q>This being a matter of ſo vaſt conſequence in order to the ſetling mens minds in the preſent diſputes of the Chriſtian world, before I come to particulars, I ſhall lay down thoſe general principles which may mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt how free Proteſtants are from all imputation of Schiſm. Schiſm then importing a violation of that communion which we are obliged to the moſt natural way for underſtanding what Schiſm is, is to enquire what the foundations are of Chriſtian communion, and how far the bounds of it do extend. Now the Foundations of Chriſtian communion in general depend upon the acknowledgment of the truth of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For that Religion which Chriſt came to deliver to the world being ſuppoſed true, is the reaſon why any look on themſelves as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to profeſs it; which obligation extending to all perſons who have the ſame grounds to beleive the truth of it, thence ariſeth the ground of ſociety in this profeſſion, which is a common obligation on ſeveral perſons joyning together in ſome acts of common concernment to them. The truth then of Chriſtian Religion being acknowledged by ſeveral perſons, they find in this Religion ſome actions which are to be performed by ſeveral perſons in ſociety with each other. From whence ariſeth that more immediate obligation to Chriſtian ſociety in all thoſe who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians; and the whole number of theſe who own that truth of Chriſtian Religion, and are thereby obliged to joyn in ſociety with each other, is that which we call the Catholick Church. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be ſuch a relation to each other in all Chriſtians as to make them one common ſociety, yet for the performance of particular acts of communion, there muſt be leſſer ſocieties wherein perſons may joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the actions belonging to them. But ſtill the obligation to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in theſe leſſer is the ſame with that which conſtitutes the great body of Chriſtians, which is the owning Chriſtianity as the only true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and way to eternal happineſs. And therefore thoſe leſſer ſocieties cannot in Juſtice make the <hi>neceſſary conditions of Communion narrower</hi> than thoſe which belong to the <hi>Catholick Curch,</hi> i. e. thoſe things which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare men Chriſtians ought to capacitate them for communion with Chriſtians.</q>
               <p>
                  <q>But here we are to conſider that as to be a Chriſtian ſuppoſeth mens owning the Chriſtian Religion to be true, ſo the conveyance of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion being now to us in thoſe books we call the Scriptures, there muſt be an acknowledgment of them as the indiſpenſable rule of faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which is, that theſe books are the great Charter of the Chriſtian ſociety according to which it muſt be governed.</q>

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97268:13"/>
                  <q>Theſe things being premiſed as the foundation in general of Chriſtian ſociety, we ſhall the better underſtand how far the obligation to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in it doth extend. For which it muſt be conſidered that the grounds of continuance in communion muſt be ſuitable and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the firſt reaſon of entring into it. No man being obliged by virtue of his being in a ſociety, to agree in any thing that tends to the apparent ruin of that ſociety: But he is obliged to the contrary, from the general grounds of his firſt admiſſion into it. His primary obligation being to preſerve the honour and intereſt of it, and to joyn in acts of it ſo far as they tend to it. Now the main end of the Chriſtian ſociety, being the promotion of Gods honour, and Salvation of mens Souls, the primary obligation of men entring into it, is the advancement of theſe ends to joyn in all acts of it ſo far as they tend to theſe ends; but if any thing come to be required directly repugnant to theſe ends, thoſe men of whom ſuch things are required, are bound not to communicate in thoſe leſſer ſocieties where ſuch things are impoſed, but to preſerve their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Catholick ſocietie of Chriſtians.</q>

There is no ſociety of Chriſtians of any one communion, but may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome things to be beleived or practiſed which may be repugnant to the general Foundation of Chriſtian ſociety.</q>

There being a poſſibility acknowledged that particular Churches may require unreaſonable conditions of communion, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to communion cannot be abſolute and indiſpenſable; but only ſo far as nothing is required deſtructive to the ends of Chriſtian Society: Otherwiſe men would be bound to deſtroy that which they beleive, and to do the moſt unjuſt and unreaſonable things. But the greater difficulty lies in knowing when ſuch things are required, and who muſt be the Judge in that caſe, to which I anſwer.</q>

                  <q>3. Nothing can be more unreaſonable than that the ſociety impoſing ſuch conditions of communion ſhould be judge, whether thoſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be juſt and equitable or no. If the queſtion were only in matters of peace, conveniency, and order, the judgment of the ſociety ought to over-rule the judgments of particular perſons; but in ſuch caſes where great bodies of Chriſtians judge ſuch things required to be unlawful conditions of communion, what Juſtice or reaſon is there that the party ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed ſhould fit Judge in her own cauſe?</q>

But, I never ſaid or thought, that the Proteſtants made this rent. The Cauſe of the Schiſm is yours; for you thruſt us from you, becauſe we call'd for truth, and redreſs of abuſes. For a Schiſm muſt needs be theirs, whoſe the cauſe of it is. The <hi>Wo</hi> runs full out of the mouth of Chriſt ever againſt him that gives the offence, not againſt him that takes it ever.</q>

For (as I ſaid before) the Schiſm is theirs, whoſe the cauſe of it is: and he makes the Separation, that gives the firſt juſt cauſe of it; not he that makes an actual Separation upon a juſt Cauſe preceding. And this is ſo evident a Truth, that <hi>A. C.</hi> cannot deny it, for he ſays it is moſt true.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That the Reader may clearly underſtand the full State of this Controverſie concerning Schiſm; the upſhot of which, is, that it is agreed between both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that all Separation from Communion with a Church doth not involve in it the guilt of Schiſm, but only ſuch a Separation as hath no ſufficient cauſe or ground for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 131. <q>There can be no Separation from the whole Church, but in ſuch things wherein the unity of the whole Church lies; for Separation is a violation of ſome Union: Now when men ſeparate from the errors of all particular Churches, they do not ſeparate from the whoſe, becauſe thoſe things, which one ſeparates from thoſe particular Churches for, are not ſuch, as make all them put together to be the whole or Catholick Church. This muſt be ſomewhat further explained. There are two things conſiderable in all particular Churches; thoſe things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it as a Church, and thoſe things which belong to it as a particular Church. Thoſe things which belong to it as a Church, are the common ligaments or grounds of Union between all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, which taken together make up the Catholick Church:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97268:14"/>
Thoſe things which belong to it as a particular Church, are ſuch as it may retain the eſſence of a Church without. Now, I ſay, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeparates from any particular Church (much more from all) for ſuch things without which that can be no Church, ſeparates from the Communion of the Catholick Church: but he that ſeparates only from particular Churches, as to ſuch things which concern not their being, is onely ſeparated from the Communion of thoſe Churches, and not the Catholick. And therefore ſuppoſing that all perticular Churches have ſome errors and corruptions in them, though I ſhould ſeparate from them all, I do not ſeparate from the Communion of the whole Church, unleſs it be for ſomething, without which thoſe could be no Churches. An evidence of which, is, that by my declaring the grounds of my ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be ſuch Errours and corruptions, which are crept into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of ſuch Churches, and impoſed on me in order to it, I withal declare my readineſs to joyn with them again, if thoſe errours and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions be left out. And where there is this readineſs of Communion, there is no abſolute ſeparation from the Church as ſuch, but only ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Communion till ſuch abuſes be reformed: which is therefore more properly a ſeparation from the errors, than the Communion of ſuch a Church, wherefore if we ſuppoſe, that there is no one viſible Church, whoſe Communion is not tainted with ſome corruptions, though if theſe corruptions be injoyned as conditions of communion, I cannot commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with any of thoſe Churches, yet it followes not that I am ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the external Communion of the Catholick Church, but that I only ſuſpend Communion with thoſe particular Churches, 'till I may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyn with them. As, ſuppoſe all the particular men I can converſe with, were infected with Leproſie, my not aſſociating with them, doth not imply that I am ſeparated from the Communion of all Mankind, but that I am loath to be infected as they are, and therefore withdraw my ſelf, till I can meet with ſuch healthful perſons with whom I may ſafely aſſociate again. And if ſeveral other perſons be of the ſame mind with me, and we therefore joyn together, do we therefore divide our ſelves from the whole World by only taking care of our own ſafety? And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if any company of ſuch leprous perſons ſhould reſolve that none ſhould live among them, but ſuch as would eat of thoſe meats which brought that diſtemper upon them, our withdrawing our ſelves and aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating without them will ſtill appear more reaſonable and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Therefore we ſay, we do not neceſſarily ſeparate from all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that have errors or corruptions in them, ſuppoſing thoſe errors and corruptions be not impoſed on us, as conditions of communion; and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97268:15"/>
thence though we ſhould grant, no one viſible Church free from taint or corruption, yet it is not neceſſary we ſhould ſeparate from them all: for we may lawfully joyne in communion with Churches having error and corruptions, if our joyning be not an approbation of them. Thus though the <hi>Greeks, Armenians, Albigenſes, Abyſſins</hi> may have ſome errors, or corruptions, yet if they be not fundamental, and be not joyned as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be approved in order to their communion, notwithſtanding them, we may lawfully communicate with them, it doth not then at all follow, that if there may be no one viſible Church free from error and corruption, it would be neceſſary to ſeparate from the communion of the Catholick Church: Becauſe, 1. All thoſe particular Churches may not make thoſe errors conditions of communion. 2. Though they did, we ſeparate not from them as Catholick, but as corrupt and erroneous particular Churches.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 336. <q>To rectifie ſuch groſs miſtakes as theſe are for the future, you would do well to underſtand that Schiſm formally taken alwaies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſomething criminal in it, and there can be no juſt cauſe for a ſin; But beſides that there is that (which if you underſtand it) you would call the materiality of it, which is the ſeparation of one part of the Church from another. Now this according to the different grounds and reaſons of it, becomes lawful or unlawfull, that is, as the reaſons do make it neceſſary or unneceſſary, for ſeparation is not lawfull but when it is neceſſary; Now this being capable of ſuch a different nature that it may be good or evil according to its circumſtances, there can be no abſolute judgment paſſed upon it, till all thoſe reaſons and circumſtances be duely examined, and if there be no ſufficient grounds, for it then it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Schiſm <hi>i. e.</hi> a culpable ſeparation; If there be ſufficient cauſe then there may be a ſeparation, but it can be no Schiſm. And becauſe the union of the Catholick Church lies in fundamental and neceſſary truths, therefore there can be no ſeparation abſolutely from the Catholick Church, but what involves in it the formal guilt of Schiſm; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible any perſon ſhould have juſt cauſe to diſown the Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for any thing whoſe beleif is neceſſary to Salvation. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth ſo, thereby makes himſelf no member of the Church, becauſe the Church ſubſiſts on the beleif of fundamental truths. But in all ſuch caſes wherein a diviſion may be made, and yet the ſeveral perſons divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed retain the eſſentials of a Chriſtian Church, the ſeparation which may be among any ſuch muſt be determined according to the cauſes of it. For it being poſſible of one ſide that men out of capricious humours and fancies renounce the communion of a Church which requires nothing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97268:15"/>
But what is juſt and reaſonable: And it being poſſible on the other ſide, that, a Church, calling her ſelf Catholick, may ſo far degenerate in Faith and Practice, as not only to be guilty of great Errors and corruptions, but to impoſe them as conditions of Communion with her, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, where there is a manifeſt ſeparation, to inquire into the reaſons and grounds of it; and to determine the nature of it according to the Justice of the cauſe, which is pleaded for it.</q>

For whatever confines muſt likewiſe divide the Church, for by that confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a ſeparation is made between the part confined and the other, which ſeparation muſt be made by the Party ſo limiting Communion. As it was in the Caſe of the Donatiſts, who were therefore charged with Schiſme, becauſe they confined the Catholick Church, within their own bounds: And if any other Church doth the ſame which they did, it muſt be liable to the ſame charge that they were. The ſum of this diſcourſe is, that the being of the Catholick Church lies in Eſſentials, that for a particular Church to diſagree from all other particular Churches in ſome extrinſical and accidental things is not to ſeparate from the Catholick Church, ſo as to ceaſe to be a Church: But ſtill what ever Church makes ſuch extrinſical things the neceſſary conditions of Communion, ſo as to caſt men out of the Church, who yeild not to them, is Schiſmatical in ſo doing; For it thereby divides it ſelf from the Catholick Church: And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97268:16"/>
the ſaparation from it is ſo far from being Schiſm, that being caſt our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the Schiſmatical Church and not ours: For although before this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing humor came into particular Churches, Schiſm was defined by the Fathers and others to be a voluntary departure out of the Church, yet that cannot in reaſon be underſtood of any particular, but the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. For not only perſons but Churches may depart from the Catholick Church: And in ſuch Caſes not thoſe, who depart from the Communion of ſuch Churches, but thoſe Churches, which departed from the Catholick are guilty of Schiſm. Theſe things I thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be further explained, not only to ſhew how falſe that imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, of our Churches departing from the true Catholick Church; but with what great reaſon we charge your Church with departing from the communion of it; and therefore not thoſe whom you thruſt out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but your Church ſo thruſting them out, is apparently guilty of the preſent Schiſm.</q>

               <p>§ 1. THE impartial ſearchers after truth, have hitherto thought that a ſtrict method (at leaſt agreeable to natural Logick) is more effectual than confuſion or wordy popular haranges: And that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie ſhould be very cleerly ſtated before it can be profitably argued: And therefore that firſt all ambiguity of terms be by due explication re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, that men may not mean ſeveral things and not underſtand each other; and to <hi>Define</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> where it is needful, and then Affirm or deny, and then effectualy prove. But why this worthy perſon doth far otherwiſe with us, both before and now, it is more his part than mine to give the reaſon: I dare not ſay he cannot; Nor I dare not ſay, he can, but will not, but all that I can ſay is that <hi>he doth not,</hi> and I know not why.</p>

               <p>§ 3. His ſad ſaying [<hi>that there is no improbability that the Jeſuites ſhould be the firſt ſetters up of the way in</hi> England which he calls the Doctrine [<hi>of Spiritual Prayer</hi>] Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> hath opened, as it deſerveth, in part; but to ſay all that it deſerveth would ſeem ſo harſh, that I have reaſon to think that it would but more offend than profit him.</p>
               <p>§ 4. For I find that he is grown too impatient with our <hi>Nameing</hi> what he patiently and confidently doth: The cauſe of his impatience I leave to himſelf. But that it is much within him I muſt conjecture, when in his defence of Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> I read him ſaying to the Papiſts [<hi>To ſpeak mildly, it is a groſs untruth.</hi>] And yet wen I ſpeak not ſo plainly to him (and I think never more ſharply) he accounts it a <hi>continued Paſſion, Rage, Railing, Intollerable indiſcretion, &amp;c.</hi> Do I give him harder words than theſe? Yet I profeſs I ſmart not by them: I take them for very tollerable words, in compariſon of his miſcarriges in the cauſe in hand.</p>
               <p>Several ſorts of men I have found think other men ſpeak in paſſion: 1. Thoſe that hear and read with paſſion: They think that which angers them came from anger. 2. Thoſe that are too high to be dealt with on even terms, and think the plain ſpeech which agreeth to others is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of ſuch as them. 3. Thoſe that commit miſcarriages ſo groſs and defend cauſes ſo bad, as have no names but what are diſgraceful, and then take all that is ſaid to anatomatize their cauſe and errours, to be ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves. With theſe and ſuch others, <hi>Truth,</hi> is not tollerable he raileth that confuteth them, and doth <hi>Auriculas molles mordaci radere vero.</hi> I profeſs I felt ſo little paſſion in writing that book which he ſaith was written <hi>in one continued Paſſion,</hi> that I think verily, I ſinned all the while, for want of a livelier ſenſe of the ſin and hurt which I was detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by my confutation. But I confeſs it is my opinion that <hi>Falſhood</hi> of <hi>Speech</hi> may lie in deſcribing a thing <hi>ſhort of Truth,</hi> as well as in <hi>going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it:</hi> And that the <hi>Truth of words</hi> is their <hi>Agreeableneſs</hi> to the <hi>matter</hi> (and mind): And that <hi>verba rebus aptanda ſunt:</hi> And that he that writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt <hi>ſin</hi> muſt call it ſin, and open the evil of it.</p>
               <p>§ 5. His Preface giveth us hopes that we are ſo farr agreed in our ends,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97268:17"/>
as to be both for God, for truth, for unity and peace and Love, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery, and one would think this much ſhould go far towards our Concord. But, alas, all agree not what <hi>Piety</hi> is, or what Popery is, nor of the way to our ends.</p>
               <p>If he think that to be againſt <hi>Spiritual Prayer</hi> would help us againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, 1. I would he would tell us, <hi>which way.</hi> If by reducing the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts to think <hi>Formes lawful;</hi> ſo do the Jeſuites: And he told us that they at <hi>Franckford</hi> took a Forme from <hi>Geneva</hi> as uſeful: And the preſent Nonconformiſts put their judgment out of queſtion an. 1660, and 1661. In their witings, offers and Formes Printed. But all that are for Formes are not for all things in <hi>your Formes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And I would he would have better told us <hi>what the Spiritual Prayer is,</hi> which the Jeſuits firſt brought in and helpes in Popery. For hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it is the <hi>Dead Ceremonious formality and Imagery</hi> of Popery, deſtroying <hi>Spirituality,</hi> (by words not underſtood, Mummeries, Beads, Canting Stage workes) which hath alienated moſt Religious Proteſtants from them. I will. 1. Tell you what I take <hi>Spiritual Prayer</hi> to be; and then. 2. Deſire his judgment of it.</p>
               <p>1. It is my judgment (if he know it to be erroneous, I crave his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) 1. That Mans Soul is by ſin ſo depraved that it is morally unable without Gods Spirit, effectually to know, feel and deſire deliverance from his own ſin and miſery, and to deſire Gods Grace and Glory, above all worldly ſinful pleaſures.</p>
               <p>2. That therefore ſuch deſires in act and habit muſt be wrought in us by the Spirit of God. And the whole work of Regeneration and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is a giving to the Soul that new Divine nature, Love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, which worketh by ſuch holy deſires. And that as the carnal mind is enmity to God, and cannot be ſubject to his Law, and if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his; ſo to be Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally minded is life and peace, and God who is a Spirit will be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Spirit and truth, and by this we know that we are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God by the Spirit which he hath given us; For he promiſed to pour out the Spirit of Grace and ſupplication: And becauſe we are ſons, he hath given us the Spirit of his Son, by which we cry <hi>Abba Father:</hi> And this Spirit helpeth our Infirmities in Prayer: If theſe things be in the Papiſts Bible, I hope they are not therefore Popery. I ſuppoſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts alſo own our God, our Saviour and our Creed.</p>
               <p>3. The help in Prayer which we expect from the Spirit, is. 1. To illuminate us to know what we need and ſhould deſire and ask. 2. To kindle in us holy deſires ſincere and ſervent, of what we ſhould ask.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97268:18"/>
3. To give us a true belief of and truſt in the Love of God, the enterceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt and the promiſes of the Goſpel, that we may pray in hope. 4. To give us thankful hearts for what we do receive, and fit with joy to praiſe the giver. 5. To ſtir up all theſe diſpoſitions to particular acts in the due ſeaſon: And to ſave us from the contrary. 6. And we believe that a mind ſo illuminated, and affections ſo ſanctified and kindled, have a great advantage above others <hi>coeteris paribus</hi> to expreſs themſelves in words: For. 1. A man that <hi>knoweth</hi> what to ſay can ſpeak it when the ignorant cannot? Doth not a ſtock of knowledge enable you to Preach without book? 2. Such a Soul will ſet it ſelf diligently to think what and how to ſpeak in ſo great a buſineſs, when the careleſs mind it not. 3. Love and delight are very ſpeedy Learners. 4. Fervent deſire ſets all the powers of the Soul awork, and is full and forward to expreſs it ſelf. Hunger can teach men eaſily to beg: Poor men ſpeak intreaties; Anger, Joy, every paſſion maketh and powreth out words, where there is prerequiſite ability.</p>
               <p>4. We believe that he who by natural defectiveneſs or difuſe cannot find words fitly to utter his own mind, may have the help of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in uttering ſuch words as he readeth or learneth of others; and (eſpecially in the caſe of <hi>Pſalms</hi> which are not of ſudden invention) if for Concord the Churches agree to uſe the ſame meet words, Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may actuate their deſires therein.</p>
               <p>5. We hold that this Holy Spirit, is as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh, Chriſts Vicar, Agent or Advocate, by preventing, operateing, Cooperating grace, thus to illuminate, Sanctifie and actuate believers, in all holy works, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in prayer. And I could heartily wiſh that you would not be againſt ſo much, as <hi>Spiritual Preaching, Spiritual Writing</hi> and <hi>diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>living,</hi> and not ſay that the Jeſuits brought them in.</p>
               <p>6. I believe that we are Baptized into the name of the Holy Ghoſt as well as of the Father and the Son, believing that he is thus Chriſts Agent for all this work upon our Souls, and covenanting to obey him.</p>
               <p>7. I believe that ſins againſt the Holy Ghoſt, eſpecially deriding or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching his great works, miraculous or Sanctifing, have a dangerous malignity.</p>
               <p>8. I ſuppoſe that in all this, the faculties of mans own Soul are the natural recipients of the Spirits influx, and agent of the act which both cauſes effect: And that its as vain a queſtion, whether it be by the <hi>Spirit or by natural faculties</hi> that we pray aright, as whether it be God as <hi>fons na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi> or mans natural powers which cauſe our natural acts? Or whether the Act of ſeeing be from the ſun or the eye? As if the ſame effect
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97268:18"/>
might not, yea muſt not have a Suprior and Inferior Cauſe?</p>
               <p>9. Therefore as Gods. Spirit witneſſing with ours that we are his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo Gods Spirit helping our infirmities in Prayer, ſuſpendeth not the exerciſe of our Spirits, or maketh our reaſon and conſideration need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but actuateth them in their duty. Learning and ſtudying how to pray, is conſiſtent with the Spirits help in Prayer.</p>
               <p>10 I never talkt of it with any Nonconformiſts who denyed that an hypocrite may without any <hi>ſpecial</hi> help of the Spirit, ſpeak all the ſame words in prayer without either book or form, wich another may ſpeak: The help of knowledge, hearing, uſe and paſſion may help him to words: Therefore they never take a man to be proved godly or ſinceer, by his bare words: but by the <hi>grace</hi> of Prayer, which is <hi>holy deſire &amp;c.</hi> and not by the ſpeaking, gift, or habit.</p>
               <p>11. But we think that it was not the Jeſuits that firſt ſaid, <hi>out of the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh;</hi> and though the tongue may lie, it is made to expreſs the mind, and we muſt judge of other mens minds by their words, till ſomwhat elſe diſprove them. And its natural for the Heart to lead the Tongue. And men are more affected by words which come from affection than by thoſe that do not: and Reading words written by another when we ſpeak to God, is not ſo natural a ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>deſire</hi> or other affection, as ſpeaking them from the preſent dictate of the heart; For any Child that can read may do the one, and it is not the uſual ſignification of ſeriouſneſs in other actions. A beggar that ſhould only read his begging leſſon, or a Child or Servant that ſhould only read ſome words to his Father or Maſter, would be thought leſs ſenſible of his wants.</p>
               <p>12. Miniſters ſhould be men better aquainted than the people, how to <hi>ſpeak to God and man:</hi> It is their office; and therefore it belongeth to them to chooſe the words which are fitteſt: and to ſet up a Miniſtry that can do neither, is to befriend the Prince of darkneſs againſt the Kingdom of Light, and to be a deadly enemy to the Church and Souls. And to ſet up a miniſtry that <hi>need not do it,</hi> but may <hi>chooſe,</hi> or is not obliged to it, is the way to ſet up a miniſtry that <hi>cannot</hi> do it. Let the Miniſters be bound to no more than to <hi>Read,</hi> and a few years will transform them to ſuch as <hi>can</hi> do no more than read. <hi>Moſcovy</hi> proveth that, and too many other Countries.</p>
               <p>13. If it be praying freely from preſent knowledge and deſire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a book or ſet form which you call <hi>Spiritual prayer,</hi> either you are for the uſe of it in the Pulpit or not. If you are, did the Jeſuits teach it you? or will you go on to follow them? If not, what a divided party
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97268:19"/>
are the Conformiſts, while ſo many uſe it and pray ſpiritually? And what a Caſe is the Church of <hi>England</hi> in, that hath ſtill ſo many Miniſters that pray as the Jeſuits Diſciples? Or why do you ſo reproach your Church and Miniſtry?</p>
               <p>14. Do you think that there is more force in the name of a Jeſuit to diſgrace <hi>Spiritual prayer,</hi> or in the name of <hi>Spiritual prayer</hi> to honour the Jeſuits? And do you not ſeem to prevaricate and highly honour the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, on pretence of diſhonoring <hi>Spiritual prayer?</hi> If you had ſaid that the Jeſuits firſt brought in <hi>Spiritual preaching,</hi> and <hi>diſcourſe</hi> and <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al living,</hi> would it not have more <hi>honoured them,</hi> than <hi>diſhonoured Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality?</hi> Will freedom from <hi>Spiritual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>prayer</hi> honour your Church? as <hi>Seneca</hi> thought <hi>Cato</hi>'s name would do more to honour Drunkenneſs, than Drunkenneſs could do to diſhonour <hi>Cato?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am not ſuch an Antipapiſt, as to fall out with Father Son or Holy-Ghoſt, becauſe the Jeſuits own them. You do but help to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm my charity, who have long thought that among the Papiſts, there are many perſons truly godly, though their education, converſe, and proud, tyrannical wordly Clergy, have ſadly vitiated them.</p>
               <p>15. All prayers written or unwritten are made by ſome body. Thoſe that the Biſhops write down for us in the Liturgy, and for our Faſts, were made by their invention: Either they had the help of the Spirit in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them or not: If yea, then why is it not as Jeſuitical to <hi>write</hi> a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual prayer, as to ſpeak one? If not, excuſe them that ſay Gods Spirit made not your Liturgy, nor are they Spiritual prayers.</p>
               <p>16. And were it not too like high and dangerous <hi>Pride,</hi> if ſuch a one as Biſhop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Morley,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Gunning,</hi> in a Convocation, or before every publick Faſt, ſhould be appointed to write the words of Prayer, and ſhould in effect ſay to all the moſt Learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in <hi>England</hi> [<hi>The Spirit cauſed us to write theſe prayers,</hi> and <hi>our meaſure is ſo ſure and great, that none of you may preſume to queſtion it, nor to think that you can pray Spiritually in any words of your own, but only in ours, at leaſt in the Aſſemby. The Spirit will help you if you ſay our words, but not your own.</hi> It now cometh into my mind what may be ſome of the meaning of Biſhop <hi>Gunning</hi>'s Chaplain, Doctor <hi>Saywell,</hi> in his laſt Book, that <hi>none hath power to ordain Biſhops, but they that have power to give the Holy Ghoſt for the work of their Office.</hi> It may be it is, The Holy Ghoſt to write Doctrine Sermons and Prayers for all their Clergy to uſe. But do you not ſay alſo to the Presbyters <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> If they have him, why cannot they ſpeak their own hearts in other words than yours? Is Spiritual prayer appropriated to your Liturgy, words or forms, any more
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97268:19"/>
than at the Council at <hi>Trent</hi> he was to the Popes inſtructions.</p>
               <p>17. We all confeſs, that as all the actions of imperfect men, have their imperfections, ſo have all our prayers, and theſe are eaſily aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated: Sudden free prayer, and book prayer, have both their conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies and inconveniencies: The queſtion is which <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> hath the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and whether forbidding either be not worſt of all: I have named the conveniencies and inconveniencies of each in my Chriſtian Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
               <p>18. Experience telleth the world, that the daily ſaying over only the ſame words, and that read out of a paper impoſed by others, by one that no further ſheweth any ſenſe of what he doth, is not ſo apt as more free and well varied words in ſeaſon, to keep people from ſleepy ſenſeleſs prophanation, and praying as the Papiſts do with their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Roſaries, and Beads: And the variety of Subjects preached on, and variety of occaſions, and all accidents require ſome diverſification of words and methods.</p>
               <p>19. It is a work of reverence to ſpeak to the King; yet as it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to write a Petition to him, ſo to ſpeak to him without Book. Judges have ſerious work to do, for eſtate and life, and yet they are truſted to ſpeak without preſcribed words; and ſo are Advocates, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, Ambaſſadors, Phyſicians, Philoſophers, and all men in their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, except Miniſters and Chriſtians, as ſuch.</p>
               <p>20. We know not why men may not be intruſted to ſpeak to God in the name of imperfect man without impoſed books and words, as well as to ſpeak to man from the moſt perfect God and in his name; in preaching. Mans actions will be like man. Nothing that is not divine and ſpiritual ſhould be ſpoken as from God and in his name. And as after our fruſtrated Treaty for Concord 1661. one of them (nameleſs) wrote a Book againſt free praying without an impoſed form in the Pulpit, and yet they never durſt forbid it to this day; ſo <hi>I</hi> know who ſhewed his deſire of a new Book of Homilies (of his own making its like) to have been impoſed inſtead of preaching, and of the old ones, on thoſe that had not ſpecial licenſe to preach. But intereſt ruleth the world: They durſt not ſo far diſgrace their Clergy, as to make them meer Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor loſe the advantage of talking out of the Pulpit for their Cauſe, where none muſt contradict them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> hath ask'd you already; whether our <hi>Spiritual Prayer,</hi> as you call it, or your Liturgy (and Biſhop <hi>Couſins,</hi> and Dr <hi>Taylors</hi> Prayer-books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) be liker to the Popiſh Maſs book, and many other Offices and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions? Indeed Mr. <hi>Auſtins</hi> hath ſo much gravity, as excepting his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97268:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it may compare with many of yours.</p>
               <p>And for that ſort of ſpiritual Devotion, in which they flie too high, I have found more of it in the Friers, Franciſcans, Benedictines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch as <hi>Barbanſon, Benedictus de Benedictis, &amp;c.</hi> than in the Jeſuits: And the Oratoriana, <hi>Phil. Nerius Baronius,</hi> and the reſt; and of their ſober or Religious men, as <hi>Sales,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ti, &amp;c.</hi> and of old. <hi>John Gerſon, Kempis,</hi> &amp;c. have more of ſpirituality than the Jeſuits. But enough of this.</p>
               <p>§ 6. As to the reſt of his Prefatory diſcourſe of the Advantages of Popery. 1. We doubt not but the Papiſts play their game among all Parties, as far as they are able, and put on divers ſorts of Vizors. But doth he (that is a Hiſtorian) not know, that all over the world their cheif deſign is upon the Rulers and Leaders, and they Cry, <hi>Fight neither againſt great or ſmall,</hi> but to win one Court Card ſignifieth more than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others?</p>
               <p>2. Doth he think the Papiſts take the Conformiſts or the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts to be nearer to them and leſs againſt them?</p>
               <p>3. Did the Papiſts think Biſhop <hi>Lauds</hi> reconciling deſign deſcribed by Doctor <hi>Heylin,</hi> (entertained by <hi>Sancta Clara, Leander,</hi> &amp;c.) or the Parliaments fears of his introducing Popery in thoſe times, to be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them?</p>
               <p>4. Are they liker to help in Popery, that are ſo apt to be over-averſe to any thing that favours of it, in Doctrine, Diſcipline, and Worſhip, and account the Pope Antichriſt? Or they that hold as followeth. 1. (As <hi>Grotius</hi>) That <hi>a Papiſt is but one that flatters the Popes, as if all were juſt that they ſay</hi> and do (and ſo there are few Papiſts I hope in the World.) 2. <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is ſound in Faith.</hi> 3. And ſo <hi>are all the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, even</hi> Trent. 4. That <hi>Rome is the Miſtreſs of all Churches;</hi> or as Biſhop <hi>Bromhal,</hi> that for Concord we muſt all <hi>obey the Pope, as Patriarch of the Weſt, and</hi> Principium Unitatis Catholicae, <hi>ruling according to the old Canons,</hi> (a Foreign Juriſdiction) and all thoſe paſs for <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> that refuſe it (of which more after.) 5. That the validity of our Miniſtry muſt be proved by the derivation of it from the uninterrupted ſucceſſion of the Roman Ordainers and Church. 6. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by that ſucceſſion is a true, though faulty Church of Chriſt, but ſo are none of the Reformed Churches which have not Biſhops, or have them not by ſuch uninterrupted ſucceſſion. 7. That the only way of the <hi>Concord of Churches and all Chriſtians is</hi> (ſaith Biſhop <hi>Gunning</hi>) <hi>to obey the governing part of the Church Univerſal, which</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Collegium Paſtorum, <hi>all the Biſhops of the univerſal Church,</hi> in one <hi>Regent Colledge, governing all the Chriſtian World per literas formatas.</hi> 8. That its ſafer and better for the Proteſtants in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97268:20"/>
                  <hi>France</hi> to be of the <hi>French</hi> Church of Papiſts than to continue without Biſhops as they are. 9. That we ſhould come as near the Papiſts as the Greek Church doth, or as both Greek and Latin did at the rupture of the two Churches, or as in <hi>Greg.</hi> 1ſt. daies ſay others, or as in <hi>Char. Mag.</hi> daies, ſay others; receiving ſay ſome the firſt ſix General Councils, ſay others the firſt 8. 10. That we muſt amend the Oath of Supremacy for the Papiſts, as <hi>Thorndick</hi> ſaith, and ſo many Doctrines as he intimateth. 11. That its deſireable that the Papiſts had continued in our Churches as in the begining of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> And if they come (as Church Papiſts do) ſhould be received in our Communion. 12. That if the Pope have not (as ſome hold) a right of ſuch Primacy as belongs to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſour, at leaſt, His Primacy is a very prudent humane conſtitution. 1. That there may be a Common Father to care for all the Church. 2. And one to be a Head of Unity and order. 3. And one to call General Councils. 4. And one to rule between when there are no ſuch Councils (which are rare). 5. And one to give power to Patriarcks and Arch-Biſhops who elſe will have none over them to authorize, or Govern them. 6. And one to decide controverſies, when Countries, Churches and Arch-Biſhops diſagree. 7. And one to ſend out Preachers among Heathens, Infidels and Hereticks, all over the world. 8. And one boldly to reprove, admoniſh and, if need be, excommunicate Kings, which their own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects dare not do.</p>
               <p>I do not mean that all theſe things or any of them are the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or held by all or moſt that conforme. But if ſome of it have been publiſhed by the Chief Prelates, and ſome by their chief defenders, and ſome in conference with us by Clergy men, I only ask whether all this pleaſe not and advantage not the Papiſts, more than Nonconformiſts any way do? And whether Arch-Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> and his Succeſſor Arch-Biſhop <hi>Bromhal,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Downam</hi> and his Succeſſour Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> differed not as much as you and I do? And whether the multitude of Pariſh Prieſt that were Papiſts in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies, and Biſhop <hi>Godfrey Goodman</hi> a Papiſts Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> with all the reſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Prin, Ruſhworth, Burnet,</hi> &amp;c. tell us not that the Papiſts had a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful game to play among the Biſhops and Clergy of the Church?</p>
               <p>§ 7. As to his note out of Mr. <hi>Jo. Humpheries</hi> book, diſclaiming Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to Papiſts, its known Mr. <hi>Humphery</hi> is a man of latitude and univerſal Charity, and tyeth himſelf to no party or any mens opinions: He openly profeſſeth his hope of the Salvation of many Heathens, and I ſo little fear the noiſe of the cenſorious, that even now while the Plot doth render them moſt odious, I freely ſay. 1. That I would have Papiſts uſed like men, and

no worſe than our own defence requireth: 2, That I would have no man pat to death for being a Prieſt: 3. That I would have no writ <hi>de excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municato capiendo,</hi> or any Law compel them to our Communion and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. For I would not give it them (if I knew them) if they came.</p>
               <p>§ 8. As to his Accuſation of my firſt <hi>Plea for Peace,</hi> he hath it after, and it is after anſwered. And as to his Accuſation of my book for <hi>Concord,</hi> I anſwer. 1. Is it no Miniſters work, in a contending world, to tell and prove what are Chriſts ordained termes of Chriſtian Concord, but his that is [<hi>Chriſts plenipotentiary on Earth, and were to ſet the termes of Peace and War</hi>] Is this ſpoken like a peace maker and a Divine? Doth not he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend alſo in his way to declare the terms of Concord?</p>
               <p>2. But no man more heartily agreeth with him in lamenting the ſtate of the Church on earth, that when ſuch men as Biſhop <hi>Gunning,</hi> Dean <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Dr. <hi>Saywel,</hi> &amp;c. on one ſide, and ſuch as I and many better men on the other ſide, have ſo many years ſtudied hard to know Gods will, I am certain for my ſelf, and I hope it of them, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigned deſire to find out the truth what ever it coſt, (and I profeſs as going to God, that would he but make me know that Popery, ſilencing Prelacy, impriſoning, Baniſhing, or ruining all Nonconformiſts, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, Antinomians, Quakers, or any that ever I wrote againſt, are in the right, I would with greater joy and thankfulneſs recant and turne to them, than I would receive the greateſt preferment in the land) I ſay, that yet after all this we ſhould ſo far differ, as for one ſide to be confident that the others way of Concord is the ready way to ruin, wickedneſs and confuſion, and to come to that boldneſs to proclaim this to the world, alas how doleful a caſe is this?</p>
               <p>What hope of Chriſtian peace and concord when ſuch excellent ſober well ſtudyed men as they, quite above the common ſort, not byaſſed by honour, or preferments or power, by Biſhopricks, Deaneries, Maſterſhips, plurality, or love of any worldly wealth, and ſuch as we that ſtudy and pray as hard as they to know the truth, are yet confident to the height that each others termes of Love and peace, are but Sathans way to to deſtroy them both, and introduce (as Dr. <hi>Saywel</hi> ſaith Conventicles do) Hereſie, Popery, Ignorance, Prophaneneſs and Confuſion: And what we are paſt doubt that their way will do, experience ſaith more than we may do.</p>
               <p>Oh what ſhall the poor people do in ſo great a temptation!</p>
               <p>§ 9. But I muſt paſs from his Preface, where I have noted. 1. That he is yet ſo peaceable as to propoſe ſome ſort of abatements for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97268:21"/>
that the benifit may be <hi>ſibi &amp; ſuis,</hi> not reaching our neceſſeries, but much better than nothing.</p>
               <p>2. That they are ſo ill agreed, that Biſhop <hi>Gunnings</hi> Chaplain writeth, againſt it, making the only way of Peace to be by the ſword to force all men to full obedience to their Lordſhips in every thing injoyned, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating an Oath, a Subſcription, a Covenant, a Word, a Ceremony, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Comprehenſion or limited Toleration.</p>
               <p>3 And I could wiſh the Doctor would conſent, at leaſt that Lords and Parliament men may have the liberty themſelves of educating their own Sons, ſo it be in the Chriſtian Reformed Religion, and to chooſe their Tutors, and not confine them to Conformiſts only: The Papiſts are tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated in chooſing Tutors for their Children: The King of <hi>France</hi> hath not yet taken away this liberty from the Proteſtants: Nor the Turks from the Greeks: And muſt you needs take it away from all the Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, Citizens, and Free-holders of <hi>England.</hi> Perhaps Beggars will conſent, if you will keep their Children, or do what the Godfathers vow. Moſt Gentlemen, that keep Chaplains, expect that they teach their Sons at home, ſometime at leaſt; what if a Lord or Knight have ſuch a Chaplain as <hi>Hugh Broughton,</hi> or <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> or as <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Blondel, Salmatius,</hi> as <hi>Gataker, Vines, Burges,</hi> &amp;c. muſt the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them to read Hebrew, Philoſophy, or Divinity to their Sons? I doubt you will ſcarce get the Parliament hereafter to make ſuch a Law to fetter themſelves, leſt next you would extend your dominion alſo to their Wives as well as Sons, and forbid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them marrying any but Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.</p>
               <p>Is it not enough to turn us all out of the publick Miniſtry? Methinks you might allow ſome the Office of a School-maſter, or Houſhold Tutor, or Chaplain under the Laws of Peace; unleſs the Sword be all that you truſt too: If it be, it is an uncertain thing: The minds of Princes are changable, and all things in this World are on the Wheel: when <hi>Peter</hi> flieth to the Sword, Chriſt bids him put it up, for they that ſo uſe it periſh by it: Hurting many, forceth many to hurt you, or to deſire their own deliverance, though by your hurt.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The beginning of the Doctors unreaſonable Accuſations examined: His ſtating of the Caſe of Separation.</head>
               <p>§ 1. THis much inſtead of an intelligible ſtating of our Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie he giveth us, <hi>Page</hi> 2. [<hi>By ſeparation we mean nothing elſe, but withdrawing from the conſtant Communion of our Church, and joyning with Separate Congregations, for greater purity of worſhip, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter means of Edification.</hi>] And may we be ſene by this, that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the difference.</p>
               <p>1. Whether by [<hi>Our Church</hi>] he meant the Parochial Church, (and if ſo, whether ſome or all) or the Dioceſan Church; or the Provincial, or the National, or all I know not. But I know well, that ſome withdraw from ſome Pariſh Churches which joyn with others. And ſome think they withdraw not from the Dioceſan or Provincial, if they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with any one Pariſh Church in the Dioceſs: And ſome renounce the Dioceſan Church, which conſtantly joyn with the Parochial: And for the National Church, who can tell whether we have Communion with it, till we know what they mean by it? Indeed in the latter part, (after the long diſpute) he condeſcendeth beyond expectation to explain that term; But its ſo as plainly to deny that there is any ſuch thing as a Church of <hi>England</hi> in a Political ſenſe, that hath any conſtitutive Regent part: But even there ſo late he maketh it not poſſible to us to know, whether we be members of the Church or not: For he maketh it to be but all the Chriſtians and Churches in the Kingdom joyned by conſent expreſt by their Repreſentatives in Parliament, under the ſame civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Rules of Religion (Doctrine, and Worſhip, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) 1. As it is a <hi>Chriſtian Kingdom,</hi> we are ſure, that we are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it. 2. As it is all the Churches of the Kingdom conſenting to the Scriptures, yea, and to Articles of Doctrine, and all that Chriſt or his Apoſtles taught, we are ſure that we withdraw not from it: 3. But if every Chancellor, Dean, Commiſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Surrogate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or every forme or word or Ceremonie be eſſential to their Church, we cannot tell who is of it and who not? Or really whether any reject not ſome one forme, word or office? If every ſuch thing be not eſſential, he never in all the book tels us what is, or how to know it, or who is of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:97268:22"/>§ 2. And the word [<hi>withdrawing</hi>] ſeemeth to imply former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: And if ſo, he maketh all the Anabaptiſts, Independants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who never were of their Church, to be none of the Separ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atiſts here meant.</p>
               <p>But if by [<hi>withdrawing</hi>] he mean [<hi>not joyning in Communion</hi>] either he meaneth in <hi>the whole Communion or but in part:</hi> If the whole, then the many thouſands that live in the Pariſhes and Communicate not in the Sacrament are no members of the Pariſh Church. And who knoweth then who are of their Church? And how few in many Pariſhes are of it, that yet paſs for Members of the Church of <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And yet I that joyn with them am none of it, in their account.</p>
               <p>And. 3. What meaneth he by [<hi>Conſtant Communion</hi>] I go to the Pariſh Church when ſickneſs hindreth not, once a day; I go to the Sacrament, and am none of their Church. Thouſands go but rarely, and thouſands ſcarce at all, at leaſt to the Sacrament, and theſe are of their Church and no ſeparatiſts.</p>
               <p>4. But perhaps the conjunction is explicative [<hi>and joyn with ſeparate Congregations for greater purity,</hi> and Edification: If ſo, then he that never joyneth with them nor any other is none of the intended ſeparatiſts. 2. Nor he that goeth to other Churches on other accounts than for <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Worſhip and Edification</hi> (As Papiſts that go as to the only true Church for the Authority).</p>
               <p>§ 3. But the utter ambiguity is in the word <hi>ſeparate;</hi> And that you may underſtand it he explaineth it by repeating it. By <hi>ſeparation</hi> he means <hi>withdrawing to ſeparate Congregations.</hi> But the doubt is, <hi>which are</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Congregations. I named many ſorts of Lawful and unlawful ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, but he will not tell us which he meaneth by any intrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y.</p>
               <p>§. 4. I would my ſelf yet that I may be underſtood, tell the reader what ſorts of ſeparation I renounce and what I own: But I have done it ſo oft and largely, that I am aſhamed to repeat it, as oft as mens confuſion calls me to it. The reader who thinks it worth his labour, may ſee it done in my firſt <hi>Plea for Peace,</hi> and in the Preface to my <hi>Cath. Theol.</hi> and ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the beginning of the third Part of my <hi>Treat.</hi> of <hi>Concord,</hi> and in <hi>Chriſt. Direct.</hi> And he calls me here afterward to the ſame</p>
               <p>Certainly it is only <hi>ſinful ſeparation</hi> that is in the queſtion; and as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there are many ſorts not ſinful. I am locally ſeparate from all Churches ſave that where I am. I morally ſeparate from the Roman Church as an unlawful Policy, and all other which are <hi>in ſpecie</hi> againſt Gods word: I ſeparate from ſome for Hereſie as being not capable matter of a Church, while they own not all the Eſſence of Chriſtianity. I ſeparate from ſome
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97268:23"/>
as Impoſing ſin, and refuſing my Communion without it. I ſeparate from ſome as having no lawful Paſtors; ſome being uncapable matter, and ſome, being uſurpers that have no true call: I ſeparate from ſome only ſo far as to prefer a better <hi>rebus ſic ſtantibus;</hi> ſometime a better as to the Doctrine, ſometime as to the Worſhip, ſometime as to the Diſcipline ſometime and moſtly as to the Paſtors worth and work; ſome go from their own Pariſh, becauſe the Miniſter is very ignorant in compariſon of another to whom they go: ſome that hear the Miniſter preach againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs and for Ceremonies, had rather hear another that calleth them to holineſs: ſome that have tollerable Preachers go to Doctor <hi>Stilling ſleet and</hi> Doctor <hi>Tillotſon</hi> as better: ſome go for neerneſs to another Church. Some go from their own Pariſh becauſe the Miniſter cuts the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer too ſhort, and Preacheth too long; ſome becauſe they would have it ſo, go to ſuch: ſome becauſe the Parſon is an Arminian; others becauſe he is contrary. Some go to the Miniſter that is ſtrict in keeping the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous from the Sacrament: ſome therefore go from him: ſome remove their Dwellings or Lodgings for theſe ends; and ſome do not: ſome go from their own Pariſh for the benefit of the Organs in another. And of old, when Nonconformiſts had Pariſh Churches and uſed ſome part of the Liturgy, many went to them from their own Pariſhes. Some of theſe are lawful, ſome are unlawful: Moſt certainly they that go from their own Pariſhes, yea, or to Nonconformiſts Aſſemblies, in <hi>London,</hi> go not all on the ſame account: Nor doth the Doctor and ſuch other ſeparate from me as I am ſaid to do from them, but otherwiſe and much more.</p>
               <p>§. 5. If he would firſt have told us what <hi>Separation is ſinful;</hi> ſecondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then have proved us guilty of it, inſtead of the confuſed talk of <hi>Separation,</hi> and a begging the queſtion by ſupoſing that to be ſinful, which he will neither diſcribe, nor prove ſuch, it had been of ſome uſefulneſs to our conviction. But I confeſs I never liked thoſe Phyſitians who give their Patients the Medicines that they are beſt ſtored with, or they can beſt ſpare, be the diſeaſe whatſoever; Nor the diſputer that poureth out what he is beſt furniſhed to ſay, how uſeleſs ſoever to the reader or to the Cauſe. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteing ſhould not be like boys playing at <hi>Duſt point,</hi> who cover their Points in a great heap of Duſt, and then throw Stones or Cudgels at it, and he that firſt uncovereth them wins them. Duſty heaps of ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words confuſedly poured out, befriend not Truth that ſhould be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, nor the reader.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Some thought it was the <hi>Place</hi> called <hi>Conventicle houſes,</hi> which made the Conformiſts call us <hi>Separatiſts;</hi> and they got oft into Pariſh Churches and Chappells. But theſe were made the worſt of ſeparatiſts,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97268:23"/>
and puniſhed the more. And doubletſs it is not meeting at any of the new Tabernacles, nor at the <hi>Spittle,</hi> nor at <hi>Sturbridge</hi> Fair, where Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath long been uſed, nor in a Priſon nor at the Gallows to Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners and People, which are faulty Separation.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Some thought that they meant that its want of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer that maketh us Separatiſts; and they have tryed and read the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer in their Aſſemblys: But theſe have been accuſed and ſuffered the more. And even Mr. <hi>Cheny</hi> was forced to fly his Country for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and Preaching in an unlicenſed meeting. And ſome reading more and ſome leſs, by this it will not be known who are the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts; The old Nonconformiſts in their Pariſh Churches read ſome more, ſome leſs, and now ſome Conformiſts vary. They ſay a Conformiſt at <hi>Greenwich</hi> keepeth up a Common-prayer Conventicle; ſome Conformiſts are accuſed for overpaſſing much: One lately ſuſpended for wearing the Surplice too ſeldom, and refuſing to pray for [<hi>our gratious Queen</hi> and James <hi>Duke of</hi> York.] How much of this goeth to make a Separatiſt?</p>
               <p>§. 8. Some thought it was want of the Magiſtrates leave that made them call us ſeparatiſts: But when the King Licenſed us, the accuſation was the ſame: yea Mr. <hi>Hinkley</hi> and many others tell you, that they took this for worſt of all.</p>
               <p>§. 9. Some ſay it is want of the Biſhops Licence: But as Mr. <hi>Tho. Gouge</hi> hath his Univerſity Licence, and I have Biſhop <hi>Sheldon</hi>'s Licence (I think not invalidate) and yet this goeth for no juſtification of us; ſo is it with others.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Some think that it is a Conventicle as deſcribed by their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non that muſt make us Separatiſts, which is of <hi>men that call themſelves</hi> of <hi>another Church.</hi> But that's not it: Mr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Poole,</hi> Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> and my ſelf, and abundance more that never gathered any Church, nor called our ſelves of any other then their own, are nevertheleſs ſeparatiſts in theſe mens account.</p>
               <p>§. 11. They that remembred what was called <hi>Separation</hi> in <hi>England</hi> of old, ſuppoſed it had theſe two degrees, which made men called Browniſts. Firſt falſly taking the Pariſh Miniſters and Churches for no true Miniſters and Churches of Chriſt, and therefore not to be Communicated with. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly or (in the lower rank) falſly taking the faults of the Pariſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Churches to be ſo great, that its a ſin to have ordinary Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them. But they that have ſtill diſclaimed both theſe are <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts ſtill</hi> in our Accuſers ſence.</p>
               <p>§. 12. Some thought that <hi>ordinary Communicating</hi> in the Pariſh Churches and pleading for it, would prove us no ſeparatiſts with them. But this
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97268:24"/>
will not ſerve as my own and many other mens Experience proveth.</p>
               <p>§. 13. I am called after to ſay more of this: The ſum of my ſeparation is this. Firſt that I take not the Pariſh Churches to be the only Churches that I muſt Communicate with, and will not confine my Communion to them alone, as if they were a ſect, or All: But will alſo have Communion with <hi>Dutch, French</hi> or Nonconformiſts.</p>
               <p>2. I take not the Order, Diſcipline and mode of worſhip in the Pariſh Churches, nor the Preaching of very many Parſons, Vicars and Curates, to be the beſt and moſt deſirable.</p>
               <p>3. I take thoſe to be no true Political Churches, which have no Paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors that have all the Qualifications, and Call, and Authority, which is Eſſential to the Office; and therefore can communicate with them, but as with a flock without a Paſtor, or an Oratory, Community or Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Company.</p>
               <p>4. I live peaceably under ſuch Biſhops as have many hundred Pariſhes, and no <hi>Epiſcopos Gregis,</hi> true Biſhops and Paſtoral Churches under them, as they think: But I own not their Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>5. I joyn with all the Churches in <hi>England</hi> as Aſſociated for mutual help and Concord in all that the Scripture preſcribeth, and in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and all that all Chriſtian Churches are agreed in, and all that is truly needful to the ends of Chriſtianity: But not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all, which their Canons, Liturgy <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conttaine: Eſpecially their <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Impoſitions,</hi> and their Preſumtious <hi>Canonical Excommunications</hi> of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters <hi>ipſo facto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. I am one of the Chriſtian Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> as under the King according to the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; and am for obeying the Laws and Rules in all things lawfully belonging to their Power to command. But not for obeying them in ſin, againſt God, nor for believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all to be Lawful becauſe they command it; nor for their taking down <hi>Family Government</hi> or <hi>ſelf Government,</hi> and diſcerning private Judgment of the ſubjects. This is my meaſure of ſeparation.</p>
               <p>§ 14. And I think in caſes that concern our own and many mens Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we ſhould have leave freely to ſpeak for our ſelves; and not be uſed as we are, that muſt neither be endured to be ſilent, or to ſpeak. Let this Dr. open our caſe to you himſelf, ſaith he [Pref. p. 36.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If I do that which you think as bad, I would gladly be told of it (though falſe accuſations I deſire not) And impenitence is too ſoon learnt without a Teacher or Academical degrees, and I had rather be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it. 2. But Reader I once more appeal to the Judgment of all reaſon and humanity as well as Chriſtianity, to decide the caſe of this Accuſation.</p>
               <p>1. We did in, 1660. and 1661. All that we were able by labour pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and yielding as far as we durſt for fear of ſin and Hell, to have been united and lived in Church Concord with the Epiſcopal party.</p>
               <p>2. When our labour and hopes were fruſtrate and two thouſand of us caſt out of the Miniſtery, and afterwards laws made againſt us as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticlers, firſt for our Fining, Impriſonment, and then Baniſhment, and after beſides Impriſonment to pay twenty pound the firſt Sermon, and forty pound the next and ſo on; when after this the Law that baniſhed us from all Cities, Corporations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and places where we lately Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did moſt deeply accuſe us as the cauſe; I never wrote ſo much as the reaſons of our diſſent: When by the execution of theſe Laws we were by Informers and others uſed, as is well known, I was ſtill ſilent. My not conforming ſhewed my diſſent, but I durſt not ſo much as once tell them why, leſt it ſhould more exaſperate them.</p>
               <p>3. At laſt I was often told that the Biſhop that firſt forbad my Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and many others after him, oft ſaid to Great men, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> keeps up a Schiſm, and yet holds all our conformity lawful, ſave <hi>renouncing a rebellious Covenant.</hi> And I yet continued ſilent.</p>
               <p>4. At laſt they wrote againſt us, that we <hi>durſt not ſay that any part of Conformity was ſin, but only inconvenient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Then many pulpits and books proclaim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>that we againſt our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences kept up a Schiſm, for a baffled cauſe which we had nothing to ſay for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. All this while Lords and Commons uſed to ask us, <hi>what is it that you would have, and what keepeth you from Conformity.</hi> [In private talk, but would never allow us to ſpeak for our ſelves and give the world or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament our reaſons].</p>
               <p>7. Many years together Pulpits and Printed Books of the Clergy, cryed out to the Magiſtrates to execute the Laws againſt us, (and as one ſaid <hi>ſet fire to the Fagot</hi>)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and blamed them for not doing it.</p>
               <p>8. When the King gave us his Licence, they were greatly offended, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>9. At laſt one great Biſhop told me that he <hi>would deſire the King</hi> to

conſtraine us to give our reaſons, and not keep up a Schiſm, and not tell for what. And another greater told me, that the <hi>King took us to be not ſincere, that would not give our reaſons.</hi> And all this while I durſt not give them, as knowing how they would be received.</p>
               <p>10. When the Biſhops kept me from Preaching and gave me leiſure, I wrote. 1. An Apology for our Preaching, 2 A Treatiſe of Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and divers other ſuch, and yet durſt not Print them (nor indeed could do it.)</p>
               <p>11. At laſt after about ſeventeen or eighteen years ſilence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by ſuch importunity (and the Preſs being more open) I ventured firſt but to write my firſt Plea for Peace, which only nameth matter of Fact, and our bare Judgment, enumerating the things which we think ſin, without our Arguments, leſt it ſhould provoke them more. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in profeſſed that (knowing mens different Educations, ſtudies, intereſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) I did not by this accuſe the Conformiſts, nor the Law makers, but only tell. 1.

               <p>Reader, ſhould I have ſtayed longer (the ſmal Tract of Sacrilegious deſertion of the Miniſtry, came out when we were licenſed, but ventured not to name the matters of our Nonconformity) what could we do leſs? I ſtaid till I think half the ſilenced Miniſters were dead. Is the call of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, the Intereſt of our Miniſtry, and Conſciences of ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard as that I muſt not tell men that ſo loud and long had asked, <hi>whats the matter?</hi> Muſt we neither be ſilent nor ſpeak?</p>
               <p>And now ſee here. 1. If Dean <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> be a man to be believed in ſuch accuſations, [<hi>All this was done by me, without the leaſt provocation on their ſide</hi>] wonderful difference! Is my naming what I think God forbids me, ſo great a provocation to them, and is all this for ſeventeen years before named [<hi>not the leaſt provocation</hi> to us <hi>on their part?</hi> What ſhall one think could bring ſuch a man to ſuch a word?</p>
               <p>2.

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of his Hiſtory of the caſe of the old Nonconformiſts.</head>
               <p>§ 1. AS to what he ſaith of the ſameneſs of the former Caſe and ours, I ſhall tell him the difference after, where he more calls me to it; And ſhall ſhew him ſo much difference, as will diſcredit this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>§ 2. As to the caſe of the old Nonconformiſts. 1. It muſt be premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we take them not for any of our rule, but cleave to <hi>Gods word</hi> and the <hi>example of the</hi> Primitive Church, looking ſtill at the great ends of order and Government.</p>
               <p>2. We maintain as well as he that the Chief Nonconformiſts were againſt that called <hi>Browniſm</hi> or Separation, and wrote more againſt it than the Conformiſts did.</p>
               <p>3. I ſtill profeſs my ſelf to be of their Judgment in this, and have practiſed accordingly.</p>
               <p>4. But they were not againſt ſuch Preaching, or any ſuch ſort of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration as I have either practiſed or defended.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Here therefore it muſt be known what the Controverſie between them and the ſeparatiſts was. 1. The higher ſort of ſeparatiſts ſaid, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was no true Church. The Nonconformiſts, ſaid it was a true National Church both as a Chriſtian Kingdom, and as an Aſſociation of Churches, (and as repreſented in National Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods were they made one.)</p>
               <p>2. The ſaid Browniſts ſaid that the Pariſh Churches were no true Churches, nor to be owned as ſuch, nor joyned with. The Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts held that they are true Churches, (that have capable Miniſters) though faulty.</p>
               <p>3. The ſeparatiſts ſaid that the Pariſh Miniſters were no true Miniſters, becauſe ordained by Dioceſans and not choſen by the people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Nonconformiſts ſaid, that the capable were true though faulty Miniſters,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97268:26"/>
owned by the peoples conſenting communion, and the ordination va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid though culpable.</p>
               <p>4. The ſeparatiſts ſaid that Miniſters and people muſt gather Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that are purer, and ſet up better diſcipline in them, whatever Rulers ſay or do againſt it, or whatever they ſuffer, as far as they are able. The Nonconformiſts ſaid, this is to be done where it may be done without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more hurt than good, but elſe it is no duty but a ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> To do it Tumultuouſly, Seditiouſly, or ſo as by running on the Magiſtrates ſword, by improbable attempts to loſe their own advantages for doing and getting good, and hinder the common pariſh reformation.</p>
               <p>5. The Separatiſts ſaid that no prohibition of the Magiſtrate will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a Miniſter to forbear the publick work of his office. The Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts held that it belongeth to the Magiſtrate to reſtrain deceivers and all falſe Teachers who do more hurt than good; and ſuch ſhould obey when they are forbidden to Preach and Adminiſter Sacraments: Yea if the Magiſtrate wrongfully forbid a worthy Miniſter to Preach, for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he is bound to obey, unleſs the need of the Church and Souls, and the probable benefit plainly weigh down that matter of order, and make the Magiſtrates prohibition invalid, as being againſt the common good, and the ends of the Miniſtry, and ſo againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p>6. The ſemi-ſeparatiſts (<hi>Robinſons</hi> party) after held that though the Pariſh Churches may be called true Churches, as a Leper is a true man, and it may be lawful to hear a Sermon in them, yet the Common-prayer is ſo bad, and the people and Miniſters ſo bad, and diſcipline ſo caſt out, that it is unlawful to joyn with them in Common-prayer, or Sacrament, or to become ſetled members of them; but all muſt attempt, though in Forreign Countreys, that are able<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſet up purer worſhip and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. The Nonconformiſts held that thoſe that can have better with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more hurt than good, ſhould cheoſe it: But they that cannot may joyn in member-ſhip, Common-prayer and Sacrament, with ſuch Pariſh Churches as will admit them without their own actual ſin, and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their faults.</p>
               <p>§. 4. I ſhall now give you ſo full proof that the Nonconformiſts were for more, which the Doctor calleth <hi>Separation,</hi> than my Preaching or practice ever reached to, as I ſhall tell the Reader, what credit this Doctors hiſtory deſerveth, and what inhumane uſuage the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts have from that ſort of men.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Anno</hi> 1588. A Synod at <hi>Coventry</hi> agreed againſt private Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, reading Homilies, the Croſs in Baptiſm, and that the faithful ought not to communicate with unlearned (they mean uncapable) Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; <hi>though</hi> they may be preſent at their Service, if they come of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to hear a Sermon. For Laymen may read publick Service. That the calling of Biſhops <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is unlawful. That it is not lawful to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by them, or denounce their Suſpentions or Excommunications. That its not lawful to reſt in the Biſhops deprivation of any from the Miniſtry, except on conſultation with neighbour Miniſters and their flock, it ſeems ſo good to them; but that he continue in the ſame till he be compelled to the contrary by Civil force. &amp;<hi>c.</hi> And the Diſcipline ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Cartwright, Fen, Wright, Oxenbridge, Gellybrand, Clevely, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Fetherſtone, Holm, Lord &amp;c.</hi> To repeat all is too tedious.</p>
               <p>But its worth the noteing that whereas the Prelatiſts uſually ſay, that <hi>when they were put to draw up a Liturgy themſelves, they could not agree of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> ſaith <hi>Page</hi> 96. <hi>They offered the Parliament a book of their own, containing the form</hi> of <hi>Common prayers</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and hoped to have</hi> had it eſtabliſhed.</p>

He tells you of their order for <hi>Parents to offer their own</hi> Children to Baptiſm, and be Godfathers <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He proceedeth to ſhew that they reſolved to practice their Diſcipline againſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates will, and did accordingly. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>p.</hi> 120. That they joyned themſelves into an Aſſociation or brother-hood, and appropriated to their meetings the name of the Church, thereby ſhewing themſelves to be moſt notorious Schiſmaticks, citeing their words (our Churches) And <hi>p.</hi> 121. That the Pariſh where they preach aſſembled, is not the Church properly in their ſence, but as many thereof only as are joyned to them with that inviolable bond, <hi>viz.</hi> The deſire of the godly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and thoſe furthermore who leaving their own Pariſh Churches come to them. e. g. <hi>The Church</hi> of God, forſooth in <hi>Black fryars</hi> conſiſts beſides that Pariſh of a number of men and Merchants wives diſperſed here and there throughout the whole City. Mr. <hi>Snape</hi>'s teſtimony is cited.</p>
               <p>§ 6. By theſe words of <hi>Bancroft</hi> and the caſe compared, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that on theſe ſuppoſitions many of the Canons were made againſt them; as againſt Conventicles and calling themſelves another Church, and a brother-hood, and about God fathers and many more, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to be of this mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:97268:27"/>§ 7. On ſuppoſition that theſe things were true, the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts have to this day been accuſed by thoſe that write againſt them, and the teſtimony of this book alledged as proof. And Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> hath in <hi>folio</hi> accordingly deſcribed them in his Hiſtory of Presbytery, as many others have done.</p>
               <p>§ 8. And now cometh Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and tells you, that [<hi>he is certain that all the old Nonconformiſts</hi>] were quite of another mind, and other men, and to prove it citeth four or five mens words againſt Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts; When yet he citeth more of my own againſt Separation: and if my words prove me not to be againſt it, how will theirs prove them to be againſt it?</p>
               <p>§ 9. Either <hi>Bancrofts, Heylins</hi> and ſuch others words of them are true or falſe. If <hi>true,</hi> how untrue are Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s? If falſe, O what a ſort of men were theſe Prelates that ſo ſtigmatized and accuſed and ſo uſed ſo many hundred ſuch men, on ſo falſe a charge? And what a Church was it that made the Canons againſt them on that ſuppoſition? And how ſhall we know which of them to believe? Doth not Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> heavily reproach his own Church for ſuch uſuage of them?</p>
               <p>§ 10. The caſe is commonly known, Firſt that a long time they had almoſt all of them Pariſh Churches as other men had: and they ſought to ſet up Diſcipline in thoſe Churches. And it had been folly then to gather others in other places.</p>
               <p>2. When <hi>Bancroft</hi> and others had got many caſt out and ſilenced, a great part of them kept in by connivence of ſome peaceable Biſhops, and by the mediation of ſome Lords and Gentlemen, ſuch as the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter, Bedford, Warwicke,</hi> the Lord <hi>Burghley,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis, Walſingham,</hi> Sir <hi>Amias Pawlet,</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Beal,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Knowles</hi> had been to them before: Yea the greater part of them by ſuch favour got into priviledged peculiar places, or little Chapells at leaſt; Few Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had not ſome Gentlemen that ſheltred them. The Earl of <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> kept in Mr. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> at <hi>Aſhby,</hi> Mr. <hi>Slater</hi> and Mr. <hi>Aſh,</hi> even in the big Town of <hi>Bremicham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mainwaring</hi> kept in Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> at <hi>Whitmore;</hi> Mr. <hi>Knightley</hi> kept in Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> Judge <hi>Bromley</hi> (and his humble holy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) kept Mr. <hi>Brumskill</hi> at Sheriff <hi>Hales,</hi> and entertained many more (Mr. <hi>Nicols &amp;c.</hi>) Sir <hi>Richard Graves</hi> at <hi>Moſeley</hi> had Mr. <hi>Pateman</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſeldom without a Nonconformiſt: One would think Doctor <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> ſhould know that his own Patron, under whoſe wing he lived, Sir <hi>Roger Burgonie</hi> was ſeldom without a Nonconformiſt at <hi>Roxhall</hi> in <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire:</hi> Mr. <hi>Hering</hi> had long liberty at <hi>St. Maries</hi> in <hi>Shrewsbery,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ford</hi>

And when one Biſhop ſilenced them, the next oft gave them liberty (as Biſhop <hi>Bridgman</hi> did after Biſhop <hi>Mortons</hi> ſilencing ſome) and when they were ſilenced, they went oft into another Dioceſe, where they rubd out a year or more, and then to another; And ſo were ſtill in ſome hope of publick liberty.</p>
               <p>And when ſilenced they uſed to keepe private faſts; And where they lodged to preach on pretenſe of expounding to as many as they could.</p>
               <p>They obeyed the Biſhops as Magiſtrates, but not as Paſtors.</p>
               <p>They knowingly broke the Law in their private and publick Miniſtry: They obeyed not the Canons; uſed not much of the Liturgy; And many of them did as ſome do now, get into publick Pulpits for a day and away, where they were not known.</p>
               <p>§. 12. But yet there are more undeniable evidences of the falſeneſs of what, he ſaith, he is certain of, as the judgment of <hi>All the Old Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.</hi> One is the known judgement of the Scotch Reformers, and the common accuſation of the Engliſh, as being of their mind. He that will affirm that the Scotch Presbyterians thought it unlawful to preach or hold Aſſemblies, when forbidden by Magiſtrates or Prelates, will incur a very ſharp cenſure from their own Leaders, who have written ſo many Books, which charge them with the contrary, and make them Rebels and Seditious for it: Such as <hi>Bancroft, Heylin, Beziers,</hi> and multitudes both old and new; eſpecially theſe laſt twenty years.</p>
               <p>And though the Nonconformiſts in <hi>England</hi> did not juſtifie all that the Scots did (and they that took <hi>Knox, Buchanan, Melvin,</hi> and ſuch other for very pious men, yet thought ſome words and deeds too raſh, eſpecially <hi>Knox</hi>'s publick opening the Queens faults in the Pulpit, and refuſing her offer to come at any time, and tell her of them privately) yet its known, that in the Rules of Diſcipline, they were moſtly of the ſame judgment: And they often joyned in defending the ſame Cauſe.

                  <hi>Reignolds</hi> wrote a Letter againſt it to Sir <hi>Francis Knowles,</hi> printed with Sir <hi>Francis Knowles</hi> his account to the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> of his Speech in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, againſt the Biſhops keeping Courts in their own names, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Law.</p>
               <p>And in many of their writings the Engliſh own the Scotch Diſcipline and Church. And yet even theſe Scots have rejected <hi>Brown</hi> as a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, and the Engliſh Confuter of <hi>Bancrofts</hi> Sermon tells him, <hi>Pag.</hi> 43, 44. Brown <hi>a known Schiſmatick is a Fit man to be one of your Witneſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt the Elderſhip: His entertainment in</hi> Scotland <hi>was ſuch as a proud ungodly man deſerved to have: God give him and you repentance.</hi> And <hi>Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, Pagets, Bradſhaws, Brightmans, Rathbands, Balls,</hi> &amp;c. words againſt the Browniſts proved not them to be againſt their own doctrine and practice, no more than the Scots rejecting <hi>Brown</hi> proved them againſt theirs.</p>
               <p>§ 13. And another proof is the common doctrine of the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, of the difference of the Magiſtrates, and the Churches Offices. The ſaid confutation of <hi>Bancroft</hi> hath it, <hi>pag.</hi> 45 and forward, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their publick writings; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Magiſtrate only hath the power of the Sword, and of Civil Government, and to reſtrain and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Miniſters that offend by Hereſie or otherwiſe: But that as Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sacraments and the diſciplinary uſe of the Keys are proper to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, ſo the deciding of Circumſtantial controverſies about them and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the due ordering of them, doth primarily belong to Eccleſiaſtical Synods. Therefore if theſe Synods were for their Preaching, they were not for ceaſing it meerly in obedience to the Magiſtrate that ſilenced them.</p>
               <p>§ 14. And it is proved by the many Volumes which they wrote againſt the Power of our Dioceſans, that it was not any Eccleſiaſtical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of theirs (which they thought it a ſin to diſobey.)</p>
               <p>§ 15. And Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> a Nonconformiſt and many more of them, own the Doctrine of <hi>Wicliff</hi> and <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> and the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> for which the Synods of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> condemned them, who affirm that it is a heynous ſin to give over Preaching, becauſe men excommunicate us, and that ſuch are excommunicated by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§ 16. And it is not nothing that the moſt Learned Conformiſts agree with them, as I have oft cited Biſhop <hi>Bilſons</hi> words, that the Magiſtrate doth not give us our power, nor may hinder our uſe of it, but is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God to protect and encourage us, and if he forbid or hinder us, we are to go on with our work and patiently ſuffer.</p>
               <p>And even now I believe moſt of the Leading Clergy think that if a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod bid us preach and hold aſſemblies, and the King forbid it, we are
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97268:29"/>
to obey the Synod rather than the King, Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that write for the Church thought ſo. And Mr. <hi>Dodvel</hi> thinks ſo even of a particular Biſhop. The difference then is but this: One par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty giveth this power to a Synod of Biſhops (and Presbyters perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned) and the other to a Synod of Parochial Paſtors, Doctors and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. But both agreed that the Magiſtrates prohibition in that caſe is not to be obeyed. And the Conformiſts will not take it well if I ſhould ſay that the Nonconformiſt are more for obedience to Magiſtrates than they: I ſtill except the <hi>Eraſtians,</hi> and ſuch as own Dr. <hi>Stillingfleets</hi> Irenicon.</p>
               <p>§ 17. There is a moſt conſiderable book called <hi>A Petition directed to her moſt Excellent Majeſty ſhewing a meane how to compound the Civil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions in the Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> where the Author (I ſuppoſe ſome Lawyer) <hi>Pag.</hi> 23. tells us what was the difference between the Papiſts and them that deſired Reformation (Nonconformiſts) about the power of Magiſtrates. <hi>And.</hi> 1. <hi>They give the Prince Authority over all Perſons Eccleſiaſtical whatſoever; The Papiſts exempt the Clergy:</hi> 2. <hi>They hold that a Prince may depoſe a Prieſt, as</hi> Solomon <hi>did</hi> Abiather, <hi>and accordingly they obey being ſilenced: The Papiſts deny it.</hi> 3: <hi>They affirm, if the Prieſts make wicked decrees, the Prince may enforce them to better. The Papiſts deny it.</hi> 4. <hi>They ſay Princes muſt and ought to make Laws for the Church, but with the adviſe of Godly Paſtors: The Papiſts deny it.</hi> 5. <hi>They hold that if the Paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors be unlearned and ungodly, the Prince may of himſelf without their adviſe, make Orders and Laws, for Eccleſiaſtical matters: The Papiſts deny it.</hi> 6. <hi>They will ſubcribe in this point to the Articles of Religion eſtabliſhed by Law; to the Apology of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>to the writings of</hi> Jewel, Horn, Nowel, Whitaker, Bilſon, Fulk. <hi>They take the Oath of Supremacy.</hi>

And the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced that ſubmitted ſtill, went on to exerciſe their Miniſtry againſt Law in that manner as beſt conduced to its ends.</p>

                     </gap>ices,</hi> and being ſtill in hope of publick reformation, they were greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Browniſts violence, that would break thoſe hopes. 3. They held that Chriſts Law was their Rule, which commanded this Diſcipline, which no Magiſtrate could diſpenſe with. 4. But that Magiſtrates muſt be obeyed in ſuch ordering of Church matters as belong to them. But not in forbearing ſuch exerciſe of the Miniſtry as was needful to its ends, the Churches good. And as its ſaid, they practiſed accordingly.</p>
               <p>I. The Browniſts denyed the truth of the Pariſh Miniſtry and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the lawfulneſs of Communion with them. II. The Semiſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts held it lawful to hear them preach, but not to joyn in the Liturgy and Sacrament. And this is it that <hi>Phil. Nye.</hi> wrote for.</p>
               <p>III. The Presbyterians and meer Norconformiſts thought it lawful, and meet in thoſe Pariſhes which had capable Miniſters, to joyn in both Liturgy Sermons and Sacraments, where ſin was not impoſed on them. But ſo (as though forbidden) while they had publick Churches, to do their beſt to practice Chriſts Commands and Diſcipline, and where they could have none to further the ſame ends as effectually as they could, in the opportunities left them. But never took it for their duty to leave all their Miniſtry or publik preaching meerly in obediene to the laws: much leſs to the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>When all this is ſo notorious, and when I knew the minds of many aged Nonconformiſts about forty years agoe as my familiar friends, who were all of the ſame mind in this as I am, what hiſtory can I be more aſſured of, than, as I ſaid, that Firſt, They took not praying
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97268:30"/>
publickly and gathering Aſſemblies to be therefore ſinful, becauſe it was forbidden by the Law. 2. But to be a ſin againſt Prudence and the ends of their Miniſtry, when it was like to do more hurt than good, by exaſperating the Prince, and depriving themſelves and others of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantages for thoſe holy ends; 3. And that it was a duty when it was like to do more good than hurt: 4. And therefore they broke Laws where they could be endured, even in Chappells and Pariſh Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</p>
               <p>§ 5. And it is not inconſiderable that the reaſons why <hi>Calvin, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger, Zanchy, Beza,</hi> ſaid what they did for ſubmiſſive forbearing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Preaching and Church gathering, were Firſt, Becauſe as they ſaw that the Prince was reſolved not to ſuffer it, ſo Reformation was then but begun, and the Prince and Magiſtrates were the pricipal means of it, and they had great hopes that what could not be done at preſent to perfect it, might be done afterwards at a fitter time. King <hi>Edward</hi> was ſain to quiet the ſeditious Papiſts by making them beleive that Latin and Engliſh, was the great difference between the former Maſs worſhip and the Liturgy: Aftertimes had no ſuch neceſſity: and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly to diſturb the Magiſtrate in his prudent progreſs of Reforming, had been to ſerve the enemies of Reformation.</p>
               <p>But in our times, Parliaments (who the Doctor <hi>S.</hi> ſaith, are intruſted ſo Conſent for us) have theſe fifty years told the Kingdom that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was growing backwards, and the increaſe of Popery by favour and publick tolleration deſigned, and much accompliſhed; and Plots threatned the reſtoring of it: and if Parliaments deceived us, yet the chief Actors themſelves were to be believed: Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> maketh the ſyncretiſm and cloſure with them in the boſom of the now indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Church, to be Arch-Biſhop <hi>Lauds</hi> very laudable deſigns. Arch-Biſhop <hi>Brombal,</hi> ſaith <hi>Grotius,</hi> was to have held ſome place among us, as a Proteſtant, and was of the Engliſh Biſhops mind, and he himſelf doth ſay the laſt; and I have ſhewed in his own words that <hi>Grotius</hi> took <hi>Rome</hi> for the Miſtris of all Churhces, and that there was no way for the Union of Proteſtants, but to joyn in Union with <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he owned the Doctrine of the Councils even of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelf, requiring but the <hi>amending</hi> of the <hi>Clergies lives,</hi> and the caſting by the <hi>Schoolmens bold diſputes,</hi> and the reſtraint of the Popes Government to the Rule <hi>of the Canons,</hi> ſecuring the <hi>rights of Kings and Biſhops,</hi> and this he ſaith will content the peaceable: <hi>Vincentius</hi> wrote a book called <hi>Grotius Papizans; Saravius</hi> in his Epiſtle upon ſpeach with <hi>Grotius</hi> laments it as too true: His friend <hi>Dion. Petavius</hi> told Mr. <hi>Ereskin</hi> an honourable perſon atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97268:30"/>
on the King, that <hi>Grotius</hi> reſolved to have declared himſelf for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if he had returned alive from the Journy that he dyed in. See Mr. <hi>Thorndikes</hi> juſt weights, what he was for.</p>
               <p>And how far many Doctors of this Church, ſome yet living, have maintained that <hi>Grotius</hi> principles are not Popery, and conſequently what ſuch mean by Popery when they diſclaim it, I need not tell you, while ſo many of them have publiſhed it in print; And are not Mr. <hi>Thorndicks</hi> termes of Concord in Councils till the eight hundredth year much like and much more in book aforeſaid?</p>
               <p>And ſurely there is great difference between ſuch Preachings as were like to be the ruin of the begun Reformation by exaſperating a Reforming Magiſtrate, and ſuch Preaching as tendeth to ſtop the revolt of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Nation, when Parliaments and the Agents themſelves of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, proclaim the danger.</p>
               <p>Its true that there was then a greater ſcarcity of Preachers than now: And that was the Nonconformiſts argument with the Biſhops when they pleaded for publick liberty: But its as true that they had far greater hopes of that Liberty, which it had been folly to caſt away, for leſs: But it is not ſo with us; we are a greater number than they, and have new Laws to ſhut us out not only of the Churches, but of Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Biſhops that will give us no ſuch liberty.</p>
               <p>§ 6. And indeed ſo many were the unlearned Pariſh Prieſts, and ſo bad, in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies, being many of them lately ſilly Maſs Prieſts, that the ſhame of the Church and the cry of the Proteſtant peop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le forced the Biſhops to tolerate moſt of the Nonconformiſts in ſome publick Church, eſpecially thoſe that were moderate and did not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly oppoſe them.

                  </hi> there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome tell men that theſe were all Conformiſts, and of the Church; And yet I am none that am of the ſame mind. The truth is, they were for ſubmitting to kneeling at the Sacrament, Surplice and moſt of the Liturgy, rather than ceaſe Preaching: But they were againſt ſubſcription, and the Engliſh ſort of Dioceſan Biſhops and Government, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed uſe of the Croſs, as it is in Baptiſm: As Tradition tells us, and as you may partly ſee in Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> Letter to Sir <hi>Francis Knowles,</hi> in Mr. <hi>Baynes,</hi> Dioceſans Tryal, his Letters, and in <hi>Fuller</hi> and other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, And Mr. <hi>Deering,</hi> Mr. <hi>Greenham,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Fox,</hi> Mr. <hi>Marbury, Dudley, Fenner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Knewſtubs,</hi> yea I think ſix or ten to one, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured

How long Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> was kept in at the Temple, is commonly known.</p>

When for it they lay in many Priſons.</p>

And did the Nonconformiſts <hi>write when forbidden,</hi> ſo much as <hi>Cartwright, Parker, Sandford, Fenner, Gilby, Ames,</hi> and aboundance more have done; yea and writ againſt Dioceſanes and Conformity as theſe and <hi>Bradſhaw, Nichols, Brightman, Bayne, Travers,</hi> and aboundance more have, even many hundreds, as the Millinary Petition and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Complaints <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhew; and yet did theſe men every one of them take it for ſin to Preach, becauſe it was diſobedience? But nothing will convince ſome men.</p>
               <p>§ 11. But I appeal to the reaſon and humanity of mankind, into what hands the ſilenced and perſecuted Miniſters are fallen? Is it humane firſt to charge them with reſiſting the Laws, by Preaching, gathering Churches, and adminiſtring Sacraments, and making Canons and ſetting up new Diſcipline, and to publiſh this to the land and world by ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as Arch Biſhop <hi>Bancrofts,</hi> Doctor <hi>Heylins &amp;c.</hi> till it is become their Common Charge to render them ſuſpected and odious and till this be taken for undoubted truth: And yet when it may ſerve for the ſilencing of us; to maintain it with <hi>Dr. St.</hi> as that which he is <hi>certain</hi> of, that <hi>the old Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for miſts</hi> were againſt ſuch Preaching and aſſembling. At this rate we have been hitherto accuſed and confuted.</p>
               <p>Yea upon the foreſaid Accuſations their Canons were formed againſt the Nonconformiſts, forbidding their Aſſembling, Preaching, calling themſelves a diſtinct Church, and a great deal more ſuch: and yet now the men that conform to theſe Canons are certain that they were made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſafe ſuppoſitions, and not one of the Nonconformiſts were ſo guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>But doth not the Doctor thus grievouſly accuſe the Church which he would defend? Were they ſuch men 1. that would ſo falſly accuſe the Innocent 2. and uſe them ſo cruelly on ſuch falſe accuſations, many of them dying in Priſons, and many lay there long <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. and to form Canons on ſuch falſe ſuppoſitions?</p>
               <p>§ 12. And I do not think I ſhall prevail with him to tell me, whether he that thinks their Caſe and ours was ſo much the ſame, doth verily believe 1. That if they had been in the Plague at <hi>London,</hi> and ſeen the forſaken people crowding for inſtruction to prepare for death, the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts (ſuch as <hi>Bradſhaw, Gifford, Hilderſham, Greenham, &amp;c.</hi>) would have refuſed to Preach to them.</p>
               <p>2. And if the next year they had ſeen the Churches burnt, and the City in ruins, and few Pariſh Miniſters officiate, they would have thought i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

God; and would have let them under ſo dreadful judgements, live and dye like prophane Atheiſts?</p>
               <p>3. And if ſhortly after the King had Licenſed them to aſſemble and Preach, would they have refuſed it as a ſin?</p>
               <p>4. And if the Prelates had prevailed by ſuch a Parliament againſt the Kings Licenſe, and he ſtill had ſhewed the clemencie of his mind by his conivence, and Magiſtrates were loth to execute the rigorous Laws, and people would not inform, and the informers repented, and thouſands more called to the Nonconformiſts for help, than did there when Popery ſtuck ſtill in the peoples hearts; would they have thought all this no alteration of the Caſe, to judge whether their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would do good or hurt?</p>
               <p>§ 13. He tells us of the fewneſs of Nonconformiſts in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days. And it is a wonder that ſo many in ſo ſhort a time, went ſo far in the Reformation as they did.

And to think the other cauſes before and after named of ſome ſort of Separation, to be inſufficient; and I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Dr. if this be his own Profeſſion, that he would tell any lie, or commit any other ſin, or forſake any other part of Religion, rather than ſeparate to other Aſſemblies, from a Church that agreed in Doctrine and the ſubſtantials of Worſhip with him. The Presbyterians then are ſure of him, if they were but in poſſeſſion; and it ſeems in <hi>Moſcovy</hi> he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake preaching. But what if the King licenſed a preaching Church, would he refuſe the uſe of it for fear of ſeparating from a mere reading Church.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Protean</hi> word [<hi>ſeparate</hi>] ſerveth for many uſes: I will put one caſe more to the Dr. (not feigned.) A Conformiſt Gentleman was of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97268:35"/>
the opinion that his Pariſh Church was no true Church, becauſe the Vicar was a Socinian, and another becauſe the Parſon was ignorant of the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Chriſtianity; and they go to the next Pariſh Church. A Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt in the ſame Pariſh, goeth to a Nonconformiſts Chappel, but doth not accuſe the Pariſh Church as none, as the other do; which of theſe ſeparateth more? At <hi>Glouceſter</hi> one took the Dioceſan Church for no true Church, becauſe Biſhop <hi>Goodman</hi> was a Papiſt, and the Biſhop is a conſtitutive part; and yet this man was for Dioceſans: A Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt went to a Nonconformiſts Church, but would not ſay the Dioceſan Church was none: Which ſeparated more? He <hi>ſeparateth</hi> from his Pariſh Church againſt the Canon, who goeth from an ignorant ſcandalous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to communicate with a Preacher at the next Pariſh: He ſeparateth from the Pariſh Churches, who judgeth them true Churches, but having the Kings Licenſe, joyneth conſtantly with the French, Dutch, or Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts as better, ſtill owning mental communion where he hath not local; and he ſeparateth from the French, Dutch, or Nonconformiſt Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, who thus leaveth them (as true Churches) to joyn with the Church of <hi>England</hi> as better. Many and various are the ſorts and degrees of Separation, and not all lawful or all unlawful: None of theſe are the Browniſts ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the old Nonconformiſts confuted; which conſiſted in a denial, 1. That the Engliſh Miniſters were true Miniſters. 2. And their Churches true Churches. 3. Or ſuch as a Chriſtian might lawfully live in communion with in ordinary worſhip. 4. And therefore they were all bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them, and ſet up others.</p>
               <p>I doubt the Dr. is far more a Separatiſt than I, and ſuch as I; for I am for Communion with all Chriſtians, as far as they ſeparate not from Chriſt; and I hate the falſe accuſing of any Church as if it were none, or its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion unlawful. I can be but in one place at once, but in heart I joyn with all Chriſtians on earth except in ſin; and locally I joyn where I ſee greateſt reaſon for it, preferring that which I judge moſt agreeable to Gods word, ſo far as I may without greater hurt. But the Canonical Conformiſts, unchurch all the Churches here but their own, and utterly refuſe Communion with them, even with thoſe that refuſe not Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them. And ſome think that forcible ſilencing, fining, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, and impriſoning, is not the gentleſt ſort of ſeparating.</p>
               <p>But doth he in all his Book do any thing to ſatisfie any mans Conſcience, that would know from what Churches he may or may not ſeparate? Not a word that I can find, that decideth ſuch a doubt. His two words here uſed are [<hi>Agreement in Doctrine, and ſubſtantials of Religion,</hi>] whereas 1. Religion is in <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Habits,</hi> and hath no proper <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and what
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97268:36"/>
his term [<hi>ſubſtance</hi>] meaneth, till he tells us, none can know. It muſt be either an <hi>eſſential</hi> part, or an integral part, for an <hi>Accident</hi> I ſuppoſe it is not. If only an <hi>eſſential</hi> part, what Chriſtian dare ſay that I may ſin againſt all the meer integrals of Religion rather than go from the Church that impoſeth ſuch ſin upon me. If it be all the integrals that we muſt agree in, then we differ in no one part of <hi>Religion;</hi> for <hi>Accidents</hi> are not <hi>parts:</hi> And then who contradicts him? When men differ in no part of <hi>Religion,</hi> they will not ſeparate unleſs merely locally: Are all the things named in my firſt <hi>Plea,</hi> no <hi>parts</hi> of Religion? It may be by [<hi>Subſtance</hi>] he meaneth only the greater ſort of <hi>Integrals,</hi> but how ſhall we know where to ſix our meaſures; what duty is ſo ſmall that I may omit it, or what ſin ſo ſmall that I may commit it for Communion.</p>
               <p>2. And as for <hi>Doctrine,</hi> they that differ in any part of Religion, are ſuppoſed to differ in the doctrine about that part. But can any man tell <hi>what Doctrine</hi> it is that he maketh our agreement in to be neceſſary, or the teſt of Communion. If I ſhould ſeparate from all Churches from which I differ in any the leaſt doctrine, I know not where the Dioceſan or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church is that I might hold Communion with: Do all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts agree in all doctrines? If it be in all that <hi>the Law impoſeth,</hi> how various, mutable, and uncertain is that.</p>
               <p>I diſtinguiſh between <hi>Doctrine profeſſed by the Church,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on me to profeſs it.</hi> As to the firſt, I will communicate with a Church that hath twenty falſe Doctrines, conſiſtent with the eſſentials of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity and Church Communion.

One of the Names to it is Mr. <hi>Simeon Aſh,</hi> my intimate dear friend, whoſe judgment in theſe matters was the ſame with mine, whom I was with even in his ſickneſs almoſt to the laſt hour of his life, and was buryed <hi>Aug.</hi> 23. 1662. the day before the Law had elſe ſilenced him, and he was to me a better Expoſitor of his own mind, than the Dr. can be: He was ſo much for going on to preach, that his Motto in his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ring was, [<hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt:</hi>] I yet keep my Ring, and can ſhew it you.</p>
               <p>And as to old Mr. <hi>Langley,</hi> another of them, I heard him my ſelf preach in <hi>Albriton</hi> Church in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> a Thankſgiving Sermon for the hopes of deliverance from the ſilencing Biſhops, when the Law forbad him: And for old Mr. <hi>Slater,</hi> I heard him preach at <hi>Trinity</hi> Church in <hi>Coventry</hi> when the Law forbad him: And did they not underſtand their own Writings better than the Dr. doth?</p>

And I would I knew how to prevail with him to tell me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Law and Canon did not forbid all the Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God according to the Directory, and neglect the Common Prayer Book, which yet almoſt all did for many years in the times of uſurpation: And yet of nine thouſand or more of theſe, ſeven thouſand ſince conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and they ſay that this Dr. is one of them.

                  </gap>ed and ſuch others is but this, which is our judgment: 1. That Churches and Paſtors are under the Kings Government as well as other Subjects. 2. That it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to him to puniſh them for evil doing, and encourage them in doing well. 3. That as to this his own execution, he is the publick Judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do well or ill. 4. That if he juſtly forbid any to preach or aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he muſt be obeyed. 5. And if he miſtake in particular caſes, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the ends of his Government, the common good, he muſt not be reſiſted, nor in ſuch a manner diſobeyed, as tendeth more to the common

hurt than his miſtake doth; nor diſabled to Govern by their diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, much leſs by Rebellion or Confuſion. 6. Nor are men bound to caſt away their great advantages for Gods ſervice which they then had, on pretence of <hi>doing better,</hi> when by accident it would do more hurt than good, nor as <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> ſaith, to run on the Sword, or oppoſe Sword to Sword, or raiſe Sedition, and ruin themſelves in vain.</p>
               <p>Their advantages were many: 1. Lawful Communion in the Pariſh Churches. 2. Moſt of them either conſtantly or by ſits, had publick Churches or Chappels to preach in, and were ſtill in hope. 3. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate protected them and the Reformation. 4. They hoped for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of it, whereas had they openly done as the Browniſts, they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered the Reformation by the exaſperation, and ruined themſelves, and loſt moſt of their labour: So that it is plain that preaching in that imprudent manner which is like to do more harm than good, they took to be a double ſin, as <hi>hurtful</hi> and as <hi>diſobedience;</hi> for obedience is due in ſuch a caſe. But in caſe the manner and circumſtances be ſuch as that theſe evils are not conſequent, but more good than hurt to be expected; they thought the bare breach of the Law no ſin.</p>

Becauſe its agreed by all, that Governing Order is a <hi>medium</hi> for the thing ordered; and never obligeth when it overthroweth the end, power being given to Edification and not to Deſtruction: None have power to forbid the neceſſary preaching of the Goſpel, and probably to damn Souls. 2.

As I have ſaid, their own practice fully expounded their words, who conſtantly broke the Law and Canon in preaching in Houſes and in Chappels without, or contrary to the Liturgy, or a part of it. So did Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> at <hi>Whitemore,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hind</hi> at <hi>Banbury,</hi> Mr. <hi>Geree</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> at <hi>Tewkſbury, John Rogers</hi> at <hi>Dedham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Harvy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bourne</hi> at <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gee,</hi> Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hancock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Broxholme,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> and abundance more, beſides thoſe mentioned before.</p>

               <p>Poſitive Precepts bind not <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> but <hi>Negatives</hi> do; and its too groſs a ſhift to turn a <hi>Negative</hi> to a <hi>Poſitive,</hi> and then pretend that the compariſon is between two duties: preaching is a duty when we can do it, but not when we cannot do it, unleſs we will ſwear, ſubſcribe, profeſs, or practiſe a forbidden thing.</p>

I conjecture that to what I have proved of the practice of the Nonconformiſts, it will be ſaid that <hi>Their preaching in peculiar places, Chappels, or Churches, though in a manner againſt Law and Canon, was but a partial joyning with the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and not a ſeparation; and the conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence of the Biſhops was a kind of Toleration.</hi>

And if it were the Temples that make the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, let them allow us to preach there and ſee whether we will refuſe it: And ſure the Conformiſts that preach in Tabernacles are not Separatiſts; the Pariſh Teacher of St. <hi>Martins</hi> now preacheth in the ſame place which I built to have preached in, and for ſo doing was by a warrant judged to priſon. They had no more Law on their ſide than I have, they uſually read no more of the Liturgy but the Confeſſion and the Scriptures, and many not the firſt at all, and ſome more; ſo that its a full proof that if <hi>breaking the Law had been all their ſtop,</hi> they would have ſtill preached.</p>

I will not here ſpeak of [<hi>draw up an Excommunication for him, take him Purſuivant, Jaylor ſee to your Priſoner;</hi>] but note one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of mine own experience, which many others can parallel: I was once (and but once I thank God) before a Biſhop, and being preſented to him by the chief Magiſtrates of a Corporation, to be Preacher in their Town; the lowly man firſt asked them, how they durſt chooſe a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without his conſent: You (ſaid he) are to receive a Preacher that I appoint you, for I am your Paſtor, though he never fed them: And then turning to me, [How durſt you, ſaid he, Preach in my Dioceſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my leave?] So that without any other reaſon but meer Lordſhip, the whole Corporation and I were diſmiſſed to wait his leiſure, which I have done now twenty years and more.</q>

               <head>An ANSWER to the falſe ACCUSATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS and REASONINGS of the Dr.'s SECOND PART.</head>
               <p>HEre the Dr. begins with the deſcription of their principles whom he accuſeth (I am one of them:) And the firſt ſort are thoſe [<q>that hold partial and occaſional Communion with our Churches to be lawful, but not total and conſtant,] <hi>viz.</hi> [at ſome times to be preſent, and in ſome part of our worſhip, and on particular occaſion to partake of ſome acts of Communion with us; but they apprehend greater purity and edification in ſeparate Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and when they are to chooſe they think themſelves bound to chooſe theſe, though at certain ſeaſons they may think it lawful to ſubmit to occaſional Communion with our Church.] The ſecond ſort are ``Such as hold any Communion with our Church unlawful: And he pretends to proceed with all poſſible clearneſs.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I am ſorry if more clearneſs and truth is become <hi>impoſſible</hi> to him. He taketh not me to be one of the ſecond ſort, and therefore deſcribeth me as of the firſt: Its no preſumption to ſay that I know my own mind and practice better than he doth, though he would ſeem to know the old Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts minds better than they did themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. The matter of fact muſt firſt be notified: 1. I ever diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the National, Dioceſan, Parochial, and Segregate Churches: And the <hi>National</hi> as ſuppoſed organized, or an Eccleſiaſtically political Society, from the National as a Chriſtian Kingdom, and as an <hi>agreeing Aſſociation</hi> of <hi>Churches,</hi> without any Governor of the whole (<hi>Single</hi> or <hi>Ariſtocratical.</hi>) And I diſtinguiſhed Dioceſans that are as Arch-Biſhops over lower Biſhops, and thoſe that are like ours, <hi>infimae ſpeciei:</hi> and I diſtinguiſhed <hi>Pariſh Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> that have <hi>true Paſtors,</hi> from thoſe that have none but uncapable men, through inſufficiency, hereſie, malignity, or as uſurpers are not truly called.</p>
               <p>2. Accordingly I concluded, 1. That the Pariſh Churches in <hi>England</hi> that have true Paſtors, are true political governed Churches. 2. That though ſome would make them none, by denying to the Paſtors an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97268:40"/>
part of their office, and make the Biſhop the ſole Paſtor, and the reſt but his Curates, and the Pariſhes no Churches as having no Biſhop, but to be only as Chappels, part of the loweſt governed Church (Dioceſan) and ſo give up the cauſe to the Browniſts called Separatiſts; yet truly ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes are true political Churches, becauſe the ordainer being but the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting Miniſter,</hi> the office is not eſſentiated as he <hi>willeth</hi> or <hi>ſaith,</hi> but as God the Inſtituter <hi>willeth and ſaith.</hi> As the power of the <hi>Huſband</hi> over the <hi>Wife</hi> is not what pleaſe the Prieſt that marryeth them, but what pleaſeth God who giveth it by his Law; and as the Lord Mayor's power is not what pleaſe the Recorder, or he that giveth him his Oath or <hi>Inſignia,</hi> but what the Kings <hi>Charter</hi> giveth; and the Kings power is not what he will that Crowneth him and giveth him his Oath, but what he hath right to by the conſtitution of the Kingdom; ſo that the truth of the Pariſh Churches is ſoundly maintained by the Nonconformiſts, and overthrown by many of the Dioceſans: But if the Pariſh Miniſter himſelf conſent not to the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of his own office, his Miniſtry may be valid to others while he is in the place, but he is, himſelf, no true Paſtor.</p>
               <p>3. All Pariſhes are no true governed Churches, whoſe Miniſters want any thing eſſential to a Paſtor, nor muſt be owned as ſuch if known.</p>
               <p>4. But for the peoples ſake they are true Churches, <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> or equivocally as a company of Chriſtians may be ſo called that have no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, and as ſuch may be ſo far communicated with.</p>
               <p>5. I never ſpake againſt a Dioceſan or Arch-Biſhop, that hath Pariſh Churches, and true Paſtors or Biſhops under him, and taketh on him no more than the Apoſtles, did, excepting their work, properly Apoſtolical, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Word and not the Sword, to overſee and inſtruct inferior Paſtors.</p>
               <p>6. When the Dioceſans put down all lower Churches and true Paſtors, I own not that doing, nor them in that form; but I ſeparate from them no further than they do from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>7. When they are but as good Arch-Biſhops taking care of many Churches, whether their Dioceſs ſhall be called a <hi>Church</hi> as ſuch, is but <hi>lis de nomine.</hi> I find not that any Apoſtle as ſuch, was the conſtitutive Head of a Dioceſan or Provincial Church, or made any ſuch, above particular Churches: Nor do I find in the New Teſtament any political Church form, but the Univerſal headed by Chriſt, and particular ones governed by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors. The General is the conſtitutive Head of his Army, and the Colonel of his Regiment, and the Captain of his Troop, as diſtinct ſubordinate Bodies; but the Major General, General of the Ordnance, Quartermaſter General, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be only under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Officers to the whole, and the nobleſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegral
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97268:40"/>
parts, but as ſuch no conſtitutive Head of any Body of Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: So that General Paſtors prove no ſuperior proper Church. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was lawful in prudence for the Apoſtles to have taken ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, limited ſeverally to each, ſo may men now; and if any call ſuch Churches, I ſtrive not, ſo the matter be agreed on.</p>
               <p>8. I ever owned a <hi>Chriſtian Kingdom,</hi> and the agreeing Aſſociation of as many Churches as can for mutual help and concord, and the King to be their Governor by the Sword: And if any will call a Kingdom a Church, or an Aſſociation that hath no conſtitutive Government, a Church; as if he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Diet or Aſſembly of many Kings or Princes, a Kingdom or Republick, let him enjoy his Equivocation, ſo we underſtand each other.</p>
               <p>9. According to theſe Principles I own my ſelf a Member of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of the Pariſh or particular Church where for the time I am called to be; that is, as they are. But I think I may remove from Pariſh to Pariſh as I have cauſe, as a dweller or a lodger may; and I take not all the Pariſh to be the Church, and take Pariſh bounds to be no Divine Inſtitution, but a humane mutable point of order, convenient when by accident it croſſeth not the end, nor doth more harm than good.</p>
               <p>10. I think if any Nobleman in <hi>London</hi> confine his ordinary communion to a juſt aſſembly in his happel, or any that have a Miniſter utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to their needs, do uſually hold communion in the next Pariſh Church for better, he is thereby neither Separatiſt nor Sinner.</p>
               <p>11. According to all this, when I was ſilenced I ordinarily heard Dr. <hi>Wilkins</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tillotſon;</hi> and communicated in ſeveral places as I had beſt opportunity; and quickly going to <hi>Acton,</hi> I there conſtantly morning and evening joyned at Common prayer and Sermon, communicating in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament where I had beſt opportunity, (being loth for the Parſon and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Plague driving me to <hi>Hambden,</hi> I conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there joyned in all the publick Worſhip and Sacrament: Returning to <hi>Acton,</hi> I did as before, and ſometime repeated Dean <hi>Rieve</hi>'s Sermon, till he got me ſent to Gaol for teaching ſome willing ignorant people between the Church meetings in my houſe: Thence going to <hi>Totteridge,</hi> I many years conſtantly twice a day joyned in the publick worſhip, and took the Sacrament when adminiſtred as Mr. <hi>Parre</hi> will teſtifie. Thence removing to <hi>London,</hi> and licenſed by the King to preach, I forbare ſome time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter choſe only the Market houſe at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, openly declaring that we met not as ſeparating from the publick Churches, but for the need of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes that went to no Church for want of room. Since then I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years joyned in all the publick worſhip, Word, Prayer, and Sacraments,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97268:41"/>
with the Pariſh Church, when able, ſince that I alſo ſometime joyn with Nonconformiſts, and preach my ſelf Afternoons, and on Thurſdays in the Nonconformiſts Chappels, being not allowed to do it otherwiſe. In the Country in Summer, I have far off got into ſome Pariſh Churches for a day, and tryed neer <hi>London,</hi> but could not have conſent, though I have Biſhop <hi>Sheldon</hi>'s Licenſe for that Dioceſs, I think not yet invalidated. This is the matter of fact.</p>
               <p>Now Reader, <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. Doth the tenth part of thoſe counted of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Church, hear and communicate ſo oft as I do.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. I do maintain that 1. When, <hi>conſideratis conſiderandis,</hi> we may chooſe the <hi>pureſt Churches and moſt edifying Miniſtry,</hi> it is a duty ſo to do. And one of his anſwers (<hi>the Rector, &amp;c.</hi>) hath in the Epiſtle cited his own words, not out of the retracted <hi>Irenicon,</hi> but his late Book againſt Popery, expreſly threatning us with <hi>damnation</hi> if we do not. To which I find no excuſe made by him, yea the Papiſt adverſary grants the ſame.</p>
               <p>2. I do maintain againſt thoſe that ſeparate from all Churches which they dare not be ſtated members of, that its lawful to communicate occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, where we may not do it ſtatedly: But is this to deny all ſave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional communion with all their Churches?</p>
               <p>3. I often ſay that there is ſo great difference of Pariſh Miniſters, and of Perſons caſes and opportunities, and Relations, (as Wives, Children, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, under Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of divers commands, &amp;c.) that to be conſtant Communicants in their Pariſh Church, is to ſome a duty, to ſome a ſin, and ſo is occaſional communion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. As to the ſecond ſort, <hi>that hold all communion with them unlawful.</hi> 1. I leave them to plead their own cauſe, and I meddle only with my own part. 2. But I muſt ſay that if they miſtake, thoſe that wilfully give them the occaſion are unfit reprovers of them: And if men for worldly ends or by error, will corrupt and defile a Church to the utmoſt that is conſiſtent with lawful Communion (or neer it) they may make the queſtion <hi>whether their Communion be lawful,</hi> too hard for underſtandings. Every one cannot tell whether one in a ſwoon be alive or dead, and ſome may bury him too haſtily.</p>
               <p>Stretch not my ſimilitude beyond my meaning: If a Gentleman of the game ſhould by wilful ſin, get the <hi>Lues Vener<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>If we be forbidden to take poyſon, and one will cauſeleſly command us to take a doubtful thing, as Nightſhade, Hemlock, <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Were your Congregations but full of perſons that had the ſcabs of the ſmall Pox not dryed away, and one went to a ſounder Congregation for fear of infection, not at all condemning you, he might be born with. If in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, when abundance of Papiſt Prieſts ſtaid in the Churches for their Benefices, a man had quietly gone from them to the Nonconformiſts, I could not blame him; though he had not been ſure that they were not changed.</p>
               <p>And I ſtill ſay that if ſuch erre by too much care to avoid ſin and ſave their ſouls, 1. It is a far greater error to give them the occaſion. 2. And in ſuch as you to ſay, that therefore they muſt be ſo far forſaken, as that none may preach to them. If I may preach to no erring people, 1. I muſt preach to none. 2. Or be no Phyſician to any that are ſick.</p>
               <p>And I muſt ſay, that though I found no call to gather any together as a Church, and give them the Sacrament; I cannot ſay that no other had ſuch, unleſs I had heard them all ſpeak for themſelves: yea I ſee ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious need in many places, that I dare not blame them.</p>

               <p>Theſe are the queſtions which, as my accuſer, (in his Book) he ſhould have handled, had truth been his deſign. 1. <q>Whether for one that holdeth ſo much Communion with their Churches as I have done, and here deſcribe, it be ſinful ſeparation to Preach in and Communicate with the Aſſemblies of Nonconformiſts, or mixt ones, as I have done? 2.

deny our conſent, 1. To your foreſaid Doctrine of all baptized dying Infants undoubted ſalvation, not excepting thoſe of Atheiſts and Infidels. 2. To your included Doctrine implyed in your Impoſitions, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That if a man have unlawfully made a Vow and Oath to endeavour in his Place and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to reform ſome corruptions in Church-Government, yea or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of his ſin and oppoſe Popery, Prophaneneſs, and Schiſm; there is no obligation on him from that Oath and Vow to do it.</q> Theſe and ſuch other Doctrines we ſeparate from, ſo far as to reject them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. His ſecond ſuppoſed Conceſſion is, [<hi>That there is no other reaſon of Separation becauſe of the terms of our Communion, than what was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reformation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There are in my judgment no common reaſons for going further from you than we do, nor to juſtifie that which is commonly known by the name of Separation. But there are many and great reaſons to juſtifie our meaſure of diſſent and miniſtration; and to ſay that [<hi>we grant there are no more reaſons now than were then,</hi>] is too bold an untruth. There is more reaſon, 1. From the quality of the things impoſed. 2. From the deſigns and drift of the Impoſition. 3. From the effects. 4. From the aggravation of Conformity as in the Church that we muſt communicate with. 5. From the things which give us a fuller cauſe for our Preaching and Aſſemblies. <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The late general contrary Church State and Engagement to it. 2. The Plague. 3. The burning of the Churches. 4. The Kings Licenſe and Clemency. 5. The number and quality of them that ſeek our helps. Of theſe briefly in order.</p>
               <p>1. As to the things impoſed now which were not then.</p>
               <p>1. The Veſtry Act was not then made, by which ſo conſiderable a part of your Pariſh Churches as the Veſtries, are to renounce all obligations to endeavour any alteration of the Government of the Church, from the Oath and Vow called the Covenant: So that all Reformation of Church Government as ſo ſworn, was thus renounced by them who in a ſort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Pariſh Church.</p>
               <p>2. The Act of Uniformity had not then impoſed the ſame declarative Renunciation of all ſuch obligation on all the Miniſters and Schoolmaſters in <hi>England,</hi> as it now doth.</p>
               <p>3. The Corporation Act was not then in being, which conſtituteth all the Officers in power in all Cities and Corporations, of ſuch only as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, [<hi>that there is no obligation from the ſaid Oath at all,</hi>] not excepting ſo much as the ſworn duties of oppoſing Popery, Prophaneneſs, and Schiſm, <hi>to repent of ſin and amend our lives.</hi> And if <hi>ſwearing and vowing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Schiſm,</hi> no whit bind men (if the Oath were but unlawfully impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97268:42"/>
why ſhould the Dr. make ſo great a matter of it, and think that his reaſonings ſhould make men afraid of Gods ſervice, if he will but call it Schiſm.</p>
               <p>4. None of theſe Acts then required men to profeſs and ſubſcribe, that there is from that Vow or Oath no ſuch Obligation on <hi>any</hi> other perſon; and ſo to become Vouchers for the Souls and Conſciences of many hundred thouſands whom we never ſaw; even thoſe Parliament men that were not forced to it, but impoſed it on others, when we know not in what ſenſe they took it.</p>
               <p>5. The Re-ordination of Miniſters ordained by Presbyteries was not then required, and made a neceſſary condition of their Miniſtration and Church Relation, (even by them that confeſs Re-ordination unlawful, and therefore plainly intimate the nullity of the firſt.)</p>
               <p>6. The Act of Uniformity was not then made, which requireth all Miniſters publickly to declare their <hi>Aſſent and Conſent to all things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, and preſcribed by the Liturgy, Book of Ordination,</hi> (though part of this was in a Canon.)</p>
               <p>7. The falſe Rule for finding <hi>Eaſter-day</hi> was not then to be aſſented and conſented to, as a condition of the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>8. Nor the new Doctrine or Article of Faith, [<hi>of the undoubted cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty by Gods word, that baptized dying Infants are ſaved,</hi>] (without any exception of the children of Atheiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) For the old words at Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation (as many Drs. of the Church have ſhewed) only meant that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe was neceſſary on the Churches part, that is, not Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>9. The word [<hi>Paſtor</hi>] as applyed to Pariſh Miniſters diſtinct from Curates, was not then blotted out of moſt places in the Liturgy; nor the twentieth of <hi>Acts,</hi> as applied to Presbyters, left out, (<hi>Take heed to your ſelves and the Flock, &amp;c.</hi>) in plain deſign to alter the Office and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Churches.</p>
               <p>10. The <hi>Oxford</hi> Oath was not then impoſed, to baniſh Miniſters above five miles from all Cities, and Corporations, and Places, where they had of late years preached; ſo that their old Flock or Friends (yea, Wives and Children that could not follow them) might not ſo much as ſee or hear ſuch Miniſters in their Families, or familiar converſe that would have come to the publick Churches: And all Nonconformiſt Miniſters that took not the Oath, were thereby forbidden to come to the Pariſh Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in all Cities, Corporations, or Places aforeſaid, though their example might have drawn many (as mine did where I was.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:97268:43"/>11. Miniſters and Corporations and Veſtries, were not then bound to ſwear or ſubſcribe, that it is <hi>unlawful on any pretence whatſoever to reſiſt any commiſſioned by the King;</hi> when the Keeper of his Seal may ſign Commiſſions to ſeize on the Kings Forts, Garriſons, Navies, and Treaſuries, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the Kingdoms to Foreigners, to deſtroy Parliaments, Cities, and Laws: I am ſure <hi>Hooker, Bilſon,</hi> or Arch-Biſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> ſubſcribed not this, nor were ſuch Conformiſts. Are all theſe no difference of caſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. There is 2. a great difference in the drift and tendency of the Impoſitions. They were at firſt to quiet a Popiſh Nation, while the true Doctrine took poſſeſſion and rooting, and to avoid the cavils of thoſe Papiſts that charged the Reformers with forſaking all the Church: But what they have been uſed for theſe laſt forty or fifty years, I leave the Reader to judge.</p>

That St. <hi>Peter</hi> had a Primacy of Order among the Apoſtles, is the unanimous voice of the Primitive Church.—3. Some Fathers and Schoolmen who were no ſworn Vaſſals to the Roman Biſhop, do affirm that this Primacy of Order is fixed to the Chair of St. <hi>Peter.</hi>

                  <note n="g" place="margin">That is, 1. The Pope is not to govern us arbitrarily, but by Canons, (Which what they are is hardly known.) 2. And all will be Schiſmaticks, that ſo obey him not.</note>

leſs diſpleaſure at our liberty. 2. It would have deprived moſt of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts of their hopes of publick liberty in the Pariſh Churches, which moſt of them enjoyed; but we had neither poſſeſſion nor expectation of ſuch a thing. 3. It would have hindred and hazarded the progreſs of the Reformation, but our preaching hath done more to ſtop the progreſs of the Syncretiſm, or of Popery: Others know this whatever you frivolouſly ſay againſt it. 4. Few of the moſt ignorant that needed them would then have left the Pariſh Churches, to hear Nonconformiſts in private; but now many will come to us that cannot get in to the Pariſh Churches: Other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent effects may be named.</p>

And the multitude of Atheiſts and filthy livers, and the thouſands of Noncommunicants who are ſtill taken for real members of your Churches, have now ſtood out againſt ſo long means and patience, that the reaſons of longer waiting for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, much differs from theirs in the beginning. 3. The Canon at firſt did not <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> excommunicate all that do but profeſs themſelves Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts, as ſince it did. 4. The Biſhops and their Canoneers had not then caſt out 2000, nor neer ſo many Preachers as now, and ſo did not ſo much tempt the people to flee from them as perſecutors, thorns, thiſtles, or wolves. 5. When one Biſhop caſt any out, ſome other uſually would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them, but now it was not ſo. 6. The people ſaw daily, that you bore with thoſe as no Schiſmaticks, that never communicated nor <hi>uſed</hi> to hear you, even the greater half of many Pariſhes, and took them for Church members as is ſaid; and therefore they had reaſon to hope that they that communicated ſomewhere with Proteſtants, eſpecially that communicated alſo with your own Churches, were as good Members, and by good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, would be as well endured.</p>

The caſe of the Plague, the burning of the Churches, the Kings Licenſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I named before, which verily made a great difference. 4. And the numbers

I preach now twice a week elſewhere, but both the places are in Neighbourhoods, where many thouſands cannot hear in the Pariſh Churches. What if other men have other ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (as the utter incapacity of ſome Miniſters, or the like) doth it follow that my own caſe and proſeſſed reaſon is a meer pretence? why then did I uſe no publick preaching, while I lived in ſuch Villages where the people might go to Church? and why did I conſtantly twice a day lead them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though ſome diſliked it? 2. The queſtion is not whether <hi>more Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97268:45"/>
are deſirable?</hi> But where they are not, whether many thouſands muſt live like Atheiſts, without all publick teaching or Divine Worſhip, for fear of being called Schiſmaticks. Is not this plainly to chuſe damnation? If the Goſpel be needleſs, why do we wiſh the Heathens had it? Why ſubſcribe you againſt mens hopes of being ſaved in all their ſeveral Religions? If Church worſhip be needleſs, why is a Clergy to be ſo honoured, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at ſo dear a rate? Aud why do you make ſuch a ſtir with Separatiſts to bring them to your Churches? Can men, not blinded by intereſt, chuſe but wonder, that ſo many thouſands in a Pariſh ſhould be taken for Church Members, and live quietly, that come not to any Church, or never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with any, and yet that godly perſons who hear and communicate with their old tryed Paſtors (yea with ſuch as communicate with you) ſhould be preach'd and written againſt as Schiſmaticks, and judged to that which ſome endure. Did this Dr. think that to drop in the caſe of other men, when he was at a loſs, would make good his charge againſt me, and ſuch as I: Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> preached other doctrine; do I do ſo, and have you proved it?</p>
               <p>But ſeeing he will needs bring the caſe to <hi>Kiderminſter,</hi> whether I would ſuffer Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> to gather a Congregation, I muſt not balk it; but adviſe him hereafter to keep himſelf at a greater diſtance, and not to put his own followers, who are willing enough to believe him, upon utter impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: He ſped better with them when he laid the ſcene an hundred years backward, or as far off as <hi>New England;</hi> let him know then all theſe things in confutation of his hiſtorical ſuppoſition. 1. That <hi>Kiderminſter</hi> Pariſh hath but about three thouſand or four thouſand ſouls, and the Church ſo fit (with five Galleries) that all may hear: But his Pariſh is ſaid to have twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſouls, of which not four thouſand can hear. 2. A conſiderable part of <hi>Kiderminſter</hi> Pariſh, called <hi>Ridnal,</hi> being at <hi>Bewdly Bridge</hi> end, and two miles from <hi>Kiderminſter,</hi> (and ſome Villages more) uſually were Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his hearers at <hi>Bewdley,</hi> and I never blamed them. 3. After him, they were Hearers and Communicants to his Succeſſor Mr. <hi>Oaſland,</hi> and he took the Paſtoral care of them (that deſired any;) and I was ſo far from blaming him, that I greatly thanked him, and we were far from diſagreeing. 4. Though Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> and I differed in the doctrine of Infant Baptiſm, I gave him leave (yea and the Quakers too) in the publick Church many hours together, to ſay all that they could for their opinions in the hearing of my Auditors, and none of them ever won one of them that I heard of, (yet the Dr. ſuppoſeth ſome great danger of their peoples ſeduction, if they hear ſuch as I that never were accuſed of falſe Doctrine. 5.

And the ſequeſtred Vicar in the Town (Mr. <hi>Dance</hi>) was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally taken to be as ignorant as he, ſo that when once a quarter he went into the Pulpit, his own Wife, though of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> would for ſhame go out of Church: Yet did I never forbid him to preach, and he oft read the Common Prayer at Sir <hi>Ralph Clares,</hi> and I ſuppoſe gave them the Sacrament. 7. I had opportunity then to have hindred all this if I would have uſed Magiſtrates: They were both by Proclamation to remove two miles off, but neither of them once removed ſo much as out of their houſes, nor did I deſire it; but we are by law driven five miles off. 8. Mr. <hi>Dance</hi> had forty pounds a year allowed him, and Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> never had a groat of his ancient Salary diminiſhed, when another was put in, but the other paid otherwiſe; but we ask you nothing for aſſiſting you. 9. I had never one hundred pounds to my ſelf, and therefore could maintain no more help; (two Aſſiſtants I had) but have you no more to maintain Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants? Now judge how well your hiſtorical Inſtances ſerve your turn.</p>
               <p>And beſides the number of Souls, very many Pariſhes are ſo wide, that diſtance forbiddeth many to come to the publick Pariſh Churches: Some Villages are five miles, ſome four, and many three miles off; and how can Families, eſpecially Women, Children, and the aged, and eſpecially in winter, go ſo far twice (or once) a day: And muſt all theſe forbear to hear, or to worſhip God, for fear of being counted Schiſmaticks?</p>
               <p>Becauſe the Dr. appealeth to my ſelf, I ſeriouſly profeſs that when I had a Paſtoral Charge, (which was but in one place) I would have been very thankful to any one that diſſered no more than the Dr. and I do, that would have gathered a Congregation of ſuch, as for number or diſtance could not have come into the Pariſh Church; and the caſe of diſtance did occaſion the honeſt ſeparation aforeſaid, though the caſe of numbers did not: Yea when hundreds deſired Communion according to the Common Prayer, I never offered to hinder any of them from taking it where and how they would.</p>

When I began to preach at St. <hi>James</hi>'s the neighbours aſſured me, that many of the hearers had been at no Church of four years; but they were Members of the Pariſh-Church, and that ſome of them got into the Church, but rarely: and ſome liked it not ſo well as to be forward ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. When I was driven thence, I preached a while where Mr. <hi>Wadſworth</hi> was in <hi>Southwark:</hi> There were ſome people that had adhered to their old ejected worthy Paſtor, and ſome that I knew not. Since then I preach once on the Lords day in another mans Pulpit, as near St. <hi>James</hi>'s as I could, and the ſame perſons that heard me there do (many of them) come hither, and ſome others: of all whom I know very few, but by report. On Thurſdays I preach a Lecture in another mans Pulpit to perſons of whom I know not many: but report ſaith, that ſome of them joyn not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily with the Pariſh Miniſters, and ſome do, and moſt judge it lawful, and ſometime, but ſeldom practiſe it: And thoſe are of two ſorts: ſome that prefer the Nonconformiſts Miniſtry, and ſome that finding the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Churches crowded, and many preſent are out of hearing, do ſeldom go thither, though they are of the Pariſh Churches, and diſſent not from their Miniſtry or Worſhip: ſome ſay [<hi>we have no Seats and cannot ſtand:</hi>] ſome ſay [<hi>we cannot hear the Miniſter:</hi>] ſome ſay, <hi>Thouſands ſtay away that can get no room, and will go no whither elſe, and when we can go elſewhere, we will not crowd in firſt to keep them out, that ſo much need Others muſt be out if we be in.</hi> Theſe are your own Church-Members: they hear you ſometimes, but ſeldom. Others that hear you conſtantly on the Lords days, will think that a Sermon on the week days may be needful to them whatever you think or ſay againſt it. And is it <hi>inconſiſtent with Sincerity</hi> here to plead the peoples neceſſity. It's well that our Sincerity is not to ſtand or fall to your judgment. Did I ſay that my hearers are <hi>conſtant hearers</hi> in your Churches? Can you perſwade the World, while you deny not that half or a quarter of your own Pariſh cannot hear you (much leſs many greater Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes) that if ſome of them do but ſometimes crowd in, perhaps once in many months or weeks, by coming with the firſt, and do but dwell in the Pariſh and own you, that they have no need to hear or worſhip God

                  <hi>CHAP. VI. Q.</hi> Whether he be no Christian that is not a fixed Member of a particular Church?</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. HE that is a true Member of the Univerſal Church, which is Chriſts Body, is a true Chriſtian: But many are Members of the Univerſal Church, which are no fixed Members of any particular Church. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. All that are rightfully Baptized are Chriſtians, (for it is their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening.) <hi>But many rightfully Baptized are no fixed Members of any particular Church. Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. He that hath all the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity is a Chriſtian: But many that are no fixed Members of a particular Church have all the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Chriſtianity. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>A fortiore,</hi> They that are not ſo much as bound in Duty to be fixed Members of a particular Church, though Baptiſed, are not unchriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of ſuch Memberſhip. But many Baptized perſon are not ſo much as bound in Duty to be fixed Members of a particular Church. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Inſtances.</p>
               <p>1. The Eunuch baptized in his Travails <hi>Acts.</hi> 9 was only a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church Univerſal. 2. Thoſe that were converted by <hi>Frumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Edeſius</hi> when there was no particular Church: And all that are firſt converted in any Infidel or Heathen Land before any Church be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. 3. Thoſe that by Shipwrack are caſt on heathen Countries where no Churches are. 4. Travellers that go from Country to Countries (as <hi>Lythgow</hi> did nineteen years, and others many.) And I think he unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily named <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where Travellers come that are of no fixed Church (unleſs he in that alſo be a Superindependant, and think that men may be many years Members of a Church many hundred miles off, which they have no perſonal communion with.) 5. Merchants and Factors, who are called to dwell long among Infidels where are no Churches. 6. Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors who by their Princes are ſent to reſide among ſuch, much of their lives. 7. Wanderers that have no fixed habitations; as many Pedlers and other poor wandering Tradeſmen, and looſe Beggars that have no Dwelling. 8. Thoſe thot live among Papiſts or any other Chriſtians who impoſe ſome ſin as a condition of communion. 9. Thoſe that live among ſuch Chriſtians as have no true Paſtors who are conſtitutive parts
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97268:49"/>
of particular Churches. Some being incapable through inſufficiency, ſome by Hereſie and ſome for want of a true Call: Such as by Mr <hi>Dodwells</hi> Doctrine moſt of the Chriſtian World are, for want of uninterrupted rrue Epiſcopal Ordination. 10. Thoſe who are ſubjects to ſuch as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them not to be fixed Members: As Wives hindred by Husbands, Children by Parents, and ſome Subjects violently hindred by Princes; who yet allow them tranſient Communion. And verily a man would think by the writings of many Conformiſts, that they took it for a Duty to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey a Prince in ſuch a caſe. 11. Thoſe who live where Church-corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not ſo great as to make tranſient Communion unlawful, but ſo great as to make fixed communion ſeem to be a culpable conſent: If I come in travel to a Church of Strangers, I am not bound to examine what their <hi>Diſcipline is,</hi> what their <hi>Lives be,</hi> or how <hi>their Paſtors are called:</hi> But where I am fixed I am more bound to know theſe, and if I find them exclude Diſcipline, live wickedly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have unlawful Paſtors, I may in ſome caſes be a partaker of the ſin if I fix among them. 12. They that live in a time and place of Schiſm and diſtraction, ſtriving who ſhall prevail, and condemning each other, all following ſeveral Factions, and needing Reconcilers: It may for a time become in prudence the duty of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, to own no Faction, nor to be more of one Church than of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, while he ſeeth that it will do more hurt than good; And thoſe that wait in hope as the Nonconformiſts now do, to ſee whether their Rulers will reſtore them to reformed Pariſh Churches, may at once in prudence find it needful, neither to fix as Members in ſome Pariſh Churches till reformed (in the Teachers at leaſt) nor to ſeem to be Separatiſts by gathering new Churches. In none of all theſe caſes is a man unchriſtened, nor ſchiſmatical, for being no fixed member of any Church beſides the Univerſal. And as it is the ill hap of theſe men commonly to ſtrike themſelves, I doubt they will prove <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf no Chriſtian, by this Rule, who for many years before he died, they ſay joyned with no particular Church, as a fixed member. And I know not well what particular Church they make the King a Member of.</p>

This Church! which Church do you mean? I was not Baptized into St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s nor St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Pariſh Church, but into one above an hundred miles off, and yet my removal made me no culpable Separatiſt. Or doth he mean, This <hi>Dioceſan Church?</hi> No; I was Baptized in the Dioceſs of <hi>Lichfield.</hi> Doth he mean <hi>This National Church;</hi> as it is ſuppoſed a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical body conſtituted of the Eccleſiaſtical Governing and Governed

Parts, he ſaith there is no ſuch Church of <hi>England;</hi> but that It inferreth Popery to aſſert ſuch. But if he equivocate here, and mean not by a <hi>Church</hi> as in the reſt, but either a <hi>chriſtian Kingdom,</hi> or an <hi>agreeing Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation</hi> of many Churches, I am ſtill a fixed member of ſuch a Kingdom, and of ſuch an Aſſociation in all things neceſſary to Churches and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Communion. 2. But <hi>Baptiſm as ſuch</hi> entred me only into the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church; much leſs did it fix me in any other. I was Baptized where I was to ſtay but a little while. And this phraſe of [<hi>being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into our Church,</hi>] is to me of ill ſound or intimation. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith that all that are baptized are interpretatively thereby engaged to the Pope: I was baptized in a Pariſh, and in a Dioceſs and in a Chriſtian Kingdom; but not ſo <hi>into them,</hi> as to be obliged to continue under that Prieſt or Biſhop or in that Kingdom. And my Baptiſm I hope did not oblige me to every Canon, Ceremony, Form, or Sin of the aſſociated Churches in <hi>England,</hi> abuſively by him called <hi>one Church.</hi> 3. And unhappily it is not meer Independancy that he is ſtill pleading for, but ſome extremes which the moderate Independants diſclaim, <hi>viz.</hi> That a member of their Churches is ſo tyed to them, that they may not remove to another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their conſent. And am I ſo tyed? to what, to Parochial, or to the Dioceſan, or to the aſſociation of Engliſh Churches. If it had been to the <hi>Species,</hi> I would fain know whether their things called by them <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> ſpecifie them.</p>

Only I muſt tell him yet 1. that if he lay his cauſe on this, that their Parochial or Dioceſan Churches are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective. 2. Or that the defects cannot by others be avoided, he will quite marr his matter, and undo all by overdoing. 3. And if he indeed think that all defective Churches muſt be forſaken, he will be one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Schiſmaticks in the World.

And do you think in your conſcience that all the Patrons in <hi>England</hi> of ſo various minds and lives, are like to chooſe only ſuch, in whoſe paſtoral conduct all that care for their Souls ſhould reſt. Yea though the Biſhops muſt Inſtitute them as they Ordained them. When we heretofore told them of the multitudes of groſly ignorant, drunken Prieſt, their anſwers were, 1. Their Chaplains examined them. 2. They had certificates. 3. <hi>A quare impedit</hi> lay againſt them if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired higher knowledge than to anſwer the Catechiſm in Latine.

Pariſh Churches; and yet dare not deny the truth of any one of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. 1. Do not all thoſe men take the Pariſhes for no proper political Churches, but only for <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Dioceſan Church,</hi> ſuch as we call <hi>Curates Chappels,</hi> who ſay that a <hi>Biſhop is a conſtitutive Part</hi> of a <hi>true</hi> political Church and entereth the Definition, and that it's no Church that hath no Biſhop, and that Dioceſan Churches are the loweſt political. And do I need to tell him how conſiderable theſe men are among them. 2. Doth he himſelf take any one of theſe for a true political Church? When I was young, divers Laymen by turns were our publick Reading Teachers: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt one was after proved to counterfeit <hi>Orders.</hi> This mans acts were no nullities to us that knew it not: but when we knew of ſuch muſt we take them for true Paſtors, and it for a true Church?</p>

Where do I ſay [<hi>that owns it ſelf to be Independant,</hi>] as if that were neceſſary to its being. 1. Doth he not confeſs that I own general Viſitors or Archbiſhops and appeals? 2. That I own <hi>Aſſociations</hi> which he makes the ſtate of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> 3. That I own Synods for obliging concord? 4. That I own the Magiſtrates Government of all? Is there no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancy in any of theſe, or all? what dependancy more doth he aſſert? 2. As to the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Keys,</hi> dare he come into the light and tell us, whether <hi>any power of the Keys,</hi> that is, of the Government of his particular Church be eſſential to the Paſtor of a true organized governed Church or not. If not, is it not a contradiction to call it a <hi>governed Church?</hi> If yea then is he a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor that wants what is eſſential to a Paſtor? But if they will call a <hi>forcing Power,</hi> or the preſent ſecular Mode of their Courts, by the name of the <hi>Keys,</hi> I never ſaid that theſe are eſſential to a Church, nor deſirable in it, but am a Nonconformiſt becauſe I will not by Oath or Covenant renounce (juſt) Endeavours to amend it.</p>

The next Accuſation is, [<hi>They leave it in the peoples Power notwithſtanding all legal Eſtabliſhments to own or diſown whom they judge fit.</hi>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> He tireth me with putting me on repetitions. 1. They can unjuſtly judge of none and diſown them without ſin. It is not I that give men power to ſin, no more than <hi>Power to die,</hi> or be <hi>ſick,</hi> which is but impotency: would I could give them power againſt it. 2. It is not power to reject any choſen by King or Patrons, from being publick Teachers, or to have the Tithes and Temples, nor to be a Paſtor to others. But it is to have a <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Judgment whether</hi> one choſen by the Patron be a perſon to whom he himſelf ought to truſt the paſtoral Conduct of his Soul. Either the Dr.

thinks that Laymen have this diſcerning power and duty or not. If yea, is it nothing to him to ſeem thus ſeriouſly to plead againſt his conſcience? If not, I ask him, 1. What meant Chriſt and his Apoſtles to call men to beware of falſe Teachers, to avoid the Leven of their Doctrine, to mark them and avoid them, and turn away from them, and not bid them good ſpeed? 2. What meant all the ancient Churches to forbid Communion with Hereticks? and even ſome Popes and Councils to hear Maſs of Fornicators? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And when he wrote that cited in my firſt Chap. he was of that mind or he was a moſt groſs diſſembler. But muſt it be otherwiſe? Is it our Salvation that we muſt ſacrifice to Prieſts, Prelates or Princes wills? If our Tithes would have ſerved them, we had not gainſaid them.

But I am glad for the peace of the Nonconformiſts elſewhere, if it concern not them. 2. As to <hi>London,</hi> he knoweth that I give the Preachers due honour, and that I juſtifie not any unneceſſary Separation of the people from them, nor of the Conformiſts from the Nonconformiſts. I gave him an account of my own Practice and the Reaſons of it: Let other men give account of theirs, I know very many of my mind. 3. And he knoweth that I oft told him that many things make good mens actions culpable in ſome degree, that make them not criminalls, odious, or to be ruined. And that I gave him many of their Extenuations. 4.

To be yet plainer with you, had the caſe been in the times of the old Prophets and Prieſts, I queſtion whether to let ſuch a Kingdom alone ſo long in that which we judge to be ſo great ſins, would not have been heavily charged on the Preachers: And I profeſs that my conſcience is more in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my ſo long forbearance was not my ſin, than whether ſaying at laſt what I did was ſin: And I had nothing to ſatisfie it, but the men that I ought to judge wiſer than my ſelf, perſwaded me that it would have done more hurt than good, and cauſed but our further rending, And I think

What if the Church be but ſchiſmatical? Have you written all this Book, to draw men to you from the Independant Churches, and do you now tell us that the people may not ſeparate from them, on the account of Schiſm? 6. What if a Church require me to tell or ſubſcribe to one known Lie, or to ſay, that I believe what I do not: or to juſtifie thouſands that I think obliged by a Vow, if they break it? What if they impoſe any one ſin on me without which they will not receive me to Communion? 7.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. IN his third Part I firſt find my ſelf accuſed <hi>p.</hi> 242, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that is not only by inſiſting on a falſe accuſation of my words, but adding a confutation of himſelf, as if he diſcerned not that he did it. In <hi>Treat. of Concord</hi> I ſay, [<hi>If it holdeth that God inſtituted only Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal or Parochial Churches, as for preſent Communion, then none of the reſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by man may deprive them of their priviledges granted by Chriſt.</hi>] I put it but with an <hi>(If it be ſo)</hi> becauſe I told them my own doubt of it. After I ſay, [<hi>To deviſe new ſpecies of Churches without Gods Authority, and impoſe them on the World; yea in his name, and call all Diſſenters Schiſmaticks, is worſe Uſurpation than to make and impoſe new Ceremonies and Liturgies.</hi>] And can any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian deny either of theſe? But he ſaith, [<hi>This ſuppoſeth Congregational Churches to be ſo much the inſtitution of Chriſt, that any conſtitution above theſe is unlawful and unſupportable:</hi>] which is more than the <hi>Independant Brethren do aſſert.</hi> And is any word of all this true? 1. The Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants much inſiſt on this? I refer him now but to <hi>Ameſii Medul. de Eccl. Miniſt.</hi> 2. Do the words ſuppoſe that which is plainly excepted in them? If it were granted. 1. That the Congregational only are ſo inſtituted. 2. And that others are not ſet over them by God, 3. And yet are obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his name, without his authority. 4. And all Diſſenters called Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,] then I ſay they are unlawful. 5. To coufute himſelf plainly he confeſſeth that I ſay, <hi>The queſtion is not whether the</hi> Archbiſhops <hi>ſhould be over the particular Churches, as Succeſſors to the Apoſtolical and General O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeers of the firſt Age in the ordinary continued parts of their Office.</hi> Nor whether Patriarks, <hi>Dioceſans, Lay-Chancellors as Officers of the King, exerciſing Magiſtracy be lawful.</hi>] And yet he ſaith that I ſuppoſe the contrary. He next pretends to give my Reaſons: And the chief is, <hi>becauſe it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the ſpecies of Gods making;</hi> when I only ſay, <hi>That which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth it is unlawful;</hi> which is not the Archbiſhops that are over the lower Biſhops, but thoſe that put them all down, and governed the Carkaſſes of the mortified particular Churches as the loweſt Biſhops of many ſcore or hundred ſuch as themſelves. And he ſaith I am for the <hi>full exerciſe of Diſcipline within the</hi> particular Church; while he confeſt I ſpake not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Archbiſhops. And yet he ſaith, <hi>This is a fair repreſentation of my opinion.</hi>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Coming to prove our Epiſcopacy the ſame with the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive he pretendeth to confute me: That which I aſſerted was, 1. That by the firſt Inſtitution, and Conſtitution, every Church no bigger for number of Souls than one of our great Pariſhes had a Biſhop of their own, (one or more I diſputed not.) 2. Yea that for the firſt two hundred years if not more, no one Biſhop had a Church ſo big as ſome of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, at leaſt except <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and even of them it is not certain that they had more Souls. 3. That after by degrees the caſe was altered: But yet after there were many <hi>Meetings</hi> like Chappels, a while there was but one Altar. 4. After that thoſe Chappels had Altars; but ſo as that at certain times of the year, the people of the Cities and next parts were all to communicate with the Biſhop, and were no more than could meet to chooſe the Biſhops, and to be preſent as to the main body of them, and diſciplinary debates, to give conſent. 5. In <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time at <hi>Carthage</hi> (a place of greatneſs and great numbers of Chriſtians) the Church was grown very great, but not beyond the exerciſe of ſuch perſonal Communion as I deſcribed: And the Biſhops there and round about be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worthy men, kept up the life of the former Diſcipline. And as great as their Church was, we would be glad of ſuch an Epiſcopacy, Order and Communion. For I oft told you, that by <hi>preſent Communion,</hi> I meant not that all muſt meet in one place at once, (For the tenth part of ſome Pariſhes cannot:) But that as Neighbours and Citizens, may have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Converſe and Meetings <hi>per vices,</hi> of ſome at one time and ſome at another, as different from meer mental Communion, or by Synods or Perſons delegate, or as their Governours or Repreſentatives, and this for mutual Edification in holy Doctrine, Worſhip and Converſation. And that the footſteps of this remained long, when worldly Reaſons had made a change.</p>
               <p>And all this I have proved ſo fully in my Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what's ſaid in my Abſtract of the Epiſcopal Hiſtory, that till ſome man ſhall confute the full Evidence of Antiquity there brought, I have no more in Reaſon to do upon that ſubject. And though the Doctors Hiſtory of this be the moſt conſiderable part of all his Book, yet ſo far doth he leave what I ſay uncontradicted, that I find not one word that he ſaith againſt any of my Teſtimonies, nor any for his own cauſe, for the firſt two hundred years: But when he ſhould have proved the extent of the Churches at two hundred years, he begins his hiſtorical Proofs at two hundred and fifty for three or four great Cities in the World, and ſo proceeds to <hi>Auguſtine</hi> at above four hundred, and <hi>Victor Uticenſis</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four hundred and ninety, <hi>Theodoret</hi> four hundred and thirty, (where
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97268:64"/>
he ſuppoſeth me to ſay that of his City, which I ſaid of the Dioceſs of that City:) And to confute all Impertinencies, and groundleſs Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, while my full proofs are unanſwered, is but loſs of time.</p>

He can prove no ſuch Rule in the firſt two hundred years. 2. See how well the defenders of Prelacy agree? <hi>Gratious</hi> (<hi>&amp; de Imperio &amp; in Anotat.</hi>) and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> I cited, who ſay that Cities at firſt had two Biſhops in each (<hi>Rome, Antioch, &amp;c.</hi>) one of Jewiſh Chriſtians, and one of Gentile Chriſtians, and ſaith <hi>D. H. Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> was Biſhop of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and they had two Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; and ſaith <hi>Gretius</hi> The Churches were formed to the manner of the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> and there were divers Churches with divers Biſhops in the ſame City (in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>&amp; de Imp. p.</hi> 355, 356, 357.) 3. In the fourth Century a Council at <hi>Capua</hi> decreed that the two Biſhops with their ſeveral Churches at <hi>Antioch</hi> (<hi>Flavian</hi>'s and <hi>Evagrins</hi>) ſhould live together in Love and Peace. 4. This was a good cuſtom while there were in the Cities no more than one Biſhop might take care of: And the cuſtom held when times altered the caſe and reaſon of it: And Poſſeſſion and the Deſire to avoid diviſion made it held up by good men. 5. I have at large in my Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy confuted the opinion of appropriating Biſhops to Cities; and ſo did the old Churches that ſet up <hi>Chorepiſcopos.</hi>

Yes, no doubt, after the ſecond Century, and perhaps in two Cities a little before; but in few in the World till towards the fourth Century. 2. This is the ſame man who in the very Sermon which he defendeth ſaid [<hi>p.</hi> 27. <hi>Though when the Churches increaſed the occaſional Meetings were frequent in ſeveral places, yet ſtill there was but one Church, and one Altar, and one Baptiſm, and one Biſhop, with many Presbyters aſſiſting him: And this is ſo very plain in Antiquity, as to the Churches planted by the Apoſtles themſelves in ſeveral parts, that none but a ſtranger to the hiſtory of the Church can ever call it in queſtion.</hi>] But when I told him how this would agree us, and hurt his cauſe, he will quickly fall under his own cenſure, and became [<hi>a ſtranger to the hiſtory of the Church</hi>] aſſerting many Altars in one Church of one Biſhop. This Sermon was written ſince his <hi>Irenicon.</hi> And now he feigneth a diſtinction between [<hi>An Altar taken with particular reſpect to a Biſhop: and for the place at which Chriſtians did communicare.</hi>] But what was the Altar that was taken with particular reſpect to the Biſhop? Was it not the material place of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municn? And ſo the members of the diſtinction are co-incident. Saith <hi>Optatus lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Quid eſt Altare niſi ſedes &amp; corporis &amp; ſanguimis Chriſti?</hi> Each
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97268:65"/>
Church had long but one of theſe. The beſt Altars that were made after the chief Church Altars were not for ordinary communion, but hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary of ſome Martyrs. The truth is, the phraſe of <hi>unum Altare</hi> was taken up when each Church had but one; but to ſet up <hi>Altare contra Altare</hi> continued after to ſignifie <hi>Anti-Churches.</hi> But I have fully anſwered this in my <hi>Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy.</hi> His conjectures from the numbers of Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he may ſee there alſo ſufficiently confuted and in <hi>Ch. Hiſt.</hi> And the odd inſtance of <hi>Theodoret</hi> he doth not at all make cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible by his willing belief of <hi>Metius</hi> and other Popiſh Feigners. And were that Epiſtle genuine a Cypher is eaſily dropt in by Corrupters: It hath need of better authority that ſhall be ſo ſingular from the caſe of all other Churches. And I ſuppoſe he knoweth that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was not a ſimple Biſhoprick, but a Metropolitane Seat, and might have 800 Pariſh Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Yea whereas there were under <hi>Antioch</hi> ſeven Dioceſes, and fifteen Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces or as others ſay thirteen, that yet had many Biſhops under them, as <hi>Seleucia</hi> twenty four. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that were more dependant on <hi>Antioch, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> was one of the eight Provinces or <hi>Metropolis</hi> that were <hi>per ſe ſubſiſtentes:</hi> And therefore when <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſaid how many Churches were under hands, it's like he meant Biſhops Churches and not meer Presbyters, and either a Cypher dropt in corrupted the account (or elſe the Biſhops had but ſingle Congregations; But for my part as the caſe ſo late concerneth me not, ſo I ſee nothing to perſwade me that that Epiſtle is genuine and uncorrupt. But I would not have a Dioceſs which then had many Provinces, or a Province which had many Biſhops Churches, be taken for a ſingle Church.</p>

Therefore this proveth not the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters power of governing it. 2. If this be a part of Government it is the Legiſlative Part or the Executive. The later it is not. The former the Lawyers ſay it is not; King and Parliament only being Legiſlators. But if this be Legiſlation, we deny it to be any of the power of the Keys, in queſtion, which is but to judge who is fit or unfit for Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communion, to Admoniſh, Abſolve or Excommunicate according to Chriſts Law; and is the execution of Chriſts Law, and not the making of new Laws. 3. It is <hi>lis ſub judice</hi> whether the things here named be any part of true lawful Church-Government: Rules of Diſcipline Chriſt hath made enough, except about meer mutable Accidents. Articles of Doctrine man muſt not otherwiſe make, than to declare what he believeth Chriſt hath made. Forms of Divine Service commanded to all others, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles never made, nor that we find appointed any others to make them.

               <p>And though Pope and Prelates have abuſed it to captivate Princes and Nations, the juſt uſe of it (he knoweth) is mentioned by the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, and viſibly recorded in the Canons of the ſeveral ages.

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> What the National Church of <hi>England</hi> is?</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. ACcording to the Doctors Method we come now to the Explication of one of the terms of our Controverſie, ſo long and loudly called for, <hi>viz. what the National Church of</hi> England <hi>is, which we muſt obey, and from which we are ſaid to ſeparate, p.</hi> 287. And the anſwer is ſuch as may tell Dr. <hi>Fulwood</hi> and him, that it's time to give over wondering that I underſtood not what they meant by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Our queſtion is of the Church Policy and Political Form. All writers of Politicks difference a meer <hi>Community,</hi> from a <hi>Political Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi> This is eſſentiated of the two conſtitutive Parts, the <hi>Pars Regens</hi> and <hi>Pars ſubdita:</hi> the former is much like the Soul, and the later the Body. The Ruling Part is called the <hi>Form</hi> by moſt, and the ſorts (<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical, Ariſtocratical, Democratical</hi> or mixt) the <hi>form in Specie,</hi> as the rational or ſenſitive Soul to Animals: But the Relative Form is the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of both in their proper order. Such a body Politick is a Kingdom, a City, a Church in the proper and uſual ſenſe.</p>
               <p>But in a looſe ſenſe many other things may be called a Church. As 1. a Community prepared for a governing Form, not yet received. 2. An occaſional Congregation about Religion (as Priſoners that pray toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Men that meet about a Religious Conſultation or Diſpute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 3. Many Churches as under one Chriſtian Magiſtrate as an accidental Head. 4. Many Churches aſſociated for mutual help and concord, without any governing Head: Either of one Kingdom or of many. 5. Many Churches as meerly agreeing in Judgment and Love, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant parts of the World. None of theſe are Churches <hi>in</hi> the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Senſe, but are equivocally ſo called.</p>
               <p>But Politically. 1. All the Chriſtian World is one Church as formed by their Relation to Chriſt the Head. 2. All ſingle Churches that have Paſtors to guide them in the Eſſentials of the Paſtoral Office, are true Churches, formed by this mutual Relation. Theſe two are undoubted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:97268:70"/>3. The now <hi>Roman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Catholick</hi> Church is one by Uſurpation, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by one Uſurping head.</p>
               <p>4. A Patriarchal Church is one, as Governed by a Patriarch.</p>
               <p>5. A Provincial Church is one as headed by the Metropolitan, or as mixt where Ariſtocratically others are joyned with him.</p>
               <p>6. An Archiepiſcopal or Dioceſan Church that hath particular Churches and Biſhops under it is one as headed by that Dioceſane. (<hi>Jure an injuriâ</hi> I diſpute not.)</p>
               <p>7. A Dioceſane Church of many ſcore or hundred Pariſhes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no <hi>Epiſcopus Gregis,</hi> or true Paſtors and Paſtoral Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, but only half Paſtors and Chappels that are but <hi>partes Eccleſia,</hi> is one, even of the loweſt ſort, in their opinion, as head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that Dioceſane.</p>
               <p>8. A Presbyterian Claſſical Church is one, as headed by the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>9. A Presbyterian National Church is one, as headed by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>10. An Epiſcopal National Church is one, either as headed by one National Biſhop, or elſe by a Synod of Biſhops Ariſtocratical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; or elſe by a Synod of Biſhops and Presbyters Ariſtocratical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. All theſe that are conſtituted of <hi>One Regent</hi> and a <hi>ſubdite Part,</hi> are called Churches in a Political proper ſenſe, and not only equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally.</p>
               <p>Now the Queſtion is, Of which ſort is the <hi>National Church of</hi> England?</p>
               <p>And the Doctor ſaith, <hi>page</hi> 287. 1. <hi>That the Society of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is counted a true Catholick Church, from their Union and Conſent in ſome common things: and ſo is ours, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But <hi>in what common things? Not in one Bible,</hi> for ſo may He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, much leſs in one Liturgy. If it be not a conſent in one Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Head, it makes no proper Church.</p>
               <p>2. He ſuppoſeth an agreement in the ſame Faith, and <hi>under the ſame Government and Diſcipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That's right: But what <hi>Government</hi> is it, <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical?</hi> The firſt is no eſſential part of a proper Church. If it be the later, is it <hi>one in ſpecie</hi> or in <hi>individu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:97268:71"/>He ſaith [<hi>As ſeveral Families make one Kingdom, ſo ſeveral leſſer Churches make one National.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, if that National Church have one Conſtitutive Head as a Family hath: It's no Family without a <hi>Pater</hi> or <hi>Mater Familias.</hi> And no Governed proper Church without Governours; and there is no Governour where there is no ſupreme in his place and kind: For inferiours have all their power from the ſupreme: There is no Univerſal ſupreme but God: but the King is ſubordinately the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme in his Kingdom in reſpect to inferiours, and ſo it is in other Governed Societies.</p>

               <p>2. Many Nations may agree in the ſame Rules of Religion, yea, ſo all Chriſtians do: Doth this conſtitute National Churches?</p>
               <p>3. One Civil Government is of another <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and not eſſential but accidental to a Church, and therefore doth not conſtitute or individuate it: One juſtice of Peace or Mayor in a Chriſtian Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, doth not make it one Pariſh Church. But if this be all your meaning, ſpeak out: we grant <hi>de re</hi> a Chriſtian Kingdom, and contend not <hi>de nomine</hi> if you call it a <hi>Church.</hi>

                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:97268:71"/>§. 4. But <hi>page</hi> 299. He cometh to his plain Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. [<hi>The National Church of</hi> England <hi>diffuſive is the whole Body of Chriſtians in this Nation, conſiſting of Paſtors and People, agreeing in that Faith, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and worſhip which are eſtabliſhed by the Laws of this Realm.</hi>] And now he [<hi>continues his wonder at thoſe who ſo confidently ſay, they cannot tell what we mean by the Church of</hi> England.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, your wonder may increaſe, that I leſs and leſs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, if you did not after tell us better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>1. Is this called the <hi>Church diffuſive</hi> one <hi>Governed body Politick?</hi> If not, it is no Church in the ſenſe in queſtion, and I'le not ſtick with you for an equivocal name.</p>
               <p>2. Do you mean by [<hi>Government agreed in.</hi> 1. The Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. Or the Eccleſiaſtical Government of the particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſeverally. 3. Or one Government of all the National Church?</p>
               <p>1. The firſt makes it no Church in the ſenſe in queſtion.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond makes it no Church, but an Aſſociation of many Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch as a thouſand Independent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Churches may make, or the Churches of many Kingdoms. Many Families Aſſociated are no City or one ruled Society if they agree in no Common Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, but only their ſeveral Family Governours. Many Cities aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated are no Commonwealth if they agree not in one ſupreme power. It's no political body without one common Governour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Natural or Collective, Monarchical, Ariſtocratical or Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</p>
               <p>And what is it of [<hi>Worſhip eſtabliſhed by Law</hi>] that individuates your Church? If all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the Law hath eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>1. Your Church hath oft changed its very being, and may do at every Parliament.</p>
               <p>2. And the Church is ſmall and unknown, if all that differ in any point eſtabliſhed are no parts of it. But if it be <hi>not all</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, who knoweth by this definition what it is, and what is the very matter of your Church. So that here is a definition which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notifieth matter or form.</p>

               <p>3. Doth it die and live again as oft as Parliaments change it? If the corruption of one have been the generation of another, how many Churches of <hi>England</hi> have you had?</p>
               <p>4. The whole Nation did not conſent by Parliament when the Lords and Commons voted down the Biſhops and Liturgy: was there then no National Church?</p>
               <p>5. How ſhall we prove that the whole or half the Nation ever meant to put their conſent into the hand of the Parliament to make a new Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to alter it?</p>

He aſſerts that there is one Catholick viſible Church, and that all particular Churches headed by their particular Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or Paſtors, are parts of the Univerſal Church as a Troop is of an Army, and a City of a Kingdom.—Then it will unavoidably follow, that there muſt be a Catholick viſible Head to a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick viſible Church. And ſo Mr. <hi>Bs:</hi> Conſtitutive Regent part of a Church hath done the Pope a wonderful kindneſs—But there are ſome men in the world that do not attend the advantages they give to Popery, ſo they may but vent their spleen againſt the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But doth not Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſay, that the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church is headed by Chriſt; I grant he doth: But the Question is of the Viſible Church of which particular Churches
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97268:73"/>
are parts: And they being Viſible parts, require a Viſible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive Regent Head,—therefore the whole Viſible Church muſt have likewiſe a Conſtitutive Viſible Regent part—This is to make a Key for Catholicks?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I am glad he ſpeaketh ſo intelligibly, in denying a <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Regent part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> though ſorry that he ſpeaks ſo ill.</p>
               <p>1. When I have written againſt <hi>Johnſon, alias Terrae</hi> the Papiſt, two Books on this ſubject; eſpecially the later fully proving the Catholick Church headed by Chriſt, to be that viſible Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick of which all particulars are members; Can the Reader think I ſhould write it over again, becauſe this Doctor will talk over a little of the ſame with that Prieſt, and take no notice of my proof or anſwer?</p>
               <p>2. Doth he believe that the Kingdoms of the World are not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible parts of God's Univerſal Kingdom? and yet God inviſible?</p>
               <p>3. Dare he ſay that all true Churches are not real parts of Chriſt's Univerſal Church, as a Governed body? and yet are not they viſible? Is it neceſſary then that the Univerſal Head muſt be viſible if the ſubordinate be ſo?</p>
               <p>4. Doth he not perceive that he turneth the Controverſie, from the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of a <hi>Regent head,</hi> to the neceſſity of his viſibility? As if our queſtion had not been, <hi>Which is the Regent part of the Church of</hi> England? <hi>but whether it muſt be viſible?</hi> Is this edifying?</p>
               <p>5. All Chriſtians are agreed that the Univerſal Church is Viſible. 1. In its parts and members on earth, and their profeſſion. 2. In that Chriſt the Head was viſible on earth; 3. And hath left Viſible Univerſal Laws; 4. And hath a Body viſible in Heaven; as the King is to his Courtiers but not to moſt of his Subjects; 5. And will ſhortly viſibly judge all the World. Thus far and no further (ſave as ſeen extraordinarily to <hi>Paul, Stephen, &amp;c.)</hi> is the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Head Viſible. And are we not agreed that this is a real and moſt excellent Political Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that all other Viſible Churches are parts of it? Something beſides ſpleen makes ſome men talk dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly.</p>
               <p>§. 10. But really doth he think that this doth unavoidably ſet up the Pope? Why, firſt is there a word of this that a ſober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian dare deny? or that the Chriſtian World doth not common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſent to? And do the certain Doctrines of the Goſpel and Church ſet up the Pope? Will he turn Papiſt if this be proved,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97268:73"/>
and the Chriſtian World be not deceived? Is this our Champion againſt Popery now? I thought no man but Mr. <hi>Cheny</hi> and ſome odd Papiſts had been of this Opinion? But to Mr. <hi>Cheny</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Johnſon</hi> I have confuted it, and therefore thither refer the Reader. Far be it from me to reſiſt Popery by denying, 1. That Chriſt's Church thus far viſible is one Political body headed by himſelf, 2. Or that all true viſible Churches are parts of it. 3. Or that every Political Governed body is conſtituted of the <hi>Regent and ſubdite parts.</hi> Chriſtians will reject me for the former, and Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans deride me if I hold the laſt.</p>
               <p>§. 11. He proceedeth, [<q>2. The plain reſolution is, that we deny any neceſſity of any ſuch Regent Conſtitutive part, or one formal Eccleſiaſtical Head as eſſential to a National Church: For a National conſent is as ſufficient to make a National Church as an Univerſal conſent to make a Catholick.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No conſent maketh a Catholick Church, but conſenting to one ſupreme Head, Chriſt: But I am glad I underſtand you.</p>
               <p>§ 12. Saith he, [<q>Queſt. By what way this National conſent is to be declared? By the Conſtitutions of this Church the Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops and Presbyters ſummoned by the King's Writ, are to adviſe and declare their judgments in matters of Religion, which received and enacted by Parliament there is as great a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional conſent as to any Law. And all the Biſhops, Miniſters and People make up this National Church.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now we are come to the bottom: And, 1. Our queſtion is of the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the Church, and the Doctor tells us the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> makes it. To <hi>conſult and adviſe and make Laws</hi> are acts of <hi>Adminiſtration,</hi> and follow the <hi>Conſtitution.</hi> Men muſt <hi>have Power</hi> before they <hi>uſe it,</hi> and muſt <hi>be a Church</hi> before they <hi>act <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>2. Yea to <hi>Adviſe</hi> and <hi>Conſult</hi> are not ſo much as acts proper to adminiſtring Government, but belong to thoſe that are no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours alſo.</p>
               <p>3. If they be no Laws till the Parliament make them ſuch, then either the Parliament are your Church Head, or you have none that's Eccleſiaſtical.</p>
               <p>But having your plain Confeſſion that you have no ſuch <hi>Regent part,</hi> and ſo are <hi>no Church Political,</hi> (ſave Civil) but a meer Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ask</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:97268:74"/>§. 13. 1. Why do you pretend that <hi>we are none of the Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or that we vent our ſpleen againſt it or deny it, who deny not Aſſociated Churches in <hi>England</hi> under one Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>2. How unhappily are the Church-Defenders and Conformiſts diſagreed? Read Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> and many ſuch others that take the Church to be a <hi>Governed body Politick</hi> and ſee what they will judg of you?</p>
               <p>3. Are not you and I liker to be of one Church of <hi>England,</hi> who agree <hi>what it is,</hi> than <hi>you and thoſe Biſhops and Doctors</hi> that ſpeak of two different things, and agree not ſo much <hi>as what it is?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Have you not brought your Defence of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to a fair iſſue, by denying that there is any ſuch Church, in the queſtioned political ſenſe?</p>
               <p>5. What made you before talk of being under <hi>one Government?</hi> If you meant only Civil? Is your Governed Church as ſuch only Civil, or a Kingdom only?</p>
               <p>6. Do you not now abſolve all men from the duty of <hi>obeying the Church of</hi> England <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſuch,</hi> and from all guilt of diſobeying them? How can men Govern that are no Governours? and how can we obey them? It's only the Civil power then that we herein diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey.</p>
               <p>If you ſay that all the Biſhops are Governours, and altogether govern the whole; I anſwer, Yes <hi>per partes,</hi> but not as a <hi>whole or Church.</hi> If twenty Families in a Village agree as Maſters and Servants, to go one way as Conſenters, this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maketh no one Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Village. If the Phyſicians of <hi>London</hi> conſent to one Pharmacopeia that maketh them not a body Politick. If twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sea Captains conſent to go one Voyage by one rule, each one is a Governour of his own Ship, but this maketh no Government of the whole. All the Juſtices and Mayors of <hi>England</hi> rule the Kingdom <hi>per partes,</hi> by the ſame Law: But all together make not one Ariſtocracy to Govern the Kingdom as One whole. Unleſs your Biſhops, &amp;c. are United in One <hi>perſona Politica</hi> or <hi>Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> they may rule their ſeveral Churches, but they make not one common Government for the National Church as ſuch. An agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Emperour, <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and other Confederates make not one Kingdom or body Politick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:97268:74"/>7. How can they be Schiſmaticks for diſobeying them that are not their Governours.</p>
               <p>8. How come Diſſenters bound by <hi>Parliament conſent?</hi> If it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was in their minds to truſt them as Conſenters for them? yea and declare their own diſſent, as moſt of the Nation did lately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Prelacy and Liturgy, yea and their choſen repreſentatives? Have ſuch repreſentatives more power to expreſs our conſent than we our ſelves?</p>
               <p>9. You unhappily erre with <hi>Hooker</hi> in your popular Politicks, if you think that the Laws bind us only becauſe we conſent to them by our Repreſentatives, or that as ſuch they make them. Whereas it is as by <hi>Conſenting in the Conſtitution they are made part of the Rullers or Legiſlators,</hi> and not meerly as if <hi>we made the Laws by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. And as to Convocation conſent, how binds it all thoſe that never conſented to them? How is the City of <hi>London</hi> ſo bound to Conform, when they had not one choſen Clerk (but only the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaries) in the Convocation that made us our Conformity (the two choſen by them being refuſed by the Biſhops.)</p>
               <p>11. Will not you paſs for an aſſerter of the Principles of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, that not only ſay, The Keys are given to the whole body, and the Convocation repreſent the People, &amp;c. but alſo that <hi>England</hi> is one Church but by conſent, without conſenting to any one Conſtitutive Regent Church head. The <hi>Independants</hi> are for a National Church meerly by confederacy and conſent, without National Government of it.</p>
               <p>12. You go further from the Epiſcopal Politicks than the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians do: For they make an <hi>Ariſtocratical Regent Part,</hi> but you make none.</p>
               <p>13. I doubt ſome Stateſmen will be angry with you, that ſay there is no power of Church Government in <hi>England,</hi> but from the King as Head (as <hi>Crumpt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:97268:75"/>15. I beſeech you think what you have done againſt the <hi>Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial, Dioceſane</hi> and <hi>Provincial Churches</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> Have none of theſe, have not each of theſe a <hi>Regent Conſtitutive part?</hi> Are none of them true Churches in <hi>ſenſu politico?</hi> You dare not ſay, No. If they are, You have ſaid <hi>that viſible Churches as Parts unavoidably require a viſible Head to the whole</hi> (by which I bring in the Pope, becauſe you think Chriſt will not ſerve the turn:) And do you not ſay that all theſe Churches are parts of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> And if you deny it to have one <hi>Regent part,</hi> do you not then either deſtroy the reſt, or uſe the name <hi>Church</hi> equivocally to theſe ſeveral ſorts ſo heterogeneal?</p>
               <p>16. I pray you tell us, from whom our Arch-biſhops receive their power? If you ſay from the Biſhops, and ſo Inferiours or Equals may give power, why may not Presbyters make Presbyters or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and <hi>generare ſpeciem?</hi> If it muſt come from Superiours, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath none ſuch.</p>
               <p>17. If the Peoples conſent can make a National Church, why may it not make an Independant or Presbyterian Church?</p>
               <p>18. If the Nations conſent, as ſuch make the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it is not made by Legiſlative power of King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>19. Do the Clergy repreſent the King? or is he none of the Church?</p>
               <p>20. How prove you that the Clergy repreſent the Laity in the Convocation?</p>
               <p>21. By your Rule, if divers parties of Chriſtians agree to ſet up divers forms of Church-Government, with mutual forbearance they would be one National Church. And ſo would Epiſcopal, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians and Independants if the Law allowed them all.</p>

               <p>24. If every Law of Order be eſſential to your Church, few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts are of it: If only the true eſſentials, why are not we alſo of it?</p>

But theſe are ſmall diſſents; The ſenſe is the Churches Law and Doctrine, and not the ſound of words in various ſenſes: I have oft ſhewed in how many contrary ſenſes the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> take the 39 Articles, the Liturgy, the words of Subſcription and Declaration, and the Oaths impoſed? How ſhall one know among all theſe, who are, or are not of your <hi>Church?</hi> When you tell us that it is [<hi>Agreeing in the Faith, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Worſhip which is eſtabliſhed by Law</hi>] and then ſpeak ſo hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the need and being of any common Government, ſave the Civil, at all eſtabliſhed over the <hi>Church</hi> as a. <hi>National body,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſtinguiſh any neceſſary parts of <hi>Faith, Government</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>1. If it be only in <hi>Eſſentials,</hi> is there either Confeſſion, Rubrick, Canon, or any Writer that hath told us <hi>which be thoſe,</hi> and <hi>all thoſe,</hi> and only thoſe Eſſentials? I never met with man that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to know them, and therefore never met with man that can thus tell, whether he be of the Church of <hi>England</hi> or not? nor that can tell of others, and who is not?</p>
               <p>2. To ſay it muſt be conſent alſo in the Integrals that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>ad eſſe,</hi> is a contradiction: and is to make Integrals Eſſentials. To ſay that it muſt be conſent in all Laws of <hi>Accidents</hi> alſo, is to make that an eſſential part which is no part. Our looſe confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſputers, when they have loſt the truth in ſuch contradictions, may ſay as Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> doth to me, that I Cavil: But will that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer help down all abſurdities with reaſonable men? It's plain that as the Papiſts Doctrine of defining Church-Members and Chriſtians, by no Eſſential Articles of Faith, but by <hi>Probable Propoſal</hi> of more or leſs doth make their Church inviſible, ſo doth this definition of the Church of <hi>England</hi> by Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> make theirs, and leave us uncertain who is of it. It makes me think what I hear <hi>Oliver</hi> the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper ſaid to a Biſhop that now is (as I am credibly told, [<hi>Doctor how know you that you are a true Miniſter of Chriſt?</hi>] who anſwered him on Mr. <hi>Dodwell's</hi> Principles, [<hi>Becauſe I have received Ordination by uninterrupted ſucceſſive conveyance from true Biſhops, from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles:</hi>] Saith he; <hi>Are you ſure they were all true Biſhops and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion uninterrupted? Doctor will you take your Oath that you are thus a true Miniſter?</hi>] At which when he ſtuck, [<hi>Come, come, Doctor,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there is a ſurer and a nearer way.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Certain I am, that if Agreement in the ſenſe of the 39 Articles, or in all Forms and Ceremonies be neceſſary to conſtitute a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> abundance that ſubſcribe are none, that now go for ſuch: But if not, I pray tell us why ſuch as I alſo are not Members of your Church.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It's not neceſſary to an equivocal ungoverned Church, ſuch as our <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> Aſſociation made: But to a Political Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned Church it is.</p>
               <p>2. Mark here all you that go the Political Church way, that your Doctor accuſeth you more than the Nonconformiſts, even of certain opening the door to Popery. What if I had ſaid ſo by you? Is it ſuch men that thus make you agents for a Pope?</p>
               <p>3. Doth this Political deſcription of Parochial, Dioceſane, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial, Patriarchal Churches, alſo bring in Popery?</p>
               <p>4. Then either our Archbiſhops have no power, or they have it from no ſuperiour, or elſe they infer a Pope.</p>
               <p>5. I again tell the Doctor as I did Mr. <hi>Cheny;</hi> It is diſingenious to ſay this to me, when I have written ſo much againſt <hi>Johnſon</hi> the Prieſt, in my firſt, and ſpecially my ſecond anſwer, which none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth to, without any confutation or notice of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Chriſt's Catholick Church hath himſelf for an Eſſential Head, ſometime viſible on earth, leaving viſible Laws, and now viſible to the Courtiers in Heaven, and coming viſibly to judge all; and there is no other. Indeed if the doctrine of Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> and many ſuch hold, who deny that the power floweth immediately from Chriſts Law or Charter to the Church, and not from the Ordainers or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, who do but <hi>determine of the Receiver and Inveſt him,</hi> then all the Doctors in <hi>England</hi> cannot anſwer the Digreſſion, <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. of the Book called [<hi>The Catholick Hierarchy,</hi>] proving that ſuch a Prelatical ſubordination of Churches, inferreth a Pope: But I have fully ſhewed the vanity of that inference as to us.</p>
               <p>But remember that the Doctor and I are agreed, that [<hi>A Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſenting</hi> in an Aſſociation of particular Churches, may be called
<pb facs="tcp:97268:77"/>
a National Church (equivocally,) Though it can make no Laws un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs its conſent alſo ſet up a Supreme Church-Government. Meet Agreements are not Laws.</p>
               <p>§. 16. He next would make the unwary Reader think that he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth my Queſtion, 1. <hi>What is the ſame Rule that all muſt walk by,</hi> viz. <hi>that the Scriptures are the Foundation of our Faith.—2. But our Church requireth Conformity to the Rules appointed by it agreable to the word of God.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But it ſeems the Scripture then is not the whole rule, but part: the fundamental part. 2. Which did <hi>Paul</hi> mean? Was your Churches Rule then made? 3. Doth your Church require this <hi>ad eſſe,</hi> or but <hi>ad melius eſſe?</hi> If the firſt, all Canon-breakers are diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred? And, is that according to God's word? If the later, why am not I of your Church? 4. But how comes that Church to command and bind, which hath no ſuch Ruling power?</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the Peoples Conſent to the Paſtoral and Church-Relation.</head>
               <p>§. 1. PAge 307. Saith the Dean, [<q>The next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered is the intereſt and power of the People as to the choice of their Paſtors, for want of which great complaints are made,—Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is very tragical on this Argument, and keepeth not within tolerable bounds of diſcretion in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Peoples Cauſe againſt Magiſtrates and Patrons and Laws.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That is tolerable to ſome men, which others cannot bear; Silken ears muſt have ſoft words; <hi>The Land cannot bear all his words,</hi> was an old Complaint: And [<hi>Speak pleaſing things, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy deceit</hi>] was an old Mandate. It's no wonder if that ſort of men, that muſt judg whether our Preaching, and Worſhipping God be tolerable, and muſt write us down the words which we muſt ſay to God in Prayer, or not be tolerated, do alſo think themſelves the meet judges, whether our <hi>indiſcretion be intollerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. But let us try whether he ſtate this Controverſie any more Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically or truly than the reſt, and whether he intimate not hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful though tollerable untruth.</p>
               <p>1. It's a crooked inſinuation, to put the word [<hi>Power</hi>] inſtead of [<hi>Right and Liberty,</hi>] as if [<hi>Power</hi>] of Conſenting in the People, and [<hi>Power of Rulers</hi>] were univocal and not equivocal terms: But this is tolerable: For experience hath convinced me, how little Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical ſtrictneſs is from this Doctor to be expected: I doubt leſt next, as ſome men inſtead of Learning maintain their reputation by deriding it, we may expect ſome ſuch defence of the Doctor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Logick, to prove that he is none of the <hi>Diſputers of this World, who deceive men by vain Philoſophy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And the word [<hi>choice</hi>] inſtead of [<hi>conſent</hi>] is ſomewhat more crooked: For [<hi>choice</hi>] uſually includeth the firſt nominating
<pb facs="tcp:97268:78"/>
Vote; And he knoweth that I pleaded for the neceſſity of no more, than the <hi>Churches conſent,</hi> though it were ſubſequent to the choice of Magiſtrates or Patrons.</p>
               <p>3. But the next is worſe, that [<hi>I plead the Peoples Cauſe againſt Magiſtrates, Patrons and Laws,</hi>] when I do but deſire their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</p>
               <p>§. 2. His repetitions call me tediouſly to repeat the ſtate of the Controverſie (a buſineſs quite below him.)</p>
               <p>I. I Have oft ſaid, that God hath not made either <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> or <hi>People</hi> the Judges who is fit to be, and ſhall be a Miniſter of Chriſt in general; but the ORDAINERS and the PERSON himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct. This is evident, 1. From Scripture Inſtances of all that were Ordained: 2. From the nature of the thing.</p>
               <p>1. Who is ſuppoſed ſo fit to judge as men and Seniors of the ſame Office? Who but Phyſicians are fit to judge who is meet to be a Licenſed Phyſician? And who but Philoſophers judge of Graduates and Profeſſours in Philoſophy?</p>
               <p>2. And no man can make me a Miniſter againſt my will, nor know me to be fit, if I know my ſelf to be unfit.</p>
               <p>§. 3. II. I have oft ſaid that the Supreme Civil Governour is the Judge, <hi>whom he muſt countenance, maintain and tolerate.</hi> The proof is eaſie, 1. Becauſe <hi>to do it</hi> is <hi>his</hi> work; and every man muſt be a diſcerning judge of his own work. 2. Becauſe it is a publick act of Government, and he is the chief publick Judge therein.</p>
               <p>§. 4. III. I have oft ſaid that the Diſpoſal of the Tythes and Temples is in the power of the Prince, and Patron by his grant. But with theſe bounds.</p>
               <p>1. His power is not <hi>Abſolute,</hi> but <hi>Under Chriſt</hi> and limited by him, and therefore he hath no power againſt him, nor to croſs his Laws or to contradict his ends.</p>
               <p>2. If the Tythes and Temples were given only for publick Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Catechumens, or for meer Lecturers, the Magiſtrate muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them to ſuch as are capable of that Office.</p>
               <p>3. If the Tythes and Temples were given for the Paſtors of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the Magiſtrate is bound to give them to ſuch as are lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be ſuch Paſtors, and not by the advantage of his Truſt, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the way of entrance inſtituted by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:97268:78"/>4. However if they were devoted to God, it is God who is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, and it's ſacrilege to alienate them. And an intolerable ill diſpoſal is alienation.</p>
               <p>§. 5. IV. I have oft ſaid, that it being ſuppoſed that their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors gift of Tythes or Glebe and Temples is the reaſon of our common <hi>Patronage</hi> and preſenting power, the will of the dead Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors is to be obſerved, and their gifts given to none but on the termes by them determined: But their gifts are ſuppoſed to be for the Churches good and not againſt it: Nor had they any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on pretenſe of beneficence, to deſtroy, or to take away more than they give: But the Truſting of our Souls Conduct is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of more weight than Tythes and Temples. If Tythes be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to be of Divine Right, all that can be expected is, that if the flock cannot truſt him whom the Patron chuſeth, they let him give his Tythes and Temple to whom he pleaſe, and they will truſt their ſouls with ſuch as they dare, and ſafely may. But if he will chuſe and offer them one whom they can ſafely and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably accept, ſo as Tythes and Temples ſhall preponderate in caſe of ſmall difference in the men, prudence obligeth them to accept of the advantage. The ſame I ſay of the Magiſtrates countenance and approbation. But if the difference be very great, it's better ſtretch our purſes to build new Temples and pay our Paſtors than truſt our ſouls on the Paſtoral Conduct of ignorant, malignant, unfaithful or heretical men.</p>
               <p>§. 6. V. I have oft ſaid, that <hi>mutual conſent</hi> is neceſſary to the being of the relation of <hi>Paſtor</hi> and <hi>Flock.</hi> And though ſometimes the Rulers impoſition, and the Patrons choice, may make it the Peoples duty in prudence to <hi>conſent,</hi> when the good preponderates the hurt, (not elſe) yet <hi>till they conſent,</hi> the <hi>Relation</hi> is not <hi>exiſtent.</hi> As if Children were bound to take Wives and Husbands by the Command and fore choice of Parents, yet it's <hi>no Marriage</hi> till they conſent.</p>
               <p>§. 7. The common objection is from the inconvenience, if the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>parties agree not:</hi> To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>1. The miſchief of the contrary way, is worſe than that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.</p>
               <p>2. There is nothing in this World without inconveniences where all things and perſons and actions are imperfect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:97268:79"/>3. If Parents and Children agree not about their Marriage, it hath great inconveniences; And yet neither <hi>Parents Government,</hi> nor <hi>Childrens conſenting Liberty</hi> muſt be denyed.</p>
               <p>4. In ſo weighty a Caſe, divers Locks and Keys keep the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches treaſure ſafe. Prince, Patron, People and Ordainers, will not ſo often agree on a vile perſon, as any one of them alone may do.</p>
               <p>§. 8. And now judge how Logically, how honeſtly the Doctor hath ſtated the Caſe, and made me <hi>Intolerably indiſcreet and tragical a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Magiſtrates, Patrons and Laws.</hi> And try if you can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what it is inſtead of this, that he would have: I tell him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that <hi>if he deny the neceſſity of the flocks conſent to the mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> he notoriouſly oppoſeth the judgment and practice of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and the Univerſal Church, of Princes, Patriarchs, Prelates, Councils and People, and fights againſt the full ſtream of Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal evidence, for a new crooked way, that would make as many modes of Religion as there are different Princes.</p>
               <p>And here he wonders what he ſaid, that occaſioned <hi>ſuch undecent paſſion.</hi> It ſeems he felt ſome paſſion in reading it, and thought he muſt have the like that wrote it. And ſo let any man obtrude any pernicious thing on the Church, and he can eaſily prove the detector to have <hi>undecent paſſion,</hi> for giving a bad Cauſe its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name.</p>
               <p>§. 9. But he cannot find out the reaſon of my inference, that then <hi>Princes may impoſe what Religion they pleaſe.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not underſtanding, with ſome men, goes for confuting: To put [<hi>Religion</hi>] for the <hi>mode of Religion</hi> is too little a ſlip of his to be inſiſted on. But is not my inference neceſſary? I urged him to tell me, in what Countries, and under what ſort of Princes the Rule holds, that the People muſt not judge whether the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Paſtors be Hereticks, nor refuſe them, if Prince and Patron pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them? He will not be entreated to tell me. I tell him, that if the Rule be univerſal, when a Papiſt, Socinian, Anabaptiſt, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epiſcopal, &amp;c. Prince and Patron preſent men of their own mind, and they are inſtituted, the People muſt take and truſt them as their Paſtors: And is not this to ſet up in all the Churches what modiſh Religion Prince and Patron pleaſe? Is this hard to be underſtood?
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97268:79"/>
Yet he calls this <hi>Railing on him for ſuppoſitions of my own making.</hi> And here he ſteps over to another man.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Before I come to his undertakings, I will repeat anothers <hi>railing and undecent paſſion</hi> againſt his Cauſe; And I deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to note how well the Doctors of the Church of <hi>England</hi> agree; and to learn which of them it is that we muſt believe, both as to Hiſtory and Right. It is Mr. <hi>Herbert Thorndike</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>Forbearance of Penal.</hi> [<q>It is to no purpoſe to talk of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church, to regular Government, without reſtoring the Liberty of chuſing Biſhops and the priviledge of enjoying them, to the Synods, Clergy and People of each Dioceſs. So evident is the right of Synods, Clergy and People in the making of thoſe of whom they conſiſt, and by whom they are to be Governed, that I need make no other reaſon of the neglect of Epiſcopacy, than the neglect of it.</q>]</p>
               <p>Yet theſe two are Doctors of one Church, but we are no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it.</p>
               <p>§. 11. I again ſay that either the Reader hath read the Church Hiſtory and Canons, or not? If not, how can he tell who to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that report them? the Doctor or me? But if he have, I will no more diſpute this Caſe with him, than I would do whether <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Parliaments uſed to make Laws. He is paſt my conviction if he be not convinced.</p>
               <p>§. 12. And I will again ſay, that I will yet ſuppoſe the Doctor ſo humble as to acknowledge himſelf much inferiour to <hi>Paulus ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi ſervita venerunt,</hi> in point of Church Hiſtory: At leaſt I ſay to the Reader, peruſe what he hath ſaid of this Controverſie and of the alteration of Church Government in his Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and his Book of Church Benefices, lately tranſlated by Dr. <hi>Denton,</hi> and doubt if you can.</p>
               <p>§. 13. And in general I add: I. I ſuppoſe no man of ſuch read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maketh any doubt of the firſt 300 years, whether any Biſhops were made over any Church without the free Election or Conſent of the Flocks and the whole Clergy, and the approbation of the Ordainers. I will not for ſhame ſtay to prove this, having ſaid ſo
<pb facs="tcp:97268:80"/>
much of it in my firſt <hi>Plea for Peace,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopal Church Hiſtory,</hi> which are unanſwered.</p>
               <p>II. And ſince the firſt 300 years, it's ſo notorious in Hiſtory that it's a ſhame to need proof of it, that the Chriſtian Emperours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Churches in this right and uſe, and for many hundred years after, permitted and ordered, that Biſhops ſhould be choſen by the People, Clergy and Synods, and when the Peoples Election was infringed, the neceſſity of their conſent long continued: And it was only in the choice of the five Patriarchs that the Emperours uſed to meddle, and that not always, nor at all chuſing them alone, but commending ſome one to the People and Clergy to chuſe, or confirming ſome one that they had nominated. And this held on till Popery ſprung up.</p>
               <p>III. And even then the Popes long continued it: But, 1. They ſtrove (ſpecially in <hi>Hildebrand's</hi> days and after) againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours negative voice in the confirmation of Popes, 2. And his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative in Inveſting Biſhops: But even in this ſtrife, the Election was confeſt to be in the Clergy, the People chuſing or freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, and no man to be made their Biſhop againſt their will; and it was but the Inveſtiture <hi>per b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>culum &amp; annulum,</hi> as a confirmation which the Emperours claimed.</p>
               <p>§. 14. I have formerly named elder Teſtimonies not denied: I will now recite but ſome Canons of Councils.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>9th</hi> and <hi>10th</hi> Canons of the firſt great <hi>Nicene</hi> Council nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieth the very Ordination of ſcandalous uncapable men: And in the <hi>Arab. Can. 4. Si populo placebit,</hi> is made a condition of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal relation. And <hi>c.</hi> 5. in caſe of the Peoples diſagreement, the ſaid People muſt take the moſt blameleſs.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Roman</hi> Council ſaid to be under <hi>Silveſter</hi> of 275 Biſhops ſaith, [<hi>No Biſhop ſhall Ordain any Clerke, niſi cum omni adunatâ Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia,</hi> but with all the Church united. If this Council be not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the very forgers ſhew the Antiquity of the Churches right and cuſtom.</p>
               <p>3. I before named a Council at <hi>Capua</hi> that decreed that the two Biſhops at <hi>Antioch</hi> choſen by their two Churches, ſhould live in Love and Peace.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Chryſoſtom's</hi> Church of <hi>Joannites</hi> would rather ſeparate than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their choſen Biſhop or his honour, though Emperour, Council and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97268:80"/>
Patriarch was againſt him: and though <hi>Cyril Alex.</hi> wrote that their breach of Canons was intolerable, and to tolerate them (a few ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Nonconformiſts) would but diſcourage the obedient.</p>
               <p>5. Even the famous Pope <hi>Caeleſtine</hi> who helpt <hi>Auſtin</hi> againſt the <hi>Pelagians</hi> Decreed [<hi>Let no man be given a Biſhop to the unwilling: Let the ſenſe and deſire of the Clergy, the Laity, and Magiſtracy (ordinis) be required</hi> (or neceſſary.)]</p>
               <p>6. How the people depoſed <hi>Theodoſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Synada</hi> and choſe another and the change approved, I have elſewhere ſhewed.</p>
               <p>7. After <hi>Atticus</hi> death the Clergy at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were for <hi>Philip</hi> or <hi>Proclus,</hi> but the people choſe <hi>Siſinnius</hi> and prevailed.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Siſinnius</hi> ſent <hi>Proclus</hi> to be Biſhop at <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> but the people refuſed him and choſe another.</p>
               <p>9. The <hi>Orleance</hi> Council, <hi>an. 540. Can.</hi> 3. decreeth about <hi>Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Biſhops, Qui praeponendus eſt omnibus ab omnibus eligatur:</hi> as of old, <hi>viz. Let him be choſen by all, who is to be ſet over all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. <hi>An.</hi> 541. The <hi>Concil. Avern.</hi> decree <hi>c. 2. That none ſeek the ſacred Office of a Biſhop by Votes but by merit, nor ſeem to get a Divine Office,</hi> rebus ſed moribus: <hi>and that he aſcend to the top of that eminent dignity by the election of all, and not by the favour of a few: and that in chuſing Prieſts there be the greateſt care, becauſe, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore another Council at <hi>Orleance</hi> decreed that a Biſhop muſt be ordained in his own Church which he muſt overſee.</p>
               <p>11. Another <hi>Orleance</hi> Council decree, <hi>c. 10 That none get a Biſhoprick by gifts or ſeeking, but with the will of the King, by the election of the Clergy and the Lay-people.</hi> And Can. 11. <hi>And as the ancient Canons have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, Let none be made Biſhop to an unwilling People (or without the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples conſent) Nor let the People or the Clergy be inclined to conſent, by the oppreſſion of perſons in power (a thing not lawful to be ſpoken.) But if it be otherwiſe done, let the Biſhop be for ever depoſed, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. I have formerly cited Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> I. his expreſs Decrees herein.</p>

which Humane Order overthrew Divine Order and Inſtitutions.</p>
               <p>15. And by the way you may conjecture of the Chuſers by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Toletane, an.</hi> 693. under King <hi>Egica,</hi> where the King Preaching to the Biſhops (as was then needful) decreeth, <hi>That every Pariſh that hath twelve Families have their proper Governour. But if it have leſs than twelve, it ſhall be part of another's charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>16. K. <hi>Pepin</hi> (who advanced the Pope to advance himſelf, and add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sword to Excommunication by miſchievous decree, yet) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered not the common way of Election, and decreeth that every City (like our Corporations) have a Biſhop, and none meddle in another's Dioceſs without his conſent.</p>
               <p>17. The choice of Pope <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the humiliation of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and many ſuch inſtances ſhew that even at <hi>Rome</hi> ſtill the People had the greateſt hand in chuſing the Pope; and that to Communicate with a Biſhop irregularly choſen, was taken for a great ſin. And when <hi>Charles Mag.</hi> was gratified as to the Papal Chair, it was but by making him a neceſſary Confirmer.</p>
               <p>18. The <hi>French</hi> Conſtitutions, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 84. objected about this by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> and <hi>Binius,</hi> ſay, <hi>Not being ignorant of the ſacred Canons, we conſented to the Eccleſiaſtick Orders, to wit, that Biſhops be choſen by the Election of the Clergy and People, according to the Statutes of the Canons, out of their own Dioceſs, without reſpect of perſons or rewards, for the merit of their life, and their gift of wiſdom, that by example and word they may every way profit thoſe that are under them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>19. The old Canons gathered by Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> and ſent to <hi>Charles Magn.</hi> recorded by <hi>Caniſius,</hi> depoſe a Biſhop, Presbyter or Deacon, guilty of Theft, Fornication or Perjury. And Can. 28. <hi>A Biſhop who obtaineth a Church by the ſecular power, ſhall be depoſed.</hi> And Can. 33. <hi>That no one pray with Hereticks or Schiſmaticks: Ex conc. Sard.</hi> Can. 2. <hi>A Biſhop that by ambition changeth his ſeat, ſhall not have ſo much as Lay Communion at his end: That no Biſhop be above three weeks in another City, nor above two weeks from his own Church.</hi> Can. 17. <hi>A Biſhop contradicted</hi> (by oppoſers) <hi>ſhall not after be ordained or purged by only three Biſhops, but by many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Can. 94. <hi>The people converted from Hereſie by another Biſhop, may be of his flock, without removing their Pariſh dwelling where another is Biſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt the other 80 Canons againſt oppreſſion, as one is, <hi>That no Biſhop judge any Prieſt without the preſence of his Clergy, it being void if not ſo confirmed;</hi> So another is againſt all foreign Judgment, <hi>becauſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97268:82"/>
men muſt be judged by thoſe that are choſen by themſelves and not by ſtrangers. And none of the Clergy muſt be condemned till lawful Accuſers be preſent, and the Accuſed anſwer the Charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>20. The ſecond General Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> though by ſervility they were for Images, held to the old Church-Canons for Elections, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Can.</hi> 3. <q>Every Election of a Biſhop, Prieſt or Deacon, which is made by Magiſtrates, ſhall remain void, by the Canon which ſaith, If any Biſhop uſe the ſecular Magiſtrates, to obtain by them a Church, let him be depoſed and ſeparated, and all that Communicate with him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>How much more ſay theſe than my [<hi>intolerable indiſcretion?</hi>] I fear ſome will think that all this binds them to more ſeparation than I am for.</p>
               <p>The 15 Can. forbids them to have two Churches.</p>
               <p>Can. 4. condemneth thoſe to <hi>Lex talionis,</hi> as unſufferably mad, that faultily drive any from the Miniſtry, and ſegregate them from the Clergy, or ſhut up the Temples, forbidding God's worſhip.</p>
               <p>21. By the way, a Council at <hi>Chalons</hi> under <hi>Charles Magn.</hi> finding ſome Prelates ſetting on foot an Oath of Obedience to them, thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is reported of ſome Brethren (Biſhops) that they force them that they are about to Ordain, to ſwear that they are worthy, and will not do contrary to the Canons, and will be obedient to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop that Ordaineth them, and to the Church in which they are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; which Oath, becauſe it is very dangerous, we all ordain ſhall be forbidden;]</q> which other Councils after repeat, (yet our Biſhops reſt much on ſuch an Oath of obedience to them.)</p>
               <p>22. What the Electing Churches were may be partly conjectured from the <hi>Concil. Regiaticin.</hi> in <hi>Caniſius,</hi> Can. 6. <hi>That the Arch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Presbyters examine every Maſter of a Family particularly, and take account of their Families and lives, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Council at <hi>Soiſons</hi> about 852. (a Presbyter by the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand being Ordained to the Church of <hi>Rhemes</hi> irregularly) Decree, <hi>That they that are made Presbyters without examination by ignorance, or by diſſimulation of the Ordainers, when they are known ſhall be depoſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the</hi> Catholick Church <hi>defendeth that which is irreprehenſible, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>23. <hi>An.</hi> 855. under <hi>Lotharius Rennigius Lugd.</hi> and others, at a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil decreed, (becauſe that bad King had by impoſing corrupted the Clergy) <q>That becauſe Biſhops were ſet over the Cities that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryed, and almoſt ignorant of Letters, and unlike the Apoſtolick pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:97268:83"/>
ſcript, by which means the Eccleſiaſtical vigor is loſt, they will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the King that when a Biſhop was wanting, the Canonical Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Clergy and the People may be permitted, that men of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed knowledg and life, and not illiterate men, blinded by covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may be ſet Biſhops over the Flocks.</q>
               </p>
               <p>24. <hi>An.</hi> 857. Pope <hi>Nic.</hi> 1. is choſen by the Emperour <hi>Ludovicus</hi> conſent, and by All the People. And he ſo far maketh the People ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparating judges, as to decree, <hi>Tit.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <q>That none hear the Maſs of a Prieſt whom he knoweth undoubtedly to have a Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine or ſub-introduced Woman. <hi>And</hi> Can. 2. That by the Canons he cannot have the honour of Prieſthood, that is faln into Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>25. <hi>An.</hi> 1050, (or thereabout) one of the worſt of Popes at a Council at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> was conſtrained to confirm the old Canon; <q>That no man be promoted to Church Government but with the election of the Clerks and the People, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>26. <hi>An.</hi> 1059. Again a <hi>Roman</hi> Council forbidding all men to joyn with a fornicating Prieſt, maketh them ſo far ſeparating judges.</p>
               <p>27. About <hi>An.</hi> 1077. A Council at <hi>Rome</hi> reneweth the Canon, nulling all Ordinations made, <hi>aus pretio, precibus aut obſequio,</hi> or that are not made by the common conſent of Clergy and People; for ſuch enter not by Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>28. From hence the Popes grew to uſurp moſt of the power in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Biſhops to themſelves by degrees, till they got Councils to judg it Hereſie for Emperours to claim ſo much as a confirming inveſtiture. Whence bloody Wars roſe. And it's greatly to be noted that yet theſe Emperours ſuppoſed the Biſhops elected by the Clergy and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and claimed but the ſaid inveſtiture, as is ſeen in the <hi>formula</hi> of Pope <hi>Paſchals</hi> Grant of inveſtitures to them.</p>
               <p>29. When they made Princes Inveſtiture Sacrilege (and entring by them) they ſo far made the People judges of Prieſts and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in a Council at <hi>Benevent. an.</hi> 1087. <hi>ſub Vict.</hi> to decree, <q>That if no Catholick Prieſt be there, it's righter to perſiſt without viſible Communion, and to Communicate inviſibly with the Lord, than by taking it from an Heretick to be ſeparated from God. For what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord hath Chriſt and Belial? And Simoniacks are Infidels.</q>
               </p>
               <p>30. But were good and bad Biſhops in all Ages thus minded, or was it only Popes? I next add that it was one of the Articles charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt <hi>Wickliffe</hi> the Reformer (as before againſt <hi>Wecelo,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned their Excommunications) <hi>That they that give over Preaching or
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:97268:83"/>
hearing Gods word, for mens Excommunications, are Excommunicate, and in the day of judgment ſhall be judged traitors to Chriſt.</hi> Art. 13. in Conc. Conſt.</p>
               <p>Reader, are we not in a hard ſtrait between <hi>Wickliffe</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingflect?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>31. The ſame is one of the Articles againſt <hi>John Hus,</hi> That men muſt not for Excommunications give over preaching. We grant that they mean <hi>unjuſt ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>32. This became one of the great Controverſies with the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> againſt whom one of the four long Orations were made at <hi>Conc. Baſil.</hi> They would never yield that their choſen Miniſters ſhould obey the Silencers.</p>
               <p>33. Laſtly, the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves oft deereed, <hi>That a ſimoniacal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection even of the Pope is plainly null, and conferreth no right or authority to the elected</hi> (though this certainly overthroweth the uninterrupted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own Succeſſion.) And how Popes were elected till the device of Cardinals, is well known.</p>
               <p>§. 15. If all this be not enough to prove the conſtant conſent of the Chriſtian Churches down from the Apoſtles for the neceſſity of the Flocks conſent to the relation of the Biſhop and Paſtors to them, Let him that would have more read all that <hi>Blondel</hi> hath produced, <hi>de jure plebis in regim. Eccleſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 16. I ſhall next prove the ſaid neceſſity from the nature of the thing, the work and benefit, and the common nature, intereſt and reaſon of mankind, if more light will not put out the eyes of ſome unwilling men, that are loth to know what they cannot eaſily be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of.</p>
               <p>And 1. Propriety is in order of nature antecedent to Regiment, which ſuppoſeth it, and is to order the uſe of it for common ſafety and good.</p>
               <p>2. As a mans propriety in his Members, Children, acquiſitions, is antecedent to Regiment, ſo much more in his ſoul which is himſelf.</p>
               <p>3. Nature obligeth all to care for their lives, but yet thoſe muſt ſometime be hazarded for publick good. But the obligation to pleaſe God and obtain Salvation and eſcape Sin and Hell, is ſo great, that no man is to pretend publick good or the will of man againſt it.</p>
               <p>4. Self-government (as to power and obligation) is antecedent to humane publick Government in order of Nature: And publick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment doth not deſtroy it, but regulate it: And therefore is not for deſtruction but for edification.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:97268:84"/>5. The end of Self-government is ſo much to pleaſe God and ſave our Souls, that no man on pretence of publick Government can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige us from this.</p>
               <p>6. God hath in the fifth Commandment, which ſetleth humane Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and obedience, choſen the name of Parents rather than Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe Parents Government is antecedent to Princes, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cannot take it from them, nor diſoblige their Children. But Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government is more natural than Parents, and Parents and Princes muſt help it, but not deſtroy it.</p>
               <p>7. When perſons want natural capacity for Self-government (as Infants and Ideots and mad-men) they are to be governed by force as bruits, being not capable of more.</p>
               <p>8. Family Government being in order next to perſonal, Princes or Biſhops have no right to overthrow it, (at leaſt except in part on ſlaves of whoſe lives they have abſolute power:) If the King impoſe Wives, Servants, and Diet on all his Subjects, they may lawfully chuſe fitter for themſelves if they can; and at leaſt may refuſe unmeet Wives and Servants, and mortal or hurtful Meats and Drinks.</p>
               <p>9. Much more if Princes and Patrons will impoſe on all men, the Biſhops and Paſtors, to whoſe charge, care and Paſtoral conduct they muſt commit their Souls, the people having the neareſt right of choice, and ſtrongeſt obligation, muſt refuſe (as diſcerning Self-governing judges) ſuch whoſe hereſie, negligence, ignorance, malignity, or treachery, is like either apparently to hazard them, or to deprive them of that Paſtoral help which they find needful for them, and they have right to as well as other men.</p>
               <p>10. The gain or loſs is more the Patients than the Impoſers: It is their own Souls that are like to be profited and ſaved by needful helps, or loſt for want of them: And therefore it moſt concerns themſelves, to know what helps they chuſe.</p>
               <p>11. If all the Kings on earth command men to truſt their lives to a Phyſician who they have juſt cauſe to believe, is like to kill them, by ignorance, errour, or treachery, or to a Pilot or Boat-man that is like to drown them, they are not bound to obey ſuch mandates. Yea if they know an able faithful Phyſician that is moſt like to cure them, they may chuſe him before an unknown man, though the King be againſt their choice.</p>
               <p>12. Scripture and experience tell us, that God worketh uſually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the aptitude of means and inſtruments: and learned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Phyſicians cure more than the ignorant, raſh, and ſlothful;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97268:84"/>
and good Scholars make their Pupils more learned than the ignorant do. And skilful, able, experienced holy Paſtors, convert and edifie much more than ignorant and vicious men: And means muſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly be choſen.</p>
               <p>13. If the Paſtoral work skilfully and faithfully done, be needful, it muſt not be neglected whoever forbid it: If it be not needful, what is the Church of <hi>England</hi> good for, more than Infidels, or at leaſt than <hi>Moſcovites?</hi> And for what are they maintained by Tythes, Glebe, and all the dignities, honours and wealth they have? And for what do men ſo much contend for them?</p>
               <p>14. It is natural to generate the like; and for men to do and chuſe as they are, and as their intereſt leadeth them. Chriſt tells us how hard it is for a rich man to be ſaved, and how few ſuch prove good. And the Clergy themſelves do not ſay that all the Patrons in <hi>England</hi> are wiſe and pious: Many Parliaments have by our Church-men been deeply accuſed: And moſt Parliament men, I think, are Patrons: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay, that moſt Patrons not choſen to Parliaments are worſe. Some Preachers complain of Great men for fornication, drunkenneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, idleneſs, yea, Atheiſm or infidelity: If many or any be ſuch, are they like to chuſe ſuch Paſtors as all godly men may truſt in ſo great a Caſe? Or would not ſuch Princes chuſe ſuch Biſhops?</p>
               <p>15. Men are as able and as much obliged now to take heed to whoſe conduct they truſt their Souls, as they were in all former Ages of the Church, forecited.</p>
               <p>16. The Laws and Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> allow all men liberty to chuſe what Church and Paſtor, that Conformeth, they pleaſe; ſo they will but remove their dwellings into the Pariſh which they affect. And in <hi>London</hi> thouſands live as Lodgers, and may eaſily go under whom they will chuſe; And if they like him not, may ſhift as oft as they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>17. Pariſh bounds are of much uſe for Order: But Order is for the thing ordered, and not againſt it: And Pariſh bounds being of humane make, cannot juſtly be preferr'd before the needful edification and ſafety of mens Souls, though ſuch humane Laws bind, where there are no greater obligations againſt them.</p>
               <p>18. The Law of keeping to Pariſh-Churches where we dwell, and the Law that giveth Patrons the choice of all the Paſtors, and Princes of Biſhops, are of the ſame efficient power and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>19. Caſuiſts uſually ſay (even Papiſts that are too much for Papal power) that humane Laws bind not when they are againſt the end,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97268:85"/>
the common good, eſpecially againſt mens ſalvation. And a <hi>Toletan</hi> Council decreeth, <hi>that none of their Canons ſhall be interpreted to bind</hi> ad culpam, <hi>but</hi> ad poenam, <hi>leſt they cauſe mens damnation.</hi> And many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts ſay, that <hi>Penal Laws</hi> bind only to do or ſuffer, and bearing the penalty ſatisfieth them, ſave as to ſcandal.</p>
               <p>20. Yet we ſtill acknowledge all the right in Princes and Patrons before-mentioned, and that Princes are bound to promote Learning and piety, and ſo to ſee that due places, countenance and maintenance encourage faithful Miniſters, and that all the Subjects have meet Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and ſubmit to hear and learn; And that they ſhould reſtrain Hereticks and Soul-betrayers, from the ſacred Office-work; and judg who are to be maintained, and who to be tolerated.</p>
               <p>21. But this power is not abſolute but bounded: And if on the pretence of it, they would betray the Church and ſtarve Souls (like the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Canon that binds all from going to an able Paſtor at the next Pariſh, from an ignorant unpreaching vicious Reader,) men are not bound to obey it, but to provide better for themſelves (unleſs <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> not <hi>formally</hi> for ſome time, when not obeying would do more hurt than good;) or as a man muſt forbear publick aſſemblies in a common Plague-time.</p>
               <p>And ſo much to open the true reaſon of the caſe in hand. And <hi>Paul</hi>'s words to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. tell me, this care is not unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf and to the doctrine, and continue in them; for in doing this thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelf and them that hear thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 17. <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come now to the Doctor's words, who <hi>p.</hi> 312. undertakes to prove, 1. <hi>That the main ground of the peoples Intereſt was founded on the Apoſtles Canon</hi> [<hi>A Biſhop muſt be blameleſs.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The word [<hi>main</hi>] may do him ſervice, but no hurt to my cauſe. [<hi>Main</hi>] ſignifieth not [<hi>Only:</hi>] who doubts but the People were to diſcern the Lives of choſen perſons? But (without coming to the Ballance, among many cauſes which is the <hi>main</hi>) I have proved that there were more; And among others, that Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles bid them <hi>take heed how they hear: beware of falſe Prophets, and their leaven: beware of the conciſion. A man that is an Heretick avoid.—Bid them not good ſpeed: Let no man deceive you,—Thoſe that cauſe diviſions and offences contrary to the doctrine ye have learned, avoid,—from ſuch turn away.</hi>—Is here no more than judging their lives?</p>
               <p>§. 18. Here he cometh to prove this even by <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Epiſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Baſilides:</hi> I muſt not name his dealing with it, leſt he ſay <hi>Irail.</hi> But I may note, 1. that he ſaith, [<hi>the force of what</hi>

Cyprian <hi>ſaith comes at laſt only to this giving Teſtimony.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Only</hi> here is more than <hi>Main</hi> before. And though it was a matter of ſcandal that was before them, and therefore it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if nothing elſe be particularly ſpoken of; yet ſure theſe words ſignifie more than <hi>Teſtimony.</hi> [<hi>By publick judgment and Teſtimony be approved worthy and meet.</hi>] And to be <hi>ſound in the faith, and apt to teach is ſome part of meetneſs.</hi> And [<hi>becauſe they chiefly have power either to chuſe Prieſts that are worthy, or refuſe the unworthy.</hi>] <hi>A chief chuſing power of the worthy is more than a meer teſtimony of fact.</hi> Again, [<hi>that by the ſuffrage of the whole fraternity the Epiſcopacy be delivered to him.</hi>] <hi>Suffrage is more than teſtimony of fact.</hi> And [<hi>All they do ſin who are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the ſacrifice of a prophane and unjuſt Prieſt</hi>] ſignifieth a diſſenting power, or elſe ſeparation were no duty.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith, <hi>This is the ſtrongeſt teſtimony in antiquity for the peoples power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A ſtrange ſaying of ſo good an Hiſtorian, who may eaſily know that the concurrent judgment of all the Churches, their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and their Canons, making the Peoples conſent (and uſually E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection) neceſſary, was a far ſtronger teſtimony than one Epiſtle. But to weaken this he ſaith,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>It was in a caſe where a Biſhop had voluntarily reſigned.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>2. He ſaith [<hi>Another Biſhop was put in his place, not by the power of the people, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This was before ſaid [<hi>that the people might give them power? No.</hi>] As if he would have the Reader think that we hold <hi>the people give the power,</hi> which I have ſo oft diſproved. But it's his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to talk to many men at once, that he may ſay, <hi>ſome of you ſaid it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if diſtinction were not a crime, I would diſtinguiſh between gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the power, and concurring with other Cauſes to give a Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity to the perſon that muſt have it: The peoples conſent is <hi>a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa partialis,</hi> of <hi>capacity</hi> and <hi>receptivity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. But what ſignifie theſe words [<hi>The Ordination of our Collegue</hi> Sabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>by the ſuffrage of the whole fraternity, and by the judgment of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, &amp;c.</hi>] Is not this as much power as we plead for?</p>
               <p>3. Are not you the Author of the Defence of B. <hi>Laud,</hi> and ſay, <hi>That Chriſt gave the Keys to</hi> Peter <hi>as the repreſentative of the whole Church?</hi> And have you now ſaid more againſt me or your ſelf? I am not of that mind.</p>
               <p>3. He ſaith, <hi>They had the judgment of a whole Council for deſerting him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:97268:86"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, for deſerting <hi>them both?</hi> And that Council told them God had fore-determined in his word what men muſt or muſt not be Biſhops, and it was God rather than they that judged it and bound them to obey; and that the power was chiefly in the people to chuſe and refuſe &amp;c.] Did you think you had helpt your cauſe by ſaying, <hi>It was a whole Council that was for what we ſay?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. He ſaith, <hi>It was for Idolatry and blaſphemy by his own confeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Which mean you by [<hi>his</hi>] when they were two? neither of them were otherwiſe Idolaters than as <hi>Libellaticks</hi> (who to ſave their lives ſuffered other men to ſubſcribe their names, thinking it was not their own deed; like ſome that I have heard of, that thought Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity Perjury, &amp;c. but let a Friend bribe an Officer to ſubſcribe their names and give them a Certificate.) And <hi>Baſlides</hi> blaſphemy was in his ſickneſs in terrour of Conſcience and perhaps phrenſie.</p>
               <p>5. He ſaith all St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s proof is, <hi>that the people were moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to give teſtimony of life, &amp;c.</hi> This is anſwered already.</p>
               <p>§. 10. His next is, <hi>The people on this aſſuming the power of Elections, cauſed great diſturbance and diſorders in the Church;</hi> where he goeth over ſome few of the many inſtances, which I have at large recited, at <hi>Antioch, Rome, Alexandria, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. And yet for all theſe diſorders, the Church deprived not the People of their priviledge.</p>
               <p>2. But how fallaciouſly is this urged? I have fully elſewhere open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Reader, how the aſpiring Prelates ſeeking Patriarchates and Biſhopricks became as ſo many Captains at War, and gathered Monks, Clergy and People to ſtrive and fight for them; And now he layeth this on the People? As if the common Souldiers and not the Generals were the cauſe of the War? But of this I have ſaid enough.</p>
               <p>§. 20. He ſaith, <hi>To prevent this many Biſhops were made without the choice of the People, and Canons made to regulate Elections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Craſtily ſaid! He ſaith not [<hi>without the conſent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>] but [<hi>the Election.</hi>] And he ſaith not that the Canons took away either <hi>conſenting</hi> or <hi>electing</hi> ſuffrages, but that they <hi>regulated them:</hi> Yes, they over and over confirmed them.</p>
               <p>§. 21. He ſaith, <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> Alexandria <hi>the Election belonged to the twelve Presbyters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are hard put to it when they are put to fly to that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony which maketh Presbyters the makers of Biſhops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Eutychius Alexand.</hi> tell you that the Presbyters choſe and made the Biſhops as the Army doth a General: which made Arch-Biſhop
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97268:86"/>
                  <hi>Uſher</hi> tell King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, That the Presbyters at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> did more than Ordain Presbyters, for they made Biſhops (as he told me himſelf.) But 1. We never denied that the Com-provincial Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ordinarily afterwards Ordained them, 2. Nor that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters choſe them. Did the Doctor think this was to the purpoſe? But 1. Doth he think that the Presbyters <hi>choice</hi> excludeth the Peoples when it is a known thing that the Canons and Cuſtom conſtantly conjoyned them?</p>
               <p>2. Will he conclude that when ever Hiſtory nameth not the Peoples choice, they are left out?</p>
               <p>3. Will he perſwade us when the People are not the chuſers, that they are not neceſſarily the conſenters or refuſers?</p>
               <p>I will add one more proof to all before-mentioned. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, <hi>ex naturâ rei,</hi> that the Paſtoral Office ſhould be exerciſed on diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters: Therefore their conſent is neceſſary.</p>
               <p>A Patient may be drencht like a Horſe, and cram'd like fatted Fowl, and ſo may have a Phyſician againſt his will. But a Soul cannot uſe Paſtoral help unwillingly. 1. He cannot unwillingly be baptized: 2. Nor unwillingly joyn in publick prayer and praiſe with the Church. 3. Nor unwillingly confeſs ſin. 4. Nor unwillingly crave or receive Miniſterial counſel. 5. Nor unwillingly receive the Lords Supper. 6. Nor unwillingly deſire the Paſtors viſitation and prayers in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 7. Nor unwillingly ſeek and receive abſolution, &amp;c. I mean, he can do none of this that doth not conſent. And is he a Paſtor to ſuch men that refuſe all this? It's a ſhame to think that learned men ſhould bend their wits to prove that the Sun is not light.</p>
               <p>Did the Church at <hi>Alexandria</hi> ever after chuſe their Biſhops, and not before? All the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Church-Hiſtory tells us that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there indeed exerciſed too great power, after this, no place on earth more tumultuous and unruly: And yet no place where the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were more ſecular, and more aſſumed the power of the Sword: But the people choſe them.</p>
               <p>4. And if it had been true that the choice lay only and abſolutely on the Presbyters, how came they to have ſo long two Biſhops and two Churches, beſides the <hi>Arians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. And he wiſely overlooketh the Queſtion, who choſe thoſe Preſ byters that were the chuſers of the Biſhop?</p>
               <p>§. 22. He next inſtanceth, <hi>ex Euſeb. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 10. in <hi>Germanion</hi> and <hi>Gordius</hi> Ordained by the Biſhops in <hi>Narciſſus</hi> place at <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. His argument, if any, muſt be this: <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, <hi>the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97268:87"/>
Biſhops Ordained them, not mentioning the peoples conſent or choice:</hi> Ergo, <hi>their conſent or choice was not uſed.</hi> How eaſily might he have known that we would deny the conſequence? Doth any of us deny that the Biſhops were the Ordainers of Biſhops? 2. And even the words of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> confute him, ſaying, <hi>That when</hi> Narciſſus <hi>ſhewed himſelf again, the brethren</hi> (no doubt the Laity) <hi>intreated him to enjoy his Biſhoprick again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 23. His next inſtance is, [Severus <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Milevis, <hi>in his life time appointed his ſucceſſour, acquainting only the Clergy with it: And</hi> Auguſtine <hi>prevented the peoples diſturbance and got them to receive him.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thus it is ſome mens work to confute themſelves. It's a known thing that the peoples right was ſo univerſally and unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably acknowledged, that the Canons forbad any Biſhop to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and chuſe his Succeſſour, leſt it ſhould foreſtall them and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice their choice. And why elſe was the peoples reſiſtance feared? And what did <hi>Auſtin</hi> but perſwade them to conſent? And why doth he mention that the People conſented and received him, if they had no conſenting Vote, or right on juſt cauſe to diſſent? It would be an odd argument to prove, that a woman had no power of choice in Marriage, becauſe one was put to perſwade her to conſent? which proveth the neceſſity of her conſenting.</p>
               <p>§. 24. He next tells us of <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s own nomination of his Succeſſour <hi>Eradius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> More and more againſt himſelf. All that men do is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of miſcarrying by their faultineſs: Wiſe men would do their beſt to prevent this, and the peoples conſent being of neceſſity, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times will pre-engage them; ſo <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s predeceſſour thought it the craftieſt way in his life-time, to take in <hi>Auſtin</hi> for his Coadjutor or fellow Biſhop (two in a City) leſt the people ſhould miſs of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a man: But this being againſt the Canons, <hi>Auſtin</hi> confeſſeth that he did it ignorantly, and diſowneth it. Yet leſt the people (who grew more and more faulty) ſhould miſchuſe, he in his life time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth to them <hi>Eradius,</hi> that their love to him might procure their acceptance. Doth not this prove that their choice or conſent was neceſſary? Reader, if the Doctor can perſwade thee that the Country have not the choice of Parliament men, becauſe ſome are commended or named to them, thy yielding is too eaſie.</p>
               <p>§. 25. The next is the ſtory of <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Novatian</hi> out of <hi>Socrat. l.</hi> 8. (who hath but ſeven) <hi>Paulus</hi> was adviſing his Clergy to chuſe his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour; They told him their fear of their own diſagreement, and to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97268:87"/>
prevent it, intreated him to nominate one. He made them promiſe to ſtand to it, and named <hi>Mercianus</hi> in a ſealed paper. Doth not this inſtance prove, that the Biſhop had not power to chuſe one of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? And was not his fear of the diſagreement of the Clergy? And doth any of this diſprove the peoples conſenting right? And would the Doctor perſwade us that even the <hi>Novatians</hi> excluded them.</p>
               <p>§. 26. He tells us, that the <hi>Greek Canoniſts think that the Council of</hi> Nice <hi>took away all the power of election of Biſhops from the people, and gave it to the Biſhops of the Province.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In all reaſon he ſhould have cited thoſe Canoniſts; for it's ſtrange that yet their following Cuſtoms and Canons ſhould ſay the contrary. 2. There is not a word in the Canon cited about electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but only <hi>ordination</hi> [that all the Biſhops in the Province ſhould Ordain a Biſhop; But when that cannot be, there ſhall be at leaſt three preſent, and three more conſenting by writing.] And what's this to the Caſe the Peoples election or conſent?</p>
               <p>§. 27. Yet he bringeth more againſt himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> Can. 18. <hi>Concil. Antioch.</hi> which is, <hi>That if one be Ordained Biſhop and go not to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, becauſe the people refuſe him, he ſhall have the honour and Office of a Biſhop, not troubling the peace of the Church;</hi>] which plainly ſaith what I have oft ſaid, <hi>That the people have no power to hinder any from being Miniſters or Biſhops indefinitely in the Church Univerſal,</hi> but only to judge whether he ſhall be <hi>theirs:</hi> whereas the Ordainers have power in both caſes; and uſually were the firſt chuſers, though the people had a refuſing or accepting power, as there appeared cauſe.</p>
               <p>§. 28. Next he addeth more for what I plead, that <hi>Baſil</hi> Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one firſt, <hi>perſwades the Senate and People to accept him:</hi> Adding [<hi>Their way then was, if the people did agree on a perſon to be Biſhop, to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the Metropolitan and Synod, who had the full power to allow or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is not this a ſtrong proof that the people had no ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing or chuſing power, becauſe the Metropolitan and Synod alſo had their vote? what need <hi>Baſil</hi> perſwade them to accept him, when they had no power to refuſe? Did <hi>Baſil</hi> or any Synod ſay, all people are bound to accept thoſe whom we chuſe, be they what they will, and not to try them and judge themſelves.</p>
               <p>§. 29. And here I deſire the Reader to remember, 1. That we take the chief truſt to be by Chriſt committed to the Ordainers for taking in fit men, and keeping out the unfit: They being the only Judges (with the perſon himſelf) who ſhall be a Miniſter of Chriſt in the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97268:88"/>
Church Univerſal; And neither Magiſtrate or People have a power to chuſe or refuſe them.</p>
               <p>2. That the Univerſal Church being one body of Chriſt, though Miniſters have not ſuch a charge of each others flocks as the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Biſhops of them have, yet are they bound to give them all the help they can (as neighbour families to help each other:) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to offer to vacant Churches the beſt they know, and perſwade them to accept them, when they are at a loſs or need advice.</p>
               <p>3. The people are bound to reverence the judgment of neighbour Paſtors herein, and not cauſleſly to oppoſe.</p>
               <p>4. When the People have choſen (or they and the Clergy,) if the perſon were not before Ordained, the Ordainers ſtill are judges for their own act.</p>
               <p>5. It was not uſual to Ordain <hi>ſine titulo,</hi> and the Ordainers did two things at once, 1. Judge abſolutely <hi>who ſhall be a Miniſter of Chriſt?</hi> 2. Judge with the Church to which he was Ordained (Elders and People) who was fit for that Church, and ſhould be theirs: And a threefold lock was ſafe.</p>
               <p>6. By all this it appears that all the Doctors talk againſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples unfitneſs to diſcern who are ſound or Heretick, fit or unfit, is to no purpoſe: And that if unmeet men are Miniſters or Biſhops, the fault is ten times more in the Ordainers than in the People: ſeeing it is not the People but the Ordainers that are truſted to take into the Miniſtry indefinitely, but only among many to judg who ſhall be theirs, ſuppoſing them either before Miniſters, or next to be made ſuch by the Ordainers. And doth the Doctor think that the judgment of all parties is not as ſure as of one alone? or that my refuſing a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician is any wrong to his Licenſers or him?</p>
               <p>§. 30. The <hi>Laodicean</hi> Canon cited by him ſpeaketh for me as the reſt: (Did he think I wanted his help to cite more for my ſelf?) Who doubteth that the People being not the ſole judges, if they took in an un-Ordained or un-approved man without the Synods conſent, it was void? (By the way, do either Synods or People (the old chuſers) chuſe our Biſhops or Prieſts?)</p>
               <p>§. 31. Yet more for me, he citeth the <hi>Chalced.</hi> Council, turning out <hi>Baſſianus</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> from <hi>Epheſus,</hi> two men that ſtrove and ſought for the Biſhoprick unto blood in the Church, and both plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they were lawfully called by Clergy, and People, (And yet had the People no right?) But they were both proved to be violent Intruders, and another choſen. And who doubts but a great General Council had the greateſt power then?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:97268:88"/>§. 32. Next he tells us of a Law of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> that made the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and better ſort of Citizens chuſers.</hi> (And indeed <hi>Nazianzene</hi> once wiſht the more religious ſort were chuſers:) but doth not this prove ſtill the peoples power, though ſo long after by an Emperour the poorer were ſo reſtrained? I will not ſtay to ſearch the Book, but take it as he citeth it.</p>
               <p>§. 33. But his next ſeemeth to be downright againſt us, Can. 13. <hi>Conc. Laodic.</hi> But it is not ſo: <hi>Crab</hi> hath two tranſlations: The firſt ſaith, <hi>Quod non ſit permittendum turbis electiones eorum facere qui ſunt ad ſacerdotium provehendi: It is not ſufferable to chuſe by tumults:</hi> ergo, <hi>not for the people to chuſe at all, no nor diſſent.</hi> I deny the conſequence. To forbid diſorder is not to forbid choice or free conſent.</p>
               <p>§. 34. His next proof is <hi>Nic. Conc.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3. which he ſaith, <hi>reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the election only to Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such dealing tells us that Proteſtant Doctors are not to be taken for infallible no more than Papiſts; I cited the Canon before: The doubt is whether it drive us not to more ſeparation than we are willing of, by nullifying our Biſhops and Prieſts calling. It is [<hi>every election of a Biſhop, Prieſt or Deacon, which is made by Magiſtrates, ſhall remain void, by the Canon which ſaith, If any Biſhop uſe the ſecular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to obtain by them a Church, let him be depoſed and ſeparated, and all that communicate with him.</hi>] Doth not the Doctor unhappily chuſe his teſtimonies? Had it not been better to have paſt over this Council? Where now is all the Church of <hi>England</hi> by this Canon, if Biſhops coming in by the King, and Parſons by the Patrons <hi>be all void and null,</hi> and the people <hi>ſeparated</hi> that communicate with them? Such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents are the fate of an ill cauſe. And the next Canon doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their matter, which calleth it madneſs for gain or any affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own, to <hi>drive any from the Miniſtry, or ſegregate one of his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, he ſhall have</hi> Lextalionis, <hi>and his work ſhall fall on his own head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 35. He adds, [<hi>Which was confirmed by following Councils in the</hi> Greek <hi>Church,</hi> as Can. 28. <hi>Conſt.</hi> againſt <hi>Photius, and the people are there excluded with an Anathema, ſo far were popular elections grown out of requeſt in the Eaſtern Empire.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Had this been true, it would not much move me, that theſe two Councils that ſet up <hi>Image-worſhip,</hi> and ſhewed much wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, ſhould contradict the Apoſtolical and Catholick conſtitutions and practice. But, 1. I thank the Biſhops, I am not able to buy the <hi>French</hi> Volumes of the Councils, and therefore what is there I know not: and my own Library is ruined to avoid their Agents di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97268:89"/>
it for my Preaching: And Doctor <hi>James</hi> and others have taught me to prefer the oldeſt Editions of the Councils, and to take heed how I truſt the later and the Jeſuits pretended Manuſcripts. I have now none but <hi>Crab</hi> (who medleth not with this) and <hi>Binnius;</hi> And in <hi>Binnius</hi> there are but 14 Canons in the laſt Action, and 27 in the antecedent <hi>Fragmenta:</hi> and no ſuch thing as a <hi>28th</hi> Canon to be found: Nor is there in the <hi>27th</hi> any ſuch thing as the Doctor ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</p>
               <p>2. But if there were, if it were but the confirmation of the 2. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Canon, it were much againſt the Doctor's cauſe, and nothing for him.</p>
               <p>3. But unhappily here alſo he ſends us to find out much againſt him. For beſides that the <hi>8th</hi> Can. in <hi>Fragm.</hi> condemneth requiring ſubſcriptions to ſtick to the Patriarch (though they were not yet oaths of obedience) the <hi>12th</hi> Canon is indeed the ſame with thoſe forecited, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That the Apoſtolical and Synodical Canons flatly forbidding promotions and conſecrations of Biſhops, by the power and command of Princes, we concordantly define, and ſentence, that if any Biſhop receive the conſecration of ſuch a dignity, by the craft and tyranny of Princes, he ſhall be altogether depoſed, as one that deſired and conſented to have the gift of God by the will of carnal ſenſe, and from men and by men.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe this is the Doctor's Canon which depoſeth all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, unhappily cited.

               </p>
               <p>Here, 1. The Churches will is made the determiner of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Ordination of their proper Biſhop. 2. The Canonical Order is eſtabliſhed (which ever required the Clergies and Peoples conſent.) 3. Nothing of the Laity but acts of Princes power and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is excluded: 4.

               <p>§. 36. His <hi>4th</hi> note is, <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrates did interpoſe in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as they judged expedient.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> An unhappy teſtimony: <hi>Socrates</hi> whom he citeth thus rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, [Alexander <hi>dying commended</hi> Paulus <hi>to the chuſers as the fitteſt; but if they would have a man of proweſs to chuſe</hi> Macedonius:] The people were divided in the choice, and made a greater ſtir than formerly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Orthodox carried it for <hi>Paulus</hi> againſt the Hereticks that were for <hi>Macedonius.

That the people were chuſers, 2. That the Emperour depoſed him not, but by a pack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Council of Biſhops
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97268:90"/>
(which we know had a depoſing power?) 3. That this is Recorded as an Act of two Hereticks, a Prince and Prelate, wronging the Church.</p>
               <p>§. 39. Saith he, [<hi>When</hi> Euſebius <hi>was dead, the Orthodox party again choſe</hi> Paulus, <hi>and</hi> Conſtantius <hi>ſends</hi> Hermogenes <hi>to drive him out by force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I doubt he will next cite <hi>Valens, Genſericus, Hunnericus, &amp;c.</hi> for murdering and perſecuting the Biſhops. Was an <hi>Arians</hi> Tyranny, a note of right?</p>
               <p>2. The ſtory (in <hi>Socrates</hi> cited by him) is this: <hi>Euſeb.</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> being dead, the People again went to the choice, and choſe as before: But ſome were kill'd in the tumult. The <hi>Arian</hi> Emperour ſends <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenes</hi> to force out <hi>Paulus</hi> the choſen Biſhop: The people tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly fight for their Biſhop and priviledge, and ſet <hi>Hermogenes</hi> Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on fire and kill him. The Emperour comes from <hi>Antioch,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merceth the City, and puts <hi>Paul</hi> out, and yet is angry that <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> was choſen by the other part without his advice; but conſenteth to him.</p>
               <p>1. Doth not this ſhew that the people were the chuſers? 2. And even their murderous tumult moved neither an Heretick Prince nor the Biſhops to deny their right of choice. 3. Murder and ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was a fair colour for more ſeverity. 4. Yet all this was by a Heretick noted as an act againſt the Church. 5. And all this was but about a Patriarch, and not an ordinary Biſhop, and that at his Imperial ſeat, where it concerned the Emperours to have moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. 6. And I told you that Princes are the Judges whom they ſhould tolerate, whoever have the choice.</p>
               <p>§. 40. He adds, <hi>When</hi> Athanaſius <hi>was reſtored,</hi> Conſtantius <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it was by the decree of the Synod and by his conſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If he meant here to intimate the excluſion of the peoples conſent or choice, he could ſcarce have named in Hiſtory an inſtance more againſt himſelf, than that of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who thereby was brought in, upheld and oft reſtored. 2. This Hiſtory tells you the <hi>Arian</hi> Emperour was forced to this conſent, to avoid a threatned War from his brother. 3. This was not to make him Biſhop, but to call him to his flock from his baniſhment. 4. And doth not all this confirm what I plead for, as to the Peoples, Synods and Princes ſeveral parts?</p>
               <p>§. 41. <hi>Nectarius</hi> caſe is next, about whom <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> diſagree, but the moſt credible ſay, that the Council named <hi>Nectarius</hi> with ſome
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97268:90"/>
others in a paper, and in honour to an excellent Emperour, bid him take which he would: But all this excluded not the peoples part (who would not have left <hi>Gregory</hi> but by his own requeſt) and were glad to accept one from ſuch a Council and Prince.</p>
               <p>§. 42. Next he ſaith out of <hi>Sozomen, That the People and Clergy choſe</hi> Chryſoſtome, <hi>and</hi> Arcadius <hi>conſented;</hi> and then he affro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>Palladius</hi> denyeth nothing that I plead for, but only tells us of the Emperours premotion and endeavours, (in his Royal City about a Patriarch) to prevent the diviſion of the people: Nor is <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladius</hi> credit to be equalled to <hi>Sozomen</hi>'s herein, much leſs prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. 2. <hi>Socrates</hi> the moſt credible of all in this, ſaith, <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 2. [<hi>It ſeemed good to them to ſend for</hi> John Chryſ.—<hi>Wherefore not long after,</hi> Arcadius <hi>with the general conſent both of Prieſts and People ſent for him.</hi>] And did not the Doctor think I needed help by ſuch Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?</p>
               <p>§. 43. The choice of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> was juſt ſuch another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The people had no reaſon to deny conſent to one out of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nominated by ſo good an Emperour; who was judge whom to tolerate in his Royal City: But both he and they after repented of the choice.</p>
               <p>§. 44. His laſt inſtance is <hi>Theodoſius</hi> getting in <hi>Proclus</hi> before <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus</hi> was buried.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Reader, 1. All this is a good Emperours care about one Patriarch of his own City to avoid diviſion, and nothing to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon choice of Biſhops.</p>
               <p>2. The true caſe <hi>Socrates</hi> (cited) thus deſcribeth: The people were the chuſers: They were for <hi>Proclus;</hi> but ſome adverſaries ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected a Canon, that a Biſhop might not be removed from one Church to another, and he being a Biſhop already they could not have him: <hi>Socrates</hi> pleadeth for the diſpenſableneſs of this Canon; but the people were fain to take <hi>Maximianus.</hi> The Emperour being for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing with that Canon, and gratifying the people that had before declared themſelves for <hi>Proclus,</hi> did not himſelf bring him in, but got <hi>Celeſtine</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to write to <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexand. John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Rufus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> to ſatisfie them to do it; and ſo got <hi>Proclus</hi> in. What is this againſt the peoples right? Theſe be all the Doctor's inſtances on this point.</p>
               <p>§. 45. His <hi>5th</hi> note is, [<hi>On the alteration of the Government of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom there was greater reaſon for the Magiſtrates interpoſing than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97268:91"/>
Becauſe of Princes endowing Churches, the Royal aſſent was fit,—though a Biſhop was choſen by the Clergy and People.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who would ſtrive againſt ſo friendly a diſputer, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on to ſay the ſame as I? when I doubt his party will ſay that he Prevaricateth.</p>
               <p>§. 46. But he ſaith, <hi>The Royal power overthrowing the Papal, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the power of nomination of Biſhops as part of the Prerogative: which being allowed in frequent Parliaments, the conſent of the people is ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up therein, ſince their Acts oblige the whole Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I ſee we yet underſtand not how much of the <hi>Irenicon</hi> is retracted, and whether he yet hold not that no Form of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is of Divine Inſtitution; or we be not bound to be for that which King and Parliament are for. But we undertake to prove the contrary, and have done it.</p>
               <p>2. What if Parliaments gave the King power to chuſe all Folks Wives and Husbands, Phyſicians, Tutors, Diet, Trade, &amp;c. our Right were not ſwallowed up by this, though it were called the King's Prerogative. Much leſs where Gods Inſtitution and the very Law of Nature have foreſtalled them, and neither God nor Man gave them that ſwallowing power.</p>
               <p>3. I oft anſwered, that Tythes and Temples may be more in the Magiſtrates power, than Paſtoral relation and power of the Keys.</p>
               <p>§. 47. He ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 326. <hi>That the inferiour right of Patronage is juſtly thought to bear equal date with the ſettlement of Chriſtianity in peace and quietneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It was ſcarce ever ſetled in peace and quietneſs to this day: Much leſs during the <hi>Saxons</hi> Heptarchy. 2. I have proved that the Univerſal Church was far from making Lay Patrons the chuſers. 3. It is leſs lawful to ſell our Souls into ſlavery than our bodies: And if our Anceſtors had ſaid to ſome rich men, <hi>You ſhall all chuſe our Paſtors and we will ſtand to your choice, if you will build us Temples and give them Lands;</hi> it would no more bind us to ſtand to their bargain, than if they had ſaid, <hi>Give us Houſe and Land, and you ſhall chuſe our Diet, Wives, Phyſicians, &amp;c.</hi> we ſay if your kindneſs be turned to our hurt, take your <hi>houſe</hi> and <hi>land,</hi> or give it to whom you will: <hi>we will not ſell our ſouls and Church-rights at ſuch a price.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 48. His <hi>6th</hi> concluſion is, <hi>That things being thus ſetled—there is no ground for the people to reſume the liberty of Elections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I need not over and over repeat the anſwer to his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 2. If the liberty of <hi>Election</hi> be not reſumed (which was not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97268:91"/>
that which I pleaded for, as he would all along inſinuate) yet the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty o<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>free conſent</hi> or <hi>refuſal</hi> may be neceſſary.</p>
               <p>§. 49. Reader, again, the true caſe is like this following: <hi>Parents</hi> have a ruling power to chuſe Wives and Husbands for their Children: Guardians have much power over Orphans in it. <note place="margin">☜</note> Magiſtrates may make Laws to reſtrain unlawful Marriages. Children are bound in theſe caſes to obey Parents, unleſs they chuſe to their apparent hurt or danger; and to obey Guardians and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in their proper Laws. But 1: It is for all this no Marriage till both parties conſent. 2. And all the ſaid power over them is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, and but directive and not deſtructive to their own conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power.</p>
               <p>Even ſo in our caſe; 1. The Ordainers are the firſt Judges, and have a power like Parents, and none ſhould be received againſt their wills, unleſs they would betray the Church. 2. The Magiſtrates may make ordering reſtraining Laws, that no unworthy perſon ſhall be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated: 3. A limited power of nomination may be left to Patrons, as Guardians, who have power to help the Churches, but none to hurt; much leſs to ruine them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. But it is not a Church related as Paſtor and Flock, till both conſent. Theſe things are evident truth, though ſome would bury it in a heap of words.</p>
               <p>§. 50. I would alſo if I could have drawn the Doctor to reſolve me this doubt; <hi>Whether the power of Parents and Husbands, or of Patrons, yea or Princes be greater, in the choice of Food, Phyſick, and ſo of a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, a Paſtor or a particular Church Communion.</hi> And if a <hi>Parent</hi> or <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> ſay, I command you to hear and Communicate with ſuch a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor and Congregation, and the Patron ſay the contrary, yea, or the Prince or Law, which is to be obeyed? And to whom this Family Government moſt belongeth? And why Father and Mother rather than Prince and Prieſts are named in the Fifth Commandment?</p>
               <p>§. 51. <hi>p.</hi> 329. He reciteth my reaſons, why Parliaments cannot take away our free Receptive conſent, and he again feigneth that I ſay all this for the peoples <hi>chuſing power,</hi> yet confeſſeth I deny not the Magiſtrates or Patrons power of their own Gift. (The Caſe of Sacrilege I leave to their Conſciences.)</p>
               <p>§. 52. <hi>p.</hi> 330. But ſaith he, <hi>Anabaptiſts, Quakers, and all may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a care of their Souls, and ſo leave the Miniſter only the Temple and Tythes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. And <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> will have a care of their Souls, when you have ſaid and done all you can againſt it: A priſon will not overcome it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:97268:92"/>2. So <hi>Turks, Socinians, Papiſts,</hi> (or <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> if you will) when they get into power, may pretend that they are fitter to be truſted with mens Souls, than men with their own: And ſo Prelates may ſay: But is nothing true that men can abuſe and miſapply?</p>
               <p>And to me it is ſomething, though it ſhould be nothing to you, 1. That nature obligeth and diſpoſeth every man more to care for his own ſoul, than it doth the Patron to care for others. 2. That many hundred or thouſand men are not all ſo like to miſtake and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about their own Souls, as one Patron is that is far from their hearts. 3. That it is a matter more dangerous to truſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thouſands in one hand than in many (as it would be in a ſtorm to put all into one boat.) If that man miſcarry he endangereth multitudes: If another man miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry it is but for one.</p>
               <p>3. To have a ſelf-ſaving power, and to have a ſelf-deſtroying power, differ (with men that hate not diſtinction.) So little can a man know what we ſay by this Doctors Anſwers, that a ſtranger would think by him that we were quite of another mind. I never ſaid <hi>Quakers</hi> or any others may have whom they will: If they chuſe men uncapable, the neighbour Biſhops or the Clergy may admoniſh them, and renounce his Communion; And the Magiſtrate may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain him and refuſe to tolerate an intolerable man: And yet the people ought not to accept an uncapable man offered by Biſhops or Patrons; no nor a man next to uncapable when they need and may have much better. Many Negatives are ſafe.</p>
               <p>§. 53. He ſaith, <hi>The prophane have right to their own ſouls, and to the care of them, and therefore are equally concerned with others</hi> (to chuſe.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is ſad with the Church when they need to be ſaved from ſuch reaſonings of their great Teachers.</p>
               <p>1. A Right to care for their Souls giveth no man right to chuſe men for others Souls, to do that which they will not have done for their own. The queſtion is, whether that man will Communicate with the Church on Chriſts terms? He refuſeth and will not (elſe he ought not to be refuſed.) And ſhall he that refuſeth Communion chuſe one to give it others, becauſe he hath a Soul himſelf? Had the neighbour Heathens and Hereticks of old power to chuſe Biſhops for the Church, while they refuſed to be of the Church themſelves? Shall he that will not be of the Society chuſe for the Society?</p>
               <p>2. We diſtinguiſh between what a man may be forced to, and what not. He may not be forced to the great gift of Sacramental Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97268:92"/>
and Communion, becauſe no unwilling perſon hath right to it: But an ignorant perſon may be forced as a <hi>Catechumen</hi> or <hi>hearer,</hi> to hear what can be ſaid for his conviction: For truth may conquer the unwilling. But none on this pretenſe can hinder the Church from hearing its own Paſtors, nor force men to be the ordinary Auditors of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, Hereticks or Heathens.</p>
               <p>§. 54. <hi>p.</hi> 331. He again tragically exclaims of me, on the old falſe ſuppoſition, that I make the people the ſole chuſers, and not only plead for their free Negative Vote (though chuſing alſo, but not alone, was the old way;) And here tells us of the tumults that would follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. So they would if the people choſe in <hi>France, Spain, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly:</hi> And yet I would they did. No humane actions are free from inconveniencies; which are not to be cured with a miſchief.</p>
               <p>2. Let him name me ten places that have ſuffered ſo deeply by the peoples choice, as I can tell him of ten thouſand that have done by the choice of Prelates, Patrons and Princes, and I will confeſs my errour. It was not by the peoples choice that all preaching was put down in <hi>Moſcovy:</hi> It is not the people that have this many hundred years choſen all the Popiſh Biſhops, Maſs-prieſts, &amp;c. in <hi>Italy,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, even in <hi>Spain, France, Bavaria, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. I told him, but had no anſwer, that not only the Innes of Court, but alſo <hi>Black fryars, Aldermanbury,</hi> and ſuch other places as have choſen their own Teachers, have (peaceably) had as happy a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Learned, Godly, able Paſtors, as any place in <hi>London</hi> or in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. It's known by experience that Learning and great worth doth as Light ſo reveal it ſelf to humane nature, that uſually moſt of thoſe that are loth to be holy themſelves, would have a Saint and an able man.</p>
               <p>5. Doth he think in his Conſcience that all the Patrons in <hi>England</hi> are liker to be judicious, and free from ſolicitations, favour and reſpect of perſons, than the majority of the Communicants of ſuch Churches?</p>
               <p>6. If the Parſons firſt admit great numbers of profane, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men to be Communicants, and then tell us how unfit theſe men are to chuſe: they do but condemn themſelves.</p>
               <p>§. 55. <hi>p.</hi> 333. He tells us we do but ſay, <hi>We judge, we think, &amp;c. the things unlawful, but for particular arguments to prove them unlawful, he finds none.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this be true, then they that never found our arguments never anſwered them. (If it be not true, it is not well.) Then you here, and Mr. <hi>Falkener, Fulwood, Durel, &amp;c.</hi> have not yet anſwered any of our arguments. Remember this.</p>
               <p>2. Though I did not argue, but name the things in my firſt Plea, you and others took it for arguing; and we ever craved leave to do it.</p>
               <p>3. Is it true indeed, that there are no arguments, in our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, 1660. and 1661. with the Biſhops, nor any in my Book of Concord, or Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy, nor in my old Diſputations of Church-Government, nor in any other mens Books theſe eighteen years? I doubt the angry Biſhops will think that in my Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy there is ſome ſort of Argument; and that my Book againſt Sacril. Deſertion of the Miniſtry hath ſome: and that an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology for our preaching (now in the Preſs) hath ſome. But if there be none, accuſe us of none.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the Impoſed uſe of the Croſs in Baptiſm, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Baptiſm to the refuſers.</head>
               <p>§. 1. PAge 343. He cometh to our [<hi>charge againſt the Church</hi>] (though he never found any Arguments as aforeſaid.)</p>
               <p>And I. Why doth he ſilently balk the chief things which I had named? will this ſatisfie Conſcience? will excuſing ſome things make others lawful?</p>
               <p>II. As to what he ſaith for the Croſs, I have ſo fully anſwered it twice to Mr. <hi>Cheney,</hi> and once to the <hi>Impleader,</hi> that I am loth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat all again. In ſhort, 1. He ſaith the Church intends it not [<hi>for a ſign of Immediate dedication.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. What is the <hi>Medium?</hi> 2. What if it were not Immediate? 3. Can it be more Immediate than in the very preſent dedicating act, to uſe the ſign and expreſſing the dedicating ſignification?—4. The words of the Canon are, [<hi>To dedicate them by that badge to his ſervice, whoſe benefits beſtowed on them in baptiſm the name of the Croſs doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>] And after [<hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>accounteth it an honourable badge whereby the Infant is dedicated to the ſervice of him that dyed on the Croſs.</hi>] And the ſervice is named [Chriſtianity in practice,] to fight under his banner, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. He ſaith, [<hi>In baptizing the Miniſter acts by Authority derived from Chriſt, but at Croſſing he ſpeaks in the name of the Church,</hi> [<hi>We receive this Child, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It's meet it ſhould be ſo, that Chriſt's Sacraments be uſed by Chriſt's Authority, and mens by mens.</p>
               <p>2. But I hope this is but a quibble; and that notwithſtanding the word [<hi>we,</hi>] the Miniſter as Chriſt's Miniſter, and in his name ſaith, [<hi>we receive this child,</hi>] when even the abſolved are to be received by Chriſt firſt, and then by the Church. I will not elſe aggravate the ill conſequences.</p>
               <p>§. 2. He before ſaith, [<hi>Was the Croſs a dedicating ſign to God, or a declarative ſign to men?</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Canon ſaith expreſly twice, [To dedicate them by this badge to his ſervice—] And [an honourable badge whereby the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:97268:94"/>
is dedicated to his Service.] And the Rubrick which we muſt ſubſcribe, refers us to the Canon for the true ſenſe and reaſon of the Croſſing.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Is Baptiſm and the Lords Supper a ſign to God, or to man?</hi> It is a ſign to man for God: God knoweth not by ſigns, but inſtituteth ſigns for humane uſe. It is to dedicate them to God's ſervice.</p>
               <p>§. 3. He ſaith, [<hi>It repreſents the duty and not the Grace.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The words are, [<hi>to his ſervice, whoſe benefits beſtowed on them in baptiſm, the name of the Croſs doth repreſent.</hi>] Are the benefits ſo beſtowed no Graoe? or is Repreſenting no Repreſenting? or ſhall we believe the Doctor againſt the Church? or is this the kind of Conformity that he would teach us, by denying what we ſubſcribe to?</p>
               <p>2. Sure the <hi>Croſs of Chriſt with his dying on it,</hi> expreſt alſo in the words of the Canon, is <hi>Grace.</hi> To repreſent or ſignifie <hi>Chriſt dying on the Croſs</hi> (which are the words and uſe) is immediately to repreſent or ſignifie the very <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Redemption</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>3. To be liſted under Chriſt as the Captain of our Salvation, and to be received into the Congregation of Chriſts flock, to fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his banner, &amp;c. are all great Grace.</p>
               <p>4. The moral operation on the ſoul which the preface of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy aſcribes to the Ceremonies, is <hi>Grace</hi> to be wrought by them.</p>
               <p>5. To make a common ſymbol or badge of Chriſtianity, ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliging as a Covenanting ſign, by which they muſt be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Infidels, and this even at our firſt Covenanting with Chriſt, is to make a Sacrament in the old ſence. What was the Souldiers <hi>Sacramentum Militare</hi> more, from which the Church ſeems to have borrowed the name? The Oath was obliging; The colours or <hi>cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulum</hi> was obliging and a ſignifying badge: The good received was the <hi>honour, relation</hi> and hope of future pay or preferment upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. And is not all this in ours?</p>
               <p>6. If you have wit ſtrong enough to juſtifie all this humane addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chriſts great inſtitution, muſt all men be compelled to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe as you and ſuch others judge, becauſe you think they do not confute you? Who gave you or ſuch others <hi>right</hi> to ſilence, reject from Chriſtendom, &amp;c. all ſuch as are not herein of your mind; even when you deny what your Canon expreſly ſaith?</p>
               <p>§. 4. He ſaith, <hi>It addeth nothing to Baptiſm which is compleat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What's this to our queſtion? <hi>It adds another Sacrament to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97268:94"/>
Baptiſm:</hi> The Lords Supper is another Sacrament of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant added to perfect Baptiſm by Chriſt; and the Croſs by men.</p>
               <p>§. 5. But all the difficulty is thus removed (he thinks) and by the foreſaid quibble of [<hi>I baptize</hi>] and [<hi>we receive.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Difficulties are eaſilier removed with ſome men, than with others.</p>
               <p>1. He dare not ſay that the Miniſter ſpeaks not as from Chriſt, when-ever he ſaith [<hi>we</hi>] in the plural number.</p>
               <p>2. Doubtleſs it is firſt Chriſts act, and then the Churches to <hi>Receive the Baptized into the flock of Chriſt:</hi> And the Miniſter herein firſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſts act and then the Churches.</p>
               <p>3. The words [<hi>we receive</hi>] him, goeth before the Croſſing and is named eſpecially as part of the Miniſtration of Baptiſm, being its immediate effect. And what a dangerous invention is it to ſay that the Miniſter here ſpeaketh not from Chriſt but the Church, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in thoſe dedicated to him?</p>
               <p>4. And he will make us a hard task of it, to know when the Prieſt ſpeaks as God's Miniſter, and when as the peoples Miniſter or mouth?</p>
               <p>§. 6. He brings us the inſtance of one after Baptiſm, <hi>engaging himſelf in the Independent Church Covenant by holding up his hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is ſuppoſed that the Covenant which he mentioneth is not the Covenant of Chriſtianity, but (that ſuppoſed) a conſent or promiſe to live in the relation and duty of a Chriſtian member of that particular flock. And this is much like a Covenant between a Chriſtian Man and Wife, Tutor and Pupil: And as men may make particular contracts, they may make particular ſigns of them, (as is the Ring and taking hands in Marriage; the crowning of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King, &amp;c.) But if you ſuppoſe the Independant Covenant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat alſo and contain the Covenant of Chriſtianity it ſelf as the firſt part, then that which is required is but <hi>ſignified conſent:</hi> And as all Chriſtians renew their conſent at each <hi>Euchariſt Sacramentally,</hi> ſo do they frequently by <hi>word</hi> and <hi>deed,</hi> and all due ſignification of conſent. Nature and Cuſtom of humane converſe have made words and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures ſignifiers of conſent: But Sacraments and ſolemn badges of this nature ſignifie by <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of the inventer or impoſer.</p>
               <p>The ſin lyeth in arrogating Chriſts prerogative, and accuſing his Laws of inſufficiency. If Chriſt (by his act and ſpirit) had not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated one day in ſeven for the Commemoration of his Reſurrection,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97268:95"/>
he had not told us that this is his own work as <hi>Legiſlator.</hi> But now he hath ſeparated one day, if man will make a Law that another day alſo of the week ſhall be ſeparated to the ſame uſe, it is as much as to ſay, 1. <hi>We have authority to make ſuch Laws as Chriſt made.</hi> 2. And to amend his Law by this addition. For if it had been fit to be made, there was the ſame reaſon then for Chriſt to have ſeparated two days.</p>
               <p>So is it in this caſe. If Chriſt had made no Sacraments, we might more have doubted whether he took it for his proper work: But where he hath made two, to make more of the ſame nature, to me ſeemeth too bold: He could have made the Sacrament of the dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Croſs if he would have had it. If our Biſhops ſhould command us to ſay we believe Chriſts reſurrection, or to ſtand up to ſignifie it, to avoid confuſed noiſe, we refuſe it not: But if they would make a Law that none ſhall be Chriſtened that will not let the Prieſt put him into a Coffin or Grave and take him out again to repreſent the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, I think it fafeſt to deny obedience to ſuch arrogant uſurpation.</p>
               <p>§. 7. He confeſſeth, <hi>It belongs to Chriſt only to appoint the means of conveying his own grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have before proved that the Croſs is by this Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as ſuch a means, and named the Grace and conveyance.</p>
               <p>§. 8. He ſaith, [<hi>Though it belong to the King to make the badge or ſymbol of his own ſubjects, yet every Nobleman may give a diſtinct Livery without treaſon.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True: And this opens the Caſe. A badge of the Kings ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects is not the ſame thing, with the badge of a ſubjects ſervant: But the Croſs is not the badge of a humane ſubordinate contract or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation (as City Covenants, or Paſtoral particular contracts, &amp;c.) but of Chriſtianity it ſelf, and of the ſubjects of Chriſt as ſuch.</p>
               <p>§. 9. <hi>p.</hi> 353. He ſaith, <hi>Is our worſhip directed to it or may we kneel before it, as Mr.</hi> B. <hi>allows men may do before a Crucifix?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But if this be not true, or be a deceiving intimation, you ſhould not allow your ſelf to write it. My words are in <hi>Chriſt. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. q.</hi> 113. <hi>p.</hi> 876. When I had named 21 Caſes in which an Image may not be uſed, (and among the reſt, when it is ſcandalous, or tempting to ſuperſtition, &amp;c.) I named many Caſes in which an Image may be uſed; and ſay [<hi>that it is not unlawful to pray before or towards an Image, in a Room where they are placed only for Ornament, &amp;c.</hi>] Is this to ſay, <hi>(worſhip may be directed to it? or that we may kneel before a Crucifix;)</hi> when I had before excepted the Images of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97268:95"/>
God, Chriſt, &amp;c. in worſhip, on ſeveral reaſons? Doth any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant doubt of what I aſſert? My Parlour hath on all four ſides the pictures of our living friends: muſt I not pray in that room be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my face will be ſtill towards ſome of them? Doth he doubt of this? Or is not his citing one half of the words as he doth, to deceive his credulous Reader, if not worſe?</p>
               <p>§. 10. He ſaith, <hi>Kneeling before a Crucifix is lawful to him ſuppoſing the mind be only excited by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A Calumny made up by ſetting together two ſcraps of remote ſentences. 1. Becauſe I ſay it's lawful to pray in a room where pictures (not any) are before me, for meet ornament, therefore he feigns me to ſay, <hi>It's lawful to kneel before a Crucifix.</hi> 2. And elſewhere I ſay, <hi>It is lawful to be excited to a good thought by ſeeing a Deaths-head, or any of Gods works, and ſo it is by ſeeing a Crucifix;</hi> (which no ſober Chriſtian doubts of) he feigns me to make it an exciting ſign to him that kneels before it.</p>
               <p>§. 11. Yea he makes ſo much uſe of his own calumny as <hi>p.</hi> 354. to prove me <hi>ſtrangely partial, Allowing it to be lawful to pray before a Crucifix as a medium excitans, as an object that ſtirs up in us worſhipping affections, and ſo excuſe all Papiſts from Idolatry that profeſs they uſe a Crucifix for no other end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Meer repeated forgery, not becoming his profeſſion. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpake for praying before it, much leſs as an object to ſtir up worſhipping affections: But only that I am not bound to fly at prayer from a room that hath only ornamental pictures; and that as in the <hi>Geneva</hi> Bible there be Hiſtorical pictures, and few but <hi>Turks</hi> are againſt them, it is lawful (I ſay not kneeling before them at prayer, but out of caſes of ſcandal and danger) to be excited by them to good affections, and indeed good affections are worſhipping af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Dare any Chriſtian ſay that it is a ſin to think reverently of God when we ſee his works, or ſee but a picture of Scripture Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory (as <hi>Abraham</hi> offering <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Chriſt dying and riſing, &amp;c.) Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts have ſtill taken them for Lyers that ſaid they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Hiſtorical pictures; and ſhewed it in the <hi>Geneva</hi> Bible. I have ſeen in many pious country Houſes all the ſtory of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> painted over their Tables, and never heard the good uſe of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. But I deſire the Reader to peruſe my words, which he citeth, Queſt. 113. and judge with what honeſty we are accuſed. I there ſay, 1. <hi>It is unlawful to make any Image of God. 4. It is unlawful to make, place or uſe an Image as is like to do more hurt than good, or to tempt to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97268:96"/>
ſin:—And all ſuch Images of creatures as others uſe to give unlawful wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or honour to, when like to tempt others to the like; as among the Papiſts the Image of the Crucifix, the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>and Angels may not be made, placed or uſed ſo as may tempt any to worſhip them ſinfully as they do. 11. It is unlawful to place Images in Churches or in ſecret before our eyes when we are worſhipping God, when it tendeth to corrupt the mind—which is the ordinary effect of Images. 12. It is unlawful to uſe Images ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, as any of the aforeſaid ſinners uſe them, though we do it not with the ſame intent: that is, ſo as in outward appearance is the ſame with their uſe, Becauſe ſo we ſhall diſhonour God as they do, and harden them in ſin: Therefore Images in Churches or in Oratories in thoſe Countries where others uſe them ſinfully, or near ſuch Countries, where the ſame may harden men in their ſin, is evil. 21. I think it unlawful to make an Image or any equal inſtituted ſign to be the publick common ſymbol of the Chriſtian Religion, though but a profeſſing ſign</hi> (as they make the Croſs.)</p>
               <p>Doth this doctrine juſtifie the Papiſts? And <hi>p.</hi> 876. §. 14. I larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove the uſe of a Crucifix (as they do the Croſs in baptiſm) to be unlawful: which he anſwereth not. Is it not conſiſtent with all this that I ſay, [<hi>That it's not unlawful to pray before or towards an Image, in a room where Images are placed only for ornament, and we have no reſpect to them as a medium or object of our worſhip</hi> (<hi>except as by accident</hi> it's made unlawful.) And that (not <hi>kneeling to them,</hi> nor in <hi>prayer,</hi> but, in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient meditation,) <hi>it is lawful ſo to uſe them hiſtorically as to ſtir up in us a worſhipping affection.</hi>] If the Papiſts do no more, no Proteſtant would call them Idolaters for it. But if they uſe them Idolatrouſly, it makes our uſe of them unlawful, when even but outwardly it is like theirs: And ſo I ſay of the Croſs. This is the Doctors zeal againſt Idolatry, that it ſeems would have us all uſed as his Books intimate, till we dare uſe the Tranſient Image of the Croſs much worſe than he maketh the Papiſts to uſe Images and Crucifixes in particular. For to uſe them as a <hi>dedicating common badge of Chriſtianity, in our great Covenant with Chriſt,</hi> is more than to uſe them <hi>hiſtorically</hi> and in <hi>meditation,</hi> or more than to pray in rooms adorned with common pictures. But he knoweth that the Papiſts give more to Images.</p>
               <p>§. 12. Obj. <hi>But what need had you to ſay all this of Images?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That men may underſtand it. I'le tell you that you may ſee the Candor of our accuſers. Dr. <hi>R. Coxe</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> conſulted with <hi>Caſſander</hi> to <hi>have had Images in our Churches. The</hi> Lutherans <hi>ſo uſe them. Our new Church of</hi> England <hi>began to ſet up Crucifixes over Altars,</hi> and to plead more for Church-pictures than heretofore. In 1642. the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97268:96"/>
Parliament ordered the defacing all Images of any Perſon of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Churches or Church-yards, (before the King went from them) Becauſe I read this Order and the Church-warden attempted to obey it, the rabble of drunken ſwearing Journy-men, who were all for Conformity, roſe in a tumult with clubs, ſeeking to kill me and the Churchwardens, and knockt down two Country-men becauſe they were our friends (who carried the hurt to their death:) And the Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clergy were ſo much for them, that one of them indicted me at the Aſſizes, and I was forced to leave the Country. Such rage for Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges tempted ſome religious men that were againſt them, to be more cenſorious againſt the Conformiſts than I would have them, and to run too near the other extream: And after it grew a diſpute whether the <hi>Lutherans</hi> were not Hereticks (of which ſee <hi>Caſpar Streſo.</hi>) The remembrance of all this drew me to ſay all the Truth which I thought uſeful to cure mens over-much cenſuring the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and the new Prelatiſts: And now the thanks they give me is to turn the cenſure on my ſelf for ſaying ſo much to excuſe them.</p>
               <p>Juſt ſo did Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> by me: My religious neighbours ſcrupled Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with their neighbour Prelatiſts, ſaying, All the drunkards and ſwearers and ignorant ungodly people that had no religion, were fierce for Biſhops, Liturgy and Ceremonies, and they durſt not joyn with them while they profaned the Sacrament. I was far from juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them, but to abate their overmuch cenſuring, I told them that in ſome Countries where cuſtome had brought ſome particular ſin from under diſgrace, we could not judge one graceleſs, whoſe whole lives elſe were pious, temperate and juſt, for ſometime committing that particular ſin; and it was hard to ſay how oft this might fall out: As breaking the Lords day in <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> ſome petty Oath in ſome Countries that uſe it, and ſuch like. For this charity to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſts, what doth Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> but turn the charge of favouring ſuch groſs ſin againſt my ſelf, as if I had been compounding it with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs?</p>
               <p>I leave you all therefore hereafter, better to defend your ſelves.</p>
               <p>§. 13. About their <hi>appointing the Croſs to work Grace morally, and that Sacraments work it not phyſically,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I miſrepreſent or miſapply both the Popiſh and Proteſtant doctrine of Sacraments.</hi>] And for the firſt he ſaith, <hi>It overthrows all that I ſay that they all hold that Sacraments work grace,</hi> ex opere operato, <hi>where there is no actual impediment, and it's he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie to ſay, They are bare outward profeſſing ſigns.</hi>]</p>

               <p>But I muſt ſpare the Reader: By this he may underſtand, 1.

To work on the ſoul of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult by repreſentation, ſignification, excitation (as the word doth) is to be an operative moral cauſe or means: And this the Church aſcribeth to it (Pref. to Liturg. &amp;c.) 2.

               </p>
               <p>And now if the Reader will no more believe the Doctor, it is not long of me. If all this be no more than to excommunicate them that [<hi>obſtinately affirm the Ceremonies Antichriſtian, impious, or ſuperſtitious,</hi>] underſtanding them is not poſſible.</p>
               <p>§. 2. But I confeſs they excommunicate not men for ſecret thoughts: We thank them for nothing. It is but for telling their judgment. And Diſſenters may have many occaſions to tell it. The Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion once allowed ſome of us to tell it: The Demands, Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, calumniating Books and Sermons, &amp;c. may call many to it.</p>
               <p>§. 3. He ſaith, <hi>All Excommunication ſuppoſeth precedent Admonition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They ſhould do ſo: The worſe is yours becauſe it doth not ſo: It only alloweth admonition to repent for his reſtoration: which made <hi>M. Anton. Spalatenſis</hi> ſay ſo much againſt it.</p>
               <p>2. If it did oblige you to admoniſh us, as you have done by your Books, you know that this changeth not our judgments: So that to be excommunicate before the admonition and after comes all to one. But indeed when the Law <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicateth, the Law it ſelf is the admonition.</p>
               <p>§. 4. He addeth [<hi>General excommunications though they be</hi> latae ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae, <hi>do not affect the particular perſons till the evidence be notorious, not only of the bare fact, but the contumacy.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Affecting</hi> is a word that ſignifieth what you pleaſe. <hi>Ipſo facto</hi> is [<hi>for and upon the fact proved, without any ſentence of a judge.</hi>] While the <hi>fact</hi> only is thus made the full cauſe, the contumacy need not be proved. It's true, 1. That the <hi>fact</hi> muſt be proved, 2. And then the Law is a ſentence and <hi>Relatively affecteth the perſon as ſentenced;</hi> 3. But no perſons elſe <hi>are obliged to avoid him, till the fact be lawfully publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> But the man is <hi>excommunicate.</hi> And 4. Whether the man that knoweth the Law and his own Fact be not bound himſelf to avoid the Churches Communion, is a great Controverſie: And the plain truth is, If it be a juſt Excommunication, he is bound to forbear
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:97268:99"/>
Communion in obedience to it: (As much as a ſilenced Miniſter is to forbear Preaching.) But if it be a ſentence unjuſt, and injuſtice be not ſo groſs as to nullifie it, ſtill he muſt forbear: But if it be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt as to be invalid, he may Communicate till he be executively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: (As one ſo unjuſtly ſilenced may preach, if he can: for the caſe is much like.)</p>
               <p>The Reader would be diſpleaſed if I ſhould cite him many Caſuiſts in ſo plain a caſe.</p>
               <p>2. But no man doubteth but the General ſentence of the Canon ſpeaketh the ſence of the Church, and doth all that Law-makers can do, before judgment: And the Law is <hi>norma officii &amp; judicii,</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Subject and Judge.</p>
               <p>§. 5. It's true that <hi>Linwood</hi> ſaith, that a <hi>Declaratory ſentence,</hi> that is, <hi>A Declaration that ſuch a man is already ſentenced by the Law,</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to oblige any to the execution of it on others, or the perſon in <hi>foro externo.</hi> But ſtill the Church hath done her part in Legiſlation, to oblige as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>§. 6. He ſaith [<hi>Perſons excommunicate are to be denounced ſo every ſix months, that others may have notice of them.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But are they not excommunicate then, before they are ſo oft denounced, yea or at all, as far as aforeſaid?</p>
               <p>§. 7. He ſaith [<hi>I have fully anſwered my own Objection by ſaying, I am not bound to execute the ſentence on my ſelf.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He would not ſay that he approveth the anſwer: For if he do, he confuteth himſelf, that would have us execute the ſilencing ſentence on our ſelves, and the ſentence againſt publick worſhip in any way but theirs.</p>
               <p>2. My reaſon is, becauſe I take the unjuſt ſentence as invalid: elſe I were bound <hi>in foro interiore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. But ſure the Church at leaſt relaxeth that mans obligation to preſent Communion, by ſhewing her will, if ſhe did not oblige him to withdraw.</p>
               <p>Read over the words of the Canon, and ſee whether they make them not as unintelligible and flexible to what ſenſe they pleaſe, as they do the words of the Act of Uniformity and Liturgy.</p>
               <p>§. 8. As to his two caſes in which the excommunicate may be ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks for not communicating, 1. We queſtion not the firſt: Juſt excommunication excludeth none but the guilty. Here then indeed is the ſtate of our Controverſie. Had he proved that in all the caſes before cited, it is juſt to excommunicate us, he had done ſomewhat, when now for want of it he betrayeth his cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:97268:100"/>2. His <hi>2d.</hi> is [<hi>If they form new Churches.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>Is forming new Churches and not communicating with the old ones all one?</hi> Our preſent queſtion is of the later. So that this great Accuſer ſeemeth plainly to <hi>abſolve</hi> all from being bound to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with them, <hi>who are unjuſtly excommunicate, and gather not new Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. But may not the <hi>unjuſtly excommunicate</hi> that cannot on juſt terms be reſtored, worſhip God in ſome publick Church? Doth ſuch a wicked ſentence bind men to live like Atheiſts till death? or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their right to all God's Ordinances? even many Papiſt Doctors and Councils ſay the contrary. And how elſe do you juſtifie the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt the Papiſts charge of Schiſm?</p>
               <p>§. 9. <hi>p.</hi> 372. He ſtill ſeemeth to think, that [<hi>His own and others reaſonings may change all the truly honeſt Chriſtians in the Land to hold all the things impoſed lawful.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe thoughts of the Biſhops in 1660. and 1661. have brought us all to the paſs that we are at; And if after 20 years ſo great experience of the inefficacy of all their Diſputes, yea and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and after the notice of the nature and different caſes of men, they ſtill truſt to bring us to Concord on theſe terms, diſputing with ſuch men is in vain; The Lord deliver us from them.</p>

               <p>§. 1. PAge 380. He ſaith I [<hi>ſeveral times mention this as one of the grounds of the unlawfulneſs of the peoples joyning in Communion with us: yea as the greateſt objection.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Four places of my writings are cited, and all will teſtifie to him that will read them, the untruth of the Doctors words. This is an unhappy courſe of accuſations: I can find no word of [<hi>The unlawfulneſs of the peoples joyning in Communion with you on this ground.</hi>] On the contrary, I have taught men how to make this very action in them lawful, <hi>viz.</hi> By getting if poſſible credible Sponſors of the old ſort, and agreeing with them to be the Parents Repreſenter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as in his name, or at leaſt but as his ſecond, undertaking the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of the Child if he <hi>die</hi> or <hi>apoſtatize</hi> (which was the old ſort:) and himſelf to be preſent and ſignifie his conſent by geſture, though he may not ſpeak.</p>
               <p>But I have ſhewed, 1. That this muſt be done beſides the Churches order, that hath no ſuch thing. 2. That ſubſcribing to the Churches order herein is unlawful: 3. That the Church which refuſeth the Child lawfully offered, ought not to blame that perſon that cannot or will not make ſuch ſhifts, but getteth another Paſtor to Baptize him whom they ſinfully refuſe.</p>
               <p>But this is not to prove it unlawful to have Communion with you. But it's lawful to uſe better alſo when they can, being thus repulſed by you.</p>
               <p>§. 2. He ſaith [<hi>The Parents are to provide ſuch as are fit to under take that office.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. No one is fit for it as uſed by the Liturgy, but an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopter that taketh the Child for his own; For he undertaketh the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents work. And it's <hi>lis ſub judice,</hi> whether any others undertaking beſides a Parent or Owner can prove the Child to be in the Covenant as offered, and have right to the ſeal and benefits: Atheiſts and Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels Children are unholy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14.</p>

If any were ſit, few Parents can get ſuch, as will underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and deliberately and credibly promiſe them to do all that God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers muſt by the Liturgy undertake. I never knew one in my life that ſeemed to the Parent to mean any ſuch thing, much leſs to do it.</p>
               <p>I have in my younger time been Godfather to three or four: But we before agreed with the Parents to intend no more than to be <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> and the Father to be the Entitler and the undertaker.</p>
               <p>I did in 1640. Baptize two by the Liturgy, (without Croſſing) and never more in 6. or 7. years after, becauſe of the impoſed corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Mr. <hi>Kettilby</hi> the Bookſeller (unleſs his Father had another Child of the ſame name baptized the ſame year) was one: But his Father gave him his name, and promiſed all his own duty, and his Uncle and Aunt ſtanding as Sponſors, we before agreed that they ſhould ſignifie but <hi>Witneſſes</hi> and friendly helpers in caſe of need.</p>
               <p>2. But what if the Parents are <hi>bid provide ſuch?</hi> that is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their own part, nor are they bound to caſt their duty on others.</p>
               <p>§. 3. He ſaith (as to the Childs <hi>Right</hi> to Baptiſm) <hi>that the Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtand</hi> in a threefold capacity, 1. Repreſenting the Parent in offering, 2. Repreſenting the Child in promiſing, 3. In their own as undertakers of his education, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I will not till he confute them repeat my proofs that in the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s ſence the Godfathers are not the Parents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives at all, nor ſpeak in their name.</p>
               <p>2. If they were, then when the Parents both are Atheiſts, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, Hobbiſts, ſcorners at Godlineſs, Hereticks, the Godfathers can repreſent them but as they are, and their own faith entitleth not the Child, becauſe they ſtand in the perſons of Atheiſts, Infidels, &amp;c. your Church doth not like this doctrine.</p>
               <p>3. And as to their repreſenting the Child, <hi>quo jure</hi> is the doubt. It cannot be done without ſome repreſenting power given them. And who gave it them?</p>
               <p>4. And as to the third Perſon (in this multiform thing) the doubt is, whether their undertaking to educate another mans Child be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, while he is bound to do it himſelf? 2. And whether men uſe to be ſerious in ſuch undertakings, which I never knew one perform, nor ſeem to mean it, ſave ſuch as take <hi>poor mens, kinſmens or dead mens chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> to keep as their own. 3. And if it be done without ſerious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, Is it not to make perjury or perfidiouſneſs, and prophane
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97268:101"/>
taking God's name in vain, to be the way of Chriſtening and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with Chriſt in order to ſalvation?</p>
               <p>§. 4. This is a great point, and he doth well to handle it dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently: His explication of it is this, <hi>p.</hi> 382. [1. <hi>The Church hath the power of the Keys,</hi> (True; but not as he and the <hi>Browniſts</hi> ſay, <hi>The whole Church, but only the Paſtors.</hi>)</p>
               <p>[2. <hi>They may baptize capable ſubjects.</hi>] No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>[3. <hi>Infants are capable ſubjects.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But what Infants? All, or ſome? Is this our ſatisfaction? If it be <hi>All Infants,</hi> then how come the Heathens Infants to be baptizable and have right, when the Parents have none? Then how great a deed of charity is it to bring an Army among them to baptize their Children by force? When even <hi>Aquinas</hi> and other Papiſts ſay, that Children may not be baptized againſt the Parents wills.</p>
               <p>I have elſewhere at large proved, 1. That Baptiſm is but the ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Covenant, and the delivering of poſſeſſion by Miniſterial Inveſtiture, and not the firſt gift or condition of our right to Chriſt and his benefits.</p>
               <p>2. That in the Adult faith and Repentance and heart-conſent are the Conditions, which Baptiſm after ſolemnly expreſſeth.</p>
               <p>3. That if a true penitent believing conſenter die without Baptiſm, he is ſaved; and if t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ptized adult die without faith, repentance and heart-conſent, he is damned.</p>
               <p>4. That therefore all the adult muſt have an entitling condition, to give them right, firſt initially, <hi>coram Deo,</hi> to pardon of ſin, and then to be baptized (which ſolemnly delivereth their full right) before they can be lawfully baptized.</p>
               <p>5. That God dealeth not ſo differently with Infants and Adult, as to require conditions of right in the later, and none in the former, as if they were all born with right.</p>
               <p>6. That the Covenant is made to the faithful and their ſeed, and that Infants condition of right is that they be children of believers: And that if both Parents be Infidels, the Children are unclean, but elſe they are holy. And God that confoundeth not the Church and the World, confoundeth not their Childrens caſe.</p>
               <p>This I have fully proved in my Diſp. of Original ſin, and Treat of right to Sacraments.</p>
               <p>7. That Baptiſm ſealeth and delivereth to the qualified ſubject, the preſent pardon of ſin, and right to Chriſt and life as to adopted Children of God. And therefore there muſt be ſome reaſon and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97268:102"/>
proof of a right to it, more than all Infants in the world have.</p>
               <p>8. That it is not a mans bringing them to baptiſm and ſpeaking feignedly in their name, that giveth them right to a ſealed pardon and ſalvation: It muſt be one that can prove himſelf entitled to repreſent the Child, which none can that cannot ſay <hi>He is my own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. If it were otherwiſe, Atheiſts, Infidels, wicked men, though Baptized, could give no right to the ſealed pardon, or to the Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a ſtate of life, to which they have no right themſelves. And if they repreſent no better Parents, as ſuch they can give them no right, ſave <hi>coram Eccleſia</hi> when they are not <hi>infideles judicati.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. Nor doth it ſuffice to an Infants right, that the Miniſter, or Church, be Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Therefore to tell us that <hi>Infants are right ſubjects,</hi> ſignifieth nothing, till either, 1. He tell us what Infants, 2. Or prove that all Infants have right; which he can never do: And if he could, I would eaſily prove that all dying Infants are ſaved, whether Baptized or not; As I can prove that true Chriſtian Infants are.</p>
               <p>§. 5. While he gives us not the leaſt ſatisfaction of Infants Right, he tells us of <hi>difficulties</hi> on the other ſide; if we lay it on Parents (or Owners) right. And 1. He tells us of divers mens Opinions; which the Reader will be loth I ſhould digreſs to try, having done it ſo larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my Chriſt. Direct. and Treat. of <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. He nameth the qualification which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>rt, [<hi>A profeſſion of the Chriſtian faith not invalidated</hi>] and ſaith nothing to diſable it, but that <hi>Others</hi> will reject it. Others wild Opinions named, goes for my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.</p>
               <p>And now I deſire the Reader to ſee the Catalogue of the things we account ſinful in Conformity in my firſt Plea for Peace, and try how many of them the Doctor hath ſo much as meddled with: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he think by theſe few touches he hath proved either our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity lawful, or our Preaching unlawful, or our Communion with thoſe Chriſtians who are not of his mind herein unlawful.</p>
               <p>If he ſay again, that he meddleth not with Miniſters Conformity but the Peoples, 1. Note, how he hath paſſed by even the greateſt things alſo in their caſe. 2. Whether he meddle not with the Miniſters caſe who ſeeketh to prove their preaching unlawful, and ſo perſwades them to be ſilent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. Whether their caſe ſhould not be ſo far meddled with, as to <hi>prove</hi> the things which they think ſinful to be lawful, or their preaching unneceſſary; before the <hi>endeavours</hi> uſed againſt them (well known) be juſtified as needful to the Churches Peace.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Whether he that ſought their judgment did make them underſtand what all our preſent Impoſitions and Acts of Conformity are? and what alterations are made in the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſince the beginning of Biſhop <hi>Lands</hi> power?</p>
               <p>2. Whether he made them truly underſtand the difference between the ancient Epiſcopacy, and the <hi>Engliſh Dioceſan</hi> frame in all its parts?</p>
               <p>3. Whether he did put the Caſe as about Subſcribing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Declaring, Covenanting or Swearing, Aſſent and Conſent to all things, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing accordingly? or only of living in Communion with them which do ſuch things?</p>
               <p>4. Whether he put the caſe as of denying active Communion in the practice of unlawful things; or as denying Communion in the reſt which are lawful?</p>
               <p>5. Whether he made them underſtand that we are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muncate by their Canon for telling our judgment?</p>
               <p>6. Whether he made them underſtand that it was about 2000 Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that were ſilenced, and what men are in many of their places? and what claim their ancient Flocks lay to many of them; and what men they are, and what they did to prevent all our diviſions?</p>
               <p>7. Whether he made them underſtand what meaſure of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we ſtill maintain with the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Pariſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?</p>
               <p>8. Whether he put the caſe to them, whether we that have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them are Schiſmaticks, if we alſo have Communion with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whom they proſecute?</p>
               <p>9. Whether he put the queſtion to them, whether we are lawfully ſilenced? and if not, whether <hi>rebus ſic ſtantibus</hi> we are bound to forbear our Miniſtry?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:97268:103"/>10. Whether he made them know that all the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> as well as we were forbidden to Preach, &amp;c. unleſs they would Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to that we are ready to prove unlawful? And if it prove ſo, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould all either have ſinned or been ſilent in obedience?</p>
               <p>11. Whether he made them underſtand how many thouſands there be in <hi>London</hi> that cannot have room in the Pariſh-Churches and the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts Churches ſet together, but live like Atheiſts.</p>
               <p>12. Whether he acquainted them that the queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all godly diſſenters that are caſt out, or cannot joyn in the Pariſh way of Liturgick Worſhip, muſt (till their judgments change) give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all publick worſhip of God, and be forſaken of all Teachers?</p>
               <p>13. Whether he acquainted them, how loud a Call we had to preach in <hi>London,</hi> firſt by the Plague, &amp; then by the burning of the Churches, the people being deſerted by the Pariſh Miniſters in theſe ſad extremities?</p>
               <p>14. Whether he acquainted them with the Kings Licences, and our being accuſed of Schiſm, even when Licenſed?</p>
               <p>15. Whether he acquainted them with what we have ſaid for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves lately in divers Books; or they judg'd us unheard?</p>
               <p>16. Whether they be ſingular? or whether it be the judgment of the Proteſtant Churches in <hi>France,</hi> that it is a ſin for any to preach or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly worſhip God, when the King, Biſhops and Law forbid them? And if ſo, How long it hath been their judgment? and why all their Churches ceaſed not when prohibited?</p>
               <p>If not ſo, How to know that our ſilencing Laws and Biſhops muſt be obeyed, and not theirs?</p>
               <p>There is no underſtanding their anſwers, till we know how the caſe was ſtated.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Mr. <hi>Clodes</hi> Letter is moderate, and it's like they took the caſe to be about proper ſeparation, and ſo ſay no more in the main than ſome Nonconformiſts have ſaid againſt the <hi>Browniſts.</hi> But the Dr. hath dealt too unmercifully with Mr. <hi>Le Moine</hi> in publiſhing his Epiſtle, when it was ſo eaſie to know how few, if any, would believe his ſtory, but take it for a confirmation, how incredible our accuſers are? I mean his ſtory that [<hi>five years ago he heard one of the moſt famous Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts preach in a place where were three men, and three or fourſcore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: he had choſen a Text about the building up the ruins of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and for explication cited</hi> Plinny <hi>and</hi> Vitruvius <hi>a hundred times, &amp;c.</hi>] I think I ſhall never ſpeak with the perſon that will believe him: ſure I am, <hi>London</hi> knoweth that the Nonconformiſts are the moſt averſe to ſuch kind of Preaching. And I know not one of them that I can ſay ever
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97268:103"/>
read a quarter of <hi>Vitruvius:</hi> I confeſs I never read a leaf of him. This Monſieur would do well to tell us yet the name of the man, that if li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving he may be call'd to account: But I doubt he fell into ſome Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, of which many are erected in place of the burnt Churches, and perhaps heard the Conformiſt who had occaſion to talk of architecture? But yet I will not believe that either Conformiſt or Nonconformiſt would expoſe himſelf to common ſcorn by an hundred or twenty ſuch citations.</p>
               <p>§. 3. And his deſcription of the mens <hi>horrible impudence to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate without mercy the Church, &amp;c. imagining that they are the only men in</hi> England, <hi>nay in the Chriſtian world that are predeſtimated to eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, &amp;c. and then pronouncing them intolerable,</hi> ſheweth that it is not us that he ſpeaketh of, nor any company that is known to us, neither our Separatiſts here, nor Anabaptiſts, nor ſo much as the very Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers holding any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>§. 4. And though he ſaith [<hi>He was not at all edified</hi> by the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts preaching, it followeth not that no others are: Nor that none were edified in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> while publick Preachers went the Nonconformiſts way.</p>
               <p>§. 5. But becauſe the Doctor chuſeth this way, I will imitate him, though with the Apology that St. <hi>Paul</hi> gloried, and give him notice of ſome Epiſtles of men that judged otherwiſe of the Nonconformiſts.</p>

               <p>§. 1.

Yea <hi>Thuanus</hi> giveth a juſter Character of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abroad that were of their mind: And <hi>John Fox</hi> (one of them) of more.</p>
               <p>§. 2. And to our three <hi>French-men,</hi> I will when it will be of more uſe than <hi>ſeeming vanity,</hi> return you four <hi>French-mens</hi> Letters to my ſelf, (Mr. <hi>Gaches,</hi> Mr. <hi>Amyralds,</hi> Mr. <hi>Le Blanks,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Teſtards,</hi> (and if you will ſome <hi>Germans</hi> too, <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans,</hi>) of a quite differing ſenſe of us Nonconformiſts. But Mr. <hi>Gaches</hi> being already in Print (by the Duke of <hi>Lauderdales</hi> means) 1660. and joyned with one of Mr. <hi>L'Angles,</hi> I leave the Reader that deſireth to ſee both.</p>
               <p>§. 3. But becauſe Mr. <hi>Joſ. Glanvile</hi> was one of themſelves here (though an Origeniſt) a moſt triumphant Conformiſt, and not the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleſt contemner of Nonconformiſts, and famous for his great wit, I will repay the Dr. with the annexing one (among many ſince) of his Letters to my ſelf; which yet indeed I do not chiefly to ballance the Drs. but to help the Reader to underſtand Mr. <hi>Glanvile</hi> and his poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humous Book, which I think not meet to paſs by without ſome Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adverſions.</p>
               <p>Though I have great reaſon to hope that dying ſo ſoon after it and his preferment, the experience of the Vanity of a flattering World might help to ſave him from impenitence: As I have read in divers credible writers, it was with Dr. <hi>Matthew Sutliffe;</hi> that on his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97268:104"/>
he repented that he had written ſo much againſt the Reformers called <hi>Puritans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I perceive Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> marvelleth, that my own expectations of approaching Death do not hinder me from writing what I do for the Nonconformiſts; whereas the truth is, had not pain and weakneſs kept me from my youth as in the continual proſpect of the Grave and the next life, I had never been like to have been ſo much againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and the preſent Diſcipline of this Church (that is, their want of Diſcipline) as I have been; For the World might have more flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered me and byaſſed my Judgment, and my Conſcience might have been bolder and leſs fearful of ſin; And, though I love not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe them, I muſt ſay this great truth, that I had never been like to have lived in ſo convincing ſenſible experience of the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the main body of the Conformiſts from the moſt of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts, as to the ſeriouſneſs of their Chriſtian Faith, and hope and practice, their victory over the fleſh and world, &amp;c. I mean both in the Clergy and Laity of mine acquaintance! O how great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence have I found, from my youth to this day? Though I doubt not but very many of the Paſſive Conformable Miniſters (to ſay nothing of the Impoſers) have been and are worthy pious men; and ſuch as would not perſwade their hearers, that the <hi>Jeſuits firſt brought in ſpiritual prayer:</hi> And I had the great bleſſing of my Education near ſome ſuch, in three or four neighbour Pariſhes.</p>
               <p>§. 4. It grieved me to hear of Mr. <hi>Glanvile</hi>'s death, for he was a man of more than ordinary ingeny, and he was about a Collection of Hiſtories of Apparitions, which is a work of great uſe againſt our Sadducees, and to ſtabliſh doubters, and the beſt mans faith hath need of all the helps from ſenſe that we can get: And I feared leſt that work had periſhed with him; But I gladly hear that by the care of Dr. <hi>H. More</hi> (that worthy faithful man of peace, who never ſtudied pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment) it is both preſerved and augmented.</p>
               <p>And as for his Origeniſme, as I like it not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo I confeſs in matters of that nature, I can better bear with the venturouſneſs of diſſenters, than hereticators can do.</p>
               <p>But when I ſaw this Rag called a Letter left behind him, my grief for him was doubled: And I ſaw what cauſe we have all to fear the ſnares of a flattering world, and what cauſe to pray for Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and for an unbyaſſed mind, and a humble ſenſe of our own frailty, that we may neither over-value <hi>proſperity,</hi> nor our own <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:97268:105"/>I did not think that he that had wrote the <hi>Vanity of Dogmatizing</hi> could ſo ſoon have come to perſwade men in power, that diſſenting from our <hi>Churches dogmatizing and impoſed words, formes and ceremonies</hi> was worthy of ſo ſevere a proſecution of us, as he deſcribeth: and that all their danger is from the forbearing ſuch proſecution of us; and that (though for their own ends he could abate us ſome little mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) the only way to ſettled peace is vigorouſly to execute the Laws againſt us.</p>
               <p>He that can think the ſilencing, and impriſoning of about 2000 ſuch Miniſters, is the way to bring this Land to Concord, hath ſure very hard thoughts of them in compariſon of Conformiſts. And that you may ſee how little his judgment againſt ſuch ſhould weigh with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who is ſo lately changed from himſelf, I will give you here one of ſeveral Letters which I had from him, and leave you to judge whether he have proved that he was much wiſer at laſt than when he wrote this? or whether his character of me agree with his motion to ſilence and ruine all ſuch? I am ſo far from owning his monſtrous praiſes, that I fear I offended him with ſharply rebuking him for them. But leſt his wit and virulence here do harm, I give it you to ſhew the unconſtancy of his judgment: or if he would have <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted me</hi> from his ſeverities, I muſt profeſs that <hi>I believe the moſt of the Nonconformable Miniſters of my acquaintance are better men than my ſelf;</hi> and therefore his exceſſive praiſe of me, is the condemnation and ſhame of his perſecuting counſel.</p>
               <p>§. 5. As to his praiſe of the Biſhops Writings againſt Popery, I had rather magnifie than obſcure their deſerts: But I am not able to believe that the old ones who write to prove the Pope Antichriſt, &amp;c. and the new ones who would bring us to obey him as Patriarch of the Weſt and <hi>principium unitatis Catholicae,</hi> were of one mind, becauſe both are called Proteſtants, and that ſuch as Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi> and the reſt of the defenders of <hi>Grotius,</hi> were of the ſame judgment with Biſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Downame, &amp;c.</hi> nor that <hi>Grotius,</hi> who deſcribeth a Papiſt to be <hi>one that flattereth Popes as if all were right which they ſaid and did,</hi> did diſclaim Popery in the ſame ſenſe as the old Church of <hi>England</hi> did. Two men may cry down Popery, while one of them is a Papiſt or near one in the others ſenſe.</p>
               <p>As to the folly of calling that Popery which is not, I have ſaid more againſt it in my Cath. Theologie than he hath done.</p>
               <p>And as to his excuſe of an ignorant vicious ſort of Miniſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no better will take ſmall Livings,] It is not true: The ſilenced
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97268:105"/>
Nonconformiſts would have been glad of them, or to have preached there for nothing: The tolerating of ignorant ſcandalous men were more excuſable, if better were not ſhut out that would have taken ſuch places. But it's notorious that for the intereſt of their faction and proſperity, they had rather have the ignorant and vicious, than the ableſt and moſt laborious Nonconformiſt: Biſhop <hi>Morley</hi> told me, when he forbad me to preach, that <hi>It was better for a place to have none, than to have me;</hi> when I askt him, <hi>Whether I might not be ſuffered in ſome place which no one elſe will take.</hi>] Moſt of the old Nonconformiſts were ſuffered by connivance in ſmall obſcure places, which was the chief reaſon why they ſet not up other meetings, which Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> thought they avoided as unlawful, becauſe forbidden.</p>
               <p>§. 6. And as to his excuſe by blaming ill Patrons, I would know then by what true obligation all men in <hi>England</hi> are bound to commit the Paſtoral conduct of their Souls to ſuch men only as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Patrons chuſe?</p>
               <p>§. 7. And when he ſo blameth the tepidity and irreligiouſneſs of the Members of their own Church, I would know, 1. Whether all men that are more ſeriouſly religious muſt be forſaken by us, and ruined by them, if they be not of their mind and form? 2. And whether the numbers of the irreligious that are for their way, and the numbers of the religious that are againſt it, ſhould not rather breed ſome ſuſpicion in them, than engage them to ruine ſo many ſuch men.</p>
               <p>§. 8. And when <hi>page</hi> 3. he confeſſeth that the <hi>ſword is their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſtrength and Government,</hi> and how contemptible <hi>words, paper, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and excommunications are without force;</hi> doth he not ſhame their whole cauſe, and ſhew that it is not the ſame Government which the Church uſed for many hundred years, which they deſire? and that their whole power of the Keys which they talk ſo much for, ſeems to themſelves a dead and uneffectual thing? while we Nonconformiſts deſire no coercive power, but to guide Conſenters.</p>
               <p>§. 9. As to his project to ſave religion under a Papiſt King, if the Dean and Chapter may but chuſe the Biſhop, I leave it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                        </opener>
                        <p>
                           <q>I Have often taken my pen in hand with a deſign to ſignifie to you, how much I love and honour ſo much learning, piety, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary goodneſs as you are owner of; And how paſſionately deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous I have been, and am, to be known to a perſon with whom none hath a like place in my higheſt eſteem and value: But my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and reſpects ſtill growing infinitely too big for mine expreſſion, I thought I ſhould but diſparage them, by going about to repreſent them. And when I ſate down to conſider, how I might moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly ſet forth my regards, and high ſenſe of your great deſerts, I always found my ſelf confounded with ſubject. And the throng of mine affections, each of them impatient to be firſt upon my paper, hindred one another's gratification. Great paſſions are difficultly ſpoken: And I find my ſelf now ſo pained with the ſenſe that I cannot write ſuteably to the honour I have for you, that I can ſcarce forbear th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away my pen; being near concluding, that 'tis better to ſpeak nothing in ſuch a ſubject, than a little. But when I conſider you as a perſon that have high affections for thoſe excellent qualifications, which in the higheſt degree are your poſſeſſion, and ſuteably reſent the worth of thoſe that own them; I am incourag'd to think that you may conceive how I honour you (though my pen cannot tell it you) by reflecting upon your own eſtimate of thoſe, that are of the higheſt form of learning, parts, and exemplary piety; or, more compendiouſly, ſuch in your judgment, as I take you for, Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And yet I have a jealouſie that that will not reach it; for though I think your judicious eſteem of ſuch, cannot be ſurpaſſed; yet I am apt to think, that none ever got ſuch an intereſt, and hold upon your paſſions, as hath the object of my admiration, on mine. Nor yet can I rebuke them as extravagant, though at the higheſt, ſince they take part with my ſevereſt judgment, and were indeed inflamed by it. And I profeſs I never found my ſelf ſo dearly inclin'd to thoſe of my neareſt blood, or ſo affectionately concern'd for my moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved friends and acquaintance, as for you, whom I had never the happineſs to converſe with but in your excellent writings, nor ever
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:97268:107"/>
often ſaw, but in the Pulpit. Yea, I ſpeak unfeignedly, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways intereſſed my ſelf more in your vindication when your unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable prejudic'd enemies have malign'd you, and delighted my ſelf more in your juſt praiſes from thoſe that know you, than ever my ſelf-love or ambition could prompt me to do in any caſe of mine own. Sir, I hope you believe that I ſpeak my moſt real ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and do not go about to complement you. For I muſt be very weak and inconſiderate, did I think to recommend my ſelf to ſo much ſerious wiſdom, by ſuch childiſh fooleries. Therefore if my expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſavour any thing above common reſpect, I beſeech you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, 'tis for that their cauſe is not common; but as much above ordinary, as their object. I know your humility and remarkable ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> denyal will not bear to read, what I cannot but ſpeak, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as I have occaſion to mention your great worth and merits. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I cannot chuſe but here acknowledge, how much I am a debtor to your incomparable writings. In which, when you deal in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſubjects, I admire your affectionate, piercing, heart-affecting quickneſs: And that experimental, ſearching, ſolid, convictive way of ſpeaking, which are your peculiars; for there is a ſmartneſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying your pen that forces what you write into the heart, by a ſweet kind of irreſiſtable violence; which is ſo proper to your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious way, that I never met it equal'd in any other writings. And therefore I cannot read them without an elevation, and emotions which I ſeldom feel in other peruſals. And when you are ingag'd in doctrinal and controverſal matters, I no leſs apprehend in them your peculiar excellencies. I find a ſtrength, depth, concinnity, and cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in your notions, which are not commonly elſewhere met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. And you have no leſs power by your triumphant reaſon upon the judgments of capable, free inquirers; than you have upon their affections and conſciences in your devotional and practical diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And methinks there is a force in your way of arguing, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowers oppoſition. Among your excellent Treatiſes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, your Rational confirmation of that grand principle of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Sacred Authority of Scripture; your ſolid dependent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the buſineſs of juſtification, and your ſtriking at the Root of Antinomianiſm in them, which I look on as the canker of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and have always abhorr'd as the ſhadow of death; And your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Catholick, healing indeavours; Theſe I ſay, deſerve from me particular acknowledgments. I profeſs the looſe, impertinent, unſound, cobweb arguings of the moſt that I had met with in the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97268:107"/>
Matter of the Divine Authority of Scripture, had almoſt occaſioned my ſtumbling at the threſhold, in my inquiries into the grounds of my Religion. For I am not apt to rely on an implicit faith in things of this moment. But your performances in this kind brought relief to my ſtaggering judgment, and triumph't over my heſitancy. As they did alſo to an excellent perſon a friend of mine, who was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on the ſame accounts that I was. And we are both no leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by what you have done in the other things formentioned. Which I profeſs I judge ſo rational, that I cannot but wonder, almoſt to ſtupor, to behold the fierce, though feeble onſets of your canker'd fiery opponents; whoſe writings againſt you (moſt of them) ſeem to me to be indited by nothing but ſpleen and choler. Nor have I been able to aſcribe the ingaging of ſo many virulent pens againſt you, to any other cauſe than the indeavours of Satan to hinder the ſucceſs which your powerful pen hath had againſt the Dark Kingdom. And the ſpirit that I have perceiv'd to animate ſome of their wild ravings hath confirm'd me in that belief, that it was the great <hi>Abad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> that inſpir'd their undertakings. I thought e're this to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you a more publick ſpecimen of mine affections by indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat in your vindication againſt the calumnies, and feeble arguings of ſome of thoſe fiery Aſſailants; But collateral occaſions, and other ſtudies have hitherto diverted me: Yet I ſhall not forget my obligations, aſſoon as I can be maſter of convenient time and opportunities for the performance. But I ſee my paper warns me; And though <hi>I</hi> ſhould pleaſe my ſelf by a larger expreſſion of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and ſenſe of your high deſervings from every one that hath had the happineſs to be taught by you, either from the Preſs or Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit; yet <hi>I</hi> dare not be ſo rude in this firſt Addreſs, as to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and importunate. <hi>I</hi> know your occaſions are ſuch, as that they cannot bear a long divertiſement. I had ſeveral times deſign'd at <hi>London</hi> to have taken the boldneſs to have waited on you, but the conſideration, how you were conſtantly ingag'd in buſineſs, prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the execution of thoſe intentions. And about three years ſince I came from <hi>Oxford</hi> on purpoſe to <hi>Kederminſter,</hi> to ſee you there, and hear you preach; both which I was happy in. But you were then ſo buſie in the company of ſeveral Miniſters that were at your houſe, that I could not gain an opportunity of making way for a future ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. If I were ſure that you were leſs incumbred now, and that you made any conſiderable ſtay in the Country, I would make a journey on purpoſe to wait on you. I have with this ſent you a ſmall
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97268:108"/>
Diſcourſe of mine own, of which I deſire your acceptance. For the ſubject and deſign, I know it will not diſpleaſe you. And for the management, I'me confident you will not quarrel with it, becauſe it is not ſo popular as it might have been, when you ſhall know, that 'twas intended for thoſe of a Philoſophick Genius. I durſt not (Sir) be any longer troubleſome, and therefore ſhall conclude with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that the freedom of your ſpirit, the impartiality of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, the Catholickneſs of your judgment and affections, the peaceableneſs, and moderation of your principles, the generoſity and publick ſpiritedneſs of your diſpoſition, the exact, uniform ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of your life, and your indefatigable induſtry for the good of ſouls, excellencies which I never knew ſo combin'd in one; have ſo endear'd you to me, that there is not that perſon breathing that hath ſuch a ſhare in the affections, and higheſt value of,</q>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Some Notes on the Book called the <hi>Lively Picture</hi> of Dr. <hi>Lud. Moulin;</hi> and his Repentance ſubſcribed by Dr. <hi>Simon Patrick,</hi> Dean of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Gilb. Burnet.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>§. 1. I Had taken no notice of this Book, had not the Author by citing my words againſt Dr. <hi>L. Moulin</hi> as juſtifying his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, made me a party. Therefore I ſhall impartially ſpeak my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him and the accuſation, leſt I be thought to own all that the Writer ſpeaketh of him, and ſo to be as guilty of uncharitableneſs as he ſeemeth to me to be. I honour the name for the ſake of his famous Father, and his worthy Brother <hi>Peter,</hi> yet living, who by his Anſwer to <hi>Philanax Anglicus, &amp;c.</hi> hath well deſerved of all Proteſtants: And his worthy Brother <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and his very worthy Son now dead: And I truly believe that Dr. <hi>Lewis</hi> was a ſincere honeſt-hearted man, though Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> ſeem to diſlike my giving him that title. And I will tell you why I think ſo.</p>
               <p>§. 2. I ever obſerved that his faults lay in his <hi>weakneſs,</hi> and not in <hi>wickedneſs:</hi> 1. He was not a man of an accurate diſtinguiſhing head, and ſo was apt to take verbal Controverſies for real. 2. And it was no ſingular thing in him, that hereby he was led by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which he moſt valued, to think that the differences between the Remonſtrants and Contra<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>remonſtrants were much greater than they are, and <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> as it was called, to be a more heinous thing than indeed it is. 3. And when he thought that God's Cauſe (as <hi>Bradwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> called it) was ſo deeply engaged againſt ſuch Opinions, who can wonder if he was zealous againſt them? 4. And then he had a <hi>haſty raſhneſs</hi> in ſpeaking what he thought was true and neceſſary, when ſometimes it was not well tryed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſometime it was in an imprudent manner and time: And ſo in his haſt ran into the temerities and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes which Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> and I did blame him for. But I never percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that he had more <hi>paſſion</hi> (much leſs <hi>fury</hi>) than other ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters, but a more ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h and bluſtering way of uttering his mind, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times and in ſome Caſes, where he thought Religion much concerned. He h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> love to truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he ſometime ruſht upon miſtakes
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:97268:109"/>
that wore the vizor of it, and then truth (real or ſuppoſed) whatever it coſt him he would ſpeak. 5. I ever obſerved it was in his too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme oppoſition to ſome real errour or crime, that he was carried into his temerities. 6. And I never found that he was a worldling, nor ſinned by the preference of worldly intereſt; And doubtleſs the love of worldly profits, honours and pleaſures, are more dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the love of God, than ſome raſh uncharitable words and cenſures in a Cauſe which he thought was Gods.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Yea I found him more patient of confutation, contradiction and reproof than moſt men that ever I diſputed with, his Zeal which you call <hi>fury</hi> being far more for God than for himſelf. I began with him about 24 years ago, confuting his Latine Book of Juſtification a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Brother <hi>Cyrus.</hi> I wrote a ſecond time againſt him in the Preface cited by his Picture-drawer, about Univerſal Redemption, (and had ſaid much more in a Book of Univerſal Redemption, going to the Preſs, which I caſt by becauſe Mr. <hi>Daillés</hi> came then out, which had the ſame teſtimonial part and more which I intended.) Yet I never heard that the Dr. gave me any uncivil or uncharitable word, nor did he ever reply to either of theſe Books; nor ſignified any abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his love. And I think this ſhewed a forgiving mind.</p>
               <p>§. 4. But it's intimated, that this was becauſe we agreed in other things? I anſwer, we diſagreed alſo even about Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was the dividing Controverſie of thoſe times. The Dr. was zealous for the Magiſtrates Power in <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſenſe, and went ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther further than Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> in his <hi>Irenicum:</hi> And as I was before againſt him, ſo after this, about 12 years ago, I wrote that Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him about the Magiſtrates Power in Church-matters, in which I called him <hi>My ſincere friend,</hi> thinking <hi>ſincere friendſhip</hi> conſiſtent with ſuch a difference and an open Confutation. (And if the contrary muſt be repented of, I hope ſuch charity is no crime.) This third Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him alſo he took patiently, and without breach of Love.</p>
               <p>And when I laboured to perſwade him to retract his Writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Excommunication, though he held ſtill to his Concluſion, and thought that the great work that God called him to in the World, was to diſcover the Papal and Prelatical Uſurpation of the Magiſtrates power under the name of Eccleſiaſtical, yet I made him confeſs all the matter that I pleaded for, and he made me ſee that his errour lay moſt in meer ambiguous words, which he had not <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ateneſs enough to explicate. All this patience ſignified not uncharitableneſs, rage or fury. And I obliged him not by praiſe, but <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

him for his eagerneſs for his own indigeſted conceptions; nor gave him any thanks for his indiſcreet and exceſſive praiſes afterwards given me in his <hi>Patronus bonae fidei.</hi> Upon all this I would put ſome queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the ſober thoughts of the Author of his Picture.</p>
               <p>1. Whether there be not as great ſigns of <hi>ſincerity, humility</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> in ſuch a behaviour, and in that great love which he had to all that he thought Godly men, (though he too hardly judged of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for that which he thought great errour and ſin) as in thoſe that cannot bear a juſt defence of diſſenters againſt their unjuſt accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor endure men to tell why they rather ſuffer than Conform.</p>
               <p>2. Whether he that maketh him ſo very bad a man<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 22. A vain Writer and malicious, if not mad and diſtracted. <hi>p.</hi> 11. he will magnifie the very worſt of men, if they be of his mind, and vilifie the beſt if they be of another. <hi>p.</hi> 27. He hath full liberty to vie with the Devil himſelf in his Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: with more ſuch.</note> and incredible a lyar for too raſh cenſoriouſneſs of diſſenters, and ſome untruths vented in raſh zeal, do not tempt men to give as odious titles to thoſe Reverend perſons who go very far beyond him in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths and uncharitable cenſures? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they that were for the ſilencing and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruining of about 2000 Miniſters, and call'd to Magiſtrates to execute the Laws againſt them, and that unchurch all the Reformed Churches which have not a continued ſucceſſion of Dioceſan Biſhops, ſhew not as much uncharitableneſs as he did that deſcribed ſome too hardly? And whether moſt of the Books written againſt me by Conformiſts, (ſuch as the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi>'s Letter, the <hi>Impleader,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hinkley,</hi> and many more) be not much fuller of untruths in matter of fact than the Drs? But yet I think it a ſin to give them ſuch a Character as this, and render the perſons as <hi>incredible lyars,</hi> becauſe errour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and faction made ſome ſo unadviſed.</p>
               <p>3. If it deſerve ſuch a Character to cenſure <hi>Arminians</hi> as dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly erroneous and befriending Popery? whether you do not conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſo ſtigmatize the old Church of <hi>England,</hi> before Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s time? Even Arch-biſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Fletcher,</hi> and the reſt who drew up the <hi>Lambeth</hi> Articles, Arch-biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> and the Church in his time (except ſix Biſhops, &amp;c.) King <hi>James,</hi> and the whole Church as conſenting by ſix Delegates to the Synod of <hi>Dort:</hi> And alſo that Synod and all the Forein Reformed Churches that conſented to it? And is not this more than Dr. <hi>Moulin</hi> did?</p>
               <p>4. And are they not then to be accordingly ſtigmatized, who on the other ſide make the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> as odious, accuſing them of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97268:110"/>
Turciſme, and doing as much againſt them as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in the Life of Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> tells us was done in <hi>England</hi> on that account.</p>
               <p>5. And if ſuch hard thoughts of <hi>Arminians</hi> as furthering Popery deſerve your Character, whether by conſequence you ſo brand not all thoſe Parliaments who voted againſt it accordingly, and made it one of the dangerous grievances of the Land? And is not that as faulty as for Dr. <hi>Moulin</hi> too much to blame you?</p>
               <p>6. Yea I doubt you ſtigmatize thus ſo great a part of Chriſtians in all the World as I am loth to mention: ſo rare is it to hear of any Country, where they are not ſo much guilty of ſects and factions, as by education and intereſt to run in a ſtream of uncharitable cenſures of one another, ſpeaking evil of more than they underſtand, as I have proved in my <hi>Cathol. Theolog.</hi> about this ſubject.</p>
               <p>7. Seeing it is above 20 years ſince I wrote that againſt Dr. <hi>Moulin</hi> which you cite, and he never found fault with it, nor juſtified his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, may I not think that he was convinced and repented? And you that praiſe his death-bed repentance, ſhould not Characterize him by failings twenty years repented of?</p>
               <p>8. How do you know that the Dr. repented not of his too hard words of you till his death-bed? You are miſtaken? In his health I more than once blamed him, 1. For his cenſure of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> and the other particular perſons, whoſe worth was known, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved well of the Proteſtant Churches; 2. For his extending thoſe cenſures to the Conformiſts and Church which belong to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, and the moſt are not guilty of, And 3. For his Book of the <hi>fewneſs</hi> of the <hi>ſaved,</hi> as preſumptuous: And as far as I could then diſcern he repented of them all, but laid the ill Title-page of the laſt on the Book-ſeller: And he ſtill thought of Cauſes and Parties as very different, he owned not his harſh words or cenſures aforeſaid. I found him not <hi>raging</hi> nor <hi>impenitent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. Doth not your own deſcription of his great readineſs to beg for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, and lothneſs to own any thing uncharitable, ſhew a better ſpirit than your <hi>picture</hi> doth deſcribe?</p>
               <p>10. Is not he as like to be a ſincere man who asketh forgiveneſs of his faults (raſh cenſures and words) as he that repenteth of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer duties, his Pacificatory principles and Writings. Surely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of evil is a better ſign than to repent of good.</p>
               <p>11. Becauſe you call us to acquit our ſelves by diſowning Dr. <hi>Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> may we not diſown both his faults and our own, without diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:97268:110"/>
God's grace and mens piety and worth? would you be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned for your own faults? 2. And how ſhould I diſown his raſhneſs better than to write what I wrote againſt him, and ſay what I ſaid to him? would you have a Synod called to reprove every raſh word?</p>
               <p>12. Becauſe you juſtly value mens repentance, I will be thankful to you to further mine, and give me leave to further yours. Only I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell you that your words ſhall not offend me by their hardneſs, if they have but truth, and you call me to repent of my ſin and not of ſerving God. I do not repent of defending Truth and Duty: nor of ſeeking to ſave the Reader from the infection of falſe accuſation and arguings which would deſtroy his charity and innocency, by the fulleſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting the <hi>falſhood</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> of the words and deeds which are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. I take it to be a wrong to thoſe that I would preſerve, to extenuate the danger of the ſnare or poyſon, on pretence of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs to the Writer. But I deal with the Cauſe and deſire none to hate the perſon: nor would I diminiſh the honour due to him for his parts or vertues; but rather have all men love and magnifie all the good, while they diſlike the evil; and would ſave the Reader at as eaſie a rate to the Writer as I can: But that he ſhould not be related to his falſe or ſinful words or deeds is not in my power to effect. But though I repent not of neceſſary truth, if I any where miſtake, or ſpeak more truth than is profitable, or in language by ſharpneſs more apt to do hurt than good, of this I repent, and ask forgiveneſs of God and man; As I do if I ſpeak ſo ſhort of truth, as with <hi>Eli</hi> to make ſin ſeem ſmaller than it is.</p>
               <p>And now I hope you will love your own duty of Repentance better than another mans, and will not be angry if I ſeek to help it.</p>
               <p>1. Do you not perceive that while you paint the Dr. as an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble raging diſtracted lyar, and praiſe his repentance for <hi>raſh words</hi> of others, that you commit the ſame raſhneſs your ſelf againſt him? If you cannot ſee your own face, let any impartial Reader be your glaſs, and ask him whether you do not that which you are condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p>2. You ſeem to vindicate the Book called the <hi>Friendly Debate,</hi> I ſhall ſhortly further tell you of ſomewhat in it to be repented of. And if partiality made not repentance a very difficult work you would have no need herein of a Monitor. But you may think me partial, though I acknowledg your civilities to me: I can ſhew you a Manuſcript of one both impartial and truly judicious, even the late Judge <hi>Hale,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing ſo great diſlike of that Debate and the Eccl. Policy, as tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to the injury of Religion it ſelf, that he wiſheth the Authors would openly profeſs that they write for themſelves, and no more ſo abuſively pretend it is for Religion.</p>
               <p>3. You ſay in this Picture that [<hi>If</hi> L. du Moulin <hi>had that honeſt zeal in him to which he pretends, he would have handled Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>as ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>4. You ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 17. He hath ſomething of the Nonconformiſts in him, and for that reaſon he ſpareth him:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Do not Nonconformiſts differ from <hi>Eraſtians?</hi> Did not I write againſt his opinion of Church-Government? And did he not bear 22 years ago when Conformity was not in our Controverſies.</p>
               <p>5. You ſay of [<hi>the party that come neareſt the doctrine of Calviniſts and Puritans,</hi> (though you ſay you mean ſuch as <hi>D. M.</hi> your Reader muſt ſuppoſe you mean the Nonconformiſts) that [<hi>they are the true Cauſes of all our preſent evils.—For the late War was raiſed,—by the very beſt of you, &amp;c.</hi>] If you mean, as you ſeem, it's ſomewhat extraordinary to perſwade men to believe this in the ſame Land and Age that the War was raiſed in; And for one to do this that had the firſt General of the Horſe in the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Army, his Patron a few doors from him, and the Lord <hi>Hollis</hi> a Colonel nearer him till lately, and the Lord Preſident of his Majeſties Privy-Council a Colonel not far off him, and many more known Conformiſts, who could all quickly have ſatisfied him how few Nonconformiſts were Members of Parliament or Commanders in the Army when the War began, and that it was betwnen two parties of Conformiſts that the Wars began, as I have proved againſt Mr. <hi>Hink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and can fullier do when there is need. Which party is moſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to repentance you may diſpute with thoſe that are fit for it: But if your intimation be untrue, it is of another nature, and degree than any of Dr. <hi>Moulins.</hi> I confeſs one party did in many Parliaments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and in that, accuſe Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> and his new followers, 1. Of Innovations, 2. Of Arminianiſm, 3. Of promoting abſolute arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Government againſt the Subjects Property and Liberty, 4. And of promoting Popery. But if this party were not Conformiſts of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Biſhops, Clergy and Gentry were not the Church in Arch-biſhop <hi>Abbots</hi> days before Biſhop <hi>Laud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:97268:111"/>As to the Reaſons of their accuſations, and the publiſhing the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles for Toleration in order to the <hi>Sp.</hi> and <hi>Fr.</hi> Match, &amp;c.

That I hope we may tranſcribe mens own words, 2. And may judge that there is ſome difference between the Biſhops that judged the Pope Antichriſt, &amp;c. and thoſe that would have us as the way to unity, to obey him as Patriarch of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and <hi>principium unitatis,</hi> and the firſt 6 or 8 General Councils, and that ſay our concord muſt be in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>unum Collegium Paſtorum,</hi> ruling the whole Church <hi>per literas forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi> and that ſay the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a true Church, but ſo are none of the Reformed that have not Biſhops, and a continued ſucceſſive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by ſuch.

When ſome worthy and Learned men did on his Death bed intimate to him that he had faln too heavy upon many Pious and Learned men of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> He profeſſed himſelf never to have born any malice in his heart againſt the Perſon of any of them, but that his intention was only to blame them for having too much gratified the Enemies of the true Proteſtant Religion, by their condeſcentions to them, and their too great compliances with them: He never recanted nor retracted any thing material that he had Profeſſed and Printed of late years; if he had uſed any ſharp expreſſions, or by any reflections given any offence to any truly pious man, he heartily prayed their pardon, and as heartily forgave all men, as he deſired them to forgive him.

               <head type="sub">Five Additional Notices to the Reader.</head>
               <p>THere are ſome things of which I thought meet to add this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Reader.</p>
               <p>I. That I am more alienated from Conformity in the point of <hi>Aſſent, Conſent</hi> and <hi>Uſe,</hi> in denying Chriſtendom to all Children who have no Godfathers and Godmothers, and excluding the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents from that Office, by ſome late Obſervations which my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiredneſs kept me unacquainted with: I am requeſted by ſome poor People to Baptize their Children: I tell them the Pariſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters muſt do it. They anſwer me, That they cannot have them Baptized by the Pariſh Miniſters, becauſe they <hi>are poor; and can neither pay the Curate nor the Godfathers:</hi> I ask them, <hi>Cannot you get Godfathers without money:</hi> They ſay, <hi>No: No body will be Godfather to their Children for nothing?</hi> Whereupon enquiring into the caſe, I am informed, that among the poor it is become a trade, to be hired perſons to be Godfathers and Godmothers; and ſome that have not money muſt leave their Children unbaptized, and till lately, Popiſh Prieſts Baptized many. I am not willing to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate this <hi>Hiring,</hi> nor the <hi>cauſes</hi> of it, nor that the ſame men that think Baptiſm neceſſary to Salvation, (or as Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> ſpeaks, to a <hi>Covenant right to Salvation</hi>) ſhould yet ſhut out all that have not money to hire ſuch Covenanters; But I am not Conformable to ſuch Church-Orders.</p>
               <p>II. Whereas there is a great ſtreſs laid on Mr. <hi>Rathband</hi>'s Book of the old Nonconformiſts Doctrine againſt the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> as if they thought that meer obedience to the Law required them to forbear Preaching when they were ſilenced, when indeed they only thought, 1. That it bound them to give up the Temples and Tithes and publick maintenance (which are at the Magiſtrates diſpoſe,) 2. And to forbear that <hi>manner</hi> and thoſe <hi>circumſtances</hi> of their Miniſtry as no Law of God in Nature or Scripture do oblige them to, but
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:97268:113"/>
will do more hurt than good; I have now for fuller ſatisfaction, here added the Teſtimony of his Son concerning his judgment and practice: who nineteen years had his liberty in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> to Preach publickly, in a Chappel, and after that in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and no wonder if the diſorders of <hi>Browniſm</hi> that would have deprived them of all ſuch liberty were oppoſed. I have peruſed Mr. <hi>Rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>'s Book (written by ſome others) and I find nothing in it that I conſent not to, but deſire him that would underſtand it to read the Book it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Rathband</hi>'s Letter to me is as followeth.

                        <p>WHereas Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in a late Book of his hath alledged a Book publiſhed by my Father, to prove that Preaching contrary to our Eſtabliſhed Laws is contrary to the Doctrine of all the Nonconformiſts in former times, I aſſure you, Sir, that my Father is not to be reckoned in that number; for he exerciſed his Miniſtry, though contrary to the Law, for many years at a Chappel in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and after he was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced he Preached in private, as he had opportunity and the times would bear; of which I my ſelf was ſometime a witneſs. Afterward, upon the invitation of a Gentleman, he exerciſed his Miniſtry at <hi>Belſham</hi> in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> for about a year, and from thence he removed to <hi>Owingham</hi> in the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where he Preached alſo about a year, till being ſilenced there, he retired into private as formerly. This I thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to ſignifie to you, and you may make what uſe of it you pleaſe, for what is written here ſhall be owned by</p>

(He is a Grave and worthy Nonconforming ejected Miniſter, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving uſually in <hi>High-gate.</hi>) His Father read part of the Common-Prayer, and kept in as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And I thank Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> for ſo full a Vindication of ſuch old Nonconformiſts againſt the Accuſations of their Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.</p>
               <p>III. When my Book was almoſt Printed, I received the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of a faithful Learned ejected Miniſter, in which, he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth the fallacy of Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Allegations of Hiſtory for the Antiquity of Dioceſan Biſhops, and fully proveth that for the firſt three hundred years the Biſhops were Congregational and Parochial, and that with ſo full evidence, as that out of <hi>Strabo</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Geographers he ſheweth that many of their Seats were but about four Miles from one another, as our Pariſh Churches are; and he confuteth what is ſaid againſt it. And he ſheweth the Doctors groſs abuſe of Hiſtory, to prove that Biſhops needed not the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples conſent, and proveth that the Peoples choice or conſent was neceſſary by the conſtant judgment of the Churches.</p>
               <p>But this Book is of ſo great worth, that I will not diſhonour it by making it an Appendix to mine, but intend to make ſo bold with the Author, as to publiſh it by it ſelf.</p>
               <p>1. As a fuller Confutation to Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. As a full Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s Letters on that ſubject; And 3. As a Confirmation of my full proof of the ſame things, in my Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p>IV. And if any will receive that from a Conformiſt, which he will not receive from ſuch a one as I, he may read,</p>
               <p>1. Our full and faithful Vindication by a <hi>Beneficed Miniſter,</hi> and a <hi>Regular ſon of the Church,</hi> Called <hi>A Compaſſionate Conſideration of the Caſe of the Nonconformiſts:</hi> I am not ſo happy as to know the Author, but he confirmeth my former Judgment, that a great part of the Paſſive Conformiſts are moderate worthy men, with whom we ſhould earneſtly endeavour as near and faſt a coalition as is poſſible to be had by lawful means.</p>
               <p>2. And either the ſame hand, or ſuch another Conformiſt, hath written Reflections on Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> in which the like candor and charity appeareth, though with ſome exceſs of kindneſs to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:97268:114"/>V. With this Defence againſt Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> I at once pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh in another Volume, <hi>An Apology for the Nonconfirmiſts Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> with an Anſwer to a multitude of their Accuſers, and Reaſons to prove that it is the Biſhops and Conformiſts great <hi>Duty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> to ſeek their Reſtoration. Which is the moſt material part of the Confutation of Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> who would perſuade us that our Preaching is a ſin, and make us guilty of ſilencing our ſelves.</p>

            <p>I Muſt take this opportunity for the avoiding of miſtakes to give thee notice, that whereas againſt them that plead for the neceſſity of an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Succeſſion of Epiſcopal ordination, I have in the Preface to my Book for <hi>Univerſal Concord,</hi> and in the beginning of my Breviate of <hi>Church-Hiſtory,</hi> ſaid that our Northern Engliſh Epiſcopacy was derived from ſuch as were no Biſhops, but Scottiſh Monks and Presbyters, and that <hi>Aidan</hi> and <hi>Finan,</hi> (<hi>Tromhere, Coleman</hi>) were ſuch, leſt I be miſunderſtood, I muſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explain my meaning; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The <hi>Culdees</hi> that were no Biſhops, firſt guided the Affairs of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Scotland,</hi> long before the coming of <hi>Palladius.</hi> 2. Theſe <hi>Culdees</hi> choſe themſelves for order ſake ſome few to be as Guides and Governorus to the reſt, whom Writers called <hi>Scotorum Epiſcopos,</hi> but were no Biſhops in our controverted ſenſe: but as an Abbot among Monks, and as the Preſidents or Principals of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, rule thoſe that are of the ſame office or order with them. Nor had they any limited fixed Dioceſſes.</p>
            <p>3. And if any will call theſe Biſhops, and the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb facs="tcp:97268:116"/>
be but <hi>de nomine,</hi> let them call them ſo and ſpare not: I contend not againſt them.</p>
            <p>4. Afterwards <hi>Palladius</hi> ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> began a higher ſort of Biſhops: But the <hi>Culdees</hi> ſtill kept up the greater part againſt him.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Columbanus</hi> his Monaſtery in the Iſle of <hi>Hy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the <hi>Culdees</hi> ſtrength. And the Monks out of that Iſland were the moſt prevailing Clergy of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> who had no proper Epiſcopal ordination: Or if you will call their ordainers Biſhops, they were not only <hi>ejuſdem ordinis</hi> with the Presbyters, but alſo not ordained by Biſhops themſelves, but made ſuch by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Monaſtery, and bare election and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Presbyters.</p>
            <p>6. Out of this famous holy Monaſtery, was <hi>Aidan</hi> firſt, and <hi>Finan</hi> after, [and <hi>Tromhere</hi> &amp;c.] and <hi>Coleman</hi> after ſent into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> where they areſaid to be made Biſhops. And they were the firſt Biſhops that came thither; and ſo, had no ordination in <hi>England</hi> from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Biſhops that were there before: Nor is there any probability that the <hi>Palladian</hi> Biſhops did ordain them Biſhops: But that their own order of Senior Monks and Presbyters only ordained them.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Beda</hi> was ſuch a votary to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that his teſtimony runs more for the Romiſh intereſt than moſt of the Scottiſh or Engliſh Hiſtorians of thoſe times: yet <hi>lib. 3. c.</hi> 5. ſaith of <hi>Aidan</hi> but that his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation was in <hi>Conventu Seniorum,</hi> and <hi>ſic illum ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantes ad praedicandum miſerunt.</hi> And <hi>c.</hi> 25. that Finan <hi>pro illo gradum Epiſcopatus a Scottis ordinatus &amp; miſſus acceperat, qui in inſula Lindisfarnenſi ſecit Eccleſiam E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopali ſedi congruam; Quam tamen more Scottorum, uno de lapide, ſed de robore ſecto totam compoſuit, &amp;

And <hi>Cedda</hi> was ordained by the Scots; And at a Synod three or four of theſe kind of Biſhops with the King and his Son, and <hi>Hilda</hi> a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Abbeſſe, were the Company that made it. c. 25. And c. 26. <hi>Tuda</hi> alſo was ordained by the Scots. And c. 4. The Biſhops themſelves were under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Abbot, <hi>juxta exemplum primi Doctoris, qui non Epiſcopus, ſed Presbyter extitit et Monachus.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>9. And as there is no word of proof that it was the <hi>Palladian Roman</hi> Biſhops that ordained theſe <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Biſhops, ſo there is enough to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in that all theſe foreſaid Biſhops continued the ſtiffe enemies of the Roman Power and order, which <hi>Palladius</hi> came to introduce. Inſomuch that <hi>Beda</hi> oft mentioneth their utter averſion to the Roman party, and that the <hi>Brittons</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> were all of a mind, and <hi>Daganus</hi> and the reſt would not ſo much as eate with the Romaniſts, no nor ſo much as eat in the ſame houſe or Inn with them, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. c. 4.</p>
