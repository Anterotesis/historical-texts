            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Not long after, considering himselfe depriued of his lawfull heyre, and howe greatly he had peruerted the course of nature, very extreame greefe ended his daies: but ere he died, hee enclosed the Treasure of the Temple with such enchaunt ments, and with so strong and fearefull a guard, that from the time of his death, it was very dangerous to come n√©ere the place.

I had not thought, replyed the Knight of the Castell, that thy indiscretion had beene so great, as to thinke I would win a thing so hardlie, and deliuer it from me so lightlie, nor shall the paragon of my hart, bee in the custodie againe of so base an excrement of nature: then spake he to the Dwarffe in this manner.</p>
               <p>Thou wretched and ridiculous creature, commest thou likewise to make one in the Tragedie? begin with thyne owne hand thou wert best, or I shall plague thee with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame torments. So tooke he the Gentlewoman in hys armes, and oftentimes laciuiously kissed her, shee stryuing in teares to hinder his embracings, wherefore hee sayde. Good Madame, seeke no occasion whereby to offende your selfe, for yee shall s√©e me plucke downe the brauery of this Knight, and make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Monster your husbande safe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling you anie more.

And if y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> wilt haue me i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine thee couragious, bring down the Ladie with thee, that the Conquerer may carrie her whether him pleaseth.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10567:62"/>
I am content, answered the Knight, because thou shalt see howe little I esteeme thy threatning, and soone shall all controuersies be ended betweene thee and me, that heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after may arise on this occasion. Quickly had he Armed himselfe and came foorth leading the Lady in his hande: which when the Dwarffe saw, he durst not tary, but gotte him a bowe shoote further off. So fell the Knight and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farano</hi> to the Combat, which continued long time doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full on eyther side, but at length <hi>Rifarano</hi> had the vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of his enemie, because he had giuen him many cruell woundes on his bodie. When the Squires of the Castell sawe their Maister ouercome, they woulde forcibly haue caryed the Ladie into the Castell again: but <hi>Rifarano</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised thereof by her cry, made them forsake her &amp; runne hastilie into the Castell, then taking her by the hand, sayd.
