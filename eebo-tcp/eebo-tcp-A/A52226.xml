            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>My <hi>Lord, Popery,</hi> now Priſoner at the Bar, hath broached many damnable Hereſies contrary to the word of God, and particularly that it is not a Rule of Faith, but as a Noſe of wax, to be turned which way the Church pleaſes whereas the word of God ſaith, that <hi>all Scripture is given by Divine inſpiration,</hi> yet he wickedly prefers his own Carnal Traditions before it, as alſo his Principles are directly againſt the Ten Commandments: Againſt the firſt, in making a God of the Bread in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Againſt the Second, in bowing down thereunto. Aeainſt the Third, by profane Swearing by God, and the Saints. Againſt the Fourth, in preferring his Saints days, which are of his own Inſtitution, before the Sabbath, which is of Divine. Againſt the Fifth, in declaring that Children of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104594:2"/>
owe not Obedience to their Parents, which are not of the ſame. Againſt the Sixth, in maintaining the lawfulneſs of Robbing, Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and endeavouring to Ruin, by Firing Houſes; or otherwiſe, all thoſe that are not of his Opinion. Againſt the Seventh, in ſetting up, and allowing of common <hi>Stews,</hi> &amp;c. Againſt the Eighth, in bloody and inhuman Muthering, and Maſſacring of Proteſtants, under the Names of Heriticks, and endeavouring to maintain the lawfulneſs thereof. Againſt the Ninth, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Leagues with Princes for his own advantage, and then breaking them, ſaying, Oaths may not be kept with Hereticſts. Againſt the Tenth, in a greedy coveting of Gold, he pretending to give out Pardons to Commit all manner of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies whatever. Beſides my Lord, there is ſcarce one Commandment of the firſt Table free from his innovations, nevertheleſs he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſay that a man of his Religion may keep all the Commandments, contrary to the word of God, which ſaith, that <hi>there is not a juſt man that liveth and ſinneth not,</hi> and alſo, that <hi>if we ſay we have no ſin we deceive our Selves,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>My Lord in the year 110 <hi>Popery</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as an Univerſal Deluge to over-ſpread the whole Chriſtian World, I with Sir <hi>Conſtant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> lived privately at <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France</hi>: enjoying the glorious Goſpel, with many others of our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Friends, and Neighbours; but <hi>Popery</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar there found us, Maſſacred and Tortured many of us for confeſſing the cauſe of Chriſt: put us to moſt Exquiſite Torments, and exerciſed Savage Cruelties upon us: from thence flying to <hi>Germany,</hi> paſſing through <hi>Flanders,</hi> we ſaw <hi>Popery</hi> preparing a fire to burn ſeveral of our Adherents, which clave to Chriſt: on of our Friends there ſuffering, I remember, before he went into the Fire, took two Stones in his hands, ſaying, when I ſhall eat theſe two Stones, our Religion ſhall ceaſe, not before. When we were come to <hi>Germany</hi> we found no reſt there, for <hi>Popery</hi> purſued us thither, and he going through <hi>Bohemiah</hi> murthered many of the <hi>Peers</hi> of that <hi>Realm.</hi> In <hi>Germany</hi> he commanded all to be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that were ſuſpected, ſaying, God knows who are his. From thence we fled into <hi>Spain,</hi> where we were taken by <hi>Popery</hi>'s bloody Inquiſition, in this manner, a Meſſenger came to us, and told us, that the Lord Inquiſitors had ſomething to ſay to us, and therefore we muſt wait upon them: we being come, they enquired our names, and ſent us to Priſon: we having entered the firſt Gate, the Jaylor asked us, whether we had a Knife about us, and under pretence to ſearch for one, took from us all our Jewels and Mony, thereby left us nothing to help our ſelves; then were we caſt into a ſtinking Dungeon, where we continued Six Months, then being brought forth, <hi>Popery,</hi> Priſoner at the Bar, endeavoured by all means to extort from us a Confeſſion, which we not doing, he ſaid we ſhould be racked; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the <hi>Rack, Popery</hi> ſitting on a Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold by the <hi>Rack,</hi> in came our Tormentor, and we being ſtripp'd, had our hands bound with Cords; then they tyed us to the Pully, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening Weights to our Heels, they hoiſted us up by degrees; thus hanging in great Torture they had us accuſe all we knew of our Religion, which we denying, they racked all our Bones out of Joynt, and then ſent us to Priſon again, and at laſt diſmiſſed us. From thence we fled into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but here was the like; and ſo we fled again into <hi>France,</hi> where we lived quietly for ſome time, but at laſt <hi>Popery</hi> purſued us, and diſguiſed with a Vizard of Friendſhip invited us, with moſt of our Brethren, to a Marriage, but being come, he murthered in one Night above 20000. From thence we fled to <hi>Ireland,</hi> but <hi>Popery</hi> purſuing us thither, committed the moſt barbarous and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Murthers, Villanies, ſparing neither Man, Woman, or Child, ripping up Women with Child, raviſhing chaſt Matrons, drowning, putting to the Sword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many thouſands of innocent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; from thence we again fled into <hi>England,</hi> where we were ſoon purſued, and though here he ſet not upon us ſo openly as before, yet his will was to do us the moſt hurt: In the year 1666 he burned down the famous City of <hi>London,</hi> and hath not ceaſed to endeavour to perpetuate his bloody Villanies; only by many ſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of God he hath been hindered; for we certainly hear he would here quite extirpate us to the utmoſt of his power: Nay I heard credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that he was reſolved not to leave one drop of Proteſtant Blood, and like his other Deviliſh Policy, could be glad to caſt theſe Treaſonable Conſpiracies on the innocent Proteſtants. My Lord, he is ſo dangerous, and ſo wickedly ſubtle, that we live in dayly hazard of our Lives, and when he may deſtroy us all, God only knows, if timely courſe be not taken.</p>

               <p>My Lord, <hi>Popery</hi> did really combine with the Devil to promote his Deſigns, and hath been guilty of great Conjurations; I have ſeen him in the VVoods in the ſhape of a Bore, he hath alſo been a cruel Murtherer; for I ſaw a Pond of his cleanſing, and thence taken out 60 Childrens Skulls, and it is computed that in about 50 years time he hath maſſacred 15 millions of Proteſtants.</p>

               <p>Then my Lord proceeded, and ſpoke as follows,</p>
               <p>You Gent. of the <hi>Jury,</hi> you hear the Priſoner is indicted for contriving Hereſie, contrary to the VVord of God; and to gain Proſelytes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, he hath been guilty of Treaſons, Murthers, and Blaſphemies; the firſt part of the Indictment hath been largely confirm'd by a <hi>Peer of this Realm,</hi> whoſe Name is <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> And the ſecond <hi>by two worthy Knights</hi>: Alſo we have had a fourth witneſs, which as the other hath fairly laid open his Villanies; and he for his defence hath only caſt foul Aſperſions upon the Juſtice of the Court, his ſins are great, and cry aloud for vengeance, and if Juſtice be not executed againſt him, we may fear leſt we be partakers with him of his plagues.
