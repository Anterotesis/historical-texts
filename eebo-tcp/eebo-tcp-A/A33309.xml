            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> and yet so far from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, that <hi>The bloud of the Martyrs proves the seed of the Church</hi>: And indeed she is the only, and true <hi>Salamander,</hi> that can live in the fire: Yet this, not by any strength of her own, but because the Angel of the Covenant, even the Lord Jesus Christ is in the bush, either to slack the fire, or to strengthen the bush, and make it incombustible. In this Book thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est see, as in a Mirrour, what hath been the lot and portion of the Church and people of God from the Creation hitherto, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 14.22.</note> 
               <hi>Through many tribulations to enter into the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Here thou hast a certaine and infallible mark of the true Church of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> To be hated and persecuted by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his instruments. Here thou maiest see what is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant concommitant of the Gospel, when it is received in the love and power of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Persecution, according to that of the Apostle, <hi>Ye became followers of us, and of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thes. 1.4.</note> 
               <hi>having received the word in much affliction,</hi> &amp;c. Neither yet is God an hard Master in dealing thus with his faithfull servants. He knows that heavy afflictions are the best benefactors to heavenly affections: and that grace is hid in nature
<pb facs="tcp:41459:3"/>
here, as sweet water in rose leaves, which must have the fire of affliction put under to distill it out. He knows that when afflictions hang heaviest, corrupt affections hang loosest upon his children. Yet doth not the Lord <hi>afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men, to crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth</hi>:<note place="margin">Lam. 3.33, 34</note> but he will hereby try who are his indeed and in truth, not in name and profession only: For as the Eagle tries her young ones by turning their faces to the sun beams, so those Christians that can outface the sun of Persecution, are sincere indeed.</p>
            <p>One thing is very remarkable in this History, that usually before any great Persecution befell the Church, the holy men of those times observed that there was some great decay of zeal, and of the power of godliness, or some mutuall conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and quarrels amongst the people of God, or some such sin or other that provoked God against them; and then, as the shepherd sets his dog upon his sheep, when they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray to bring them in, and then rates him off again: So God lets loose wicked Persecutors upon his own children, but it's only to bring them in unto him; and then, he not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains their rage, but casts the rod into the fire. <hi>If judgement begin at the house of God,</hi>

               <hi>what shall the end be of them that obey not the Gospel of God?</hi> Much excellent use may be made of this History: As, teaching us,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That whosoever will take Christ truly, must take his Crosse as well as his Crown, his Sufferings as well as his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That persecution is the bellows of the Gospel, blowing every spark into a flame; and that Martyrs ashes are the best compost to manure the Church, their bloud to water it, and make it fertill.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That Gods children are like Starres, that shine brightest in the darkest night: Like Torches that are the better for beating: Like Grapes that come not to the proof, till they come to the presse: Likes Spices, that smell sweetest, when pounded: Like young Trees, that root the faster for shaking: Like Vines, that are the better for bleeding: Like Gold, that

looks the brighter for scouring. Like Glow worms, that shine best in the dark: Like Juniper that smels sweetest in the fire: Like the Pomander, which becomes more fragrant for chafing: Like the Palm tree, which proves the better for pressing: Like the Camomile, which the more you tread it, the more you spread it. Yea God knoweth that we are best, when we are worst, and live holiest, when we die fastest; and therefore he frames his dealing to our disposition, seeking ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to profit, then to please us.</p>
            <p>That when God exposeth us to Persecution, he expects our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> speedy and thorow Reformation, if we desire the affliction to be removed. For as it were to no purpose for the Finer to put his gold into the fire, except it lie there till it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined: So were it to small purpose for God to lay afflictions on us, if so soon as we whine and groan under his hand, he should remove them, before we be bettered thereby. Whereas afflictions, like <hi>Lots</hi> Angels, will soon away, when they have done their errand.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> It hath been the portion of all the Saints,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.12</note> from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation hitherto. <hi>What son is there whom the Father chasteneth not?</hi> One son indeed God had without sin,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.7.</note> but not without sorrow; for though Christ his naturall Son, was <hi>sine corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,</hi> without corruption, yet not <hi>sine correctione,</hi> without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; though he was <hi>sine flagitio,</hi> with out crime, yet not <hi>sine flagello,</hi> without a scourge. And <hi>if they did these things to the green tree, what shall be done to the dry?</hi> And behold the wonderfull wisdom of God herein? who by these afflictions separates the sinne that hates, from the son that he loves,<note place="margin">Luk. 23.31.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:41459:4"/>
and keeps him by these thorns from breaking over into Satans pleasant pastures, that would fat him indeed, but to the slaughter.</p>
            <p>In an <hi>Appendix</hi> to this Book, I have added the Lives of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of our Modern Divines, which I conceive not to be hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeniall to the rest of the Work; for though they were not Martyrs, yet may they well be stiled Confessors, in regard of the great Persecution and Sufferings, which most of them met withall whilest they lived here. And if any ask the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why I have added no more? It is because my intelligence comes in so slowely; and if such as are able, will take the pains to inform me, I shall (if God spares life) adde more to the end of the next impression of my Lives of the Fathers, and modern Divines. I hope that these my weak and poor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours will not prove ungratefull, nor be judged unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, considering the times wherein we live: For if the same sins abound amongst us in these daies, which have been the forerunners of persecutions formerly;<note place="margin">

               </note> we have cause to fear the worst, and to prepare for it; Forewarnd, forearmed. The reading of this History will manifest what wonderfull constancy and patience the Saints have shewed in their greatest sufferings: what hath been the power of Almighty God in their support: and what miserable ends many of their Persecutors have come to. My hearty desire is, That by reading of this Book, God may have the glory, and thy soul the comfort, and I shall be well appaied for my pains, Who am,</p>

            <l>WHat? yet more Books? what spirit now inspires</l>
            <l>Your Pen to write of Torments, Warres and Fires?</l>
            <l>What? Will that Pen that drew to th' Life before,</l>
            <l>Change stile, draw Death, and speak of Life no more?</l>
            <l>What blustering Boreas rais'd these stormy Windes,</l>
            <l>Which blew down Churches, shook the steddiest Mindes,</l>
            <l>Sure Hell's broke loose, and Devils in the flesh</l>
            <l>Are come out thence to try their wits afresh.</l>
            <l>Who ever heard <hi>Troy</hi>'s story with his ears,</l>
            <l>And could restrain his eies from shedding tears?</l>
            <l>I quake to hear what Saints in former daies</l>
            <l>Ne're shook to feel, so they might win the Baies.</l>
            <l>They conquer'd all; Their patient disposition,</l>
            <l>O're came both Pope, and <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition.</l>
            <l>They conquer'd Kings, and won the Crown at last;</l>
            <l>Prest towards the Prize, forgetting what was past.</l>
            <l>The Story's sad; 'tis true, yet the Authors skill</l>
            <l>Hath made that pleasant which in't self is ill.</l>
            <l>Away long-winded Volumes, Times disease;</l>
            <l>This Author doth our phansies better please.</l>
            <l>Large Books are endlesse; but 'tis his design</l>
            <l>T'enclose great Volumes in his single Line.</l>

            <head>To the Reverend Mr. <hi>Sa. Clarke,</hi> ON HIS MARTYROLOGIE.</head>
            <l>OH, Welcome home, Divine <hi>Drake,</hi> welcome home,</l>
            <l>First girdle of the World of <hi>Martyrdome.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who seeks for more, can no new thing descry,</l>
            <l>Y' have left no room for new discovery.</l>
            <l>These <hi>Maps</hi> and <hi>Charts</hi> you bring, nay every letter</l>
            <l>Makes you the worlds great Patron, it your Debtor.</l>
            <l>To call't a Map doth but a Part imply,</l>
            <l>'Tis the whole Globe of <hi>Martyrologie.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Each Picture is a Map, each Figure breaths</l>
            <l>A little hist'ry of the Martyrs deaths.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pisgah</hi>'s too farre to see the <hi>Holy-Land,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Stand here on <hi>Calvary,</hi> and view't at hand.</l>
            <l>Let others brag at large, whose fancy 'tis</l>
            <l>To say A SAINT by a Periphrasis.</l>
            <l>Who doth this Book of yours with theirs confer,</l>
            <l>Findes <hi>Saint</hi> and <hi>Martyr</hi> in one Character.</l>
            <l>Though (some there be) that differ from the rest</l>
            <l>In judgement, and account short-writting best:</l>
            <l>Those I am sure will praise you when they eye</l>
            <l>Your skill in <hi>Tachyhagiography.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Th'are many words make Volumes, do but look</l>
            <l>And you shall see 'tis matter makes a Book.</l>
            <l>All Volumes of this Subject here are set</l>
            <l>As't were contracted in an <hi>Alphabet.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In characters, for brevity, 'tis good</l>
            <l>That Vowels be by Cons'nants understood.</l>
            <l>The least is best, if no essentiall be</l>
            <l>Wanting to make't a perfect Entitie.</l>
            <l>Man's but the World <hi>Epitomiz'd,</hi> but this</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Compendium</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> is.</l>
            <l>Its commendation is it self, 'tis best</l>

                  <hi>and should be as gods knowing good and evil:</hi> and hereby he drew our first Parents from their Obedience unto God, and cheated them of that blessed and happy estate which God had created them in. Since which time his enmity against the Church and Children of God hath never ceased: but by his <hi>effectual working in the Children of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,</hi> he hath provoked and stirred up one man to be the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Devourer of another: Thus he provoked <hi>Cain</hi> to rise up against, and to slay his brother <hi>Abel,</hi>

                  </note> who thereby was so much provoked against him, that he slew him in the Temple; <hi>Bagoses</hi> being informed hereof, came with his Army to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and kept the <hi>Jews</hi> in bondage seven years, making them tributaries, so that before they could offer their daily sacrifice, they were compelled to pay for every Lamb, fifty Drachmes. After the death of <hi>John, Jaddus</hi> his sonne succeeded in the priesthood, in whose time <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great passed over the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spont,</hi> and having overcome the Lieutenant of <hi>Darius,</hi> he conquered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny countries in <hi>Asia minor,</hi> intending suddenly to come upon <hi>Jerusalem.

live after the Ordinances of their forefathers, and that every seventh year they might be exempted from taxes and tributes, which he fully granted: they besought him likewise that the Jews which were in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> and <hi>Babilon,</hi> might be permitted to live after their own Laws, which he willingly promised, and so departed: this was about the year of the world 3632. and before Christs nativity 332.</p>

               <p>He constrained the <hi>Jews</hi> to forsake God, and adore those Idols which himself vvorshiped; he forbad them to circumcise their Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>At this time there dvvelt at <hi>Modin</hi> (a Village of <hi>Jury</hi>) one vvhose name was <hi>Matthias,</hi> a Priest of the rank of <hi>Joarib,</hi> that had five sons, <hi>John</hi> called <hi>Gaddis, Simon</hi> called <hi>Matthes, Judas</hi> called <hi>Maccabeus, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azer</hi> called <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> called <hi>Apphas.</hi> This <hi>Matthias</hi> often complained to his sons of the miserable state of their Countrey, of the sacking of their City, the profanation of the Temple,<note place="margin">

Religion of their fathers: As soon as he had thus spoken, a certain <hi>Jew</hi> stepped forth to offer sacrifice according to the command of the King, wherewith <hi>Matthias,</hi> inflamed with zeal, was so displeased, that he and his sons fell upon him,<note place="margin">Zeal.</note> and with their swords hewed him to pieces; he also slew <hi>Apelles</hi> the Kings Captain, and some other soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who would have withstood him. Then he overthrew the Altar and with a loud voice, he said, <hi>If any one be affected to the Laws of their fathers, and to the service of God, let him follow me</hi>? and so he retired into the deserts with his sons; the like did the rest, with their wives and children, hiding themselves in caves and dens. The Kings Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains having intelligence hereof, with the Garison that was in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> they pursued them into the desert, and having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken them, they first endeavoured by perswasions to draw them to Idolatry; but the <hi>Jews</hi> absolutely refusing to yield to their wicked wils, resolved rather to die then to submit to them, and to commit such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety;<note place="margin">The <hi>Jews</hi> murthered, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to fight on the Sabbath day.</note> whereupon these bloody persecutors assailed them on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and burned them in their caves, who neither resisted their enemies, nor closed up the mouths of their Caves, supposing it to be a violation of the Sabbath, if they should fight or work upon that day; some thousands of men, women and children were there stifled; yet divers escaped, who joined themselves with <hi>Matthias,</hi> and chose him for their Captain. Then did he inform them, that they ought to fight on the Sabbath day, if they were assailed by their enemies, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with them not to be guilty of their own death, by their neglect to defend themselves; and so having assembled a sufficient number, he destroyed the Altars, and slew those that had forsaken their Religion: commanding others to circumcise their Children, and driving those from every place, whom <hi>Antiochus</hi> had set to see his Laws executed. But when he had thus governed one year, he fell sick, and perceiving his end to approach, he called his sons, and exhorted them to follow his steps in maintaining the Law of God,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Nicanor</hi> slain.</note> and by sound of trumpet, giving notice to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring places, the inhabitants thereof betook themselves to their weapons, and meeting those that fled, they slew them, so that no one escaped from this battel, though they were at least nine thousand men.</p>
               <p>Then ensued a little peace to the <hi>Jews.</hi> Shortly after <hi>Alcimus</hi> the High-priest, intending to beat down an old wall of the Sanctuary, was suddenly striken by God, became speechless, and fell to the ground, and having endured many grievous torments for many dayes,<note place="margin">A just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> he died miserably. Then did the people by a generall consent give his place to <hi>Judas</hi>: who hearing of the great power and victories of the <hi>Romans,</hi> sent two of his intimate friends to <hi>Rome,</hi> to intreate the <hi>Romans</hi> to be their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Confederates,<note place="margin">

               <p>The Embassadors coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> were intertained by the Senate, and friendship concluded betwixt them, upon these conditions; That none under the <hi>Romans</hi> should war against the <hi>Jews,</hi>

               <head>CHAP. V. The Martyrdom of the <hi>Maccabees.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHilst <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> was living, he thrust out <hi>Onias</hi> the High-Priest from his Office, and put into his room <hi>Jason</hi> his brother, whereupon <hi>Jason</hi> promised to pay him yearly three thousand six hundred and sixty Talents of silver. This wicked <hi>Jason</hi> presently forced all the people to forsake their Religion, and to build Baths: He hindered the defence and building of the Temple. Hereat God was very wroth, and stirred up <hi>Antiochus</hi> to go to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where he was gallantly entertained by the <hi>Jews.</hi> Then did he presently make an Edict, That whosoever of the <hi>Jews</hi> refused to offer Sacrifice to the gods,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Antiochus</hi> his cruel Edict.</note> he should presently be broken to pieces on the wheel. But those that were godly did little esteem that Edict.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> perceiving that the rigour of his Edict prevailed little, and that many chose rather to die,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> then to forsake their Religion, he sitting in an eminent place, and calling all the <hi>Jews</hi> together, caused swines-flesh to be sacrificed on the Altar, and to be offered to every <hi>Hebrew</hi> to eat. Amongst the multitude thus assembled, there was one <hi>Eleazer,</hi> a Priest a man that feared God, and one who was very aged, of a reverend countenance,<note place="margin">Subtilty.</note> and famous for his vertue; To him <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> said, <hi>Be advised by me, holy old man, to avoid those torments which are prepared for the obstinate; preserve thy reverend age, and contemn not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of life; take the sacrifice, and eat of the swines-flesh, for no wise man will credit the Jews opinion to refuse that meat which nature hath ordained for mans use, as well as any other: Why should this beast be more abominable then others?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Or, suppose your Laws are to be observed, yet will they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse thee, seeing thou sinnest not voluntarily, but by compulsion?</hi>
To whom <hi>Eleazer</hi> answered;<note place="margin">Courage.</note> 
                  <q>We, O <hi>Antiochus,</hi> follow not vanity, but the verity of Religion, and fear of torments cannot make us embrace another: but suppose that the Religion left us by our fore-fathers had no firm ground, yet should not torments make me forsake it. Do not esteem it a small matter to eat forbidden meat, and to taste of that which is sacrificed to Idols; for it is a profane thing to touch things that are prophane, and we are taught by our Law to suffer with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whatsoever, for Gods cause, is inflicted upon us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I refuse this profane meat, well knowing what I ought to eat, as warranted by Gods Law, which I have learned to obey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and herein will I persist, though with tyrannous hand thou pluck out mine eyes, or with a sharp knife rip up my entrails. Think not that because I am old, my body is feeble: If I must be sacrificed for Gods sake, thou shalt find me as lusty, and constant as a young man, and most joyfull in torments. Prepare an extraordinary fire, or what else thou pleasest, thou shalt find me more constant in the midst of all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41459:18"/>
torments, then I am now before they come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The chaste, and pure company of Fathers shall receive me into their number, where I shall not fear (O impious King) thy threats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Whilst <hi>Eleazer</hi> spake thus boldly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eleazer</hi> cruelly beaten.</note> the souldiers haled him to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, and stripping him naked, they hanged him up, and whipped him: and whilst on either side he was thus beaten, one cryed, Obey the Kings pleasure and command. But this worthy man was not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by torment, but suffered as though he had been in a sleep: and fixing his venerable eyes upon Heaven, he knew in whom he believed, and to whom he sacrificed his life, and beholding the flesh on each side of his body rent and torn with stripes, and the bloud issuing out abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, he admired his own patience, and thanked God the author of it: At last finding his own frailty, scarce able to endure such torments, he fell upon his face, which with stripes was all rent, and torne,<note place="margin">His admirable patience.</note> still glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying God, as he did before: Then a souldier, to gratifie the King like a mad man, did spurn, and tread upon him, to encrease his sufferings: but <hi>Eleazer,</hi> strong in body and minde, like a Champion of the true God, did never shrink at those pains, but by patience overcame the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of his tormentors; so that his torturers admired that he should be able to bear them: Then the Kinges Officers said, <hi>How long wilt thou forbear to obey the King? eat Swines flesh and free thy self from all that thou endurest.</hi>
                  <hi>Eleazer,</hi> though hitherto he had been silent in all his torments, yet could he not hear such profane counsel without answering, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he cryed out; <q>We <hi>Hebrews</hi> are not so effeminate as to forsake the way of salvation wherein we walk to our old-age,<note place="margin">His zeal.</note> neither are we taught for feare of contumely, which will not long endure, to give others an occasion, and example to sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wilt thou, O Tyrant, esteem of us if we should yield unto thee? nay, thou mightst justly reprove our inconstancy:</q>
Then did the souldiers, by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, cast him into the fire, and poured stinking, and loathsome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors into his nostrils, all which he patiently suffered, till he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed in the flames:
Yet when nature began to fail, lifting up his daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led eyes to Heaven, he said, <q>Thou, O God, art he from whom life, and salvation proceedeth: Behold I die for observing thy Laws: Be mercifull to this thy Nation,<note place="margin">His prayer at death.</note> and forsake not them whom hitherto thou hast protected in thy bosom, and under the shadow of thy wings, let my death end all misery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> and so he joyfully yielded up the ghost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> was but more incensed hereby, and therefore he caused seven Children of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to be brought to <hi>Antioch,</hi> who being young, and therefore, as he thought, weak, and unable to endure tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he presumed that either by perswasion, or fear, he should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them to forsake their Religion.</p>
               <p>Then he commanded these seven, together with their mother <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona</hi> now aged, to be brought before him: They were of excellent beauty, and worthy children of so vertuous a mother. The Tyrant beholding them, with a merry countenance, craftily spake unto them:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41459:19"/>
                  <hi>I wish your good, O admirable young men, do not therefore like mad men resist my commands:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Antiochus</hi> his subtilty.</note> 
                  <hi>Avoid not only torments, but death also: I desire not only to exalt you to honour, but to encrease your riches, and possessions: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn therefore your own superstition, and embrace our Religion: If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse this (as I hope you will not) I will devise all torments, that by a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring, and painfull death, I may consume you:</hi> And to terrifie them the more, he caused all sorts of Instruments for torment to be brought forth before them, as Wheels, Rods, Hooks, Racks, Cauldrons, Cages, Gridirons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with Engines to torment the fingers, and hands, as Gauntlets, Auls, Bellows, Brazen-pots, and Frying-pans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then said he, <hi>Obey me, O prudent young men, for if I command that which is a sin, yet do not you offend, being compelled to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But these holy young men, inflamed with a divine spirit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned these torments, and despised both threats and flateries, denying to eat of the sacrificed Swines flesh, and saying:
<q>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">The seven bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns courage</note> O Tyrant, dost thou persecute us that are innocent? We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to die, and will, till death expels life, firmly keep that which God commanded and <hi>Moses</hi> taught us: and therefore seek not, O Tyrant to seduce us by protesting thy unfeigned love: Thou lover of in justice, master of cruelty, deviser of iniquity, the pardon thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrest is more painfull to us then punishments: We contemn death, and esteem not thy words, our master <hi>Eleazer</hi> having taught us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise them. Why dost thou expect such pusillanimity in us young men, when of late thou foundest such courage in an old man? Thou canst not know our minds except by tearing our bodies thou searchest them out: We will willingly for our God suffer any thing, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Heaven, whilst thou for thy cruelty to innocents, shalt be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to eternal fire.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Tyrant greatly moved herewith, caused them to be beaten with Buls-pizels: first commanding <hi>Maccabeus</hi> the eldest to be stripped, and stretched out upon a Rack,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Maccabeus</hi> his torments.</note> and his hands to be bound, and so to be most cruelly beaten, who so wearied his tormentors by sufferring, that they rather desired to give over, then he requested it: Then was he put upon a Wheel, and a weight hanged at his feet, and so stretched round about it, that his sinews and entrails brake, yet all this while he called upon God:<note place="margin">His resolute speech.</note> and then said to the Tyrant:
<q>O bloudy Tyrant, who persecutest the Majesty of God; I whom thou thus tormentest, am no witch, nor murtherer, but one who dies for observing Gods Law:</q>
And when the tormentors, overcome with compassion, willed him to submit to the Kinges pleasure, he said;
<q>O ye wicked ministers of Tyranny! Your Wheels are not so sharp and cruel, that I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by will be forced to forsake Heaven, whereon my minde is fixed: Tear my flesh, yea if you please, rost it at the fire: torture each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of my body with severall cruelties, yet you shall not be able to force us young men to impiety.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note>As he thus spake, a fire was kindled, &amp; he thus racked on the Wheel, was thrown into it, and by flames was so burned that his bowels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41459:19"/>
yet was his minde unmoved, and in the midst of his torments he cryed thus to his brethren;
<q>O beloved brethren, make me your example; despise the alluring baits of this world; obey God rather then this Tyrant,<note place="margin">His speech at death.</note> who can if he please humble the proud and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and exalt the dejected:</q>
Then was he taken from the fire; and slain alive; his tongue was pulled out of his head, and he put into a frying pan, and so he departed out of this life, to the admiration of his enemies, and the joy of his mother, and brethren.</p>
               <p>Then was the second brother, called <hi>Aber,</hi> haled by the souldiers; and the Tyrant shewed him all those instruments of torment, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him if he would eat of the sacrifice? which he, denying to do,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Abers</hi> tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> his hands were bound with iron chains, and being hanged up thereby, the skin of his body was slain from the crown of his head to his knees, so that the entrails in his brest were seen: Then was he cast to a cruel <hi>Libard,</hi> greedily thirsting after blood, but the beast smelling at him,<note place="margin">Or Leopard.</note> forgat his cruelty, and went from him, without doing him any harm: This increased the Tyrants rage, and <hi>Aber</hi> by his torments grew more constant, crying aloud,
<q>O how pleasant is that death to me, which is caused by all sorts of torments for Gods sake! yea,<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  </q>
And so shortly after he yielded up his soul to God.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Machir</hi> the third son was brought, whom all pitied,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Machir</hi> brought forth.</note> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted by his brothers examples to forsake his opinion, and so decline the punishment; but he being angry at such Counsel, replied,
<q>One Father begat us, one Mother bore us, one Master instructed us,<note place="margin">His courage.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore no longer prolong the time in vain; I came to suffer, not to speak, use all the Tyranny that possibly you can against my body yet have you no power over my soul.</q>
This so moved the Tyrant, that he devised new torments beyond the reach of humane wit; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a globe to be brought, he caused him to be tied about it in such sort, that all his bones were put out of joint,<note place="margin">His torments.</note> hanging one from another in a most pitifull manner; yet was the holy Martyr nothing dismaid; then the skin of his head and face was pulled off, and then was he put upon the wheel, but he could be racked no worse, for all his bones were dislocated before; the blood issuing from him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, he said,
<q>We, O Tyrant, endure this torment for the love of God, and thou the Author of such cruelty,<note place="margin">His speech at death.</note> shalt be punished with everlasting pain;</q>
Then was his tongue cut out, and he being put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fiery frying pan, resigned his spirit unto God.</p>
               <p>Next followed <hi>Judas</hi> the fourth brother, whom all the people per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41459:20"/>
to obey the King:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Judas</hi> his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> But he said,
<q>Your fire shall not separate me from the Law of God, nor from my brethren; To thee, O Tyrant, I denounce destruction, but to such as believe, salvation: Try me thou cruel wretch, and see if God will not stand by me, as he did by my three brethren now in glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
The cruel Tyrant hearing this, was so inraged, that he leaped down from his chaire to torment this Martyr himselfe;<note place="margin">His torments.</note> He commanded also his tongue to be cut out, to whom <hi>Judas</hi> said,
<q>Thy cruelty will nothing avail thee, our God needs not by voice to be awaked,<note place="margin">His speech at death.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he heareth such as call upon him with their hearts, and know's our thoughts afar off, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Cut out my tongue if thou please, would thou wouldst so sanctifie all the parts of my body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and think not that thou shalt long escape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished:</q>
Then was his tongue cut out, and he bound to a stake, was beaten with ropes ends, which torments he bore with admirable pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: After which he was put upon the wheel, where he ended his life, and went to the rest of his brethren.</p>
               <p>Then spake <hi>Achas</hi> the fift brother,
<q>Behold, O Tyrant, I come to be punished before thou commandest me,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Achas</hi> his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> therefore hope not to alter his minde that desireth to be tormented: The bloud of my innocent brethren hath condemned thee to hell, I shall make up the fift, that by it thy torments may be increased: What offence have we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that thou thus ragest against us? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All that thou canst al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge against us is, that we honour God and live in obedience to his Laws, and therefore we esteem not punishment, which is an honour to us; though no part of us be left untormented, yet we shall be the more rewarded by God.</q>
Then at the command of the Kings the executioner cast him into a brazen pot,<note place="margin">His torments.</note> where he was prest down with his head to his feet, and afterwards he sufferred all the torments inflicted on his brethren, but he was so far from being discouraged, that suddenly starting up,<note place="margin">His speech at death.</note> he said,
<q>Cruel Tyrant, how great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits dost thou (though against thy will) bestow upon us! yea the more thou ragest, the more acceptable to God shalt thou make us; therefore I shall be sorry if thou shewest me any mercy: by this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall death, I shall go to everlasting life.</q>
And having thus finished his sufferings, he died.</p>
               <p>Then was <hi>Areth</hi> the sixt brother brought, to whom the Tyrant proferred the choise of honour,<note place="margin">

<q>O Tyrant, though I be younger in years then my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, yet the constancy of my minde is not inferiour; as we have lived, so we will die together in the fear of God: Hasten therefore thy torments, and what time thou wouldest spend in exhorting me, spend it in devising torments for me.</q>
Whereupon <hi>Antiochus</hi> in a rage, commanded him to be tied to a pillar with his head downwards: Then caused he a fire to be made at such a distance,<note place="margin">His torments.</note> as might not burn, but rost him: Then he made them prick him with awles, that the heat might pierce the sorer: In these torments much bloud, like froth, gathered about his head and face;<note place="margin">His speech at death.</note> yet said he,

I willingly follow them, that as by blood I am conjoyned to them, so by death I may not be separated from them. Devise, O Tyrant, some new torment, for I have overcome these already: O Master of cruelty, enemy of piety, and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Justice! we young men have conquered thy power, thy fire is cold, and heateth not: thy weapons are bended, and blunted in our bodies; our God giveth us more courage to suffer, then thou hast to punish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
As he thus spake, they pulled out his tongue with an hot pair of tongs, and lastly frying him in a frying pan, he gave up the ghost.</p>
               <p>There being now only the youngest brother left, called <hi>Jacob,</hi> he,<note place="margin">

                  </note> presenting himself before the Tyrant, moved him to some compassion, wherefore he called the Child to him, and taking him aside by the hand, he said, <hi>By the example of thy brethren thou seest what to expect if thou disobeyest me; therefore deliver thy self from these torments, and I will give thee what honour my Kingdom can afford: thou shalt be a Ruler, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of my Army, my Counceller</hi> &amp;c. But when this prevailed not, he called his mother, who coming, and standing by her son, the Tyrant said to her, <hi>O worthy woman, where now are all thy Children? yet thou hast one remaining; advise him therefore not to ruine himself, and to leave thee childless by his obstinacy,</hi> &amp;c. The mother bowing her self to the King, said to her child in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> that she might not be understood of others,
<q>Pity and comfort thy sorrowfull mother, O my son,<note place="margin">His mother encourageth him.</note> who bare thee nine moneths in my womb, gave thee suck with my brests three years, and with great care have brought thee up hitherto. I pray thee, dear son, consider the heavens and earth, and remember that God created them all of nothing, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> fear not therefore these pains and torments, but imitate thy brethren, and contemn death, that in the day of mercy I may receive thee with thy brethren again in heaven.</q>
Then did he desire to be unbound, which being granted, he immediately ran to the torments,<note place="margin">His noble cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> and coming where was a frying pan red hot, he said to the King;
<q>Cruel Tyrant, I now know thee, not only to have been cruel to my brethren, but even cruelty it self. Wretch that thou art, who gave thee these purple robes? who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted thee to thy Kingdom? Even he whom thou in us dost perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, whose servants thou tormentest and killest, for which thy self shalt suffer eternal torments; though thou art above others, yet he that made other men, made thee also of the same nature, for all are born, and must die alike. He that kils another, sheweth that he himself may be killed; thou tearest and tormentest thine own Image all in vain? In thy fury thou killest him, whom God created like thy self, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thou pullest out our tongues, tearest our bodies with flesh-hooks, and consumest us with fire; but they that have already suffered, have received everlasting joyes, and everlasting punishments attend thee. Think not that I expect any favour, I will follow my

brethren, and remain constant in keeping Gods Law.</q>
The Tyrant herewith inraged, caused him to be tormented; but his mother com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him, and with her kind hands held his head, when through violence of the torturers,<note place="margin">His torments.</note> the blood issued out of his mouth, nose, and privy parts; the tormentors not ceasing till his life was almost spent; but then giving over, God gave him strength to recover, and to endure more then any of his brethren had done. At last his hands and arms being cut off, with his eyes lift up to heaven, he cryed,
<q>O <note n="*" place="margin">Lord. His last words.</note> 
                     <hi>Adonai.</hi> be mercifull unto me, and receive me into the company of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Then was his tongue pulled out, and he of his own accord going into the fiery frying pan, to the great admirarion of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> died.</p>

                     <hi>Salamona</hi>'s zeal.</note>The mother seeing all her Children dead, was inflamed with a holy zeal to suffer Martyrdom also; and despising the Tyrants threats, she offered her motherly brest to those torments which her Children had suffered before her. Indeed herein she excelled them all, in that she had suffered seven painfull deaths, before she came to suffer in her own person, and feared in every one of them, lest she should have been overcome. She alone with dry eyes did look upon them whilst they were torn in pieces, yea, she exhorted them thereunto, rejoycing to see one torn with flesh-hooks, another racked upon the wheel, a third bound and beaten, a fourth burned, and yet she exhorted the rest not to be terrified thereby; and though her grief in beholding their torments was greater then that which she had in child-birth, yet did she frame a chearfull countenance, as if it had been one triumphing, wishing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the torments of their bodies then of their souls; for she knew that nothing was more frail then our lives, which are often taken away by Agues, Fluxes, and a thousand other ways. Therefore when they were first apprehended, she thus exhorted them in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue,
<q>O my most dear and loving Children,<note place="margin">Her speech to her Children.</note> let us hasten to that Agony which may credit our profession, and be rewarded by God with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. Let us fearlesly present our bodies to those torments which aged <hi>Eleazer</hi> endured.

                  </q>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> being enraged against her, caused her to be stripped naked,<note place="margin">Her torments and death.</note> hanged up by the hands, and cruelly whipt: then were her dugs and paps pulled off, and her self put into the red hot frying pan; where lifting up her eyes and hands to heaven, in the midst of her prayers she yielded up her chast soul unto God. But God suffered not the cruel Tyrant to escape unpunished, for in his wars against the <hi>Persians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See more of this before.</note> the Lord struck him with madness, his intrals were devoured with worms, and stinking like a Carrion, in the extremity of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he gave up the ghost.</p>
               <p>Concerning this <hi>Antiochus,</hi> Daniel, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.9, 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> saw in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that there <hi>came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

And shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods heavy Judgement fell upon him by a grievous sickness, which was a slow and slack fire in his inward parts; and withal, he had a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy appetite after food, and yet nothing sufficed him; he had also a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his Bowels, and a greivous flux in his fundament; a moist and running humour about his feet,<note place="margin">

He had a short and stinking breath, with a great pain in breathing; and through all the parts of his body such a violent cramp, as humane strength was not able to endure. Yet longing after life, he sent for Physitians from all parts, by whose advice he went to the hot bathes of <hi>Calliroe</hi>; but finding no ease there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, his torments still encreasing, he sought to lay violent hands upon himself, if he had not been prevented by his friends, and so in extream misery, he ended his wretched life.</p>

               <p>After this there was a general persecution raised up against the Church of Christ in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> whereby all the faithfull were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad throughout the Regions of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> except the Apostles, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Saul also made great havock of the Church, entring into every house, haling both men and women, and committing them to prison,</hi> verse 3.</p>

Then did they set him upon a Pinacle of the Temple, again requiring him in the audience of all the people, to tell them which is the way of Jesus crucified; to whom he answered, <hi>Why ask you me of</hi> Jesus <hi>the son of man, when as he sits at the right hand of God in Heaven, and shall again come in the clouds of the air?</hi> this so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Scribes and Pharisees, that they threw him down head-long; but he not being dead with the fall, gat upon his knees, and said, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do:</hi> Then one taking a Fullers Club, struck him on the head, and brained him.<note place="margin">The Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>James.</hi>

               <p>THis first Persecution was begun by <hi>Domitius Nero,</hi> the sixt Emperour, <hi>Anno</hi> 67. or thereabouts: the occasion whereof was this;<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Nero</hi> having passed over the first five years of his reign somewhat plausibly, he then began to fall to all manner of prodigious impieties: and amongst other wicked designs, he had a great desire to consume the stately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial City of <hi>Rome</hi> with fire; pronouncing King <hi>Priamus</hi> an happy man, because he beheld the end of his Kingdom and Countrey toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>yea,</hi> said he, <hi>let not all be ruined when I am dead, but whilst I am yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nero</hi> sets <hi>Rome</hi> on fire.</note> and for the effecting of this villany, he sent divers to kindle the fire in sundry places; yea, some of his own bed-chamber were seen to carry Flax, Toe, Torches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to further it: and when any attempted to quench it, they were threatned for it; others openly hurled fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands, crying, <hi>They knew what they did, there was one would bear them out.</hi> This fire first began amongst the Oyl-men and Drugsters; The night-watch and <hi>Praetorian</hi> guards did openly cherish it; and when it was throughly kindled, <hi>Nero</hi> went up to the top of <hi>Maecenas</hi> Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which over-looked the whole City, where he fed himself with the sight of infinite burnings, and sang to his harp, the burning of <hi>Troy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Circus</hi> burnt down.</note>Amongst other stately buildings that were burned down, the <hi>Circus,</hi> or race-yard was one, being about half a mile in length, of an oval
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41459:24"/>
form, with rows of seats one above another, capable to receive at least a hundred and fifty thousand Spectators without uncivil shouldrings: but the particulars were innumerable, the damage inestimable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides which, many thousands of people perished; the flame and smoak smothered some, the weight of ruins crusht others, the fire consumed others; others threw themselves into the fire out of sorrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, and villains slew many.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Nero</hi> finding that this fire, which continued burning nine dayes, brought a great <hi>Odium</hi> upon him; to excuse himself, he transferred the fault upon the Christians, as if out of malice they had done it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nero</hi> charged it upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</note> and thereupon he raised this first persecution against them. For there was at this present a flourishing Church of Christians in <hi>Rome,</hi> even before St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s arrival there,<note place="margin">Raiseth the first Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and <hi>Nero</hi>'s own Court was secretly gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and enriched with some of those Diamons, whose salutations the Apostle remembers in his Epistle to the <hi>Philippians.</hi> But whilst <hi>Nero</hi> with their blood, sought to quench and cover his own infamy, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to himself new envy; whilst many that abhorred Christians for their Religion, commiserated their sufferings as undeserved. Some he caused to be sewed up in the skins of wild beasts, and then worried them to death with dogs: some he crucified, others he burnt in publick,<note place="margin">Several kinds of torments.</note> to furnish his evening sports with Bonefires. Many he caused to be packed up in paper stiffened in molten wax, with a coat of sear-cloth about their bodies, bound upright to Axletrees, many of which were pitcht in the ground, and so set on fire at the bottom, to maintain light for <hi>Nero</hi>'s night-sports in his gardens. Some of them were gored in length upon stakes, the one end fastened in the earth, the other thrust into their fundaments, and coming out at their mouths.</p>
               <p>Nor did this Persecution rage in <hi>Rome</hi> alone, but it was extended generally over the whole Empire,<note place="margin">Beastly cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> insomuch that a man might then have seen Cities lie full of mens bodies, the old lying there together with the young, and the dead bodies of women cast out naked in the open streets, without all reverence of their sex. Yea his rage and malice was so great, that he endeavoured to have rooted out the very name of Christians in all places. Whereupon <hi>Tertullian</hi> said, <hi>That it could be no ordinary goodness which</hi> Nero <hi>condemned; and,</hi> saith he, <hi>We glory on the behalf of our sufferings, that they had such a dedicator as he</hi>:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tertullians</hi> speech.</note> but this great Persecution, like a blast, did spread the Religion that it blew, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving continued four years from the first rising, is expired in two most shining blazes, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Martyrdom of the two great Apostles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul: Peter</hi> was crucified with his head down-wards, which manner of death himself made choice of, and whilst he thus hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross, he saw his wife going to her Martyrdom, whereupon he much rejoyced; and calling her by her name, he bad her remember the Lord Jesus Christ. At the same time, also <hi>Paul,</hi> before <hi>Nero,</hi> made a confession of his faith, and of the Doctrine which he taught;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> martyred.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was condemned to be beheaded, and the Emperor sent two of his Esquires, <hi>Ferega</hi> and <hi>Parthemius,</hi> to bring him word of his death:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41459:25"/>
they coming to <hi>Paul,</hi> heard him instruct the people, and thereupon desired him to pray for them that they might believe; who told them, that shortly after they should believe and be baptized: then the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers led him out of the City to the place of execution, where he prayed, and then gave his neck to the sword, and so was beheaded. This was done in the fourteenth, which was the last year of <hi>Nero.</hi>

Having also heard some rumors of Christs Kingdom, he was afraid, as <hi>Herod</hi> had been before him; and thereupon commanded all of the linage of <hi>David</hi> to be sought out and slain; At last two poor Christians that came of <hi>Judas,</hi> the brother of Christ according to the flesh, were brought before <hi>Domitian,</hi> and accused to be of the Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> and of the line of <hi>David:</hi> Then did the Emperour demand of them what stock of money and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they had; To whom they answered, that they two had not above thirty nine Acres of land, out of which they payed Tribute, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved themselves by their labour and industry, withal shewing him their hard and brawny hands, by reason of their labour. Then did he ask them of Christ, and of his Kingdom; to whom they answered, that Christs Kingdom was not of this world, but spiritual and celestial; and that he would come at the last day to judge the quick and the dead. Hereupon he despised them as simple and contemptible persons, and so dismissed them. He punished an infinite company of Christians that were famous in the Church, with exile, and loss of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Under this persecution it was that St. <hi>John,</hi> the beloved Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">St. <hi>John</hi> put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to boiling oyl.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41459:25"/>
released under <hi>Pertinax</hi>: At which time he returned to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where he lived till he was a hundred and twenty years old. During his abode there, he was requested to repaire to some place not farre off, to order their Ecclesiasticall affairs; and being in a certain City, he beheld in the Congregation a young man, mighty of body,<note place="margin">An excellent story <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But having by this means more liberty then before, some of his old companions began to resort unto him; who first drew him forth to sumptuous and riotous banquets; then inticed him to go abroad with them in the nights to rob and steal, and to much other wickedness. And he being of a good wit, and stout courage, ran like an unbridled horse to all manner of disorders and outrage: And associating to himself many loose and dissolute companions, he became their Head and Captain, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all kindes of murther and felonies. Not long after, upon some urgent occasions, St <hi>John</hi> was again sent for into those parts, where having decided those controversies, and dispatched those busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses for which he came, meeting with the afore-mentioned Bishop, he required of him the pledge, which before Christ and the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he had committed to his custody. The Bishop herewith ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, supposing that he meant it of some money committed to him, which yet he had not received, not daring to contradict the Apostle, he thereupon stood mute: Then <hi>John</hi> perceiving that he was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, said, <hi>The young man, and the soul of our brother committed to your custody, I do require.</hi> Whereupon the Bishop with many tears said, <hi>He is dead</hi>: To whom <hi>John</hi> replyed, <hi>How, and by what death?</hi> The Bishop answered, <hi>He is dead to God, for he is become a wicked and vicious man, and a thief, and now he doth frequent these mountains, with a company of thieves and villains like himself,</hi> &amp;c. The Apostle, rending his garments with a great lamentation, said, <hi>I left a good keeper of my brothers soul; get me an horse and guide presently</hi>; which being done, he went strait to the mountains, and was no sooner come thither, but he was taken by the thieves that watched for their prey, to whom he said, <hi>I came hither for this cause, Lead me to your Captain:</hi> and so being brought before him, the Captain all armed, looked fiercely upon him, and soon coming to the knowledge of him, he was striken with such shame and confusion, that he began to flie, but the old man followed him as fast as he could, crying, <hi>My son why dost thou flie from thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? an armed man from one naked? a young man from an old man? Have pity upon me my son: and feare not, there is yet hope of salvation, I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

for thee to Christ, I will die for thee if need be, as Christ died for us, I will give my life for thee; Believe me, Christ hath sent me.</hi> He hearing these things, first as in a maze, stood still, lost his courage, cast down his weapons, then trembled, and vvept bitterly, and coming to the old man, he embraced him with many tears, only his right hand he kept hid and covered. Then the Apostle, after he had promised and assured him that he should obtain pardon of our Saviour, falling upon his knees, he prayed for him, kissing his murthering right hand, vvhich for shame he durst not shevv before, and then brought him back to the Congregation, where he fasted and prayed continually for him, comforted and confirmed him with many Scripture-promises, and left him not, till he had restored him to his former Office, and made him a great example of Gods Mercy to repentant sinners.</p>

                  <hi>DOmitian</hi> being slain by some of his own servants, <hi>Nerva</hi> succeeded him, who was a good and mercifull man, stayed the persecution against the Christians, called them home from banishment, so that the Church enjoyed peace in his time, but he reigning only thirteen moneths, <hi>Trajan</hi> a Spaniard succeeded him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Trajans</hi> perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> who in the tenth year of his reign, raised the third persecution against the Church, which was far more cruel then either of the former; inasmuch as <hi>Plinius Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> an heathen Philosopher,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> writes in the Christians behalf.</note> seeing the lamentabte slaughter of the Christians, moved with pity, he wrote to <hi>Trajan</hi> concerning the same; that whereas there were many thousands of them daily put to death, there were none of them which did any thing contrary to the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws worthy of persecution, saving that they used to gather together in the morning before day, and sing Hymns to a certain God that they vvorshipped, called Christ; in other things they were godly and honest; and for proof hereof, saith he, <hi>I caused two Maidens to be laid on the rack, and with torments to be examined about the same; but finding nothing in them but only lewd and immoderate superstition, I resolved to surcease further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, till I received further instructions from you about this matter.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Christianity accounted su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Trajan</hi> having read this Epistle; returned answer, that it was his mind, that the Christians should not be sought after, but if they were brought and convicted, that then they should suffer execution:<note place="margin">

commotion was raised in any of them, then presently were the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians blamed for it. <hi>Trajan</hi> sent a command to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever could be found out of the stock of <hi>David,</hi> should be enquired for,<note place="margin">The stock of <hi>David</hi> sought for.</note> and put to death; hereupon some Sectaries of the Jewish nation, accused <hi>Simeon</hi> the son of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> to come of <hi>Davids</hi> line, and that he was a Christian: of which Accusers it happened, that some of them were taken to be of the stock of <hi>David,</hi> and so most righteously were executed themselves who sought the destruction of others.

               <p>AFter the death of that quiet and mild Prince <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> his son M. <hi>Antoninus Verus</hi> succeeded in the Empire, a stern and severe man by nature, who raised the fourth persecution against the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; wherein a great number of them, who truly professed Christ, suffered most cruel punishments and torments especially in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> amongst whom was <hi>Polycarp</hi> Bishop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> who was burnt at a stake at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> together with twelve others that came from <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> Also <hi>Germanicus</hi> a young man,<note place="margin">

sued out a bill of Divorce, and so was separated from him; then did this malicious wretch accuse her to be a Christian,<note place="margin">Malice.</note> which was no lesse then death, whereupon she being in great perill, delivered up a suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Emperour, craving but so much favour, that she might go and set her family in order, and then she would be ready to answer to all such crimes as should be objected against her: This petition the Emperour granted; Her husband perceiving that he was frustrated of his expectation, went and accused <hi>Ptolemaeus</hi> (who was her instructer in the faith of Christ) that he was a Christian.<note place="margin">

               <p>Many others also suffered Martyrdom at the same time, because they sharply reprehended Idolatry, and refused at the Emperors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to offer sacrifice to Idols, for which they were beheaded.</p>

               <p>In <hi>Troada, Nicomachus</hi> being grievously tormented, cryed out, I am no Christian; and so being let down from the Engine, he had no sooner sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to the Idols, but being possessed by the devil, he was thrown on the ground, where he bit off his own tongue, and immediately after died; Many others which shewed the like cowardise,<note place="margin">Danger of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy.</note> were taken and tormented with wicked spirits: One was struck dumb: A maid taken with a wicked spirit, tore out her own tongue, and died with grievous torments in her belly, and inward parts: But though some did thus fall away, yet others there were, whom neither fear,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> nor pain could remove from their stedfastness, but they continued glorious Martyrs to the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> relates a story of one of his fellow-Ministers, who in the midst of his torments began to faint, being greatly afraid of death, and desired to be released:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> Vision.</note> at which time there appeared to him a young man of admirable beauty, and so bright, that mans mortal eye could scarce endure to behold him, who angerly said to him, <hi>Pati timetis, exire non vultis, quid faciam vobis?</hi> To suffer you dare not, to go out you will not, what would you have me do unto you?<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Novatian</hi> schism.</note>

               <p>In this Persecution there sprung up the <hi>Novatian</hi> Schism, which made a great disturbance in the Church. This <hi>Novatus</hi> being a Minister under <hi>Cyprian</hi> in <hi>Carthage,</hi> by stirring up discord and factions, bred
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41459:36"/>
much trouble to the Church, seeking to withdraw certain of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren from the Bishop: And afterwards <hi>Novatus</hi> going to <hi>Rome,</hi> set up himself as a Bishop,<note place="margin">Pride the cause of schism.</note> against <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the then Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>; And to further his design, he by subtilty allured to him three or four holy men that had been Confessors; Then he entised three weak Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops that lived in <hi>Italy,</hi> to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there perswaded them by imposing hands upon him, to make him Bishop; for which fact, two of them afterwards were suspended, and the third upon his repentance vvas re-admitted. <hi>Novatus</hi> being thus made a Bishop, grew proud, and sought by all means to with-draw the people from <hi>Cornelius</hi> to himself; yea, he made many of them to swear that they would not leave him to go to <hi>Cornelius.</hi> But the holy Confessors before mentioned, vvhen they perceived the crafty subtilty of <hi>Novatus,</hi> left him, and much grieving for their sin, were reconciled to <hi>Cornelius</hi> again. <hi>Novatus</hi> held this opinion, that they which once renounced the faith, and for fear of torments had offered incense to the Idols, although they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,<note place="margin">A Synod against <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
                  </note> yet could never be re-admitted into the Church of Christ again. To suppress this error, there was a Synod called at <hi>Rome</hi> of sixty Bishops, <hi>Anno</hi> 255. who condemned it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> also relates of <hi>Aurelius,</hi> a godly and valiant young man, who for his constancy in the cause of Christ,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aurelius.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>Decius</hi> the Author of this persecution, escaped not the revenging hand of God, for warring against the <hi>Goths,</hi> and being overcome by them,<note place="margin">Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.</note> lest he should fall into their hands, he leaped vvith his horse into a whirlpit, where he was drowned, and his body was never found after.

Their feet are fettered with chains, but he is bound of man, whom the Lord Christ doth loose; he lies tied in the stocks, whose feet thereby are made swifter to run to heaven; neither can any man tie a Christian so fast, but he runs so much the faster for his garland of life. They have no garments to save them from cold, but he that puts on Christ is sufficiently clothed. Doth bread fail to their hungry bodies? Man lives not by bread alone, but by every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Your defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity shall be turned to honour, your mourning to joy, your pain to pleasure, and felicity infinite. And if this grieve you, that you cannot serve God in your places as formerly, yet your daily sacrifice ceaseth not, which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite and humble heart; and though your travel be great, yet shall your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be greater; for God beholding them which confess his name, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth their willing minds, in their strivings helpeth them, in their victory crowneth them, rewarding that in us which he hath performed, and crowning that which he hath in us perfected.</hi> Again he tells them that they are now in a joyfull journey, hasting apace to the mansions of the Martyrs, there to enjoy, after darkness, durable light, and comfort above all their sufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> About the same time also, <hi>Lucius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was banished.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. The eighth Primitive Persecution which began An. Christi, 259.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>VAlerianus</hi> being seduced by the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Inchanter, as is before related, stirred up the eighth persecution against the Church of Christ;<note place="margin">Sin the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.</note> concerning which <hi>Cyprian</hi> writeth thus;
<q>We must confess that this great calamity which hath wasted for the most part all our Churches, and still dayly consumes us, ariseth chiefly from our own wickedness, while we walk not in the way of the Lord, nor observe his precepts as we ought, whilst we are full of lucre, pride, emulation, dissention, void of simplicity and faithfull dealing, renouncing the world in word, but not in deed, every man pleasing himself, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing others; and therefore we are thus worthily scourged: For what stripes do we not deserve, when the Confessors themselves do keep no Discipline; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Concluding, <hi>Non venissent fratribus haec mala, si in unum fraternitas fuisset animata</hi>; These evils had not happened to the brethren, if they had joyned together in brotherly unanimity.</q>
A little before this persecution began, God by a vision revealed it to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> saying to him, Be quiet and of good comfort, for peace will come;<note place="margin">A Vision.</note> albeit a little stay there is for a while, for that some remain yet to be proved and tried, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The crimes and accusations that were laid to the charge of the Christians,<note place="margin">Christians charged as the causes of all plagues.</note> by the Persecutors, were, that they refused to worship Idols, and the Emperors; and that they professed the name of Christ: Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, all the calamities and evils that happened in the world, as wars, famine, pestilence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were imputed only to the Christians: But <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> confuting those slanders,<note place="margin">Confuted by <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Tertullian.</hi>
                  </note> proved that the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al cause of all those miseries which befell the Empire, proceeded from the cruel shedding of the innocent blood of the Christians. In this persecution, <hi>Cyprian</hi> was at last condemned to have his head cut off,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cyprian</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</note> who patiently and willingly submitted his neck to the stroak of the sword.</p>
               <p>Also about this time, <hi>Sixtus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with his six Deacons, were accused for being Christians,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sixtus</hi> and his Deacons.</note> whereupon being brought to the place of Execution, they were all beheaded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laurence</hi> also another of his Deacons, following <hi>Sixtus</hi> as he went to his Execution, complained that he might not suffer with him, but that he was secluded, as the son from the father: To whom the Bishop answered, that within three days he should follow him, bidding him in the mean time to go home, and if he had any treasures, to distribute them amongst the poor: The Judge hearing mention of treasures, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that <hi>Laurence</hi> had great store in his custody, commanded him to bring the same to him: <hi>Laurence</hi> craved three days respite, promising
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41459:37"/>
then to declare where the treasure might be had: In the mean time he caused a good number of poor Christians to be gathered together,<note place="margin">The courage and constancy of <hi>Laurence.</hi>
                  </note> and when the day of his answer was come, the persecutor strictly charged him to make good his promise; then valiant <hi>Laurence</hi> stretching out his arms over the poor, said, <hi>These are the precious treasures of the Church, these are the treasure indeed in whom Christ hath his mansion,</hi>, &amp;c. But oh! what tongue is able to express the fury and madness of the Tyrants heart! how he stamped, stared, ramped,<note place="margin">The rage of Tyrants.</note> and fared like one out of his wits: his eyes glowed like fire, his mouth foamed like a boar, like a hell-hound he grinded his teeth: then he cryed, kindle the fire, make no spare of wood: hath this Villain deluded the Emperor? away with him, whip him with scourges, jerk him with rods, buffet him with fists, brain him with clubs: Jesteth the Traitor with the Emperor? pinch him with fiery tongs, gird him with burning plates, bring out the strongest chains and fire-forks, and the grate of Iron, set it on the fire, bind the Rebell hand and foot, and when the grate is red hot, on with him, rost him, broil him, toss him, turn him upon pain of our high displeasure, do every man his Office, O ye tormentors. Immediately his command was obeyed, and after many cruel handlings, this meek lamb was laid, I will not say upon a bed of fiery iron, but on a soft down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; so mightily God wrought for his servant, so miraculosly did he temper this Element of fire, that it was not a bed of consuming pain, but of nourishing rest unto <hi>Laurence.</hi> Not <hi>Laurence,</hi> but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror seemed to be tormented, the one broiling in the flesh,<note place="margin">In all these things we are more then Conquerors.</note> the other burning in his heart: when this triumphant Martyr had been pressed down with fire-forks for a great space, in the mighty Spirit of God he spake to the Tyrant thus;</p>
               <l>This side is now rosted enough, turn up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O Tyrant great,</l>
               <l>Assay, whether rosted or raw thou think'st the better meat?</l>
               <p>By the constant confession of this worthy and valiant Deacon, a Roman souldier was converted to the same faith, and desired to be baptized, whereupon he was called before the Judge, scourged, and afterwards beheaded.</p>
               <p>About the same time <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with his three Deacons, were brought before <hi>Emilianus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dionysia.</hi> banished.</note> who told them of the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the Emperor, and therefore required them to sacrifice to his gods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to whom <hi>Dionysius</hi> answered, Divers men worship di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers gods, but we, only that one God who is the Creator of all things, making our prayers to him uncessantly for the health of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then said the President, Why can you not worship your own God and ours also? <hi>Dionysius</hi> replied. We worship only one God, as we have said; the President said, I see you are ingratefull persons, and regard not the Emperors clemency, therefore I banish you to <hi>Cephro</hi> in <hi>Lybia,</hi> and charge you that you convent no more your assemblies, nor be found out of that place at your peril, and though <hi>Dionysius</hi> was sick, yet would he not grant him one days respite before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:41459:38"/>
In <hi>Cephro</hi> he had a great Congregation, as well of those that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in his banishment, as of others that resorted to him out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>; yea, though at first he was persecuted there, and stoned, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a great number of the Inhabitants forsook their Idols,<note place="margin">The power of the Word of God.</note> and were converted unto God by his Ministry; and having accomplished his Ministry there, the Lord removed him to another place. For (saith <hi>Dionysius) Emilianus</hi> translated us from thence to a sharper place of <hi>Lybia,</hi> commanding us to meet all together at the City <hi>Mareota</hi>; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to separate us into several villages, or rather to take us by the way; when we came thither, I was commanded to <hi>Colluthion,</hi> a place which I had never heard of; yet was it some solace to me that the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren told me it was near to the City <hi>Paretonium</hi>: for as my being at <hi>Cephro</hi> gat me the acquaintance of many brethren of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> so I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that the vicinity of that place to the City, might procure me the concourse of certain loving brethren from it, as it came also to pass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He writeth moreover that the number of those which suffered Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom about that time was great, men, women, young men, maidens, old wives, souldiers, and men of all sorts and ages; of whom some with scourgings,<note place="margin">The cruel tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Christians.</note> and fire, and some with the sword, obtained the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and gat the Crown. Neither (saith he) to this day doth the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident cease cruelly murthering such as be brought before him, tearing some with torments, imprisoning others, and commanding that no man should come to them: yet God with the daily resort of the brethren doth comfort the afflicted.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Palestine, Priscus, Malchus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> three godly men, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the valiant courage of the Christians so boldly to venture,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Priscus, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Alexander</hi>
                  </note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to stand, and patiently to suffer in this persecution, as grieved with themselves,<note place="margin">Zeal.</note> began to accuse their own sluggishness and cowardise, to see others so zealovs and valiant, and themselves so cold and faint-hearted, in labouring for the Crown of Martyrdom: whereupon, agreeing amongst themselves, they came to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and stepping to the Judge, they declared themselves to be Christians, and so they were sentenced, and given to the wild beasts.</p>
               <p>A certain woman also in the same place, formerly a Marcionist, being brought before the President, obtained the same Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Carthage</hi> three hundred Christians being brought before the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,<note place="margin">Three hundred Christians put into a lime-kiln.</note> were put to their choice, either to offer sacrifice, or to go into a lime-kiln: whereupon by mutual consent, they all chose the lime-kiln, in which, with the smoak of the lime, they were smothered.</p>
               <p>In another part of <hi>Africk,</hi> three godly Virgins had first vinegar and gall given them to drink,<note place="margin">Three Virgins cruelly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</note> then were they scourged, then tormented upon the gibbet, and rubbed with lime, then were they scorched upon the fiery grid-iron, then cast to the wild beasts, which would not touch them, therefore lastly they were beheaded.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> a godly man was first tormented with the rack, then cast

to the wild beasts, which not hurting him, he was burned in the fire. <hi>Fructuosus</hi> a Bishop in <hi>Spain,</hi> with his two Deacons, having wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed a good confession, were all of them burned in the fire.<note place="margin">

Also <hi>Claudius,</hi> a President and Minister of his persecutions, was possessed by the Devil, and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off his tongue in small pieces, he ended his wretched life. Also there were great &amp; terrible Earth-quakes, and many commotions and Rebellions in sundry parts of the Empire, insomuch as <hi>Galienus,</hi> the son of <hi>Valerian,</hi> and his fellow Emperor, began to relent towards the Christians, and set forth some Edicts in their favour: notwithstanding which, some there were that suffered in sundry places; amongst whom was one <hi>Marinus,</hi> a noble man, and valiant Captain in <hi>Caesarea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marinus.</hi>
                  </note> who stood for an honourable office which of right fell to him, but his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor to prevent him, accused him to the Judge to be a Christian. Hereupon the Judge examined him of his faith, and finding that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was a Christian, he gave him three hours to advise and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with himself; then the Bishop of the place finding that he stood doubtfull in himself what to do, took him by the hand, and led him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, and laid before him a sword and a New Testament, bidding him take his free choice, which of them he would have. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> immediately ran to the New Testament, and chose that, and so being animated by the Bishop, he presented himself boldly before the Judge, by whose sentence he was beheaded.</p>
               <p>About the same time there was in <hi>Caesarea, Asyrius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>AFter the death of <hi>Quintillian,</hi> succeeded <hi>Aurelian</hi> in the Empire, who was by nature severe and rigorous, and a strict punisher of dissolute manners, so that it grew into a Proverb, <hi>That he was a good Physitian, saving that he gave too bitter Medicines.</hi> In the beginning of his reign, he was a moderate and discreet Prince, and no great distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Christians, whom he neither molested in their Religion, nor in their Councels. But afterwards, through sinister suggestions of those which were about him, his nature being before inclinable to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, he was altered to plain Tyranny, which he first shewed in the death of his own sisters son, and afterwards he raised the ninth perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution against the Church of Christ; but when he was about to sign a Proclamation or Edict for that persecution, it pleased God that a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt fell so near him, that all men thought he had been slain, and the Emperor was so terrified thereby,<note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> that he gave over his Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal purpose, so that he rather intended, then moved persecution. Having reigned about six years, he was slain.</p>
               <p>After whose death divers other Emperors succeeded, in whose time the Church had peace for about the space of forty four years. During which time it did mightily increase and flourish: Yea, the more the Christians had suffered, the more they were honoured;<note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Dorotheus,</hi> with his Wife, Children, and whole family, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and highly advanced in the Emperors Court. Yea, <hi>Gorgonius,</hi> and divers others, for their Doctrine and Learning, were with their Princes in great estimation. The Bishops were also in great favour with the Rulers and Presidents where they lived; so that innumerable multitudes and Congregations assembled together in every City, and there were great concourses of such as daily flocked to the publick places of prayer.</p>
               <p>But through this great prosperity, the Christians, by reason of the corruption of their natures, and the temptations of Satan,<note place="margin">Sin the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.</note> began to degenerate, and to grow idle and delicate, striving and contending amongst themselves, upon every occasion, with railing words bespat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering one another in a despitefull manner; Bishops against Bishops, and people against people, moving hatred and sedition each against other: Besides, cursed hypocrisie and dissimulation increased more and more; by reason whereof Gods Judgements brake forth against them, which began first to fall upon those Christians which were souldiers; but that touched the other very little, neither did they seek
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41459:40"/>
to appease Gods wrath, nor to call for Mercy, but thinking that they should escape well enough, they heaped iniquities daily more and more,<note place="margin">Contention amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</note> one upon another. The Pastors being inflamed with mutual contention each against other; Then did the Lord raise up adversaries against his people, that rased their Churches to the ground, burnt the sacred Scriptures in the open Market places, made the Pastors of the Church to hide themselves, and some with great shame were taken Prisoners, and were mocked of their enemies, and put to open reproach.</p>

               <p>These two Emperors having obtained many victories, were so puffed up with pride, that they ordained a solemn Triumph at <hi>Rome.</hi> After which, <hi>Dioclesian</hi> would needs be worshipped as God, saying, that he was brother to the Sun and Moon, and adoring his shoes with gold and precious stones,<note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then also did he raise a great and grievous Persecution against the Church of God: and the Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> drawing nigh, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Churches of the Christians to be spoiled, and cast down, and the books of the holy Scriptures to be burnt,<note place="margin">Bibles burnt.</note> which was executed with all rigour and contempt that might be.</p>
               <p>Then he sent forth his Edicts for the displacing of all Christian Magistrates,<note place="margin">Cruel Edicts.</note> and put all others out of their Offices, imprisoning such of the common people as would not abjure Christianity, and subscribe to the heathen Idolatries.</p>
               <p>Then were cruel Edicts sent abroad for the imprisoning of the Elders and Bishops, and constraining them by sundry kinds of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to sacrifice to the Idols; whereupon insued a great persecution against the Governors of the Church, amongst whom many of them manfully passed through exceeding bitter torments:<note place="margin">Horrible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> Some were scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all over their bodies with whips: some with racks and tearings of their flesh, were exceedingly cruciated: some one way, others another way were put to death.</p>
               <p>Some were violently drawn to the impure sacrifices, and as though
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41459:40"/>
they had sacrificed, when indeed they did not, were let go. Others neither coming to their Altars; nor touching any piece of their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, yet were born in hand by those which stood by, that they had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed; and so being defamed by their adversaries, were let go.<note place="margin">False Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</note> Others as dead men were carried out, and cast away, being but half dead.</p>
               <p>Some were cast down on the pavement, and trailed a great space by the legs, and the people made to believe that they had sacrificed; Others with-stood them, stoutly affirming with a loud voice, that they had not sacrificed; withal saying, that they were Christians, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in the profession of that name.</p>
               <p>Some cryed that they neither had, nor ever would be partakers of that Idolatry,<note place="margin">Courage.</note> who were buffetted on the face and mouth by the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that they might hold their peace. But if the Saints seemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so little to do what their enemies would have them, they were made much of;<note place="margin">Humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</note> yet none of these devices prevailed against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant servants of Jesus Christ; but of the weaker sort, through frailty, many fell at the first brunt.</p>
               <p>When these Edicts were first set up at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> a Christian, a noble man born, moved with an holy zeal, ran, and took them down,<note place="margin">Zeal.</note> and tare them in pieces, though the Emperors were present in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for which he was put to a most bitter death, which with great constancy and patience, he endured to the last.</p>
               <p>These furious Tyrants, <hi>Dioclesian</hi> in the West, and <hi>Maximian</hi> in the East, raged exceedingly against the poor Saints of Christ. But <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesian</hi> proceeded more subtilly,<note place="margin">Subtilty.</note> first beginning with the souldiers in his Camp: to whom the Marshal of the field proposed that they should either offer sacrifice, or leave their places and offices, and lay down their arms; whereunto the Christians resolutely answered, that they were not only ready to lay down their weapons, but to suffer death, if it was imposed upon them,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> rather then so to sin against God.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this persecution, few were tormented, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Emperor grew to greater cruelty. It cannot be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed what number of Martyrs suffered; what blood was shed through all Cities and Regions for the name of Christ.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Tyre</hi> certain Christians were given to the most cruel wild beasts, which would not hurt them; and the Lions, Bears and Leopards,<note place="margin">A miracle of Mercy.</note> which were kept hungry for the purpose, would not touch them: Yet did they vehemently rage against those that brought the Christians into the stage, who though they stood, as they thought, without their reach, yet were they caught, and devoured by them. Afterwards these Martyrs were slain with the sword, and cast into the sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvanus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Gazenses,</hi> with thirty nine more, were slain in the Mettal-Mynes. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> dyed a glorious Martyr.<note place="margin">

               <p>At <hi>Antioch</hi> two young Maidens were thrown into the sea.

               <p>The Christians in <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> were tormented divers ways: some of them were hanged up by the feet, and with the smoak of a small fire strangled.

                  <hi>Serena,</hi> the wife of <hi>Dioclesian</hi> the Emperor, was martyred for her Religion. Some others were bound hand and foot to a post, and so burnt.</p>
               <p>Also many Christians of all ages and sorts, being met together in a Church, to celebrate the memorial of Christs Nativity, <hi>Maximian</hi> the Emperor sent some to fire the Church, and burn them all; But first they commanded a Cryer to proclaim, that whosoever would have life, should come out, and sacrifice to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> otherwise they should be all burnt; then one stepping up boldly, in the name of all the rest, said, We are all Christians, and believe that Christ is our only God and King, and we will sacrifice to none but him; hereupon the fire was kindled, and some thousands of men, women and children were burnt in that place.<note place="margin">Christians burnt in a Church.</note>

               <p>Besides the kindes of death, the punishments were so great and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible as no tongue is able to express: as whippings, scourgings,<note place="margin">Cruel tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, horrible scrapings, sword, fire, shipboats, whereinto many were put and sunk into the sea: Also hanging upon crosses, binding some to the bodies of trees with their heads hanging downward, hanging others by the middle upon gallowses till they died of hunger: throwing others alive to Lions, Bears, Leopards, wilde Buls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pricking others with bodkins and talons of beasts till they were almost dead.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Thebaide,</hi> they hanged up women naked by one of their feet, the rest of their body hanging downwards, with many other sorts of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments most cruell to be thought of: Some were bound to the boughs of trees, and had their members torn asunder, others were mangled with axes, some choaked with smoak over a slow fire, some had their hands, ears, and feet cut off, others were scorched and broiled upon coals, yet not to death, but had the torment renued every day.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Pontus</hi> the Martyrs had other horible torments inflicted on them, Some had their fingers-ends under the nails thrust in with bodkins: Some were sprinkled all over with boiling lead, having their necessary members cut from them, others suffred most filthy and intolerable torments in their bowels, and privy members: what the outrage of this persecution was in <hi>Alexandria, Phileas</hi> a Bishop thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,</p>
               <p>Because (saith he) every man might torment the holy Martyrs as he listed, some beat them with cudgels, some with rods, some with whips,<note place="margin">Hellish cruelty.</note> some with thonges, some with cords, some having there hands bound behind them were lifted upon timber-logs, and with certaine instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had their members and joints stretched out, where their bodies hanging, were subjected to the will of the tormentors, who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to afflict them with all manner of torments: on their sides,

               <p>They devised also another greater torment, for when the Christians were lamentably beaten, they had a new kinde of rack, wherein they lying upright, were stretched by both the feet above the fourth hole, with sharp shels strawed under them. Others were cast down upon the pavement, where they had so many torments inflicted upon them, that their sufferings cannot be imagined what they were: In the midst of which torments some died,<note place="margin">Admirable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</note> their enemies being confounded with their singular patience.</p>
               <p>Some half dead were thrust into prisons, where, with their wounds and pain they ended their lives: Others being cured of their wounds, were again put to their choice; whether they would sacrifice to the Idols, and have their liberty, or have the sentence of death pass upon them, who did willingly chuse death for Christs sake, rather then to sin against him.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> a Christian pulling down, and tearing the Emperors Edict, was stript and beaten till the bones appeared, and then washed in salt and vinegar, under which torments he died. Yet notwithstanding the horribleness of these tortures, the Christian Martyrs were so farre from being dismaied,<note place="margin">Courage and constancy.</note> that they were confirmed and strengthned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, merrily and joyfully undergoing whatsoever was inflicted upon them.</p>
               <p>

               <p>In <hi>Alexandria</hi> the holy Martyrs led with the love of better rewards, did not only bear the menaces of the cruel souldiers, wherewith they threatned them, but also whatsoever torments they could devise for their destruction: Yea saith <hi>Sulpitius</hi>; then the Christians with more greedy desire pressed and sought for Maryrdom,<note place="margin">Humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</note> then now they do for Bishopricks.

When <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Maximian,</hi> notwithstanding all the slaughter which they made, saw the number of Christians rather increased then diminished, so that they were out of all hope of utter rooting them out, and having now even their fill of blood, they ceased at last of their own accord from putting any more Christians to death:<note place="margin">The mercies of the wicked are cruelty.</note> Yet of a great multitude, they thrust out their right eies, and maimed their right legs at the ham, with a searing iron, condemning them to the Metal-mynes, not so much for their labour, as desirous to afflict them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: and so having raigned together about one and twenty years, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oclesian</hi> divested himself of the imperial Dignity, and lived a private life, and the like did <hi>Maximian</hi> also, resigning the Empire to <hi>Galerius Maximinus,</hi> and <hi>Constantius.</hi>

                  <hi>Maximinus</hi> was of a cruel Nature, a great Enchanter, vicious in his life, and a great enemy to the Christians, and therefore continued the Persecution of them, yet at length was revoked from his cruelty by the just Judgement of God upon him; For he was suddenly taken with an horrible and filthy disease,<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors.</note> which first began outwardly in his flesh: and then proceeded more inwardly: his privy members putrified with a botchy corrupt boil, and a fistula consuming, and eating up his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails, whence swarmed forth an innumerable company of lice, with such a pestiferous stink, that no man could abide him; he being also very gross, his fat putrified, and stank intollerably; and because his Physitians could not abide the stink, he commanded them to be slain: others of them, because they could not cure his incurable disease, he put them to cruel deaths.</p>
               <p>At last being told that his disease came from God, he began to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think himself of all the cruelty which he had shewed to the Saints, confessed his offences to God, and gave command that the Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the Christians should cease; requiring his Officers likewise to re-edifie their Temples,<note place="margin">Hypocrisie.</note> and requesting them to pray to their God for him.</p>
               <p>This Edict much comforted and refreshed the Christians, who thereupon gathered together in every City, called their Synods and Councels; yea, the Infidels themselves extolled and magnified the true God of the Christians.</p>
               <p>But this Tyrant <hi>Maximinus</hi> scarce suffered this peace to continue six moneths together, but again he forbad the Christians to meet, and privately stirred up the <hi>Athenians</hi> to petition him that none of them might be suffered to live in their City: Also a Conjurer in <hi>Athens</hi> made an Image of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which uttered these words, <hi>Jupiter commandeth the Christians to be banished out of this City and Suburbs, because they are enemies to him.</hi> Also certain harlots were suborned to say, that they formerly were Christians, and privy to the wicked and lascivious acts which they exercised amongst themselves, upon Sabbath daies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thereupon the Emperor commanded that they should put them to death by all means possible.

               <p>The pestilence also scattering through all houses, killed very many, especially those of the richer sort, which escaped the famine, whereby innumerable Magistrates,<note place="margin">Pestilence.</note> Princes and Presidents were quickly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, so that all places were filled with mourning, and nothing

                  <hi>Constantine</hi> succeeding his father, overcame <hi>Maxentius</hi> the Tyrant in <hi>Rome,</hi> and he together with <hi>Licinius</hi> set forth Edicts in favour of the Christians: <hi>See</hi> Constantines <hi>life in my second part of lives.</hi> Yet <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus</hi> continued his persecution in the East, whereupon <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Licinius</hi> wrote to him to favour the Christians, and he finding that he was too weak to encounter with them, sent forth his Edicts to stop the persecution: yet afterwards he picked new quarrels with them, and began to persecute them again: whereupon <hi>Licinius</hi> went against him, and overthrew him in a battell: Then did <hi>Maximinus</hi> kill many of his enchanters and conjurers that had encouraged him, and promised him victory.</p>
               <p>Shortly after the Lord striking him with a grievous disease, he glorified the God of the Christians,<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors.</note> and made a Law for the safety and preservation of them: yet not long after by the vehemency of his disease, he ended his life.</p>

               </p>
               <p>He quarrelled with the Christians, because as he said, they praied not for him, but for <hi>Constantine</hi>: and thereupon he first banished them all from his Court: then he deprived all the Knights of their honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable order,<note place="margin">Wicked Laws.</note> except they would sacrifice to devils: then he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Bishops should have no meetings to consult about their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical affairs: nor that any Christians should come to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or hold any assemblies: then that men and women should not meet together to pray, that women should not hear the Bishops, but chuse out women to instruct them: then that none should help or succour those that were in prison, nor should bestow any alms upon them, though they should die for hunger, and that they which shewed any compassion to those which were condemned to death, should suffer the

               <p>This cruelty made many godly persons voluntarily to forsake their houses, and to live in woods, mountains, and desarts: He caused <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus</hi> to be hanged upon a crosse, to have nails thrust into his arm-pits,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Constantine</hi> being informed of all this wickednesse, raised an Army, went against him, overcame him twice, and at last caused him to be put to death, as you may see in <hi>Constantines</hi> life in my second part: whereby the Church obtained a generall peace.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. The Persecution of the Church under <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostata, <hi>Anno Christi, 365</hi>·</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>IUlian</hi> was Nephew to <hi>Constantius</hi> the son of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and was by him made <hi>Caesar,</hi> and sent against the <hi>Germans,</hi> where after some smaller victories having overcome his enemies in a great and bloody battel, he was by his Army made <hi>Augustus,</hi> and after <hi>Constantius</hi> his death, succeeded in the whole Empire, both of the East and West. He was brought up in the Christian Religion, and was endowed with excellent parts;<note place="margin">His Apostacy.</note> but when be came to the Empire, he Apostatized from his former profession, and turned Heathen, and became a deadly enemy to the Church of Christ, and a great persecutor of it.</p>
               <p>The first thing that he did, was to open the Idol Temples; shut up by his Predecessors, and to suffer the Gentiles to commit their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Idolatries, and publickly to adore their Idols: Then his next design was to supplant the true Christian Religion, being induced thereto by the devil and his own wickedness: And the better to effect the same, he practised a means never before used by any, which was to shew himself pitifull, and not cruel; perceiving that by means of the torments inflicted on the Martyrs,<note place="margin">Devilish sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</note> the holy Christian Faith was greatly increased; and therefore he took a contrary course, and sought by gifts, favours, flatteries, and by bestowing offices and dignities, to draw them to renounce the Christian Faith, and to sacrifice to false gods, and by this means there were not a few, who being covetous and ambitious, desiring to be rich and honoured, fell from their Christian profession.</p>
               <p>Then did he make Laws and general Decrees, that no Christian should be Master of any Arts or Sciences,<note place="margin">Christians might not stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> neither should study in any Schools, that so through the desire of Learning they might turn Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, or else they should remain ignorant and illiterate, and so be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient to preach the Christian faith.</p>
               <p>He also ordained that no Christian should have any charge, or hold any office of Justice,<note place="margin">They may be in no Offices.</note> neither should be a Captain in the Wars, nor enjoy any other dignity. Thus he used all the inventions that possibly he could devise, to make War against Jesus Christ, without shedding any Christian blood, that so he might take the Crown from the holy Martyrs,<note place="margin">The most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which they formerly obtained by the persecution of the sword: and indeed this was the greatest and most dangerous Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ever the Church endured.</p>

with all manner of base jears; and those which excelled most in this wicked practise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he most loved and honoured, advancing them to offices, both in his Court and Army.</p>
               <p>During his short reign, though himself put none to death, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore specified; yet the heathen Idolaters, in sundry places, proceeded far otherwise; especially in <hi>Palestine,</hi> where they burnt many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians alive, others they stripped naked, and tying cords to their feet, dragged them up and down the paved streets,<note place="margin">Barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> till their flesh was torn from their bones; Upon others they poured scalding water: Some they stoned, or beat out their brains with clubs: and having thus murthered them, they burnt their bodies, and then took their bones, and mingled them with the bones of Camels and Asses, that they might not be known for mens bones.</p>
               <p>The Christians in <hi>Alexandria</hi> were most cruelly used by the <hi>Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks,</hi> or <hi>Pagans</hi>: Some were slain with the sword, some were fastned to the Cross, some brained, some stoned; and such was their rage against Christianity, that one brother spared not another, nor parents their children, nor children their parents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Emilianus</hi> was burned in <hi>Thracia. Domitius</hi> was slain in his cave. <hi>Theodorus</hi> for singing a Psalm at the removing of the body of <hi>Babilas,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Artemius</hi> also, a Captain of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> souldiers,<note place="margin">

Then did they cover them with hogs-meat, and ripping up their bellies, put barly into them, and so caused their bowels and flesh to be devoured by their hungry swine.</p>

               <p>In the Market-places of the Cities, <hi>Julian</hi> set up his own Image, amongst the Images of the heathen gods, to the end that whosoever should do civil reverence to his Image,<note place="margin">Devilish sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</note> might also seem to worship the gods of the Gentiles; and that they who would not bow to the Idols, might seem to refuse due reverence to the Emperour.

and liberty in reproving him for his heathenish superstition, which so enraged him, that he caused them to be put to death.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Caesarea,</hi> the Inhabitants being most Christians, had formerly overthrown the Temples of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi>; and now in <hi>Julians</hi> time, they overthrew the Temple of <hi>Fortune,</hi> which so enraged him,<note place="margin">Christian cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> that he disfranchised them, exacted of them three hundred pounds weight of gold, and compelled their Clergy to serve in War-fare, threatning further to put to death all the Inhabitants thereof at his return, but it pleased God that his own death prevented it.</p>
               <p>About this time, <hi>Julian</hi> going to enquire of the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos,</hi> there came down fire from heaven, and destroyed the Temple, and beat the Image of <hi>Apollo</hi> in pieces,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Image broken with lightning.</note> like to the smallest powder or dust.</p>
               <p>When he came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> there was a noble woman, called <hi>Publia,</hi> who had the Education and government of divers young virgins, these she caused, as <hi>Julian</hi> passed by her house, to sing with a loud voice, <hi>The Idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the works of mens hands,</hi> &amp;c. This so angred the Emperour, that he sent them a command to sing no more as he went that way; but <hi>Publia</hi> was so far from fearing him, that the next time he came, she made them sing the same verse, and to add to it, <hi>Let God arise, and his enemies shall be scattered,</hi> &amp;c. This so incensed <hi>Julian,</hi> that he sent for her to him, scoffed at her, and caused her to be clapt on the cheeks in a disgracefull manner; but she looked upon it as a great honour thus to suffer reproach for Christs sake; and coming home, she caused her maids still to sing Psalms of the Emperours fury and madness.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the Emperour intending to war against the <hi>Persians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Christians fined.</note> set a great fine upon every ones head that would not sacrifice to the Idols, whereby he much enriched himself by the spoil of the Christians.</p>
               <p>Then were false Accusations forged against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> so that he was forced to flie; yet he thus comforted himself and friends,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Nubecula est, cito pertransibit,</hi> This persecution is but a little cloud, and will soon pass away.</p>
               <p>In his flight, he took a ship upon the river <hi>Nilus</hi> to fly to <hi>Thebais,</hi> but <hi>Julian</hi> sent an Earl after him, to bring him back again, who pursuing him with sails and ores, had almost overtaken his ship, whereupon the Marriners would have run her ashore, and fled into a wilderness that was hard by, to whom <hi>Athanasius</hi> said, <hi>Quid turbamini filii?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Courage.</note> 
                  <hi>quin in occursum eamus persecutori nostro, ut intelligat, quia longe major est qui nos defendit, quam qui persequitur:</hi> My sons, why are you thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted?

                     <hi>COnstantine</hi> the Great, dying, divided his Empire amongst his three sons, <hi>Constantius, Constans</hi> and <hi>Constantine.

This Presbyter complained to <hi>Constantius</hi> that the Return of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> from banishment was very dangerous to the peace of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: Yea, he so far incensed the Emperour against him,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But neither in banishment could he enjoy peace and safety, for this <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperour sent to all the officers in his Army to search him out, wheresoever he was,<note place="margin">His banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> proposing a great Reward to those that could bring <hi>Athanasius</hi> to him, either alive or dead; whereupon he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to hide himself in a deep pit, where he lay six years never so much as seeing the light of the Sun, till at last a Maid that used to carry him his food, was corrupted by those which sought for him, to betray him to them;<note place="margin">His miraculous deliverance.</note> but it pleased God by his Spirit to reveal to him his danger, whereby he escaped a little before they came to apprehend him.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards <hi>Constans</hi> forced his brother <hi>Constantius,</hi> though much against his will, to restore <hi>Athanasius</hi> to his Church at <hi>Alexandria</hi>:<note place="margin">He is restored for a time, and again banished.</note> But after the death of that good Emperour <hi>Constans, Constantius</hi> drave him into banishment again; yet the Lord stirred up a godly woman to hide him in her house, till the death of <hi>Constantius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Alexandria</hi> in the room of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> was <hi>George</hi> an <hi>Arrian</hi> Bishop placed, who also was furnished with armed souldiers to assist him in his devillish devices. Thereupon he caused a great fire to be made, took many Christian Virgins, caused them to be stripped naked, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring them to renounce their faith, or else they should be burned: but when the sight of the fire could not terrifie them,<note place="margin">Christian vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abused.</note> he caused their faces to be so dashed with strokes, that their countenances were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured; yet like patient souldiers of Christ they endured all kind of rebuke for his names sake.</p>
                  <p>Thirty Bishops, of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> were slain in the fury of this <hi>Arrian</hi> Persecution. Fourteen Bishops were banished,<note place="margin">The <hi>Arrians</hi> cruelty.</note> whereof some of them died in the way, the rest in exile. Forty Orthodox Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in <hi>Alexandria</hi> were scourged with rods, because they would not communicate with the <hi>Arrian</hi> Bishop <hi>George,</hi> and so pitiously handled, that some pieces of the rods were so deeply fixed in their flesh, that they could not be drawn out, and many through excessive pain of their wounded bodies, died.</p>
                  <p>The like cruelty did the <hi>Arrians</hi> exercise in <hi>Constantinople. Paul</hi> the good Bishop was banished to <hi>Cucusus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">B. <hi>Paul</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</note> where he was strangled by the <hi>Arrians. Macedonius</hi> a notable heretick was placed in his room, who used no less cruelty in forcing men to communicate with him, then was used formerly to force them to sacrifice to Idols.</p>
                  <p>These Hereticks used also great diligence in procuring Councels to<note place="margin">Subtilty.</note>

                  <p>He was exceedingly filled with wrath against the Bishops assembled in the Counsel of <hi>Lampsacum,</hi> because they adhered to the <hi>Nicene</hi> faith. In <hi>Constantinople</hi> he banished all the Orthodox. In <hi>Edissa,</hi> he commanded them all to be slain as they were assembled together in the Church. The Lieutenant that had received this charge from him, being more mercifull then his Master, gave private notice to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,<note place="margin">An admirable story.</note> that they should not assemble at that time; but they, neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding his advice, nor fearing his threats, flocked to the Church in great companies: and whilst the Lieutenant, with many armed soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, hasted thitherward to fulfill the Emperors command, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man leading a child in her hand, all in haste, brake the ranks, and thrust into the armed troops; the Lieutenant being moved therewith, called the woman before him, saying, <hi>Thou fond and unfortunate woman, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther runnest thou so rashly? Thither</hi> (said she) <hi>whither others hasten; Hast thou not heard</hi> (said he) <hi>that the Lieutenant will slay as many as he finds there?

That he also</hi> (said she) <hi>may be accounted in the number of Martyrs.</hi> Hereupon the Lieutenant returned back to the Emperor, and told him that all the Christians from the highest to the lowest prepared themselves to die in the defence of their faith,<note place="margin">Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and withal he shewed him what a rash thing it was to murder so great a multitude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so with his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons perswaded the Emperour, that he appeased his wrath, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the mischief at that time.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Constantinople</hi> the <hi>Arrians,</hi> favoured by the Emperor, crowed insolently over the Christians, they scourged, reviled, imprisoned, amerced, and laid upon them all the intollerable burthens they could devise.

themselves into a boat, and so these holy Martyrs glorified the Name of Christ, by patient suffering of a double death, burning and drowning.</p>
                  <p>In all the Eastern parts he tormented many with sundry sorts of grievous torments, put many to death, drowned many in the sea,<note place="margin">Cruelty of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</note> and in rivers.</p>

The Bishops and Ministers through all the Province, being dispoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all their substance, and turned out of their Churches, assembled together, and presented a petition to <hi>Genserick,</hi> that they might, at least in private,<note place="margin">Pride.</note> be suffered to instruct their people to whom he proudly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>I have decreed that none of your profession shall remain in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, how then dare you prefer such a request?</hi> and withal, he would at that instant have drowned them all in the sea, but that the importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of some about him, stopt him.</p>
               <p>There was also a noble Earl, called <hi>Sebastian,</hi> a man of great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and courage, whom <hi>Genserick</hi> much feared, and therefore sought occasion to put him to death: which that he might the better effect, he moved him to be re-baptized by one of his Priests, and to turn <hi>Arrian:</hi> the Earl therefore requested him to call for a fine manchet, which being done, he said, <hi>This loaf, that it might be fine and white, hath been boulted from the bran,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A noble Earl martyred.</note> 
                  <hi>moistened with liquor, and baked: but if you now cause it to be broken in pieces, steeped in water, kneaded and baked again, if it come out better, I will do as you would have me. Genserick</hi> understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his meaning, could not tell what to answer for the present, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he caused him to be put to death.</p>
               <p>If any Minister in his Sermon occasionally did but mention <hi>Pharaoh, Nebuchadrezzer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> 
                  <hi>Herod,</hi> &amp;c, presently it was laid to his charge that he meant it by the King, and thereupon he was banished.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding all this cruelty, the people of God stood fast in their holy profession,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> and rather increased then otherwise.</p>
               <p>Afterwards at the request of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Genserick</hi> suffered the Orthodox in <hi>Carthage</hi> to choose them a Bishop, which they did; and not long after <hi>Genserick</hi> with his <hi>Vandals</hi> took the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rome</hi> sacked.</note> carrying away with him, not only all the treasure that of a long time had been stored up there, but many of the people also; who, when they were brought into <hi>Africk,</hi> were shared between the <hi>Vandals</hi> and the <hi>Moors,</hi> so that husbands were separated from their wives, parents from their children; which this godly Bishop hearing of, he caused all the gold and silver vessels belonging to the Church, to be sold for their Redemption,<note place="margin">Charity.</note> that so married persons, and parents, and children might enjoy the comfort of their relations: Then also did he provide food and lodging for them, and night and day went amongst them himself, to see how they did, to minister to their wants, and comfort them; But this procured him such hatred amongst the <hi>Arrians,</hi> that they sought to slay him; but the Lord about this time took him to himself, whereby he escaped their malice.</p>

were converted, and sending for an Orthodox Minister,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Moors</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> were baptized.</p>
               <p>This coming to <hi>Gensericks</hi> ears, he commanded these servants of God to be drawn at a Chariots tail thorow thickets of thorns,<note place="margin">Cruelty of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</note> till they were torn in pieces, and these newly converted <hi>Moors,</hi> he caused their naked bodies to be haled backwards and forwards, thorow bushes and brambles, and others of them to be tied to wild beasts, and so to be rent in sunder; the poor Christians saying thus each to other, <hi>O brother pray for me, God hath fulfilled our desire, O this is the way to the kingdom of heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Genserick</hi> further raging against the Orthodox, sent one <hi>Proculus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Zeugian</hi> Province, to dispoil all the Churches of their Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Ministers of their books, that thereby they might be disabled to holy services; which command was executed with all rigour: and whereas the Bishop of <hi>Habensa</hi> refused to deliver them up, he was expelled the City,<note place="margin">The Bishop of <hi>Habensa.</hi>
                  </note> and all men at great penalty were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to harbour him, so that, being above eighty years old, he lay naked for a long time, under the open skie.</p>
               <p>About Easter, when the Christians were met together in a Church, to celebrate the remembrance of Christs Resurrection, the <hi>Arrians</hi> with a great power of armed men, set upon this innocent company, who with their naked swords slew many: The Minister that was preaching, they shot through the throat with an arrow:<note place="margin">Christians murthered at a Sermon.</note> and such of them as escaped death, were by the command of the King, executed by sundry kinds of torments.</p>
               <p>In other places, when the Christians were administring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Hereticks rushed in amongst them, taking the bread and wine, and trampling them under their profane feet.<note place="margin">Horrible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faness.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Then did <hi>Genserick</hi> command, that none but <hi>Arrians</hi> should bear any office, either about himself or his children: And a Bishop called <hi>Armogastes,</hi> they took, and first nipped his fore-head and legs with bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strings; then did they hang him up by one foot,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Armogastes</hi> tormented.</note> with his head down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, yet did he seem to all men as if he slept in a feather-bed, which so enraged <hi>Theoderick</hi> the Kings son, that he commanded him to be beheaded, but some about him disswaded him from it,<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> because said they, he will be accounted a Martyr. Then was he banished to dig in Mynes; yet afterwards he was sent for again, and made a Cow-heard near to <hi>Carthage,</hi> that he might be a continual object of scorn.</p>
               <p>There was also one <hi>Saturus,</hi> a noble man, eminent for holiness, whom the Tyrant much laboured to draw to the <hi>Arrian</hi> profession, but he refusing, the King told him, that if he presently consented not,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Saturu</hi>'s noble courage.</note> he should forfeit his house and goods, that his Children and slaves should be sould, and his wife should be given to the Camel-driver: Yet no menaces could shake his faith. His wife hearing of her doom, went to her husband as he was praying, with her garments rent, her hair disheveled, her Children at her heels, and a sucking infant in her

I am resolved therefore as my Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me, to forsake wife, children, lands, house, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that I may be his Disciple; and accordingly he was dispoiled of all, and turned out a begging, yet all were forbidden to harbour him.</p>

                  <hi>Genserick</hi> having reigned thirty seven years and three moneths, died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Genserick</hi> being dead, his son <hi>Hunrick</hi> succeeded him, who at first was more moderate to the Christians, insomuch as they began to hold their meetings as before time. The <hi>Manichaean</hi> Hereticks he sought out, and though most of them were of his own Religion, yet he burnt some,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Manichaeans</hi> punished.</note> and banished others.</p>
               <p>At the request of the Emperour <hi>Zeno</hi> and <hi>Placidia</hi> his wife, he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> to chuse their own Bishop, having been destitute of one for twenty four years.

               <p>The women, besides these torments, they carried thorow the streets, to be made a publick laughing-stock, yet could they not force them to altar their Religion.<note place="margin">Constancy.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Then did <hi>Hunrick</hi> ordain, that none of his Countries which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented from his Religion, should receive their ordinary pensions and salaries. Then did he send many of them who had been delicately brought up, to <hi>Utica,</hi> in the parching heat of the sun, to dig the land for corn; yet they went cheerfully, and comforted themselves in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Then did he command that no man should be a Knight, or bear any publick office except he turned <hi>Arrian:</hi> whereupon very many with invincible courage,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> forsook their honours and offices, rather then their faith.</p>

weights at their feet, and putting to their sides; breasts, back and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, red hot plates of iron, to compell them to confess that their Bishops and Ministers lay with them, that so he might from thence have an occasion to persecute them. Many of these died under the pain, and others remained lame and crooked all their lives after, yet would they not confess any such thing.</p>
               <p>Then did he banish into the wilderness, of Bishops, Ministers, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and other Members of Christ, four thousand nine hundred seventy six; some of them being lame with the gout, others blind with age:<note place="margin">Multitudes ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</note> Amongst whom also was <hi>Foelix</hi> Bishop of <hi>Abiris,</hi> possessed with a dead palsie, and therefore unable, either to go or ride;<note place="margin">

                  </note> which the cruel King being informed of, and requested that he might be suffered to stay; he answered, if he be not able to ride, let wild bulls be coupled to drag him to the place appointed: So that they were fain to carry him on a Mules back across, as if he had been a sack.</p>
               <p>Then were all these holy Confessors, brought to the City of <hi>Sicca,</hi> where the <hi>Moors</hi> were to receive them, and transport them thence to the wilderness. Thither came two <hi>Arrian</hi> Earls,<note place="margin">Tentation.</note> and with great subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty sought to withdraw them from their stedfastness, saying, <hi>What mean you to be so obstinate, as not to obey the Kings Laws, whereas by complying with him, you may be preferred to honour?</hi> Then did they all cry out, <hi>We be Christians, we be Catholicks, we believe, and confess the Trinity in Unity.</hi> Hereupon were they shut up in a grievous prison.</p>
               <p>Many mothers also voluntarily followed their little children, much rejoycing that they had born Martyrs: Others sought to draw them to rebaptization by the Hereticks but, through Gods grace, they could not prevail.<note place="margin">Constancy.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As they passed on the way travelling more by night then by day, because of the excessive heat, a woman hasted after them,<note place="margin">An excellent story.</note> leading in her hand a little child, encouraging him, saying, <hi>Run Sirra, seest thou all the Saints how merrily they go forwards, and hasten to their Crown</hi>? One of the company rebuked her, and asked her whether she went? To whom she answered, <hi>Pray for me, I go with this little boy, my nephew, to the place of banishment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> least the enemies finding him alone, should seduce him from the way of truth into the way of Error.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The enemies being more enraged because of their constancy, when they came to their lodgings, penned them up in narrow places. Then was denied to them all the comfort of access of their friends, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting whereof formerly, their Keepers had been beaten with staves. These blessed Saints were tumbled one upon another, as grains of corn,<note place="margin">Cruelty of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</note> neither could they have means of stepping aside to ease nature, so that the stink of their excrements exceeded their other pain.</p>
               <p>Then were they brought forth, their garments, heads and faces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smeared with dirt in a pitifull manner, and by the clamorous <hi>Moors</hi> they were hastened forward in their journey; yet they went singing with great joy unto the Lord, <hi>Loe, This honour have all his Saints.</hi> Then came to them the blessed Bishop <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cyprians</hi> sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy.</note> who to their singular

               <p>There came great multitudes from sundry Countries and Cities, to behold these servants of God, and many casting their Children at their feet; cryed thus, <hi>To whom will you leave us wretches whilest you go forward to your Crown? Who shall baptize our infants? instruct and administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments to us? our hearts serve us well to go with you if we might.</hi> But now none were suffered any more to go with them for their comfort, but they were pressed forwards, and made to run.</p>
               <p>When any of the aged, or tender Children fainted, they were first punched forwards with staves:<note place="margin">Barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> Then were the <hi>Moors</hi> commanded to tie ropes to the feet of such as were unable to go, and to hail them thorow the rough places, so that first their garments were rent, then their flesh, and their heads were dashed against the sharp edges of rocks, whereby very many of them died.</p>
               <p>The rest that were stronger came at last to the wilderness, where, like beasts, they had barly given them for their food; there were also abundance of venemous serpents and scorpions in that place, whose sting was deadly, yet, thorow Gods great Providence, none of these servants of Christ gat any hurt thereby.<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hunrick</hi> in the seventh year of his reign, directed his Mandate to <hi>Eugenius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and told all other Bishops in <hi>Africk,</hi> that they should by such a day meet at <hi>Carthage</hi> to defend by disputation their faith against the <hi>Arrian</hi> Bishops;<note place="margin">Subtilty of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</note> but withal, by the tenour of the decree, they perceived that he would not suffer any of them to live within his dominions, which caused great heaviness amongst them. <hi>Eugenius</hi> returned answer, that since it was the common cause of all the Christian Churches, it was but equal that Bishops out of other Countries should be requested to be there present also; and this he did, not because they suspected their own abilities to defend the truth, but because he knew that strangers might use more liberty of speech then they could, and that other Bishops might be witnesses of their sufferings, but this request did but more enrage this unreasonable Tyrant.</p>
               <p>The appointed day approaching, many Bishops resorted to <hi>Carthage,</hi> worn out with afflictions and sorrows, yet for many days after their coming, there was no mention of disputing, till in the mean time the King had singled out the learnedest and skilfullest of them, that by sundry Calumniations he might make them away: Amongst whom was <hi>Laetus,</hi> a stout and learned man, whom he first impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, and then burnt him in the fire, that so he might strike a fear into the rest.</p>
               <p>At last the Disputation began, and the Orthodox, to avoid tumult,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41459:57"/>
chose out some to answer for all the rest. The <hi>Arrians</hi> placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon lofty Thrones,<note place="margin">Pride of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</note> whilest the Orthodox stood below upon their feet; Whereupon they said, <hi>Conference is to be taken in hand, not where proud superiority of power bears sway, but where, by common consent, the Disputants upon equal tearms debate the controversies, that truth may come to light,</hi> &amp;c. Then were all the Catholicks commanded to have an hundred stroaks a piece with a cudgel, given them for this speech:<note place="margin">Unjust cruelty.</note> Whereupon <hi>Eugenius</hi> said, <hi>The Lord from heaven behold the violence which we suffer, and consider the tribulation which we sustain from our perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.</hi> Then did the Orthodox Bishops desire the <hi>Arrians</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound what they intended; But the <hi>Arrian</hi> Bishops seeing them ready to dispute with them, sought out tergiversations, and declined the dispute. Hereupon the Orthodox drew forth a declaration of their faith, excellently well penned, and exhibited it with this Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>If you be desirous to know our belief,</hi>

                  <hi>the faith which we hold is herein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised.</hi> The <hi>Arrians</hi> stormed exceedingly at this, giving them out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious language, and presently by false Calumnies they accused them to the King, and so incensed him, that by an Edict in one day he caused all the Christians Churches through <hi>Africk</hi> to be shut up,<note place="margin">A wicked E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</note> giving to the <hi>Arrians</hi> all the goods and Churches of the Orthodox.</p>
               <p>Then did he command that all those godly Bishops that were met together at <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Bishops being thus turned out, lay in the open fields round about the Wals: and when the Tyrant went forth to the fish-ponds, they met him, saying, <hi>Why are we so afflicted? what evil have we done? If we be called to dispute, Why are we spoiled of all we have? Why are we slandred? Why are we forced to remain here amongst the dung-hills, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with hunger and nakedness, far from our Churches and houses</hi>? Herewith the Tyrant was so enraged, that he commanded his horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ride over them, whereby many of them were sore bruised and wounded, especially the aged and weak men: Then did he command them to meet him at the Temple of <hi>Memory:</hi> and when they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they had this writing delivered to them; Our Lord King <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> lamenting your obstinacy in refusing to obey his will, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his Religion, yet intends to deal graciously with you, and if you will take this oath, he will send you back to your Churches and houses: Then they all said with one consent, <hi>We are all Christians, and Bishops, and hold the Apostolical and only true faith</hi>; and thereupon they made a brief confession of their faith;<note place="margin">Devillish sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</note> But the Kings Commissioners urged them without any further delay to take the oath contained in that paper; Whereupon they answered, <hi>Do you think us bruit beasts, that we should so easily swear to a writing, wherein we know not what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained?</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:41459:58"/>
Then was the Oath read unto them, which was this, <hi>You shall swear that after the death of the Lord our King, his son</hi> Hilderick <hi>shall succeed him in the Kingdom, and that none of you shall send letters beyond the seas.</hi> If you take this oath, he will restore you to your Churches.</p>
               <p>They that were plain-meaning men amongst them, were willing to take it; but others that saw further into the subtilty of it, refused it. Then were those which would take it, commanded to separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the other, which being done, a Notary presently took their names, and of what Cities they were: he did the like also by the Refusers; and so both parties were committed to ward, and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the King sent them word; first to those that would have taken the oath: Because that you, contrary to the rule of the Gospel, which saith,<note place="margin">A wicked sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt not swear at all,</hi> would have sworn: The Kings Will is, that you shall never see your Churches more, but shall be banished into the wilderness, and never perform any Ministerial office again; and there you shall till the ground: But to the Refusers of the oath, he said, because you desire not the reign of our Lords son, you shall therefore be immediately sent away to the Isle of <hi>Corse,</hi> there to hew timber for the ships.</p>
               <p>He also sent abroad through all <hi>Africk,</hi> his cruel tormentors: So that no place, no house remained free from lamentation, screeching and out-cryes. They spared neither age nor sex, but only such as yielded to their will. Some they cudgelled with staves; some they hung up, others they burned. Women, and especially gentlewomen, they openly tortured stark naked without all shame: Amongst whom was <hi>Dionysia,</hi> whom when they saw bolder, and more beautifull then the rest,<note place="margin">

expect to enjoy his Kingdom in peace, so long as he suffered any of them to live, Hereupon he sent for seven eminent Christians from <hi>Capsa</hi> to <hi>Carthage,</hi>

                  <hi>Do with our bodies what you please, torment them at your will, its better for us to suffer these momentary pains, then to endure everlasting torments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon they were sent to prison, loaded with great iron chains, and thrust into a stinking Dungeon: But God stirred up the hearts of many godly persons (by great bribes to the Jayler) to procure daily access to them, and by their exhortations,<note place="margin">Gods Mercy.</note> they were so corroborated in the faith, that they much desired to suffer the like things for Christ with these men, and would willingly have laid down their necks to the Persecutors swords.</p>
               <p>The Tyrant hearing of it, was exceedingly enraged, caused them to be kept closer, loaden with more chains, and to be put to great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Then did he cause a ship to be filled with combustible matter, commanding that these holy Martyrs should be put into it,<note place="margin">Many burned in a ship.</note> and fast bound in the same, and fire to be set to the ship in the sea, that they might be burned to death.</p>
               <p>When they were brought out of the prison, the multitude of Gods people accompanied them to the ship, who as innocent Lambs were led to be sacrificed, looking upon their weighty irons, as rare Jewels and Ornaments. With chearfulness and alacrity they went towards the place of execution, as if they had gone to a banket,<note place="margin">Admirable courage and comfort.</note> singing with one voice unto the Lord, as they went along the street, saying, <hi>This is our desired day, more festival then any fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>His manner was by perswasions, flatteries, promises and rewards, to seek to draw the Christians to his <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie; but they which would not be prevailed with hereby, he no way punished or molested them.</p>

After their departure the <hi>Moors</hi> on the contrary, cleansed the Churches, carried out the dung<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> kneeled down to, and reverenced the Ministers, and distributed money to the poor, and thus they did continually.</p>
               <p>Then did <hi>Cabaon</hi> prepare to give his enemies battel; and whereas the <hi>Vandals</hi> were all Horse-men, and very well mounted, their Horses were so afrighted at the sight of the <hi>Moors</hi> Camels, that they were presently put into disorder, and the <hi>Moors</hi> with darts and arrows did so pelt them, that they put them to flight, and slew many of them, whereupon <hi>Thrasamund</hi> shortly after died of grief.</p>
               <p>Then did <hi>Ilderick</hi> the son of <hi>Hunrick</hi> succeed in the Kingdom, who was equally mild and gentle, both to the <hi>Vandals</hi> and Christians, and one that kept very fair correspondence with the Emperour <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.</hi> But <hi>Gilimer,</hi> a cunning and ambitious man, deposed him, and usurped the Kingdom to himself.

               <p>The opinions of these <hi>Waldenses</hi> for which they were so declaimed against, and cruelty persecuted by the <hi>Romanists,</hi> were these.</p>

               <p>The Popelings exercising such cruelty against the Gospellers,<note place="margin">They defend themselves by Arms.</note> they began to defend themselves by arms, repelling force with force: and when, being overpowred by multitude, they could defend themselves no longer, they left their places, and became souldiers abroad, and many of them became very helpfull to our King <hi>Henry</hi> the second in his Wars, when he was molested about Arch-Bishop <hi>Beckets</hi> death: Also our King <hi>Richard</hi> the first at his return out of the <hi>Holy land,</hi> (as they called it) made good use of them (who though they were curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Pope, yet were they blessed by God) for the recovery of his right, and for the defence of his people.</p>

               <p>The power of these Inquisitors was without limitation, they could assemble the people by the sound of a bell when they pleased, proceed against the Bishops themselves,<note place="margin">Inquisitors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, An.

               <p>To be rich was a crime near to <hi>Heresie,</hi> and he that had any thing to lose, was in the way to be undone, either as an <hi>Heretick,</hi> or as a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of them: yea, bare suspition stopped the mouths of parents, kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, and friends, that they durst not intercede each for other.

               <p>No Advocate durst undertake the defence of his nearest kinsman, or friends: no Notary durst receive any Act in his favour; yea, death it self made not an end of their punishment, for sometimes they passed sentence against the bones of the dead, to dis-inter and burn them, it may be thirty years after the death of the party accused.</p>
               <p>Such as were heirs had nothing certain, for if their fathers or kindred were accused they durst not undertake the defence of their own right, possess their own inheritance, without the crime or suspition of <hi>Heresie.</hi> The greatest and richest amongst the people were constrained even to adore these Monks Inquisitors, and to give them great sums for the building of their Convents &amp; houses, for fear to be accused of <hi>Heresie.</hi>

               <p>And the better to keep the people in aw, these Inquisitors would sometimes lead in Triumph their prisoners in their processions, enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some of them to whip themselves, others to go in their shirts bare-foot and bare-headed, having a With about their necks; and a torch in their hands for the greater terrour to the beholders, seeing persons of all estates and sexes in so miserable a condition.</p>
               <p>Some of these accused persons were sent into the holy Land, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled for some other expedition against the <hi>Turks</hi> and Infidels, where they were to serve for a certain time at their own charge: in the mean time these Fathers Inquisitors took possession of their houses and goods, and when they returned home, they must not so much as enquire whether these Monks had in their absence lain with their wives, lest they would be condemned as back-sliders, and unworthy of favour.</p>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That their Ecclesiastical Polity is not good, nor holy, nor established by Jesus Christ. Thirdly, That the Mass, as it is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated therein, was not instituted by Christ, or his Apostles. The Bishop undertook to prove the contrary: but after three days disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he desired fifteen days to commit his Arguments to writing; and <hi>Arnold Hot</hi> required eight days to put in his Answer.</p>
               <p>At the day appointed the Bishop brought in a very long writing; and <hi>Hot</hi> desired to answer by word of mouth, intreating his Auditors that he might not seem troublesom to them, if he were long in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering so long a discourse; and it was granted that he should be heard with patience without interruption, and so he discoursed for divers hours four days together, to the great admiration of all that heard him, and so ready was he therein, that all the Bishops, Abbats, Monks, and Priests, wished themselves elsewhere: For he framed his answer to each point in order, as it was set down in the writing, and that with such plainness and perspicuity, that he gave all that were present to understand, that this Bishop, though he had writen much, yet had he concluded nothing that might truly turn to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> against his Assertions: Then did <hi>Arnold</hi> request, that forasmuch as the Bishops, and himself in the beginning of the conference, were bound to prove whatsoever they affirmed by the Word of God only, it might now be imposed upon the Bishops, and Priests to make good their Mass as they sing it, part by part, to have been instituted by the son of God, and so used by the Apostles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Bishops were not able to prove that the Mass, or any part of it was so ordained or used, whereupon they were much discontented, and ashamed. <hi>Arnold</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to prove that it was not instituted by Christ or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.<note place="margin">The Popelings bafled.</note> For (said he) <hi>if the Mass were the holy Supper instituted by our Saviour, there would remain after the consecration, that which was in the supper of our Lord,</hi> viz. <hi>Bread: But in the Mass there is no bread;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41459:64"/>
For by transubstantiation the bread is vanished, therefore the Mass is not the holy Supper of the Lord: &amp;c.</hi> The Bishops, Legats, Monks, and Priests having nothing to answer to these things, retired themselves: not being willing to here any more: and fearing least these Gospellers should work such an impression on the hearts of those that were present, as might shake their beliefe touching the Masse, they dessolved the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssembly. <hi>Nich Vignerius.</hi>

               <p>Between the years 1176. which was the time when this Inquisition was first erected, to the year 1228. there was so great a havock made of poor Christians, that the Arch-Bishops of <hi>Aix, Arles,</hi> and <hi>Narbonne,</hi> being assembled at the request of the said Inquisitors, to conferre with them about divers difficulties in the execution of their offices,<note place="margin">Horrible cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of the great number that were accused &amp; cast into prison, saying, <hi>We hear that you have apprehended such a multitude of the</hi> Waldenses, <hi>that it is not only impossible to defray the charge of their food, but to provide lime and stone to build prisons for them, we therefore advise you to forbear this rigour till the Pope be advertised, and direct what he will have done in this case,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1488. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the eight sent <hi>Albert de capitaneis,</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Cremona</hi> against these <hi>Waldenses,</hi> who craved aid of the Kings Lieutenant of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> against them. This Lieutenant for his service levied troops of men, and at the Arch-Deacons request,<note place="margin">Popish subtilty</note> led them against the <hi>Waldenses</hi> in the valley of <hi>Loyse,</hi> and to colour his proceedings with a pretence of justice, he took a Counsellour of the Court along with him. But when they came to the valley, they found no inhabitants, for they were all retired into their Caves in the high mountains, having carried their little children, and all their provision of food with them. Then did this cruel Lieutenant cause much wood to be laid to the mouths of the caves, and set it on fire,<note place="margin">Barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie..</note> so that some were choaked with smoak, others burnt with the fire, others cast themselves headlong from the rocks, and were broken in pieces; and if any stirred out, they were presently slain by the souldiers.</p>
               <p>In this Persecution,<note place="margin">A girevous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.</note> there were found within the Caves four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred infants stif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then did he march against the <hi>Waldenses</hi> of <hi>Pragela,</hi> and <hi>Frassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere,</hi> but they, providing for their own safety, attended him at the passages and narrow straits of their vallies,<note place="margin">The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant repulsed.</note> so that he was forced to retire.</p>
               <p>After a while <hi>Albert de Capitaneis,</hi> being called to another place, he substituted a <hi>Franciscan</hi> named <hi>Francis Ploieri,</hi> who <hi>Anno</hi> 1489. began anew to informe against the <hi>Waldenses</hi> of <hi>Fressaniere,</hi> citing them to appeare before him at <hi>Ambrun,</hi> and for non-appearing, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated them, and condemned them for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the secular power, and there goods to be confiscated; and in this judgement, their assisted one <hi>Ponce,</hi> a certain Counsellour of <hi>Dauphine.</hi> These men afterwards caught two of their Pastors [<hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Gerondin,</hi> and <hi>Peter James</hi>] who being asked why the <hi>Waldenses</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased so fast, and spread so far; they answered,<note place="margin">Plain dealing.</note> 
                  <hi>Because the Popish Priests live so dissolutly, and because the Cardinals are so covetous, proud and luxurious, it being commonly known that there is neither Pope,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1594. <hi>Anthoni Fabri,</hi> and <hi>Christopher de Salience</hi> had Comis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions sent them from the Pope,<note place="margin">The weaknesse of a woman.</note> to commence suit against the <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> who apprehending the widow of one <hi>Peter Berand,</hi> they imprisoned, and oft examined her, and thereby drew from her whatever she knew of the Assemblies of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> of the persons that frequented them, and of the places and times of their meeting, which afterwards brought great trouble to the said Churches of Christ, and of gain to the Inquisitors.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth succeeding King <hi>Francis,</hi> Anno 1598. the inhabitants of <hi>Frassaniere</hi> petitioned him to take some order for the resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of their goods, which by the Inquisitors were deteined from them. The King referred it to his Chancelor, who procured a Commissary from the Poppe, and Commissioner from the King, to be sent down to examine the businesse; These accordingly, having examined divers wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses against the <hi>Waldenses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses.</note> and finding their innocency, did at last ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve them; the Kings Commissioner publickely professing, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to be but as good a Christian as the worst of those of <hi>Frassaniere</hi> were: and returning to the King, they made report to him of that which they had done: The King thereupon ordered that the goods of the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses</hi> should be restored<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>When the Kings order came to <hi>Ambrun,</hi> it was the opinion of most men, that seeing most of these goods were in the possession of the Arch-Bishop, that therefore he should give a good example in begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to restore them, but the Arch-Bishop answered, that the goods which he held were annexed to his Arch-Bishoprick,<note place="margin">Popish subtilty and injustice.</note> and incorporated to his Church and, therefore it was out of the Kings jurisdiction, and he did not beleeve that the King would meddle therein: Yet being willing to please the King, he profered to restore them their Vineyards, provided that the Lords of <hi>Dauphine</hi> would restore the goods which they had; but there was not one that would restore what they had so unjustly gotten, so that the poor people where wholly frustrated of their expectation.</p>
               <p>Then did the summon the Arch-Bishop and those refusers before the King, but these great ones having more friends and favour at Court, then the poor people had, their excuse was admitted, which was, that they could not restore the goods, before the Pope had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved those of <hi>Frassaniere</hi> from the sentence of excommunication. <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. The President of <hi>Provence</hi> made a speech to the assembly of Estates to root out these <hi>Waldenses:</hi> Whereupon they raised an Army for the effecting of it; but as soon as the men were in Arms, it pleased God,<note place="margin">A speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> by the death of King <hi>Francis,</hi> to put an end to that design, whereby the <hi>Waldensian</hi> Churches in <hi>Dauphine</hi> enjoyed peace, and were well furnished with godly Pastors, who held them in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise

of religion, though they were in continuall danger of being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted to the death for the same.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Waldenses</hi> in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> many years before being multiplyed, so that the countrey could not feed them, dispersed themselves abroad into divers parts, whereof some went into <hi>Piedmont,</hi>

               <p>The first Persecution in <hi>Piedmont</hi> were occasioned by the Preists, who complained to the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Turin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> that these people lived not according to the manner and belief of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; that they offered not for the dead, cared not for Masses, Absolutions, or to get any of theirs out of the pains of Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hereupon the Arch-Bishop persecuted them, complaining of them to their Princes to make them odious: But the Prince enquiring of their neighbours, heard that they were of a good conversation, fearing God, without deceit or malice, loving plain dealing, alwaies ready to serve their Prince with alacrity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He therefore purposed not to molest them: But the Priests and Monks gaining nothing by their belief, charged them with an infinite number of calumnies,<note place="margin">Slanders.</note> and ever and anon catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one or other of them, they delivered them to the Inquisitors, and the Inquisitors to the executioners,<note place="margin">Persecution in Piedmont.</note> so that there was scarce a Town or City in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> wherein some of them had not been put to death.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Turin</hi> one of them had his bowels torn out of his belly,<note place="margin">Cruelty.</note> and put into a bason before his face, and then was he cruelly martyred,</p>
               <p>At <hi>Revel</hi> in the Marquisat of <hi>Saluces,</hi> one <hi>Catelin Girard</hi> being on the block whereon he should be burnt,<note place="margin">Cat.

               <p>Thus they burnt many of them in the fire, till <hi>Anno</hi> 1488. and then they resolved to assault them by open force, because they saw that otherwise they should never be able to extirpate them: besides,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> their constant sufferings converted many to the faith. Hereupon they levied an Army of eighteen thousand men, besides many inhabitants of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> who ran to the pillage from all parts.

They raised also forces in <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine,</hi> where with they over-ran the Valley of <hi>Pragela,</hi> so that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to defend themselves, could not assist their friends in <hi>Piedmont.</hi> But the enemy by this division of his forces, being weakned, was every where beaten, especially in the Valley of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> where the <hi>VVal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densians</hi> having been informed of the levies of their enemies against them, prepared themselves to receive and resist them, keeping
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41459:67"/>
the strait passages, where few men might defend themselves against many.</p>
               <p>They defended themselves with long Targets of wood, whereby they covered themselves from the hurt of their enemies arrows. Whilst they were thus bickering with their enemies, the women and children upon their knees cried out, <hi>O God help us.</hi> The enemies made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves merry with this fight,<note place="margin">Prayer.</note> and amongst them, one Capt. <hi>Saquet,</hi> who as he was imitating the woman,<note place="margin">Profanenesse. A just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> was slain, and tumbled down into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deep valley.</p>
               <p>Another Captain, crying out to the women in derision, was killed with the shot of an arrow in the throat. Hereupon the souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themselves all to their heels, and the greatest part slew themselves, by tumbling down from the rocks.</p>
               <p>Another providence of God was this, that the enemies approaching to the stongest entrance by nature, might their have fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,<note place="margin">A specall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and so made themselves masters of that Valley: But God sent so thick a cloud, and dark a fog, that they could scarce see one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby they wanted opportunity to discover their advantage, and therefore departed: which the <hi>VValdenses</hi> seeing, couragiously pursued them,<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors</note> and by that means the enemy being dispersed, and not seeing which waies they went, the greatest part fell headlong down the mountains, quitting their arms and booty which they had gotten at their first entrance into the Valley, by which means the <hi>Waldenses</hi> recovered it again,</p>
               <p>Then it pleased God to move the Princes heart (which was <hi>Philip</hi> the seventh, Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>; and Lord of <hi>Piedmont</hi>) with pity towards these poor people,<note place="margin">Gods mercy.</note> saying, <hi>That he would not have that people which had been alwaies true, faithfull and obedient to him, to be unjustly destroyed by Arms</hi>; being content that twelve of the Principall should come to him to <hi>Pignerol</hi> to crave pardon for all the rest, for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king arms in their own defence, without his authority: These he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained lovingly, forgiving all that was past, during the warre. And having been informed that all their children were born with black throats,<note place="margin">Slanders.</note> with foure rows of teeth, and all hairy, he caused some of them to be brought to him, and seeing them fair and perfect creatures, he was much displeased with himself for beleeving so easily the reports which were brought to him against them, giving command that none should hereafter molest them, but that they should enjoy all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which they rest of his subjects in <hi>Piedmont</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding which, the Monks Inquisitors daily sent out pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse against them, lay in wait for them, and as they could aprehend any of them, delievered them over to the secular power. This Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution lasted to <hi>Anno.</hi> 1532. at which time the <hi>Waldenses</hi> ordered that there exercises of religion should be performed no more in covert, as formerly they had been, but in publick, that every one might know them,<note place="margin">Zeole and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ageth.</note> and that their Pastors should preach the Gospell openly, not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any persecution that might happen unto them.</p>

                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:41459:67"/>
The prince being advertised hereof, was highly offended with them, and thereupon caused one of his Commanders to hast with his Troops into the said Vallies,<note place="margin">Persecution renued.</note> which was performed with such dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that he was entred with five hundred horse and Foot, before they were aware, ransacking, plundering and wasting all before them. Then did the <hi>Waldenses</hi> leave their ploughs, putting themselves into passes, and with their slings charged their enemies with such multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of stones, that they were constraned to flie, and to abandon their prey, many remaining dead upon the ground.</p>
               <p>This news was presently carried to the Prince, and withall he was told, that these people were not to be subdued with Arms, they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bettter the straits of their Country, then the assailants, and that the skin of one of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> would cost him the lives of a dozen of his other subjects: where upon he vsed Arms no more against them, but as any of them was caught in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> he put them to death, if they changed not their belief.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding with rigour, they persisted in their resolution,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> and that things might be carried on in the better order, they assembled out of all their Vallies to <hi>Angrogne,</hi> Anno 1535. <hi>viz.</hi> the heads of all their families, with their Pastors, where they heard that their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Provence,</hi> and <hi>Dauphine</hi> had sent two of their Pastors, <hi>George Morrell,</hi> and <hi>Peter Masson</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> to confere with <hi>Oecolampadius Bucer,</hi> and others, about their relief, which they had held from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to son, time out of minde.

               <p>When this Agreement came abroad to the ears of the Priests, they were much astonished, despairing to see these people reclaimed and brought back to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; whereupon they retired from amongst them without speaking a word.</p>

Hereupon the Parliament resolved wholly to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate them, and for that end sent two men with authority, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, or root them out.</p>
               <p>These persons went first to <hi>Perouse,</hi> where by Proclamation in the Kings name, they command all to go to Masse upon pain of loosing their lives.<note place="margin">Persecution. renewed.</note> Then they went to <hi>Pignorol,</hi> where they cited many to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before them: and amongst others, a poor simple labouring man appeared, whom the President commanded to have his childe re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by a Priest: The man requested respite to pray to God before he answered him,<note place="margin">Profanenesse.</note> which with great laughter was granted: Then fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down on his knees, he prayed unto God, and when he had done, he said to the President; I will cause my child to be rebaptised, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that you will give me a bill, signed with your own hand,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41459:68"/>
that you will discharge me of the sin which I shall commit hereby,<note place="margin">Prudence.</note> and bear one day before God the punishment and condemnation which should befall me for the same, taking this iniquity upon you and yours: The President hearing this, commanded him out of his presence, and pressed him no further.</p>
               <p>The President framed diverse Indictments against sundry persons in the Vallies, and collected whatsoever he thought might hurt them: and going to one of their Churches, he caused a Monk, that he brought along with him, to preach in the presence of the people; and when he had ended, the people desired that some one of their Pastors there present might answer his discourse, but that was denied by the President, whereupon there was such a murmur amongst the people, that the President, without any more speech, gat him away to <hi>Turin,</hi> where he reported all to the Parliament, and withall told them, that if they sought by violence to reclaime this people, they were resolued to defend themselves; and that the places of their abode, were of such strength, that it was a work for a King of <hi>France</hi> to root them out. Thereupon, this report and the Indictments were sent to the King, who having other occasions, returned no answer that year: Only the Inquisitors proceeded as they could catch any, to deliver them to the secular power.</p>
               <p>At the years end, the King commanded the Parliament to cause them to do that by force,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> which they would not by words be brought to. Then did the Parliament send the President again to <hi>Angrogne,</hi> where he commanded them in the name of the King, to go to Masse upon pain of forfeiting their lives and goods; but they answered, that they could not obey such commands against the command of God. Then he commanded that twelve of the Principal of them, together with all their Ministers and Schoolmasters, should presently yeeld up their bodies to the prisons of <hi>Turin,</hi> &amp;c. They answered, that they could not obey that command or appear at <hi>Turin,</hi> because they should thereby endanger their lives. The Parliament was so incensed at this answer, that as many as they could apprehend, they burnt, amongst whom was <hi>Jeffery Varnegle</hi> Minister of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> Anno 1557. by whose death the people that were present were much edified, seeing his constancy of invocating God to the last.</p>
               <p>The Protestant Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> hearing of this great Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, interceded in their behalf to King <hi>Henry</hi> the second of <hi>France.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The German Prince inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceds for them.</note> Who promised to have regard to this request of theirs, and indeed they enjoyed peace afterwards, till the peace was concluded betwixt the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Estate, which was <hi>Anno</hi> 1559. The year after, the Popes Nuntio reproved the Duke, for that with all his power he had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and that if he did not now endeavour to reduce them to the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, or to root them out, his Holinesse should have cause to suspect that he was a favourer of them.<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> Hereupon the Duke presently commanded them to go to Mass, upon the pain of their
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41459:69"/>
lives: But the not obeying him he set upon them by open force, and yet at the same time,<note place="margin">A great perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> he caused them to be pursued by the Monks Inquisitors also: So that a great Persecution was raised against the poor Christians: Some were taken and burnt, who shewed invincible constancy in all their torments and death.</p>
               <p>To recite all the outrages, cruelties and villanies practised against them, would be too tedious: Many fled, and their houses and goods were ransacked and spoiled: One of their Ministers was apprehended, and put to a shamefull and cruell death, but he shewed such admirable patience therein, as astonished his very adversaries. Some also were taken and sent to be Gally-slaves: Yet some, through weakness, yeelded to the adversaries, and were more cruelly handled then those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained constant in the truth.<note place="margin">Humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Three of the most cruel persecutors of these faithfull servants of Jesus Christ, were, first <hi>Thomas Jacomel</hi> a Monk, an Apostate, that had renounced the known truth, and persecuted mortally and maliciously the poor Christians against his own conscience: he was a whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and given over to all villanies, and filthy living, a Sodomite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his delight was to spoil, rob, and torment the captives of these <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> The second was a collaterall, called <hi>Corbis,</hi> who in the examination of the prisoners was very rigorous, and burnt many of them: but in the end feeling a remorse in his conscience, he protested that he would meddle with them no more: The third was the Provest of Justice, who lay in wait in the high waies to apprehend them when they went abroad in the morning, or as they went to the Market.</p>
               <p>The Monks also of <hi>Pignorol</hi> vexed the Churches near about them grievously,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> some they took prisoners, and kept them in their Abbies: then they assembled a company of Ruffians, sending them to spoil the Churches, and to take prisoners, men, women, and childen; of whom some by torments they forced to abjure, others they sent to the Galleys others they burnt.</p>
               <p>The gentlemen of the valley of S. <hi>Martin</hi> vexed their tenants grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously: spoiling some of their goods, imprisoning others, and vexing them by all means: Two of those gentlemen getting some Ruffians to them in the night time, set upon a village called <hi>Renclaret,</hi> which the Inhabitants perceiving, fled into the mountains covered with snow, naked, and without victuals: in the morning these villains took a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of that Valley, who was coming to visit these people of <hi>Renclaret,</hi> and burnt him: but three nights after they of <hi>Pragela,</hi> pitying their friends of <hi>Renclaret,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> sent four hundred men against the Ruffians, who fought with them, and without the losse of one man, put them to flight, and restored their friends to their houses.</p>
               <p>A year after, one of these gentlemen called <hi>Truchet,</hi> with a company of Ruffians, arrested the Minister of <hi>Renclaret,</hi> as he was at his sermon: but the people were so moved at his outragious dealing, especially the women, that they had almost strangled <hi>Truchet,</hi> and so canvased the rest of his company, that they had no minde to come any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:41459:69"/>
Shortly after they took another Minister as he was going to preach in a parish a mile from his house, but the people hearing of it, speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursued them, and recovered their Minister again; but when the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains saw that they were like to lose their prey, they so wounded him, that they left him for dead.<note place="margin">Treachery.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Monks of <hi>Pignerol</hi> sent some Ruffians by night to the Ministers house of S. <hi>Germain,</hi> who were conducted by a Traitor that knew the house, and formerly had frequented it; this fellow knocking at the door, and the Minister knowing his voice, opened the door, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving himself to be betrayed, he fled at a back-door, yet was quickly taken, and sorely wounded, notwithstanding which, they pricked him with halberds to hasten his pace, as they carried him away: they also slew and hurt many others: The Minister, after sore imprisonment,<note place="margin">Prodigious vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany.</note> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured a cruel death with much constancy: at his death the Inquisitors caused two poor women that they kept in prison, to carry faggots to burn him, and to say to him their Pastor, <hi>Take this, thou wicked Heretick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in recompence of that naughty Doctrine that thou hast taught us</hi>: To whom he replied, <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> good women, I have taught you well, but you have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In brief, they so persecuted these poor people, that they forced them to forsake their houses, and to fly into the mountains, loosing all their estates, so that many that had lived well, and relieved others, were now fain to crave relief and succour of others.</p>
               <p>The Monks with their Troops of Ruffians continued thus to molest and persecute these poor people, They asked of their Ministers, <hi>Whether it were not lawfull for them to defend themselves against such violence</hi>? The Ministers answered, that it was, only they advised them to avoid blood-shed as much as might be. This question being resolved, they of <hi>Luserne</hi> and <hi>Angrogne</hi> sent some to aid their friends of St. <hi>Germain</hi> against the Monks.</p>
               <p>In <hi>June,</hi> divers of these <hi>Waldenses</hi> went out into the country to reap their harvest, and in sundry places were all taken prisoners,<note place="margin">A miracle of Mercy.</note> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of each others calamity, but God so wrought, that miraculously they all escaped out of prison, to the great astonishment of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries. At the same time also, others who had been long in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and longed for nothing but death, through Gods providence, were delivered after a wonderful sort.</p>
               <p>In <hi>July,</hi> they of <hi>Angrogne</hi> being at their harvest on the hill side of St. <hi>Germaine,</hi> perceived a company of souldiers that were spoiling the inhabitants of St. <hi>Germain</hi>; whereupon they made an out-cry, upon which the people of <hi>Angrogne</hi> ran presently thither-ward, some by the valley, others over the mountain: they which went by the valley being above fifty men, met with the spoilers, who were a hundred and twenty men well appointed, with whom they fought, and gave them a great overthrow; some were hurt, others drowned,<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> and but few hardly escaped; not one of <hi>Angrogne</hi> being hurt in the fight.</p>
               <p>The Monks were so affrighted with this defeat, that they ran away
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41459:70"/>
from their Abbey to <hi>Pignerol,</hi> to save their Reliques and Images, which they carried thither; and if the Ministers would have suffered their people to have attempted it, they might easily have freed their brethren which were imprisoned in the Abbey.<note place="margin">Popish subtilty.</note>
               </p>
               <p>After this these Monks, being assisted by a Captain, took many of the inhabitants of the valley of <hi>Luserne</hi> prisoners, spoiling their goods, driving away their Cattel; and in the end ransomed them for great summs of money.</p>
               <p>About this time a Gentleman of <hi>Campillan</hi> promised his Neighbours that if they would give him thirty Crowns,<note place="margin">Popish dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation and perfidiousness.</note> he would secure them against trouble; but when he had got the money, he caused some soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to come to his house, and in the night sending for the poor men which suspected no danger, he trayterously endeavoured to deliver them into the hands of their mortal enemies: but God, who succours his in their greatest necessity, discovered to one of them the danger they were in, whereby they all fled, and escaped.</p>
               <p>Then were strict commands sent through all the Country to banish all the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> together with the Gospel, out of the mountains and vallies of <hi>Piedmount</hi>; but the people still desired that they might have leave to serve God purely according to the Rules of the Word.</p>
               <p>In the end of <hi>October,</hi> a rumour was spread abroad, that an Army was raising wholly to destroy them: yea, and such malefactors as were in prisons or banished, were pardoned, upon condition that they should take arms to destroy the <hi>Waldenses</hi>: Hereupon the Ministers met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to consult what was to be done in so great an extremity. And first they enjoyed a general and publick Fast to seek unto God for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,<note place="margin">Fasting and Prayer.</note> and in the end concluded that they should not defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by arms, but that forsaking their houses, and taking their best movables with them, they should retire unto the high mountains, but if their enemies pursued them thither, that then they should take such advise as God should please to give them.</p>
               <p>This Counsel all the people submitted to, and for eight days space, were as busie as Ants in summer, to remove their goods and provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which though they did in great danger, yet with great courage and alacrity, praising God and singing <hi>Psalms,</hi> every one cheering up another. But other Ministers hearing of this resolution, wrote to them that they thought it strange that in such an extream necessity, they should not rather resolve to defend themselves against violence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that it was lawfull for them so to do, to defend the true Religion, and the lives of themselves, wives and children, knowing thar it was not the Duke, but the Pope that thus stirred him up against them.</p>
               <p>During this time, their Adversaries cryed nothing, but <hi>To the fire with them, to the fire with them,</hi> and presently by proclamations set up every where, <hi>Angrogne</hi> was exposed to the fire and sword: The Army also approached to their borders, and the people retired into the mountains: But when they saw some horse-men not only spoiling their goods, but taking some of their brethren prisoners, they came
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41459:70"/>
back, and set upon them, in which bickering some of the enemies were slain, and the rest retired to their camp; not one of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> was slain or hurt. But two of these horsemen that fled, galloping away before the rest, when they came neer to the Army, cryed out, <hi>They come, they come</hi>: Whereupon the whole Army was so astonished,<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> that every man fled away, none pursuing, and the Captain could not all that day get them into order again.</p>
               <p>The next day the Army under the Lord of <hi>Trinity,</hi> was mustered in a meddow, near to <hi>Angrogne</hi>; They of the Town had sent some to stop the passages that the Army should not enter, and in the mean time they retired into the meddow of <hi>Toure,</hi> not expecting the Army so soon, so that there were but few that kept the Passages, but when those few perceived their enemies preparing themselves to fight, they all fell down upon their knees, praying earnestly unto God to pity them, and not to look on their sins,<note place="margin">Power of Prayer.</note> but on the cause that they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, to turn the hearts of their enemies, and so to worke that there might be no effusion of bloud, but if it were his will to take them, their wives and infants out of this world, that it would please him mercifully to receive them into his Kingdome. Their prayers being ended, they perceived their enemies to come through the Vines to win the top of the mountain: Whereupon the combat began in divers places, and continued untill night: The poor <hi>Waldenses</hi> being but few, and only armed with slings and cross-bows, were much oppressed by the multitudes of their enemies, so that at last they retired to the top of the mountain, where they defended themselves till night. But having found a place where they might withstand their enemies, they turned again and slew divers of them.</p>
               <p>At Even the enemies began to encamp themselves, which the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses</hi> perceiving, they fell to prayer, desiring God to assist and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them, for which the enemies flouted and laughed them to scorn.<note place="margin">Profaneness.</note> The poor people devised to send a Drum into a valley hard by; and as they were at prayer, the Drum beat up in the valley; whereupon the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> caused his souldiers to retreat, which was a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> who were weary, thirsty,<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and in great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill if God by this meanes had not given them some rest: Of the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses</hi> there were but three slain, but many of their enemies, and more hurt, of whom few recovered.</p>
               <p>This combat much encouraged the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and as much terrified their enemies, who in their retreat, burnt many houses, and destroyed the Wines that were in the Presse.</p>
               <p>Then did the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> encamp in the vally of <hi>Luserne,</hi> by a Village, the people whereof had alwaies hated the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and much rejoyced at this hurt that was now done to them, but they were paid back in their own coyn, being all destroyed by the Army.<note place="margin">A just reward.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Then did the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> place four Garisons in four severall Fortresses, so that the poor <hi>Waldenses</hi> found themselves in a sea of troubles: Whereupon they first betook themselves to prayer,<note place="margin">Prayer.</note> then
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41459:71"/>
sent to their friends for aid, who sent them all that they could make. Then did the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> send his Army to <hi>Villars</hi> and <hi>Tailleret</hi>: The lesser part went towards <hi>Villars</hi>; the people seeing their enemies approaching, called upon God with fervent prayer, then set upon their enemies, slew some, hurt others, and the rest fled. The other company going towards <hi>Tailleret,</hi> they of that place were but few in number, yet making their prayers to God, and commending their cause to him, they set valiantly upon their enemies; during which bickering, they of <hi>Villars,</hi> encouraged by their late success, came to help their friends, and set so lustily upon their enemies, that they put them to flight: but in the pursuit of them they fell into an ambush, and were environed by their enemies, yet, through Gods mercy, they all escaped without the losse of one man;<note place="margin">A speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> on the enemies side there were so many slain, that they were laid together by whole Cart-loads.</p>
               <p>Another party of the enemies going to spoil a rich mans house, some of his neighbours, not being above seventy, set upon them, put them to flight, took away their Drum, and recovered their booty from them.</p>
               <p>Then did the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> send to them, telling them how much the Duke and his Dutchesse favoured them,<note place="margin">Popish subtilty</note> and promised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to mediate for them that they might live in peace: But whilest by these pretences, he sought to make them secure, he sent part of his Army to get the hill of <hi>Tailleret,</hi> and another part had already gotten the way that led to the meddow of <hi>Tour,</hi> whereby the <hi>Angrognians</hi> might have been easily enclosed; but they perceiving it, immediatly sent some to encounter with their enemies, who gat the victory, pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to their camp, and slew very many of them, without the losse of one man.</p>
               <p>The Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> cunningly excused this attempt, and sent to them to draw up a supplication to the Duke, which was accordingly done, wherein they promised to render all honour and reverence unto God, according to his Word, and all due obedience to the Duk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in the mean time <hi>Trinity</hi> grievously vexed them of <hi>Tailleret,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Perfidiousness,</note> upon pretence that they had not presented themselves to treat of this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, taking their arms from them, and causing them to ask pardon on their knees.</p>
               <p>But presently after news was brought them, that the enemies had gotten to the top of the mountaine, and had taken all the passages, whereat they were sore amazed, and ran with all speed to defend their wives and children: some they saved, but the most of their goods were already in the enemies hands, who at this time did them much mischiefe.</p>
               <p>Yet after this, the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> sent word again to them that were fled, that if they would return, he would receive them to mercy: The poor people most of them trusting to his promise, returned, but the next morning the enemies came to apprehend them and their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,<note place="margin">Papist trechery</note>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:41459:71"/>
besetting the place on every side: Then they that were swift of foot, escaped, all the rest were taken; yet God miraculously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them: for an old man that could not run so fast as the other, was espied by a souldier,<note place="margin">A notable story.</note> who ran with a naked sword to have slain him, the old man seeing the iminent danger, caught him by the legs, overthrew him, and drew him by the heels down the hill; the souldier cryed, <hi>Help, help, this villain will kill me</hi>;<note place="margin">A speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> hereupon his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ran to his rescue; but in the mean time the old man escaped; and the rest seeing what the old man had done, though they had lost their weapons, yet took heart of grass, and with stones and slings, drave away their enemies, and thereby they all escaped.</p>
               <p>The next day the souldiers went again to <hi>Tailleret,</hi> robbing, spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and carrying away all that they could find, but most of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were retired towards <hi>Villars</hi>; Then did the souldiers range all about, and took divers prisoners, whom they used cruelly,<note place="margin">Barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> and one souldier bit off one of their ears, saying, <hi>I will carry the flesh of this wicked Heretick with me into my Country:</hi> They found also two women, the mother and the daughter, in a cave, whom they wounded to death: and in another cave, an old man of an hundred years old, with his grand-daughter of eighteen years old that fed him; the man they slew, the maid they would have ravished, who flying from them, tumbled down the mountains, and died.</p>
               <p>About the same time there was one <hi>John Martin</hi> that made his boasts every where, that if he could meet with the Minister of <hi>Angrogne.</hi> he would slit his nose; but shortly after a wolf met him, and setting upon him, bit off his nose, whereupon he ran mad, and died mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably.</p>
               <p>A certain souldier promised the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> to bring to him the Minister of <hi>Tailleret,</hi> and accordingly never ceased till he found him,<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.</note> but as he was pursuing of him, some out of the mountains rescued the Minister, and slew the souldier with stones.</p>
               <p>These souldiers were so extream abusive to women, that many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists that lived by,<note place="margin">Uncleannesse.</note> sent their daughters into the mountains to the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses</hi> to preserve their chastity.</p>
               <p>Then did the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> promise, that if they would pay him eight thousand Crowns, he would with-draw his Army, and be gone; They being desirous of Peace, sold their Cattel to raise the money,<note place="margin">Popish Perfidiousness.</note> but when he had received it, he continued his Army there still.</p>
               <p>Then did the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> require them to send away their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters till the matter were determined before the Duke, or else by his Army he would force them to it; whereupon by mutual consent they agreed, that the Ministers should with-draw for the present,<note place="margin">Their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters sent away.</note> till the Army was retired, which was not done without great sighs, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and tears. At that time there fell an extraordinary snow, so that the people with great difficulty, were fain to make way for their Ministers to pass. But the Army hearing that the Ministers were gathered together, they sent out a company of harquebushers to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41459:72"/>
them, who came but one hour too late to have taken them: Then did they search every cave, house and chest, to seek them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they robbed the poor people of all their best things. Then did they beset the Ministers house of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> to whom the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> had promised safety, but it pleased God that he escaped; the souldiers pursued him into the mountains, but could not overtake him; whereupon they plundred his house, burnt his books and writings, and so returned.</p>
               <p>The next morning command was given to the Rulers of <hi>Angrogne</hi> within twenty four hours to deliver up their Minister, or else <hi>Angrogne</hi> should be put to fire and sword; They answered that they knew not where he was, for the souldiers had driven him over the mountains. Then did the souldiers burn houses, break the mils, spoil the people, and do all the mischief they could, and so departed.</p>
               <p>The Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> left Garisons in the Fortresses, and caused the poor <hi>Waldenses</hi> to maintain them, who, not content with their wages, pillaged and robbed all about them; and having taken fourteen men, they bound them, and were leading them away prisoners, but their wives and children pursued them so fiercely with stones,<note place="margin">Cruelty.</note> that they were glad to let their prisoners go, and had much ado to save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Two others that they caught, they hung up by the heels and hands, and having tormented them almost to death, at last released them for a great sum of money. Another Garison in the night went to <hi>Tailleret,</hi> brake in at the windows and tops of houses, spoiling all, and took also fourteen prisoners, whom they bound two and two together, and were carrying them to the Fortress, but two of them getting loose, so valiantly assaulted the souldiers, and beat them with stones, that they forced them to let go their other prisoners. Yet two others they took, and carried them to the Fort; one was but a child, whom the Captain strangled with his own hands; the other was sixty years old,<note place="margin">Barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> whom they bound, and took a crature that lives in horse-dung, and put into his navel, covering them with a dish, which in a short space did eat into his belly, and killed him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Waldenses</hi> were in great perplexity, by reason of these Garisons, but especially for the want of their Ministers: whereupon they resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to call them back, yet to have preaching only in private, because they would not imbitter the souldiers, till their messengers returned from the Duke. These messengers were cruelly handled at the Court, and at last sent back with a command that they should entertain Priests to say Mass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When this Report was made to their brethren that sent them, there was wonderfull lamentation, weeping and mourning. Then did they send two of their Ministers to the Church of <hi>Pragela,</hi> to shew them of the pitifull condition of the Churches in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and to ask their advice, how to prevent the danger: and in the next place they all fell to prayer,<note place="margin">Prayer in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> and having long called upon God for counsel and direction in so great a strait; they resolved upon debate, that the people in <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Dauphine</hi> should joyn in a League toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41459:72"/>
wherein they promised, through Gods grace and assistance, to maintain the pure preaching of the Gospel, and administring the holy Sacraments, to yeeld obedience to their superior, so farre as they were commanded by the Word of God, and one to be aiding and assisting to the other; that none should conclude any thing touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the estate of Religion,<note place="margin">A League.</note> without the consent of the rest of the Vallies.</p>
               <p>During this Treaty, all the housholders were required to be present at Masse, and such as would do it, should live in peace, but such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused should be condemned to be burnt, or sent to the Gallies, so that the people were constrained to fly, die, or renounce the Gospel: The first they would have chosen, but could not do it by reason of the great snow; Whereupon they exhorted one another saying, <hi>We shall be all called for to morrow, to renounce God, and to return to Idolatry, let us therefore make a solemn protestation, that we will live and die in the confession of Gods holy Word; let us in the morning hear a sermon, and then cast down to the ground, all the Idols and Altars</hi>:<note place="margin">A good reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</note> and to this all agreed.</p>
               <p>In the morning they put their resolutions into execution, beating down the Images, and casting down the Altars: Then they went to <hi>Villars</hi> to do the like there; but by the way they encountred with a band of souldiers, who where going to spoil a village,<note place="margin">Images demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</note> and to fetch away the inhabitants prisoners: These souldiers seeing them so ill provided, mocked them, and discharged their guns at them; but they taking courage, with stones beat the souldiers, pursuing them to the Fortresse. Then did they go to <hi>Villars,</hi> and having destroyed the Idols and Altars there, they returned to besiege the fortresse, demanding the prisoners that were therein.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Waldenses</hi> attempted often to have taken the Fortresse; but without Ordinance it was impossible: also the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> was come back with his army, and the next day would have raised the siege: But it pleased God that very night that the souldiers in the Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, desired leave to depart, with bag and baggage, which was easily granted to them: and the souldiers whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:41459:73"/>
The next day the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> cunningly sent to them of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grogne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Popish subtilty.</note> that if they would not aid the other, they should be gently dealt with, but they knowing his fraud, agreed with the rest to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Religion with their lives, and that no one should make an agreement with out the consent of the rest. Then did the Lord of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> assay with his Army to enter into the borders of <hi>Angrogne</hi> by certaine streights, but the people having raised up some breast-works, valiantly defended themselves and offended their enemies. <hi>Trinities</hi> souldiers being weary, fresh ones were brought in their stead, so that the fight endured untill night, wherein many of the enemies were slain, more hurt, and but two of the <hi>Waldenses</hi>; and so the battell ceased for the present.</p>
               <p>The next day the Army marched towards <hi>Angrogne</hi> five severall waies, and there were none to resist, but only a few that kept the Watch, who valiantly fought for a space, but seeing themselves in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be inclosed, they retreated to an high place, where the combate was renued with greater fiercenesse then before: The Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> seeing the losse of many of his men, sounded a retreat, and went to <hi>Angrogne,</hi> but the people were fled into the medow of <hi>Tour</hi>; therefore he burned and spoiled all before him: He also oft set fire upon the two Churches, where the word used to be preached,<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> but could not burne them, and so he did to the Ministers house, and yet it remained whole.</p>
               <p>Amongst them of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> there were but two that were enemies to the word of God, and they were both slain that day.</p>
               <p>Then did the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> send some to burn <hi>Rosa</hi>; but the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were driven back four daies together, by them that kept the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages; whereupon he sent his whole Army, yet they valiantly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood them from morning till night; At last a party gat behinde them, over a mountaine, so that the poor people seeing themselves environed, saved themselves by running through the midst of their enemies, and others of them gat into the rocks. The enemies being entred <hi>Rosa</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed all with fire and sword: The people fled by secret waies toward <hi>Luserne,</hi> wandring all night upon the mountains full of snow, laden with their stuff, carrying their infants in their arms, and leading others by the hand with great pain and travell:<note place="margin">Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> They of <hi>Luserne</hi> seeing them, ran to them, praising God for their deliverance; and they all were very chearfull, notwithstanding their extremities.</p>
               <p>Shortly after the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> went to <hi>Luserne</hi> by three waies; they which kept the passages resisted their enemies valiantly, but when they saw themselves assaulted on every side, they fled into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Then did the souldiers sack and burn the houses, staying all they could finde: When they which were fled to the mountains saw their houses on fire,<note place="margin">Joy in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> they praised God, and gave him thanks, that thus accounted them worthy to suffer for his Name: Then did the souldiers pursue them to the mountains, but after they had called upon God, a few of them beat back their enemies, whereupon the Army retired.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:41459:73"/>
They in the meddow of <hi>Tour,</hi> perceiving a company of souldiers burning the rest of the houses in <hi>Angrogne,</hi> they sent six harque-bushiers against them, who from the higher ground, discharging all their guns together, the souldiers ran all away, when none pursued them.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, as the Watch was hearing a Sermon, they spied a company of souldeirs marching up the hill, whereupon they ran to encounter them, and easily discomfited them: But whilest they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued the chase, some cried to them, that another company was entred into the meddow, whereupon they left the chase: or else not one of their enemies had escaped.</p>
               <p>Presently other companies came other waies, which the Ministers and people seeing, were much discouraged, and therefore they fell to prayer, and ardently called upon God, with sighs and teares untill night. And whereas seven spies were sent before the souldiers,<note place="margin">Prayer in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> there went out five of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> against them, and took some, and chased the rest: Then went out eight more against the whole company, and pursued them with an undaunted courage from rock to rock, and from hill to hill, and then went out twelve more, who joining with the other, made a great slaughter of their enemies.</p>
               <p>Another company from <hi>Luserne,</hi> having a Minister with them, as they used alwaies to have; after they had made their prayers to God, set upon another company of souldiers, whose hearts were so taken from them, that they presently fled: One of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> a very young man, carried a greate staff in his hand,<note place="margin">Speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences.</note> with which he laid so lustily at his enemies, that he brake his staff, and slew many of them, he also brake four of their own swords, in pursuing of them: Also, a boy of eighteen years old, slew the Lord of <hi>Monteil,</hi> Master of the Camp, which much dismaid the enemies: Another threw down <hi>Charles Truchet,</hi> and then leaped upon him, and slew him with his own sword; upon which all the rest fled, and were pursued till night hindred.</p>
               <p>The Minister seeing the great effusion of bloud, and the enemies fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cried to the people that it was enough, and so exhorted them to praise God: They that heard him obeyed, and fell to prayer. In this battell they gat much armour, which was a great advantage to them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. Thanks were returned unto God in every place, every one sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying, <hi>Who sees not evidently that God fighteth for us.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Presently after, the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> returned to burn the Villages, but especially to pursue the poor people in the mountains. And one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with many horsemen ascended the mountain of <hi>Comb</hi> by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suspected way, where were no Warders; but they which were next, seeing them, called upon God for aid, and though they were but thirty in number, yet they valiantly beat them back twice; many of the enemies were slain, and not one of the <hi>Waldenses. Trinity</hi> seeing his men thus beaten back, sent out most of his Army to assist them,<note place="margin">A speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> which were about one thousand five hundred men: And there came
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41459:74"/>
about a hundred to help the Warders: The combat was very cruel; at last the poor men were fain to retreat with the losse of two of their men; at this the enemies exceedingly rejoyced, blowing their trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and triumphing: but the people crying all together to the Lord, returned again, with greater violence, assaulting them with their slings; So that the enemies being weary, rested themselves, and the while the <hi>Waldenses</hi> betook themselves to prayer, which more affrighted their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies then any thing else.<note place="margin">Prayer.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Then did the souldiers charge again furiously, but by the hands of a few they were driven back; yea little children, fervently calling upon God, threw stones at their enemies, as also did the women: Such as were unfit for war kneeled on the ground with their faces towards heaven, crying,<note place="margin">The enemies every where beaten.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord help us.</hi> Then came one running that brought word, that the <hi>Angrognians</hi> were coming to help them, which the enemies hearing, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently retreated.</p>
               <p>Another party of the Army of an hundred and fourty, went ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; but by seven men they were strongly resisted and driven back: A third party was met by the <hi>Angrognians</hi> and driven back.</p>
               <p>The Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> intending to be revenged upon them in the med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Tour,</hi> assembled all the Gentlemen of the country, and an Army of about seven thousand: and when the poor people saw them coming, glittering in their harnesse, and so many in number, they were at first astonished, but pouring out their prayers unto God to succour them,<note place="margin">Prayer in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> and to have regard to the glory of his Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They marched to encounter with their enemies, and seasonably by the way, they met with some aid that was coming to them from <hi>Luserne,</hi> so that uniting themselves, they soon discomfited their enemies.</p>
               <p>The Captain of the enemies had in the morning promised to do great matters that day, but in the evening he was carried back, weak and wounded, and not like to live: Whereupon a Papist said to him, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur, there religion is beter then ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another part of the Army set upon an house in a passe, wherein were but five men, yet they lustily defended it, drave out their enemies that had entred, and kept the place, till some of their friends came to relieve them.</p>
               <p>Another half of the Army, assaulted another Bulwork on the side of the mountaine; And they within suffered them to come very near, but then with slings and guns, they slew many of them, others rouled down great stones, which killed divers, so that when they had attempted all waies to take it, they were forced to retire; the Lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> weeping to see his men slain so fast, and at last, having lost very many of his men, he was forced to retreate; many of the Army crying out, <hi>God fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for them, and we do them wrong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all that conflict there were but two of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> slain, and two hurt;<note place="margin">A speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> whereas they never shot at their enemies but they killed some, and sometimes two at one shot: The souldiers confessed that they
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41459:74"/>
were so astonished that they could not fight: Others said, that the Ministers by their prayers, conjured and bewitched them. It was a wonderfull work of God, that shepherds and cowherds should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with so mighty a power of strong and brave souldiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well furnished with ammunition, and themselves having nothing but slings, stones, and a few harquebushes, and yet should beat them, and in all those fights, they lost not above fourteen men.</p>
               <p>Shortly after a company of souldiers went to <hi>Angrogne</hi> to destroy the Vines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and mocking the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> they said,<note place="margin">Scorners puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</note> 
                  <hi>that they were valiant men behinde their bulworks, but if they came into the plain, how they would beat them:</hi> Then came thirty of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and set upon them in the plain, and fought with them a long time, hand to hand, slew many of them, and at last forced them to run away, and that with the losse of one only man of their own.</p>
               <p>The night after, some thought that it would have been an easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to take the Lord of <hi>Trinity,</hi> and to have spoiled his whole Army, but the <hi>Waldenses</hi> would not do it, least they should offend God, and passe the bounds of their vocation, intending only to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>Then did <hi>Trinity</hi> betake himself to his old shifts of entertaining a treaty for agreement; but in the <hi>Interim,</hi>

               <p>Shortly after the Ministers and chief Rulers of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested the Lord of <hi>Raconis</hi> to deliver a petition, which they had drawn up to the Dutches of <hi>Savoy,</hi> wherein they declared the equity of their cause, protesting all due obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at last, through Gods mercy, they came to a good agreement, and according to the promise of God, <hi>all things turned to the best to those that feared him, that were called according to his purpose.</hi>

               <p>After the death of the Duke and Dutchesse of <hi>Savoy, Charles Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel</hi> their son succeeded,<note place="margin">Peace obtained</note> who maintained them in peace according to the treaty formerly made: Yet the Inquisitors were alwaies watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to apprehend one or other of them: and amongst others, one <hi>Bartholmew Copin</hi> of <hi>Luserne,</hi> being at <hi>Ast</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> with his Merchandize, and at evening supping with some other company,<note place="margin">

Fie upon you, said the other, what a false Religion is yours? <hi>My Religion,</hi> said <hi>Copin, is as true, as it's true that God is God, &amp;c.</hi> The next morning <hi>Copin</hi> was called before the Bishop of <hi>Ast,</hi> who told him, that he must either recant the opinions he held over night, or be punished: <hi>Copin</hi> said, he had been provoked to that discourse; yet he said nothing but what he would maintaine with his life: Adding that he had some goods, and a wife and children, yet he had lost the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that he bare unto those things,<note place="margin">Christ best of all.</note> neither were they dear to him, to the prejudice of his conscience. Yet <hi>said, that behaving himself ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, he ought not to be molested<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he came about his merchandize, the</hi> Turks <hi>and</hi> Jews <hi>being permit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next day the Bishops Secretary went to him, professing great love, and telling him, that except he acknowledged his fault, he was in great danger of his life: <hi>Copin</hi> answered, <hi>That his life was in the hands of God, and he desired not to preserve it to the prejudice of his glory; and having but a few paces to walk in his journey to heaven, his hearty prayer to God was, to give him grace not to turn back.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some few daies after he was examined by an Inquisitor in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Bishop, who exceedingly tormented him with sweet and gentle perswasions,<note place="margin">Tentation.</note> by fair words seeking to draw him to an abjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But <hi>Copin</hi> alwaies convinced him by the word of God: alleadging that if he should be ashamed of,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> or deny Christ before men, Christ would be ashamed of, and deny him before his heavenly Father. Then said the Monk, <hi>Go thy waies thou cursed Heretick to all the devils in hell, and when thou shalt be there tormented by them, thou wilt remember this good and holy counsel that we have given thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>After many violent encounters, they caused his wife and son to come to him, promising if he would confesse his fault, he should have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to depart with them; They suffered them also to sup together, which time he spent in exhorting them to patience,<note place="margin">His exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his wife and children</note> telling them that God would be more then a husband and father to them: for his own part he was not bounde to love wife or childe more then Christ; and that they should esteem it their happiness, that God was pleased to do him the honour to be a witnesse to his truth, with the losse of his life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He enjoyned his wife to bring up his children in the fear of God: his son he commanded to obey his mother, he desired them to pray for him, that God would strengthen him against all tentations, and so taking leave of his wife, and blessing his son, he dismissed them, his wife and son shedding fountains of tears, and crying out in so lamentable a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as would have moved the hardest hart to compassion.</p>
               <p>The Bishop knew not well what to do with him: If he let him go, he feared a scandall, and that many would be encouraged by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity: If he punished him, he offended against the agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Duke and the <hi>Waldenses.</hi> And thereupon he sent his indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Pope, to know his pleasure.

In their travell, they found in <hi>Calabria,</hi> some wast and untilled lands: yet seeming very fertil,<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> fit for corn wine, oyl and chestnuts, and that the hils were fit for cattel, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them with fuell and timber; they came therefore to the Lords of those places to treate with them touching their abode there.</p>
               <p>The Lords received them lovingly, agreed to orders much for the advantage of these new inhabitants; agreed about rents, tenths, tolls, penalties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so assigned to them certain parts of the Countrey. Then did they return to their parents, shewing how it fared with them, and so receive what they pleased to bestow upon them, and many of them marrying, they returned into <hi>Calabria,</hi> where they built some Towns and Cities, as St <hi>Xist, la Garde,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Lords of those Countries thought themselves happy in that they had met with such good subjects as peopled their waste lands,<note place="margin">Their holy lives.</note> and made them to abound with all manner of fruits; but principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were honest men, and of good conscience, yeelding all those duties and honours which they could expect from good subjects. Only the Priests complained of them, that they lived not after their religion, made not their children Priests and Nuns; loved not Tapers, Masses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they adorned not their Churches with Images, went not on Pilgrimage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon the Lords feared, that if the Pope should take notice, that so near his Seat, there were people that contemned his Laws, they might chance to lose their subiects: They therefore perswaded the Priest to be silent, since in other things they shewed themselves ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men, inriched the Country, yea and the Priests themselves, by their Tithes. These Lords also stopped the mouths of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who exceedingly murmured, because by no means they could draw them into alliance with them, and because all that they had,<note place="margin">Their godly conversation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> prospered exceedingly: They were wise and temperate, not given to drinking, dancing, swearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and living in a Country, where the inhabitants were given to all manner of wickednesse, they were as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones in a common sink.</p>
               <p>Thus they were preserved in peace by their Lords, till <hi>Anno</hi> 1560.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41459:76"/>
At which time these <hi>Waldenses</hi> resolving to make a publick profession of their Religion; sent for two Ministers from <hi>Geneva,</hi> who did much establish the exercise of Religion amongst them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Pope per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutes them.</note>Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth hearing of this, presently concluded their utter ruine and extirpation, giving the same in charge to Cardinal <hi>Alexandrino,</hi> a violent man, who chose two Monks Inquisitors of his own humour, and sent them, first to begin with the inhabitants of St. <hi>Xist</hi>; There they assembled the people, gave them good words, promising that they should receive no violence, if they would accept of such Teachers as the Bishops should appoint, which if they refus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they would lose their lives, goods and honors, and would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for <hi>Hereticks:</hi> And further to prove them, they appointed a Mass to be sung: but the people with their wives and children, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently quit their houses, and fled into the woods.</p>
               <p>From thence the Monks went to <hi>la Garde,</hi> where they caused the Town-gates to be locked, and the people to be assembled, telling them that they of St. <hi>Xist</hi> had adjured their Religion,<note place="margin">Popish lies.</note> and went to Mass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> promising that if they would do the like, no man should injure them. These poor people, believing what was told them, were content to do what they would have them; but when they heard that their friends of St. <hi>Xist</hi> refused to go to Mass,<note place="margin">Humane frailty</note> and were fled into the woods, they were exceedingly grieved at their own revolt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved with their wives and children, to go to their brethren.</p>
               <p>In the meane time the Monks sent two companies of souldiers after them of St. <hi>Xist,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Popish cruelty.</note> who ran after them as after wilde beasts, crying, <hi>kill, kill,</hi> and so slew divers: but such as could get to the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, called to the souldiers, beseeched them to have pity on them, their wives and children, telling them that they had been inoffensive in their conversations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet if they would not suffer them to continue in their habitations, that at least they would license them to depart, either by sea or land, that they might retire themselves whether the Lord should be pleased to conduct them, beseeching them also, for Gods sake, not to force them to defend themselves-</p>
               <p>But this more enraged the souldiers, who presently violently assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them: Then did they so defend themselves, that by Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,<note place="margin">A speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> they slew the greatest part of the souldiers, and put the rest to flight. Hereupon the Inquisitors wrote to the Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> speedily to send some Companies of souldiers to apprehend the <hi>Hereticks</hi> of St. <hi>Xist</hi> and <hi>la Garde,</hi> whereby he should do a work very pleasing to the Pope, and meritorious for himself.</p>
               <p>Then did the Viceroy come himself with his Troops, in the mean time the <hi>Waldensian</hi> women came home to seek for food for their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and children that were in the woods-</p>
               <p>The Viceroy proclaimed through all <hi>Naples,</hi> that all such banished persons as would come to fight against the <hi>Hereticks</hi> of St. <hi>Xist,</hi> should be pardoned all their offences: Whereupon great numbers resorted to him, and were conducted to the woods, where they chased these
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41459:76"/>
poor people, slaying some, wounding others, the rest fled into caves,<note place="margin">Barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> where most of them died of famine.</p>
               <p>Then were they of <hi>la Garde</hi> cited before the Inquisitor, and many fair Promises were made unto them if they would appeare; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto, thirty of them were apprehended, and put to the rack.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Charlin</hi> was racked with such violence, that his bowels brake out of his belly, and all to extort from him a confession, that in the night, the candles being put out, they committed whoredome, and abominable incest, yet would he never confesse any such wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse.</p>
               <p>Another with extreame pain upon the rack, promised to go to Masse, the Inquisitor seeing that he had shewed such weaknesse,<note place="margin">Prodigious wickednesse.</note> urged him to confesse the forementioned wickednesse, which, because he refused, he left him eight hours together upon the rack, yet could he not get from his mouth so foul a slander.</p>
               <p>Another was stripped stark naked, whipt with rods of iron, drawn through the streets, and burnt with firebrands: One of his sons was killed with knives: Another thrown down from an high Tower, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would not kisse a Crucifix: Another was condemned to be burnt alive, and as he went to the fire, he threw to the ground a Crucifix, which the executioner had fastened to his hands,<note place="margin">Zeal.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they covered him all over with pitch, and so burnt him.</p>
               <p>The Inquisitor <hi>Panza</hi> cut the throats of eighty,<note place="margin">Horrible cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties.</note> as butchers do their sheep's; then causing them to be divided into four quarters, he set up stakes for the space of thirty miles, and appointed a quarter to be fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to every stake. Four of the principall men of <hi>la Gard</hi> he caused to be hanged. Another young man, because he would not confesse himself to a Priest, was thrown from an high tower.</p>
               <p>The Vice-roy passing by before he was dead, and hearing him implore Gods mercy, kickt him on the head, saying, <hi>Is this dog yet living? take him and cast him to the hogs.</hi> Sixtly women were racked so violently, that the cords pierced into their arms and legs, and being then cast into prison, they died there, only nine of the handsomest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delievered to the fathers of the Inquisition, were never heard off after.</p>
               <p>Many others were delivered to the secular power to be burnt,<note place="margin">Their totall extirpation.</note> and if any interceded for them, he was presently put on the rack as a favourer of Hereticks.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth sent the Marquesse of <hi>Butiane,</hi> promising that if he would wholly cleare <hi>Calabria</hi> of these <hi>Waldenses,</hi> he would make his son a Cardinall: But he was put to no great pains to do it, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors and the Vice-roy of <hi>Naples</hi> had by sundry deaths killed all the men, women and children that they could light of.</p>
               <p>One of their Ministers was famished in prison: Another was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was condemned to be burnt; The Pope and his Cardinals would needs see that pleasing spectacle: But the Minister
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41459:77"/>
spake so many things out of Gods Word, against the Pope, that the Pope gnashed his teeth for anger, wishing that he had been some where else. And thus were these godly people wholly rooted out of <hi>Calabria.</hi>

                  <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1540. The inhabitants of <hi>Merindoll</hi> were summoned, and some of the chief appearing for the rest, they were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be burned alive, their children and families to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed, and that the place of their habitation should be laid waste,<note place="margin">A cruel decree.</note> the woods cut down two hundred paces round about, and so left desolate.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Opede</hi> also proclaimed, that on pain of death no man should give any relief or sustenance to them. All their habitations were pillaged, sacked and burnt, and none of their persons spared, but such as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for the Gallies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Opede</hi> comming to <hi>Merindol,</hi> found none there but one simple lad, who had yielded himselfe prisoner to a souldier, and promised two Crowns for his ransom; but <hi>Opede</hi> paid the money to the souldier, and caused the lad to be shot to death; then he utterly razed the Town, and laid it levell with the ground.</p>
               <p>Then did he march against <hi>Cabrieres,</hi> and with the Cannon battered the wals: There was within only about sixty poor sick Pesants, who sent him word that he needed not to spend powder to batter the wals, for they were ready to open the gates, and quit the Country, if they might but have leave with their wives and children to go to <hi>Geneva,</hi> or <hi>Germany</hi>

Some of them that came forth he slew with his own hands, ripping open their bellies, so that their children came forth, whom he trod under his feet: many were fled into cellers and caves, whom he caused to be dragged out, had into the field, stripped stark naked, and then slain. Others were bound by two and two together, and slain by the Captains, who rejoyced in their bloudy butchery.</p>
               <p>Then did this Tyrant (worse then <hi>Herod</hi>) command one of his

Captaines to go into Church, into which many women, children and infants were fled; and to kill them all, which the Captain at first refused, saying, <hi>that it was a cruelty unbeseeming men of warre</hi>: Whereat <hi>Miniers</hi> being displeased, charged him upon pain of rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the King to do it. The Captain fearing what might be the issue, entred with his souldiers and destroyed them all, sparing neither young nor old.

               <p>Many of these <hi>Merindolians</hi> hid themselves in rocks and dark caves, where some were famished, others were choaked with fire and smoak set to their caves mouths.

Then did he send to <hi>Arles</hi> for a famous Chyrurgion, who cured him of his difficulty to make water, after which, desiring all to depart the room, the chyrurgion in private exhorted him to repent of his former cruelty and bloud-shed, telling him that this his strange bleeding was Gods just hand upon him for shedding so much innocent bloud: But these words pierced the impure conscience of this wicked wretch, and more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him then the torments of his disease, so that he cryed out to lay hands on the Chirurgion as an <hi>Heretick</hi>: Whereupon he conveyed himself away, and returned to <hi>Arles.</hi>

Monk, who gat a Commission to examine those whom he suspected to be <hi>Hereticks</hi>; whereupon he afflicted the faithfull with all kindes of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty: Amongst other horrible torments that he used, this was one; he filled boots with boiling grease, and put them upon their legs, tying them backwards over a form, and their legs hanging down over a soft fire: Thus he tormented very many, and in the end most cruelly put them to death.</p>
               <p>

In these torments he often cried out in great rage. <hi>O who will deliver me? VVho will kill and rid me out of these intollerable paines, which I know I suffer for the oppressions which I did to the poor men?</hi> Oft-times he himself endeavoured to destroy himself; but he had not the power.

               <p>When he was dead no man would come near to bury him; till at last a young novice caught hold of his stinking carcase with an iron hook, and so dragged him into an hole that was made for him.</p>
               <p>In the time of this Persecution the Bishop of <hi>Aix,</hi> with some other Bishops and their courtizans, walking along the streets of <hi>Avignion,</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXIV. The Persecution of the <hi>Albingenses.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THese were the same with the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> differing only in name from their habitation in the Country of <hi>Albi.</hi> Divers of <hi>Waldo</hi>'s disciples going into this Country, and amongst them one <hi>Arnold</hi> (from whom they were called <hi>Arnoldists</hi>) laboured with so good successe, that in a short time there was scarce any found that would go to Masse.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third was much moved to anger, when he saw many great Provinces to shake off his Antichristan yoak, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he condemned them for <hi>Hereticks</hi> in the Councel of <hi>Lateran</hi>: Yet did they so multiply, that <hi>Anno</hi> 1200. they possessed many and great Cities; yea, they had many great Lords that took part with them, as Earl <hi>Remund</hi> of <hi>Tholouse, Remund</hi> Earl of <hi>Foix,</hi> the Vicount of <hi>Bezieres,</hi> &amp;c. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third pretended a great desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime them by preaching and conference; and thereupon there was a famous Disputation at <hi>Montreall,</hi> wherein the Popish Doctors were shamefully baffled by <hi>Arnold</hi>: But the Popes pollicy was thus to rock them asleep whilest he raised Armies against them to destroy them:<note place="margin">Popish subtlity</note> The pretended occasion whereof was this; There was one Frier <hi>Peter</hi> that was slain in the dominions of the Earl of <hi>Tholouse</hi>; whereupon the Pope sent preachers abroad through all <hi>Europe</hi> to assemble men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to take vengeance on the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> for the innocent bloud of Friar <hi>Peter,</hi> slain amongst them; promising Paradise to all that would come to this warre, and bear arms for fourty daies. This he called the holy warre, and gave the same Pardons and Indulgences to those that came to this war, as to those which went into the <hi>Holy land</hi> against the <hi>Saracens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then did he thunder against Earl <hi>Remund,</hi> charging all Arch-bishops and Bishops through their Diocesse to pronounce him accursed and excommunicated,<note place="margin">Popes rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Earl <hi>Remund.</hi>
                  </note> and that with the sound of a Bell, and extinction of Candles every Sabbath and festivall day, for murthering of a good servant of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He also absolved all his subjects from their oaths of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41459:79"/>
allegiance to him; commanding every good <hi>Catholike</hi> to pursue his person, and to take and possesse his land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He also wrote to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes to stirre them up to get this pardon, rather by fighting against these <hi>Albingenses,</hi> then by going against the <hi>Turks.</hi> Earl <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> hearing of all these preparations against him, sent to the Pope, humbly beseeching him not to condemn him before he was heard, assuring him that he was no way guilty of the death of Frier <hi>Peter,</hi> but that he was slain by a Gentleman, who immediatly fled out of his Country, otherwise he would have severely punished him for it. But all was in vain, for presently came Armies of crossed souldiers to pour down their vengeance on him and his lands.</p>
               <p>Amongst these were many noble men, and Ecclesiasticall persons, Arch-bishops, Bishops, Abbots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to all which the Pope promised <hi>Paradise,</hi> but gave them not a peny.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Tholouse</hi> perceived that he must either prepare for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or submit; the latter he thought the safer, and therefore he went presently to the Popes Legate at <hi>Valance</hi>; to whom he began to say,<note place="margin">He goes to the Popes Legate.</note> that he thought it strange that so many armed men should be brought against him, who used no other arms for his defence but his own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency: And that concerning the death of the Frier, they should first have enquired the truth of the fact, before they thus moved heaven and earth against him; yea, if he had been guilty, yet there was an ordinary course of justice to be used against him, and not to wreak their anger on his innocent Subjects: and therefore Sir (said he) <hi>since I come voluntarily to you, armed only with the testimony of a good conscience, what further use is there of these armed Pilgrims? pray you therefore counte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Legate answered, that he had done well in coming to him, yet could he not send back the souldiers, except he would put seven of his best castles into his hands, which should serve for a hostage; Now did the Earl when it was too late see his own folly in putting himself into the Legates hands, and thereby making himself a prisoner, but there was no remedy, now he must take Laws from him that had him in his power, and therefore be told him that both his person and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions were at his disposall, beseeching him that his Subjects might receive no more damage by the Souldiers.</p>
               <p>The Legate presently sent to put Garisons in those seven Castles, commanding all the Consuls of every City presently to appear before him: and when they were come, he told them that Earl <hi>Remund</hi> had delivered up his Castles to the Pope, and therefore they were to take notice of it, that so they might acknowledge themselves lawfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to his Holinesse, in case the Earl should falsifie his Oath to the Pope.</p>
               <p>The Consuls were much astonished thus to see their Lord devested of all his possessions: but that which most afflicted them was, to see him
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41459:80"/>
led to S. <hi>Giles</hi> to be reconciled to the Church, where the Legate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Earl to strip himself stark naked all but his linnen draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:<note place="margin">The Earl whipt naked.</note> then did he put a cord about his neck, whereby he led him nine times about the grave of <hi>Frier Peter,</hi> scourging him with rods all the while: The Earl demanded satisfaction for so sharp a penance seeing he was not guilty of the fact: the Legate answered, that he must submit if he would be reconciled to the Pope, yea, he must be thus scourged before the Earls, Barons, Marquesses, Prelates, and all the people: he made him also to swear to be obedient all his life to the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome</hi>: and to make irreconcileable warre against the <hi>Albingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> &amp;c,</p>
               <p>Then did the Legate make him General of the crossed Souldiers for the seige of <hi>Beziers</hi>: The Earl knew not what to do: For to conduct an Army to fight against the <hi>Albingenses,</hi> was to sin against his conscience, and if he should fly away, it would furnis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In this extremity he stayed in the Army a few daies, and then went towards <hi>Rome</hi> to reconcile himself to the Pope.</p>
               <p>Then did the Army come before the City of <hi>Beziers,</hi> and provided all manner of Engines for battery,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Beziers</hi> besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> reared up ladders for a general Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calado: this the Earl of <hi>Beziers</hi> beholding, and judging it impossible to defend the City, he went out: and cast himself down at the Legates feet, beseeching him not to punish the innocent with the nocent, which must needs be, if the Town were taken by storm: he told him, that there were in the City great numbers of good Catholicks, which would be subject to the same ruine with the <hi>Albingenses:</hi> he desired him also to commiserate him now in his minority that was a most obedient servant to the Pope, and had been brought up in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, in which he would live and die: The Legate told him that all his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses prevailed nothing, and that he must do as he may: The Earl re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the City, assembled the people, and told them that he could obtain no mercy from the Legat, except all the <hi>Albingenses</hi> would come and abjure their religion, and promise to live according to the Laws of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>: The Popish party requested the <hi>Albin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses</hi> to yield to this, but the <hi>Albingenses</hi> answered, that they would not forsake their religion for the base price of their frail life: that God was able, if he pleased, to defend them, but if he would be glorified by the confession of their faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">Faith and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> it should be a great honour to them to die for his sake: that they had rather displease the Pope, who could but kill their bodies, then God, who could cast both body and soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then did the Popish party send their Bishop to the Legate, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him not to include them in the chastisement of the <hi>Albingenses:</hi> and that the best way to win the others was by gentle means, not by rigour: the Legate grew into great choler at this, swearing that if all the City di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> not acknowledg their fault, they should all taste of one cup without distinction of religion, sex or age: and accordingly he summoned the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41459:80"/>
City presently to yield to his discretion, which they refusing, he caused that his Engines should play, and that a generall assault should be given.</p>
               <p>It was impossible for them within the City to resist so great violence,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Beziers</hi> storm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> being assaulted by above an hundred thousand Pilgrims: so that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies entred, and slew a great multitude, and set the City on fire,<note place="margin">Barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> and burnt it to ashes: When the City was first taken, the Priests and Monks came forth of the great Church with Banners and Crosses, singing, <hi>Te Deum laudamus</hi>; but the Souldiers, who were commanded by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to kill all, ran upon them, made their heads and arms to fly about the streets, so that they were all cut in pieces.</p>
               <p>In this City of <hi>Beziers</hi> they slew sixty thousand persons, the Popes Legate saying to the Captains and souldiers, <hi>Caedite eos omnes, novit enim Dominus qui sunt ejus,</hi> Kill them all] <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks</hi>] for the Lord knoweth who are his.</p>
               <p>Then were these Pilgrims presently conducted to <hi>Carcasson</hi> before the fourty daies of service, which they had vowed to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were expired.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Beziers</hi> when he saw that he could obtain no favour of the Legate, before the City was taken, left his charge to the Bishop, and went to <hi>Carcasson,</hi> endeavouring to prepare and furnish it for a long siege: but the Legates Army followed him presently, unto which there came a new supply of crossed souldiers out of sundry Countries, so that his Army now consisted of three hundred thousand fighting men.</p>
               <p>Near to the City of <hi>Carcasson</hi> was a Town of the same name: the City was seated on an hill, and fenced with a double wall; yet the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims thought to take it at the first sight,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Carcasson</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged.</note> and therefore ran with great violence upon the first Rampier, filling the ditch with fagots, but they were beaten back with such courage, that the ground was covered with their dead bodies: The young Earl of <hi>Beziers</hi> won much honor in this first encounter, encouraging his men, and telling them, that it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to die fighting, then to fal into the hands of such cruel and merciless enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Albingenses</hi> much encouraged hereby, swore to him that they would spend their lives for the preservation of the City.</p>
               <p>The next morning the Legate commanded a general assault to be made upon the Town of <hi>Carcasson</hi> which was two miles from the City: &amp; The people valiantly defended themselves, but being oppressed with multitudes, the souldiers entred the Town,<note place="margin">Popish cruelty.</note> putting all to the sword and fire, as they had done at <hi>Beziers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then came the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> to the Camp, and told the Legate that he understood that his kinsman the Earl of <hi>Beziers</hi> was in the City, and that with his leave, he would go to him, not doubting but that he should prevail with him to do his duty to the Pope and Church: The Legate gave him leave, and the King approaching to the Rampier, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for the Earl, who came to him: then said the King, that he desired
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41459:81"/>
to know of him what moved him to shut up himself in that City a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst so great an Army of Pilgrims? the Earl answered, that it was to defend his life, goods and Subjects: that he knew well that the Pope, under the pretence of religion, resolved to destroy his Uncle <hi>Remund,</hi> and himselfe: that he saw the cruelty which they had used at <hi>Beziers</hi> even against the Priests themselves: adding also what they had done to the Town of <hi>Carcasson,</hi> and that they must look for no mercy from the Legate or his Army: and that therefore he rather chose to die, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending himself with his subjects, then to fall into the hands of so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable an enemy as the Legate was: that though he had in his City some that were of another religion, yet they were such as had wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none, and were come to his succour in his greatest extremity, and for their good service he was resolved not to abandon them, and that his trust was in God the defender of the oppressed, that he would as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist them against that world of ill advised men,<note place="margin">A brave speech</note> who forsook their own houses to burn, sack, and ransack, and kill in their houses other men without reason, judgement, or mercy.</p>
               <p>The King returning to the Legate, told him, that his cozen was much discontented with his former dealings against his Subjects of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers</hi> &amp; <hi>Carcasson,</hi> that he believed, seeing they spared not the Romish Priests, their war was not for Religion, but a kinde of theevery: that he would not yield himselfe to the descretion of such mercilesse men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Legate, after some debate, told the King, that for his sake he would receive the Earl of <hi>Beziers</hi> to mercy,<note place="margin">Popish cruelty, and unlean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> and that with him, twelve more might come out with bag and baggage, but for the rest he would have them wholly at his discretion, and that they should all come forth stark naked, men, women, maids, and children, without shirts, smocks, or other covering, and that then they might hope well of his mercy, he being the Popes Legate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King much distasted this propositions, yet reported it to the Earl of <hi>Beziers,</hi>

               <p>Then did the Legate cause all his Engines to play, commanding, that they should take the City by storm,<note place="margin">The Pilgrims repulsed with great losse.</note> but he was little pleased when he saw the losse of a great number of his Pilgrims: for they in the City threw down stones, fire, pitch, brimstone, and boiling water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they so galled the assailants, that the earth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This overthrow caused divers of the crossed souldiers, having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished their fourty daies service, and thereby gained <hi>Paradise,</hi> to refuse to conquer more after so faire a purchase, and therefore they returned home.</p>
               <p>The Legate being much troubled to see his Army so decreased, thought of this Stratagem, he sent for a gentleman, telling him that he might do a piece of service, whereby he might not only merit heaven,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41459:81"/>
but gain a great reward here: which was by going to the Earl of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zires,</hi> endeavouring to put him into great fears, and then to perswade him to have recourse to the Legates mercy, and withall that he should perswade him with great Oaths and Execrations (whereof he could absolve him at his pleasure) to come with him to the Legate,<note place="margin">Popish Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faanenesse and perfidiousness.</note> with as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance that he should be dismissed safe and sound.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman plaied his part so well, that he brought the young Earl with him: The Legate presently told him, that he was now his prisoner till <hi>Carcasson</hi> was taken, and till his Subjects had better learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their duty: the Earl astonished hereat,<note place="margin">The Earl made a prisoner.</note> cried out that he was betrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that faith was violated with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this nothing prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for he was presently committed to the guard and custody of the Duke of <hi>Burgonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inhabitants of <hi>Carcasson</hi> understanding this,<note place="margin">A speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> brake forth into tears, and were so astonished, that they now thought of nothing but how by flight to escape the danger, but that seemed impossible, being environed with such an Army: at last one told them, that he heard some old men say, that there was a certain vault under ground, great and large, which went to the Castle of <hi>Cameret</hi> three leagues off: Then were all the Citizens imploied to search for this vault, and having at last found it, they began their flight in the evening, with their wives and children, carrying with them only some victuals for a few daies. This departure was accompanied with much sorrow thus to leave all their worldly enjoyments: The next morning they came to the Castle, and from thence dispersed themselves, some to <hi>Arragon,</hi> others to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia,</hi> others to <hi>Tholouse,</hi> whether it pleased God to conduct them.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Carcasson</hi> taken</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the morning the Pilgrims were strangely astonished, hearing no noise nor seeing any man stirring in the City, yet they approached the wals with much fear, lest it should be but a stratagem to endanger them, but finding no opposition, they mounted the wals, crying out, that the <hi>Albingenses</hi> were fled, and thus was the City with all the spoils tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> made Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note> and the Earl of <hi>Beziers</hi> committed to prison in one of the strongest Towers of <hi>Carcasson.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then did the Legate call all the Prelates, and great Lords of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my together, telling them, that though it was requisite that there should be alwaies a Legate in the Army, yet it was likewise necessary that there should be a secular General, wise and valiant, to command in all their affairs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This charge was first proffered to the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne,</hi> then to the Earl of <hi>Ennevers,</hi> and to the Earl of S. <hi>Paul</hi>: but they all refused it: Lastly, it was proffered to Earl <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Montfort,</hi> who after some excuses, accepted of it.</p>
               <p>The Earl being made general, settled himself at <hi>Carcasson</hi> with four thousand Pilgrims, all the remainders of that huge Army.</p>
               <p>After this Earl <hi>Remund</hi> of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> went to the French King for his Letters of commendation to the Pope, to be by him fully cleared from the death of Frier <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Pope thereupon received him courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41459:82"/>
gave him full remission and absolution, and thereby declared him sufficiently justified.</p>
               <p>Shortly after the Earl of <hi>Beziers</hi> died in prison, and Earl <hi>Simon</hi> was put into possession of his lands,<note place="margin">Eearl of <hi>Bezi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> dieth.</note> whereupon all that bordered upon him began to fear him, for that he gave it out that the Spring follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he would have a great Army of Pilgrims, wherewith he would chastise those that had not acknowledged his authority given him by the Church. Upon this occasion <hi>Castris</hi> sent unto him the keys of their City; the Castle of <hi>Pinies</hi> yielded to him, and so did all round about <hi>Carcasson</hi>: But the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> secretly encouraged the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Vicounty of <hi>Beziers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King of Arragon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth the <hi>Albingenses.</hi>
                  </note> telling them that his Pilgrims would be uncertain, and would not stay long with him, and that if in the mean time they would but keep themselves in their Garisons, when he was weak by the departure of his Pilgrims, they might then set upon him, and reduce him to reason.</p>
               <p>These messages gave such encouragement to the Gentry, that the Earl <hi>Simon</hi> being gone to <hi>Montpelliar,</hi> they took arms to shake off his yoak, besieging some of his souldiers in a Tower near to <hi>Carcasson:</hi> the Earl hearing of it presently returned to succor them, but the Tower was taken before he came, which affront brought him into some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: Then Captain <hi>Boucard</hi> belonging to Earl <hi>Simon,</hi> attempted to surprise the strong Castle of <hi>Cabe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>

               <p>The City of <hi>Carcasson</hi> was hereupon stricken with great fear, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving little hope to defend themselves, but by flight, being environed on all sides by their enemies. About this time Earl <hi>Simon</hi> wrote to all the Prelates through <hi>Europe,</hi> that if in the Spring following they did not send him good store of Pilgrims,<note place="margin">Prodigious cruelty.</note> he could hold out no longer against his enemies, having since the last departure of his Pilgrims, lost above fourty Towns and Castles; And whilest that he waited for these new succours, he surprised the Castle of <hi>Beron,</hi> where he pulled out the eyes of above a hundred <hi>Albingenses,</hi> and cut off their noses, leaving only one with one eye to guide the rest to <hi>Cabaret.</hi>

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1210. Earl <hi>Simon</hi> being shut up in <hi>Carcasson</hi> for want of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, heard that his wife was comming from <hi>France</hi> with many Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, whereupon he went out to meet her: These Pilgrims he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed against the Castle of <hi>Menerbe,</hi>

                     <hi>Menerbe</hi> taken.</note> which at last was yielded up to him for want of water. This Castle was defended by <hi>Remund,</hi> Lord of <hi>Termes,</hi> and was scituated in <hi>Narbonne</hi>: one argument which Earl
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41459:82"/>
                  <hi>Simon</hi> used to stirre up his crossed souldiers to fight manfully against it, was, <hi>For (that</hi> saith he,) <hi>there hath been no Masse sung in it since the yeare</hi> 1180. <hi>which is now thirty years,</hi> Upon the surrender of the Castle they laboured to draw this noble Lord to recant his religion, and turne <hi>Papist</hi>; but finding him immovable, they shut him up in a straight prison, where shortly after he died: they also took his wife, sister, and daughter, who was a maid, and other Noble women, with whom they laboured to withdraw them from the truth both by flattery and frowns, by faire speeches, and cruell threats, but when they saw that nothing would prevaile, they made an huge fire, casting them into the same, and burning them: <hi>God fridi Annales.</hi> Also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his taking of the said Castle, he caused a Frier to preach to the people, and to exhort them to acknowledge the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome</hi>: but they not staying till he had done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cried out,<note place="margin">Courage and constancy.</note> 
                  <hi>We will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake our faith, you labour but in vain, for neither life nor death shall make us abandon our beliefe.</hi> Then did the Earl and Legate cause a great fire to be made, and cast into it a hundred and fourscore men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who went in with joy, giving God thanks for that he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed so to honour them, as to die for his Names sake: They also told Earl <hi>Simon</hi> that he would one day pay dear for his cruelties. All that saw their valour, and constancy were much amazed at it.</p>
               <p>Then did the Earl besiege the Castle of <hi>Termes,</hi> which also at last was taken for want of water; yet they within the Castle,<note place="margin">The Castle of <hi>Termes</hi> taken.</note> when they perceived that they could hold out no longer, one night quit the place and passed away undiscovered. The Castle <hi>de la Vaur,</hi> was also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged, in which there were many godly people: Thither came ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pilgrims to the Legate, from all Countries; and amongst others,<note place="margin">Six thousand Pilgrims slain.</note> six thousand <hi>Germanes,</hi> of whose coming the Earl of <hi>Foix</hi> hearing, he laid an ambush for them, overthrew and slew them all, not one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaping but an Earl that carried the news to Earl <hi>Simon.</hi> After six moneths siege the Castle of <hi>Vaur</hi> was taken by assault,<note place="margin">Horrible cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> where all the souldiers were put to the sword save eighty Gentlemen, whom Earl <hi>Simon</hi> caused to be hanged, and the Lord <hi>Aimeri</hi> on a gibbet higher then all the rest, the Lady his sister was called <hi>Girauda,</hi> was cast into a ditch, and there covered with stones.</p>
               <p>And for the rest of the people a very great fire was made, and they were put to their choise, whether they would forsake their opinions, or perish by the flames: There were scarce any of them found that would doe the first, but exhorting one another, they went into the kindled fire of their own accord, saith <hi>Altisiodore,</hi> but more probably they were forced into the same, where joyfully they resigned up their spirits unto God: Some say that they were about foure hundred persons that thus perished by fire.</p>
               <p>After the return of the Earl <hi>Remund</hi> from the Pope, the Legate still fought to entrap him,<note place="margin">Popish subtilty</note> but the Earl would not come againe within his reach. Then did the Legate send the Bishop of <hi>Tholouse</hi> to him, who pretended a great deal of love and friendship to the Earl, and by his

subtilty at last prevailed with him to profer his strong Castle of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonnes</hi> to them to lodge in as they passed that way: but as soon as the Legate and his company were entred, they seised upon it, and put into it a garison, which was a continuall vexation to all his subjects.</p>
               <p>Then did the Legate resolve upon the utter extirpation of Earl <hi>Remund,</hi>

When they were both come, the

Legate commanded them upon the pain of his high indignation, that they should not depart, but with his leave: Whilest they were there, the Earl was privately shewed by a friend, The Articles of the Legate to which he would enforce him to subscrib,<note place="margin">Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Earl <hi>Remund.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Remund</hi> having read over these Articles shewed them to the King, who advised him presently to mount on horseback, least seising upon him, they might the better become masters of all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state which accordingly he did. The Legate was much troubled that he had thus lost his prey, and despairing to do any more by subtilty, he resolved to set upon him by force: and thereupon he besieged the Castle of <hi>Montferrand,</hi> where <hi>Baldwin,</hi>

               <p>Shortly after came <hi>Remund</hi> the son of Earl <hi>Remund</hi> out of England, where he had been bred under his uncle King John,<note place="margin">Young <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munds</hi> successe.</note> with an Army, and quickly made himself Master of the City of <hi>Beaucaire,</hi> and almost famish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that held the Castle, so that they yeelded it up to depart with their baggage.

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1214. The Legate called a Councel at <hi>Montpelier,</hi> for renuing of the Army of the Church, and to confirm the authority of Earle <hi>Simon</hi>; where they declared him to be Prince of all the Countries conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               </p>
               <p>By the same <hi>Lateran</hi> Councill, Earle <hi>Simon</hi> had the forementioned lands of the <hi>Albingenses</hi> confirmed to him, and thereupon he hastened to the King of <hi>France</hi> to receive investiture, and as he went (saith the Monk of <hi>Sernay</hi>) in every City and towne the Popish Clergy, and people met him, crying, <hi>Blessed is he that commeth to us in the name of the Lord,</hi> and every man thought himself happy that could but touch the hem of his garment.</p>
               <p>When he had recived his Investiture from the King of France, being attended with an hundred Bishops that had preached the Crosse in their Diocess, and with an exceding great Army of Pilgrims he hasted to make himself Lord of all those countries, which the Pope had given him. So that all men trembled at his reproach, and with this great Army of Pilgrims he took in divers places, using great cruelty,<note place="margin">A new Army of Pilgrims.</note> putting men women and children to the sword.

               </p>
               <p>Earl <hi>Simon</hi> being in great perplexity, a Bishop bid him be of good comfort, for that the Cardinal had sent messengers throughout the world to raise him succours, and so he was inforced to wait, with much impatiency, the coming of these new supplies,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1218. There came to him a hundred thousand Pilgrims, and he was resolved that they should earn their pardons, knowing that at the end of fourty daies they would vanish: Whereupon the next morning they were ordered to give a generall assault to <hi>Tholouse</hi>: But Earl <hi>Remund</hi> perceiving in the night that they were very secure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their great multitude, he sallied out upon them, and that with so good successe, that ere morning all the field was covered with their dead bodies,<note place="margin">Many Pilgrims slaine.</note> and the Earl with his men being weary with killing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the City to give thanks unto God for his assistance.</p>
               <p>Then did Earl <hi>Simon</hi> enter into the Castle of <hi>Narbonnes</hi> to see if he could discerne any way to enter into the City, but finding none, it much troubled him, whereupon two Lords gave him Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell to come to some honourable agreement: yet the Cardinal <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trand</hi> told him that there was no need for him so to do; To whom one of them answered, <hi>Monsieur Cardinal, pray you where finde you that you should take from Earl Remund, and his son that which belongs unto them: If I had known as much as I know now, I had never taken upon me this business.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After nine moneths siege the Citizens of <hi>Tholouse</hi> made another sally, killing as many of the crossed souldiers as they encountered with; and Earl <hi>Simon</hi> coming in to the reliefe of his men, had his horse shot in the head with an arrow, which caused him to run away with him, which one of the <hi>Albingenses</hi> seeing, with his Cross-bow he shot him thorow the thigh;<note place="margin">E. <hi>Simon</hi> slain by a woman.</note> 
                  <hi>Simon</hi> perceiving that he lost much bloud, was la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to get out of the presse, but just at that present, a woman discharging an engine from the walls of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> a stone parted his head from his shoulders; and thus by Gods just judgement, he that had been the deflourer and murtherer of many women, was himselfe slaine by a woman.</p>

                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:41459:86"/>
Upon his death, the Legate and all the Bishops fled, never staying till they came to <hi>Carcasson,</hi> the Pilgrims disbanded and returned to their homes, and Earl <hi>Remund</hi> caused a publick Thanksgiving to be returned to Almighty God for this so signall a deliverance.</p>
               <p>Afterwatds, at the instigation of the Pope, Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> went, and besieged <hi>Tholouse,</hi> but finding the business too hot for him, he returned without doing any thing of note:<note place="margin">Prince Lewis his cruelty.</note> yet in this iourney he tooke the towne of <hi>Miromand,</hi> wherein he cruelly put to the sword men, women, and children to the number of five thousand.</p>
               <p>Upon his returne the Legat <hi>Bertrand</hi> being weary of these warres, wrote to Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the 3. desiring to be recalled because of his age: yet with all, he signified a necessity of continuing these warrs Otherwise (saith he) not only the lands of the <hi>Albingenses</hi> wilbe lost, but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> itself will be ruined, the Doctrin of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenses</hi> shaking the authority of the Popes themselves: And (saith he) this war hath cost us very deare, for within less then fifteene years there hath dyed above three hundred thousand Crossed soldiers: and therefore all wilbe lost, except these <hi>Hereticks</hi> be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
               <p>This occasioned the Pope to send a new Legat [<hi>Conradus</hi> Bishop of Portua] Also he granted to all Crossed soldiers that fought against the Albingenses the same in dulgences as to those that went to fight against the <hi>Saracens</hi> in the <hi>Holy land:</hi> Moreover he tooke King, <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France</hi> into his protection, and made peace betwixt him, and young King <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>England</hi>: so that <hi>Philip</hi> wholly bent himself to roote out the Gospellers.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Bohemians</hi> were Heathens and Idolaters, till their Duke or Captain <hi>Borivoius</hi> going into <hi>Moravia,</hi> Anno Cristi 894. by a strange providence of God was converted to the knowledge and faith of Christ, whereupon he together with thirty other Palatines was baptized; At his return into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> he took along with him <hi>Methudius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Moravia,</hi> by whose Ministry,<note place="margin">Christianity brought into <hi>Bohemia.</hi>

                     <hi>Ludomilla</hi> the Dukes wife was converted and baptized.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Borivoius,</hi> busying himself in erecting divers Schooles and Churches, it pleased God that in a short time a great harvest was gathered, many of the Nobility and Commons being daily converted and baptized: but Satan envying the progresse of the Gospel, presently raised up persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the Professors of it: For first of all <hi>Borivoius</hi> was banished by the wicked faction of the Idolaters, and then compelled to resign his Dominion to his Eldest Son, who being dead, his younger son <hi>Borati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaus</hi> succeeded,<note place="margin">Persecution begun.</note> who was a very holy man yet was drawn to marry <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homira,</hi> famous for nobility and beauty, but a Heathen: yet she promised, after instruction, to be baptized, and during her husbands life she cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concealed her hatred against Christians, but he being dead, the grandmother <hi>Ludomilla</hi> educated the elder son <hi>Wenceslaus,</hi> and <hi>Draho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi> took the younger, <hi>Bolislaus,</hi> and usurped the government, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Christian Churches to be shut up,<note place="margin">Tyranny.</note> the exercises of their worship to cease, prohibiting Ministers from instructing the people, and Schoolemasters from teaching youth: such as disobeyed were imprisoned, banished, and put to death.</p>

pretend that she was much displeased with the tumult, commanding that the Arms of both parties should be brought in to the City magazine, severely forbidding any man to walk with dart or sword: the Christians, though suspecting her fraud, yet that they might not seem disobedient, brought their arms to the Magazine, the enemies pretending also to do the like.<note place="margin">300.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Drahomira</hi> yet laid not aside her hatred and bloudy designs against the Christians, which she first shewed against holy <hi>Ludumella,</hi> substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting two wicked villains in the night to murther her, these fellows finding her at her prayers in her Oratory, strangled her: Some there were that much provoked <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> to revenge that wicked act,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ludomilla</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</note> which he refused, because he judged it contrary to that duty which he owed to a mother, and to the modesty and patience of a Christian. But he was shortly after ill requited by this unnaturall monster, who affecting domination, began to defame <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> as sluggish and unfit for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but when she perceived that his subjects loved him excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, she waited a fitter opportunity, which thus fell out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bolislaus</hi> having a son, she invited <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> to the baptising of this his Nephew at <hi>Bolislavia,</hi> he going thither, she entertained him with much dissembled love: but in the night as he was making his prayers to God: His brother <hi>Bolislaus</hi> assaults him, and beeing assisted with some other cut-throats slew him,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 929. <hi>Bolislaus</hi> having by this fratricide obtained the government, threatned imprisonment and death to all the Ministers and Christians if they did not presently depart <hi>Bohemia:</hi> his mother added, that their dead bodies should not be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: Hereupon many fled, others were seized on, and tormented to death diverse waies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but God suffered not <hi>Drahomira</hi> to escape his reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging hand,<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.</note> for in that place, where the ministers bones lay unburied, the earth opened of it self, and swallowed her up alive with her Chariot, and all that were in it, which place is to be seen before the Castle of <hi>Prague</hi> to this day.</p>
                  <p>Others also who were her instruments in massacring the innocent Christians, some of them ran mad, and threw themselves down from high places, others slew themselves with their own swords, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

they had murthered the innocent men, and the place where <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceslaus</hi> blood was shed, could never be washed off, but remained as a perpetuall witnesse of that villany.</p>
                  <p>These things so affrighted <hi>Bolislaus,</hi> that he became more milde to the Chistians.</p>

                  <p>Not long after the Pope having usurped domination over other Churches, sought to obtrude his superstitions upon the <hi>Bohemians</hi> also: but especially he commanded that all their sacred service should be in the Latine tongue and that they should not have the cup in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the <hi>Bohemians</hi> sent two Ministers, and four others to <hi>Rome,</hi>

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 977. to the Pope, desiring to be eased of these grievances, and at last obtained their request.</p>
                  <p>Yet afterwards they were againe inhibited the use of their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in holy services, whereupon <hi>Urateslaus</hi> Duke of <hi>Bohemia</hi> (who shortly after for his valiant service to the Roman Empire, was created King) sent Embassadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> requesting a confirmation of the Liberties formerly granted to them; but the Pope [<hi>Hildebrand</hi>] abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refused it.</p>

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1197. Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> sent a Cardinall into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to inhibit Ministers marriage, and to divorce such as were married, but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and Ministers almost stoned him to death.</p>
                  <p>Also when afterwards the cup was taken away in the Sacrament, there were many that opposed that sacriledg, and amongst the rest <hi>John Melicius</hi> of a noble family and fervent spirit, much honoured for his rare learning and holinesse of life;<note place="margin">

                     </note> in his ministry he earnestly exhorted his auditors to a frequent communicating in both kindes: at last he was much moved in spirit to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there to testifie that the great Antichrist was come, and did then reign.</p>
                  <p>He prayed unto God, with fasting and teares,<note place="margin">The Pope An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.</note> desiring that unlesse these thoughts came from Gods Spirit, he might be delivered from them: but when yet he could finde no inward quiet, he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and wrote upon the Cardinals doors, <hi>Antichrist is come, and sitteth in the Church.</hi> He also in his conferences with many, asserted the same: For this the Pope imprisoned him, and excommunicated both him, and his auditors.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Bohemians</hi> were incited more and more to mutuall conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: the Priests daily from the Pulpits divulged their excomunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and execrations against the <hi>Hussites,</hi> and to stir up the greater ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred against them, they used lying signs; for, putting dirt about the wicks of their Tapers, when the flame had burned the wax to the dirt, the Taper went out:<note place="margin">Popish malice, and subtilty.</note> Then cried they out, That God by miracles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his hatred of those wicked <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who were unworthy to enjoy the light: and thereupon they persecuted them all manner of waies, and they used such violence, as raised a tumult at <hi>Prague</hi> Anno 1419. wherein the enraged multitude threw twelve Senators of <hi>Prague</hi> with the Maior, out of the windows of the Senate-house, who fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the points of spears.</p>
                  <p>After this the Pope publikely excommunicated the <hi>Bohemians</hi> at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Yet still as the Popish party prevailed at any time, they exercised all manner of cruelty upon the poor servants of Christ, insomuch that at <hi>Cuttenburg,</hi> where were deep mettall-mines, <hi>Anno</hi> 1420. they threw into one of them a thousand and seven hundred persons,<note place="margin">Multitudes martyred.</note> and into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a thousand thirty eight, and into a third a thousand three hundred thirty four persons.</p>
                  <p>Also a Merchant of <hi>Prague</hi> coming to <hi>Preslaw</hi> in <hi>Silesia,</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Popes Legate being their, was in his Inne drawn into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, where pleading for <hi>Husse,</hi> and the Sacrament in both kindes, he

                     <hi>the fight is but short, the reward is eternall: Let us remember the Lord, what a cruel death he under went for us, and with what guiltlesse bloud we are redeemed, and what torments the Martyrs have patiently endured,</hi> &amp;c. But when they were brought to execution, and the ropes by which the horses were to drag them through the streets, were fastened to their feet; the Student affrighted with the terrors of death,<note place="margin">Apostacy.</note> and allured by the fair promises of the Legate, recanted: But the Merchant, like an unshaken rock, told them, that their hopes of any recantation from him were but vain; <hi>I am ready to die</hi> (saith he) <hi>for the Gospell of the Lord Jesus</hi>: And so being drawne slowly through the streets,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> he was brought to the place of execution, and there burnt, <hi>Anno</hi> 2420.</p>

                  <p>About the same time a company of souldiers going towards <hi>Prague,</hi> seized upon a godly Minister, and four other men, and four boys, the eldest not being aboue eleven years old, for administring, and receiving the Sacarament in both kindes, and carried them to their Colonel, the Colonel sent them to the Bishop who required, them to abjure, or else he would burn them; the Minister stoutly answered, <hi>But the Gospel teacheth otherwise, so that you must either approve what we do, or blot it out of your Bible.</hi> Hereupon one of the troopers smote him so violently on the face with his gantlet, that the bloud ran out of his mouth and nose.<note place="margin">Cruelty.</note> The Bishop made this Minister the subject of his mirth and scorn all

                  <p>Another Captain violently entring into a Church where many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people were met together, he killed some, and took others priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and going to the Communion Table, he took the Cup, being full of wine,<note place="margin">Profanenesse and blasphemy.</note> and drunk to his horse, who having pledged him, he said, his horse was now one of the communicants in both kindes.</p>
                  <p>About the same time also a Godly Tayler was burned at <hi>Prague.</hi> Also one <hi>Martin Loquis</hi> should have suffered the like death, but his life was begged by the <hi>Thaborites.</hi>

Then did a Priest beg him to see if he could convert him: but when that succeeded not, he thrust them into a dark, stinking dungeon for two moneths: Then did he torment them with fire,<note place="margin">Prodigious cruelty.</note> till their bowels came forth, to extort from them who were their companions: Afterwards they were both shut up in a tub, and so burned <hi>Anno</hi> 1421.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Reformation begun.</note> obtained of their King [<hi>George Pogiebracius,</hi>] a place in the hilly Countrey near to <hi>Silesia</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit, where throwing off all superstious practices, they applied

themselves to the form of the Primitive simplicity, calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Brethren and Sisters.</p>
                  <p>The beginning of this Church displeased the Devil, and therefore he raised a sudden and violent tempest to overthrow it:<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> For the same of it being spread abroad, the Priests in every pulpit stirred up the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the people against them, crying out, <hi>Blow out these sparks, blow them out before they grow into a flame.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1461. One of their Ministers with some others of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Prague,</hi> to visit their friends, were betrayed, and some Officers coming to apprehend them, said to them, <hi>All that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution,</hi> therefore come forth, and follow us to prison, which they did.

                  <p>Presently after their came forth from the King an Edict,<note place="margin">A wicked Edict.</note> forbidding all Pastors to administer holy services without ceremonies: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, threatning death to those that should administer to the brethren, called now by the hateful name of <hi>Piccards.</hi> The brethren hereupon were brought into great extremity, being like sheep destitute of shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds. Yet presently came forth a new Edict that none of them should be suffered to live either in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> or <hi>Moravia.</hi> Hereupon they were dispersed amongst the woods and mountains, dwelling in caves;<note place="margin">Popish cruelty.</note> where yet they were scarce safe, so that they were forced to make no fire, nor dresse any meat, but in the night time, least the smoak should betray them. In the cold winter nights, sitting by the fire, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themselves to the reading of the Bible, and holy discourses. When in the snow they went ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>These brethren chose by suffrage, certain Elders,<note place="margin">Elders chosen.</note> to whom they promised obedience: and by the advice of these Elders, the chiefest of the brethen in <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Moravia,</hi> were called together in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, in the mountaines to ordain <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws,</hi> whereby they should be governed;<note place="margin">A Synod.</note> they appointed also sundry daies of Fasting and Prayer for themselves, and their dispersed friends; taking counsell from Gods Word, concerning those things which were required to the fuller Reformation, both of life and doctrine. That which most afflicted them was for want of Pastors, not knowing where they should have new ones, after those were dead, who then lived with them; but after debate, they resolved, that Christ had given this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to his Church, that such as were ordained themselves, might ordain others: Yet some scruple arose, whether such as were but
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41459:96"/>

                  <p>Then did these Brethren deliberate among themselves, whether they should joyn with the <hi>Waldenses</hi> in <hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Austria</hi>;<note place="margin">The <hi>Waldenses</hi>·</note> and so be one people with them, and one Church: The purity of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Christian Conversation did much please; but again, it much displeased them, that they concealed the truth, not openly professing it as they ought, but to avoid persecution, they frequented the Churches of the Papists, and so communicated with Idolaters. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they concluded to admonish them of this evil; and for this end they sent some able men to them,<note place="margin">Admonition.</note> to acquaint them with it: The <hi>Waldenses</hi> answered, that to be in unity with them was very gratefull, and for the evils objected against them, they were not ignorant of them, nor would defend them, but rather would labour to amend them: Concluding that they desired to have a sixt day of meeting with the Brethren, in which they would take some further order about this businesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Waldenses</hi> persecuted.</note>But before the time came, the Papists having some intelligence of it, raged so violently against the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> that they burnt one of the chiefest of them at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and so persecuted the rest, that they were fain to provide for their own safety by flight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1468. There came out a new Decree against these Brethren, requiring all the Nobles of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> within their severall jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to apprehend as many as they could, and to proceed against them.</p>
                  <p>Many therefore were apprehended and put into prison, where they were kept for a long time:<note place="margin">The Church increaseth.</note> But thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>After the death of <hi>Pogiebracius, Uladislaus,</hi> a <hi>Polonian</hi> succeeded in the Kingdom, to whom the Brethren wrote an Apology, by reason of many foul accusations that were carried to him against them: This so exasperated their enemies, that they endeavoured by a most impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent invention, to stir up the hatred of all men against them.

                  <p>But the devil was befooled herein, for the Brethren, by publick writings did confute these lies;<note place="margin">Confession.</note> and the villain trembling so often to forswear himself in the sight of the people, confessed at last that he was suborned to do what he did, and that he knew not any of the <hi>Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cards</hi>: Yet thus far it made for good, that some to make experience of so great villanies, began privately and disguised, to frequent the Assemblies of the Brethren, and finding it to be farre other wise then it was reported, did associate themselves with them, as with true Christians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1488. <hi>Mathias</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Brethren banished.</note> banished the Brethren from <hi>Moravia,</hi> which caused some hundreds of them, taking a Minister along with them, to go into <hi>Moldavia</hi>; Whereupon the Brethren in <hi>Bohemia</hi> sent one of their Elders to them, to exhort them unto patience under this persecution, which was for the truth.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after the restless enemies of God and his Church,<note place="margin">Persecution.</note> raised another persecution against the Brethren in <hi>Bohemia</hi>; for some Bishops consulting together, suborned the Queen, great with childe, so that they conceived that the King would deny her nothing in that state, to request of him, that he would severely punish the <hi>Piccards</hi>: The King displeased at her request, only nodded his head, but gave no answer at all: Yet the Bishops, in his presence, began to draw up the Edict.<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> The King going into his chamber, fell down on his knees, and with tears besought God to forgive the guilt of those bloudy counsels, and to grant no successe to them: and God heard his prayers, and shewed some examples of his severe judgements on the Authors of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy.</p>
                  <p>The Queen who proposed to her fancy,<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.</note> what gratefull spectacles she should have in seeing the <hi>Piccards</hi> brought to <hi>Prague,</hi> and there, some burnt, some beheaded, and others drowned in the water, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently fell in travell, and when she was not able to bring forth, the Physitians advised that the childe should be cut out of the mothers womb, which was accordingly done, whereby the childe lived, but the mother died.</p>
                  <p>Two years after, the Bishops by their importunity prevailed with the King that sharp remedies should be used against those growing evils, as they were pleased to call them;<note place="margin">

was done; but at last, by the cunning artifice of the Chancellor, and his bloudy associates, it was confirmed by the greatest part of the Nobility, in the presence of the King; and a mutuall confederacy was entred into,<note place="margin">Devillish wickednesse.</note> that it should be prosecuted with an armed power, but God following some of the chiefe contrivers of it with sundry judgements, it almost came to nothing.</p>
                  <p>Yet in these troubles most of the Ministers were turned out of their places, so that they durst not preach nor pray, but in private. And a certaine Noble man, having apprehended six of the Brethren, cast them into prison, and when they were brought forth to be burnt, they went chearfully to the fire; and when the chief officer, taking affection to one of them, offered him his life, if he would recant his error, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him withall to give him a years time to consider of it; he paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a while,<note place="margin">Tentation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted.</note> but by and by answered, <hi>It is too much by such a delay, to lose my Brethrens company,</hi> and so going along with them, they were burned together.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after the Chancellor that had procured the passing of the Edict against the Brethren, as he returned from the Parliament, visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a certaine Noble man by the way, he with great pleasure reported to him what was agreed upon against the brethren: The Noble man having a servant by, that was much edicted to the discipline of the Brethren, asked him how he liked it; the servant answered, that all were not agreed: The Chancellor suspecting some new conspiracy, asked him who durst oppose the States of the Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c</hi>? the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant said,<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>In heaven there is one, who if he were not present at your counsels, you have consulted in vain:</hi> The Chancellor replied, <hi>Thou knave, thou shalt finde that as well as the rest</hi>: And rising up in fury, immediately a Carbuncle rose upon his foot, which turned to a disease, called <hi>Ignis sacer,</hi> whereof he died miserably.</p>
                  <p>Another of the great sticklers in this businesse, returning home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as he was a lighting out of his Chariot to make water, he struck his member on a sharp nail that was in the boot, whereby he drew out his entrails with him, and not long after he gave up the ghost.</p>
                  <p>Also D· <hi>Augustine,</hi> who by slanderous libels had endeavoured to stirre up the King against the Brethren, died suddenly as he was at supper.</p>
                  <p>Another Noble man of these persecutors, as he was hunting, his horse threw him, and his arrow ran into his thigh, and came out at his loins, whereby he died a most paineful death.</p>
                  <p>Many others of them felt the like judgements of God; so that it grew into a proverbe amongst them: If you be weary of your life, attempt something against the <hi>Piccards,</hi> and you shall not escape a year to an end.</p>

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1535. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the first succeeding in the Kingdom, the Popish party cunningly stirred up the <hi>Calixtines</hi> to persecute the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:<note place="margin">A new persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Whereupon, they suffering many grievous things sent a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, together with a confession of their Faith to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> subscribed by twelve Barons and thirty three Knights, complaining how unjustly they were accused by their enemies, and that the Priests ordinarily cried out that the <hi>Piccards</hi> might be slain without controul, and that a lesse sin was thereby committed,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> than if one killed a dog, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> returned answer, that he had not leisure to consider of their Papers, yet promised that nothing should be done either against law or equity, till he had further knowledge of the cause.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Brethren being much encouraged by letters from <hi>Luther, Bucer</hi> and <hi>Capito,</hi> went on constantly, and through Gods mercy, a great nummber was added to the Church, till that fatal year 1547.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Another Minister they fetched from his house, and miserably tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him by twisting a cord about his head, then tied they his hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, and his legs with a small cord, intending the next morning to torture him with fire, but in the night time as he was earnest at his prayers, repeating those words, <hi>In thee O Lord is my trust,</hi> he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his hands and feet miraculously to be loosned,<note place="margin">A speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> Whereupon get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up, he went to the gate, where were three Watchmen, one of them standing with his hand on his sword, yet he passed by them undiscover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: When he came to the Town-gate, he was known by the Souldier that stood Sentinell, but he, being a <hi>Bohemian,</hi> was overcome by entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">Cruelty to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</note> and let him passe over the bridge, whereby he escaped.

                  <p>Then came forth an Edict,<note place="margin">Ministers charged with treason.</note> wherein the blame of all the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion (as they called it) was laid upon the Ministers of <hi>Prague,</hi> because they had stired up, by their seditious and lying Sermons (as they pleased to stile them) and by their writings, not only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, but the Nobles also against <hi>Caesar</hi>; and that they were the authors of the choice of <hi>Frederick,</hi> and that they still laboured to stirre up in the people an hatred against <hi>Caesar.</hi> Thereupon all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters within <hi>Prague,</hi> were required within three daies to depart out of <hi>Prague,</hi> and within eight daies to depart out of all the Kingdom, and the Provinces belonging thereto, and never to return again; and if any under what pretence soever, should stay or returne again,<note place="margin">Ministers ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</note> or if any should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to harbour or conceal any of them, that both the one and the other should suffer death: this was <hi>Anno</hi> 1621.</p>

Then were their Churches in <hi>Prague</hi> given to the Jesuits. It can not be expressed what lamentations and mournings there were amongst the people,<note place="margin">The eighteenth Artifice.</note> when thus they must leave their Pastors, and that for ever. Yet the <hi>German</hi> Ministers, whereof there were two, were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to continue in favour to the Duke of <hi>Saxony.</hi> Then did as many as understood Dutch, flock to their Congregations, which so vexed the Jesuits,<note place="margin">The <hi>German</hi> Ministers ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</note> that they obtained, not a banishment, but a gracious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of them as they would have it called.

                  <p>The next design was, to remove the Ministers out of other free Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the Commissioners of Reformation were imployed herein: One of them with a Troop of horse coming to <hi>Slana,</hi> and going to Church, the Minister (a godly and learned man) was reading the Gospel: The Commissioner sent a souldiers to him to bid him give over, but the Minister still going on, himself went to him with his sword drawn,<note place="margin">Blasp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In a neighbouring City, the Minister for fear of these barbarous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, went a way of himself, yet the Commissioners extorted a great summe of money from his Church, and banished him in his absence. In another place they commanded the Minister to depart from his Parish within three daies, and from the City within eight daies; he modestly asking the reason of his banishment, they told him <hi>Caesar</hi> by conquest was Master of all the Churches, and that therefore he would put into them whom he pleased.</p>
                  <p>But, into the rooms of these godly Preachers, were put in unclean men,<note place="margin">Illiterate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons put into the places of Christs Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> wicked, blasphemers, and men illiterate, and of no worth; and yet they could not provide for all places: so that one of their hirelings supplied divers Churches, and in stead of the wholesome food of Gods Word, he fed them with poison. Then brought the ignorant Monks out of <hi>Poland,</hi> unprofitable burthens to the earth, yet fit enough to be scourges to unprofitable and common Gospellers.</p>
                  <p>Then a Commissioner, with some Troops of horse, entring into <hi>Ctutenburg,</hi> a place famous for maintaining the Orthodox Faith, cals before him the Ministers, casts them out of their places, and puts Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41459:102"/>
into their Churches: And these Jesuits urging it, the Ministers were commanded to depart out of the City gates before break of day, and out of the Kingdom within eight daies: Hereby were twenty one Ministers driven away, many Citizens accompanying them:<note place="margin">Twenty one Ministers ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</note> One of them at the parting, preached upon that Text, <hi>They shall cast you out of the Synagogues</hi>; exhorting them to perseverance. All the multitude much bewailed their losse, and with great lamentations, wailing and kissing each other, they recommended themselves to the blessing and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>In every place the Ministers were cast out of their livings, some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonned, and after a while dismissed, and all commanded to depart the Kingdom, upon pain of death. Some were stifled with stink whilest they lay in prison.</p>
                  <p>At last, <hi>Anno</hi> 1624. an other Decree came forth from the King, whereby all the Ministers of the Gospel were commanded to depart the Kingdom, by a peremptory day prefixed, because, as was alledged,<note place="margin">Ministers charged with sedition.</note> they were seditious men, and seducers of the people: Yet herein they used this Artifice, that in most places this Edict was concealed, till the time was almost or altogether elapsed, so that by this means the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters not having time to communicate their counsels together, went into severall Provinces, and some were faigne to hide themselves in caves &amp; dens, and those either returned privately, and visited their auditors, or comforted such as came to them in the mountains and woods, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and administring the Sacraments to them.</p>
                  <p>But as soon as the enemies understood it, they presently published a new decree, wherein a punishment was preposed to those that should conceal the Ministers, and a rewarde to such as should betray them: Whereupon some of the Ministers were taken and cast into prison: Then by the Jesuits were they by all waies sollicited to Apostacy; and fear of death, hunger, cold,<note place="margin">Tentation.</note> the stink of the prison <hi>&amp;c.</hi> prevailed with some to renounce their Ministery: But most bore up couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously against all storms, and at last some by paying great fines,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> others by giving it under their hands, that they would never returne into <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> were dismissed.</p>
                  <p>One godly Minister was examined by tortures, when, where,<note place="margin">A Minister Martyred.</note> and to whom he had administred the Sacraments of Baptism or the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he answered, that he had neither laide down, nor slacked his Ministry, which he received from Christ, and not from <hi>Caesar:</hi> Being profferred life if he would change his Religion he answered, <hi>This body of mine is subject to corruption, and now it begins to decay already, Why Would you have me hinder it</hi>? Being brought forth to execution, the Crier with a loud voice proclaimed that he was guilty of sedition: But he with a loud voice said, <hi>I suffer for the truth of Christ.</hi> None of the Citizens were suffered to accompany him, yea they were threatned to be shot, if they did but look out at their windows: And that his voice might not be heard, the Drums and Trumpets sounded conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. As he was passing on, he chearfully said: <hi>This day shall my

soul be with Christ:</hi> The Captain said, With the devil in hell: The Martyr replied, <hi>But you with your impious crew will run headlong thither, except ye repent.</hi> Then was his right hand cut off, wherewith he gave the Cup in the Sacrament: Then was his head cut off, his bowels taken forth, and wrapped in his shirt, his quarters set upon four stakes, and his head upon the fifth.<note place="margin">Popish cruelty.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then did the Commissioners go into <hi>Moravia,</hi> to a Noble Baron called <hi>Charles de Zerotina,</hi> a man for wisdom and vertue famous through all <hi>Europe,</hi> a constant professor of Religion, and one who maintained twenty four Ministers of the Brethren within his jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: They told him that they had an express command from Cardinall <hi>Ditrichsteine</hi> to expell all those Ministers out of the Country:<note place="margin">The Vice-roy.</note> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That in matters of Religion he ought not to be subject to the Cardinall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore from him he appeals to <hi>Caesar.</hi> Then did they grant him fourteen daies to prosecute his appeale, but the Baron being not in health; could not go in that time to <hi>Caesar,</hi> Then they came again to him, an told him that it should be in his choice whether he would send them a way himself,<note place="margin">Courage and Constancy.</note> or suffer them to do it; the Baron answered, that he could not banish those whom he knew to be the servants of Jesus Christ, nor could consent that they should do it: Yet that night they sent abroad their citations to require all the inhabitants of that Village to appear before them the next morning, at which time the Minister and people came; then did they read to them <hi>Caesars</hi> Edict, asking them if they would submit to it; they answered that they wholly relied upon the will of God, whom they served in the Gospell of his Son, and therefore they were resolued to undergo what punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they should inflict, seeing they suffered only for the Name of Jesus Christ, and not for any ill deeds: Then they demanded of them, whether the would forsake their heresie, and returne to the Catholick Church; which they unanimously denied.

were about the number of fifty men, famous for learning, skill in mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary affairs, and prudence in government, who were the light, delight and safeguard of their Countrey.</p>
                  <p>All of these in one night, and at one hour, were apprehended in their houses, when they suspected no danger, and by the Captains were commanded to get up into Wagons, and so some of them were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Castle of <hi>Prague,</hi> others to the Majors house.

                  <p>Early in the morning they washed their faces, and put on clean clothes, as if they had been going to a wedding; and cut off the collars of their dublets, that when they came to the Scaffold, there should need no new making ready. Then did they earnestly pray to

God,<note place="margin">Prayer.</note> that he would be pleased to confirm and strengthen both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and the people concerning their innocency.</p>
                  <p>Presently after the sun rising, a beautifull bow appeared, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed the heavens, the Ministers, souldiers, and many others looking upon it: The Martyrs looked out at the window, and saw a Rainbow of an unusuall colour, the heavens being very clear, and no rain of two daies before, whereupon falling upon their knees, they lifted up their voices and hands, praising God for this sign that he shewed from heaven. Then presently was a Gun discharged, which was a warning for their bringing forth to execution; whereupon those Champions of Christ encouraged one another,<note place="margin">Courage.</note> praying that each of them might be strengthened, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then Troops of horse and foot came to fetch them, the streets, market-place and houses, being filled with multitudes of spectators.</p>
                  <p>The Martyrs being called forth one by one, went to their death with and undaunted courage, hasting as if they had been going to a banquet: When one was called for, he thus took his leave of the rest, <hi>Farwell most loving friends, God give you the comforts of his Spirit, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and courage, that what formerly with your mouths you have professed,</hi>

At this houre all sorrow departs from me, and joyfull eternity shall succeed it.</hi> Then did the rest answer, <hi>God above to whom you are going, prosper your journey, and grant that you may passe happily from this vale of misery, unto that heavenly Country; The Lord Jesus send his Angeles to meet you: Go, dear brother, into thine and our Fathers house, and we will follow after, presently we shall meet in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory, and this we are confident of through him in whom we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first was the Lord <hi>Schlik,</hi> a man of admirable parts, about fifty years old: When he was condemned to be quartered,<note place="margin">The L. <hi>Schlik.</hi>
                     </note> and his parts to be scattered here and there; he said, <hi>The loss of a sepulchre is easie:</hi> Being exhorted by a Minister to courage, he said, <hi>I have Gods favour so; that no fear of death doth trouble me;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His faith and courage.</note> 
                     <hi>I have formerly dared to oppose An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, and I dare now die for Christ.</hi> The Jesuites troubling him when he came to the Scaffold, he shaked them off, and seeing the sun shining bright, he said, <hi>Christ thou Son of righteousness, grant that through the darknesse of death, I may passe into eternall light</hi>; and so having end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his prayers he constantly received the stroak:<note place="margin">His Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> His right hand and head were hung on the high Tower upon the Bridge.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> was next, about seventy years old,<note place="margin">The L. <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceslaus.</hi>
                     </note> famous for Learning, Religion, and his travels through divers countries: His house was formerly plundered, even to his wearing apparell, he only saying, <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away.</hi> Being asked why he would engage himselfe in <hi>Fredericks</hi> cause, he said, <hi>My conscience pressed me to do what I did; I am here, my God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His patience.</note> 
                     <hi>dispose of me thy servant as seems good in thine eyes; I am full of years, take me out of this life,

that I may not see that evill that is coming on my Country.</hi> Afterwards holding forth his Bible, he said, <hi>Behold my Paradise, it never yeelded me so much Nectar and Ambrosia as now.</hi> When he was sentenced, he said to the Judges,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>You have a long time thirsted after my bloud, but know withall, you will finde God a revenger of innocent bloud, for whose cause we suffer.</hi> A Frier saying to him, You are deceived in your opinion, he answered, <hi>I rely not on opinion, but on the infallible truth of God, for I have no other way but him who said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.</hi> On the Scaffold, stroaking his long beard, he said, <hi>My gray hairs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what honour remains for you, that you should be crowned with Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>: And so praying for the Church, his Country, his enemies, and commending his soul to Christ,<note place="margin">His Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> his head was cut off, and set on the Tower.</p>

As he was going to suffer, he called the Minister to him, and told him that he much feared his wives inconstancy in Religion,<note place="margin">His message to his wife.</note> and therefore desired him to exhort her to constancy, and not to suffer her self to be drawn from her Religion by any allurements, assuring her that it is the infallible way to salvation. Then to exhort her to use more cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency to his subjects, rather easing then over-charging them with burthens.

                     </note>The next was <hi>Casper Kaplitz</hi> a Knight, of eighty six years old: When the Minister came to him after his condemnation, he said, <hi>See me a miserable old man, who have often intreated my God that he would have mercy upon me, and take me out of this miserable life, but have not obtained it, for God hath reserved me to be a spectacle to the world, and a sacrifice to himselfe, Gods will be done: My death indeed is disgracefull in the eyes of men, but glorious in the sight of God; for God will account that death precious in his sight, which I suffer for his glory and truth:</hi> And when it was told him that he might have his life, if he would ask pardon; he answered,<note place="margin">His courage and constancy.</note> That he would ask pardon of him against whom he had committed many sins all his life, but he never offended the Prince, and therefore would not give occasion to suspect that he had committed

Then were some of the Citizens banished, others cast into prison, and three of the principal was sequestered to strike a terror into the rest; the cause pretended was, because they said, as was alledged, <hi>That none had power to command their consciences,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Amongst these there were two Burgomasters, learned men, who exhorted their fellow Citizens not to be affrighted with these imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terrors.</p>

                  <p>One <hi>Bartholomew Lang</hi> told them to their faces, that he had rather die by the sword, then deny his faith; whereupon with divers others he was thrust into a stinking dungeon, where they kept them prisoners for seventeen weeks, their houses in the meane time being possessed by the barbarous souldiers.</p>

                     </note>At <hi>Zaticum,</hi> another City, famous for religion, the Minister being banished, Friers were put into his place, who being assisted with soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers used to cane those that would not bow to the Host, and because the Major and some of the Aldermen were absent at a solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, they sined them.

Then did he proclaim that without his leave none should go out of the gates upon pain of death: The next day he arrested the Major, and would not release him, but upon the promise of Apostacy.

them grievously, till he had forced their consent to the like Apostacy. Then assembling the whole Senate, he commands them presently to submit to <hi>Caesars</hi> will, to go to auricular confession, and to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in one kinde, promising that such as obeyed should be eased of souldiers, that the others should have their burthens doubled, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring every one in order to answer for himselfe, whether he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to perform this within three weeks: One of them modestly pleading to be excused, in regard of his conscience: the furious beast fell upon him, beat him about the head, and abused him with cursed words, saying, <hi>Thou art an unworthy knave to be in this place, I will have thee bound hand and foot, and cast into a deep dungeon, and when thou hast vomited out thy wicked soul, I will deliver thee to the hangman to be buried,</hi> &amp;c. Then he cals to his souldiers for chains and fetters, with which they bound his hands and feet, and put an iron coller about his neck, with a thick chaine, and so brought him to the Dungeon, where he was tormented for three weeks, neither wife nor children being suffered to come to him, and fed with bread and water; the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites also were daily molesting him: Then was he sentenced to death, which he chose before Apostacy. Then said one of the Jesuites, he is possessed with the devil, &amp; therefore he commanded him to be bound more straitely, whereby at last he was forced to go to auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, but by that means getting out of the Prison, he fled into <hi>Misnia</hi> to escape their tyranny.</p>
                  <p>All the best Citizens did desire banishment,<note place="margin">Exile denied to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</note> but the City gates were kept strictly, least any should get out, or carry out their housholdstuff; whereupon many escaped by the mines of the wall, and among these, a Lords wife, leaving all her rich housholdstuff behinde her, crept out at the common sewer, to follow her husband into banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Many of the exiles in <hi>Misnia,</hi> having spent all that little which they carried with them, were forced to seek alms in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where being betrayed, they were cast into prison, and so tormented, till some of them were almost distracted, and then they were sent away to other places; some of these were persons of good quality.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Tusta</hi> a chief Officer of the Kingdome sollicited the Citizens to turn <hi>Catholicks,</hi> which they refusing to do,<note place="margin">At <hi>Tusta.</hi>
                     </note> he complained of it to the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites at <hi>Prague,</hi> whereupon <hi>Don Martin</hi> is sent thither, who entring the City, sends his souldiers into the Senators houses, licensing them to abuse them at their pleasure, so that in a short time many were forced to Apostasie. Then did that other Officer set a great fine upon the City,<note place="margin">Apostacy.</note> because they turned <hi>Catholicks</hi> for another mans sake, and would not do it for his: And thus the poor Protestants were abused on every hand to satisfie the lusts of these Tyrants.</p>
                  <p>Then did another Noble man, with a band of souldiers, go to the City of <hi>Rokizan,</hi> and tyrannically abuse them for their Religion, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing no kinde of insolency that they could think of:<note place="margin">At <hi>Rokizan.</hi>
                     </note> Amongst other projects this was one; He caused all the Citizens to write their names

in three books:<note place="margin">Popish subtilty</note> In the first such as were already <hi>Catholicks</hi> (which were but six late Apostates) In the second the names of such as would become Apostates within a fortnight, which were very few: In the third such as absolutely refused, and so were opposite to God and <hi>Caesar,</hi> and in this were almost all the names, which so enraged him, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to use all manner of cruelties,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> saying, that they deserved the crosse, the wheel, yea and hell it self.</p>
                  <p>Then did he command all the Citizens to come to the Church the next day, to receive the Sacrament in one kinde; but when, coming himself to Church, he found few or none there, he runs through the streets, and into the houses, driving all that he met with to the Church with his stick. When he came thither again, he espied one <hi>John Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi>

                  <p>After this he again sent word to <hi>Foelix,</hi> that except he changed his minde by the morrow,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Foelix</hi> escapes.</note> he would act a new tragedy with him, but that night he escaped, leaving behinde him his dear wife and children, and an aged mother of eighty years old. Then did the Earl imprison his wife, and sequestred his estate, and enforced the rest of the Citizens to subscribe that they did freely, and with all readinesse of minde, imbrace the <hi>Catholick</hi> religion.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Martinitz</hi> was appointed to reforme the City of <hi>Slana,</hi> who substituted one <hi>Hansbursky,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">At <hi>Slana.</hi>
                     </note> an Apostate, to see this work done. This man that he might ingratiate himself with the Jesuites, appointed a solemn Procession, and either by fraud or force, brought to it most of the Citizens:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>John Blyssa.</hi>
                     </note> Amongst others, he required one <hi>John Blyssa</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, but he refused, saying, <hi>As oft as I have received the Lords Supper, so oft have I obliged my self to God, and against these abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> Then said the other, Thou shalt not resist the Emperours plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: But said he, <hi>In those things which belong to Caesar, I will not, but here Gods business is in hand</hi>: Then said the other, Thou shalt be forced to it: <hi>God,</hi> replied he, <hi>seeks willing, not forced worshippers</hi>; whereupon he was presently committed to prison, for nine weeks and so was another godly Citizen,<note place="margin">Banished.</note> and fined, and then together with his wife, driven out of the City.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards also was <hi>Blyssa</hi> and his wife banished, for procuring his childe to be Baptized by a Protestant Minister privately, and his estate was sequestred, having nothing left him to support him in his banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Then by divers kindes of torments he compelled some to a forced obedience; as he did fifty men whom he shut up in a narrow room, where they could neither stand, sit, nor lie, nor have leave to go forth
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41459:112"/>
to ease nature: So that after three daies enduring of this pain and stink, they were forced to promise to learn the <hi>Roman</hi> religion.</p>
                  <p>The like dealing he used to divers women in his own chamber: but so soon as they could, most of them went into voluntary ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Prachatice</hi> they entred by force, and slew the Major, who was bringing to them the keys,<note place="margin">At <hi>Prachatice.</hi> Prodigious cruelties.</note> together with a thousand six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, women and children, sparing none but such as fled, or hid themselves in secret places: The karcasses they left unburied for divers daies, all dirty, and shamefully naked. Afterwards when the City began again to be inhabited, the Commissioners of Reformation came thither, promising them that if they would turn <hi>Catholicks,</hi> they should have their Liberties restored to them, but if they refused, they should be restrained from all trading, and when this prevailed not, they thrust men and women, young and old into prisons, where they miserably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fflicted them for four whole moneths.</p>
                  <p>The like cruely they used to all other Cities, where they shewed and used all manner of impostures, deceits, tyrannies and impudent practices, till they had rooted out the reformed Religion, and set up their idolatrous and superstitious worship in the stead of it.</p>
                  <p>The godly Ministers being generally removed,<note place="margin">The twenty sixth Artifice.</note> the next design of the enemies was to take all Bibles, and other profitable books out of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hands, that so the heat of Religion might in time grow cold: The Friers also which were placed in the Churches: did not presently thunder, but dealt fairly, beseeching and confirming the truth of their Religion with oaths, and dreadfull cursing of themselves,<note place="margin">Popish subtilty</note> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing also the Emperours favour, and easing of their burthens; yea they sought by works of charity to oblige the poorer sort to them.</p>
                  <p>One Frier promised a bushell of Wheat to every one that would come to Confession; but when his Garners began to waste, he gave but half the measure, whereupon one flang away in anger, saying, <hi>What, is my soul viler then the rest?</hi> But when they perceived that they gained but few by their Fox-like subtilty, they returned to their Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish cruelty, compelling men to come to Masse, and taking the names of all such as absented themselves; and if any went to private religious meetings, they were fined, imprisoned and whipt.</p>
                  <p>Some godly persons being met together with a Minister, in a private Chappel, two Colonels, with some troops came upon them, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed the Church, rusht in with their drawn swords, took the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster from the Communion-table, stript off his cloaths,<note place="margin">Popish pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanenesse.

                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:41459:113"/>
Then came out an Edict that whosever refused to turn <hi>Papist,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men or women, young or old; bond or free, their names should be returned to the Council of State, who would give instructions what should be done with their persons and estates.</p>
                  <p>Marriage, Buriall and Baptism were forbidden to the Protestants, and if any did it privately,<note place="margin">The twenty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Artifice.</note> they were imprisoned, and not dismissed without Apostasie, or a great fine. Then was all trading inhibited, or means of getting their living, and at last buying of food, so that the poor people being oppressed with hunger and want, were either forced to fly, or to Apostatize.</p>
                  <p>The countrymen they fetched out of their houses, yea out of their beds,<note place="margin">Prodigious cruelties.</note> by troopes of souldiers, driving them like beasts before them in the sharpest cold, and filled the common prisons, towers, cellers, sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, yea and hogsties with them, where they were killed with hunger, cold and thirst.</p>
                  <p>A godly Chirurgion, with others, was cast into a place full of snakes. Another company was thrust into a stable, and all the windows stopt up, that the were almost stifled for want of breath. In some places they shut them up in privies, that they might be poisoned with the stink. In some places they mad holes, and knockt them full of iron spikes, wherein those that were shut, could neither sit nor stand, but bending and crooked: It was not possible that any man could endure this posture above two or three hours, their sinews in the mean time trembling and their members quivering, and their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hearts ready to faint with anguish; so that some were forced to promise to turn <hi>Catholiks,</hi> others that refused were brought back to torture.</p>
                  <p>Then the devised a prison upon the water, very narow, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a cubit and an half in length, wherein the prisoner could by no meanes lay himself at length, and if he turned himself unawares, he must fall into the water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The twenty eighth Artifice.</note>Another design was, first to assault men of greatest authority, to make them an example to the rest.</p>
                  <p>In the town of <hi>Minion</hi> the Commissioner demanded of the people a positive answer,<note place="margin">At <hi>Minion.</hi>
                     </note> whether they would turn <hi>Catholicks</hi>: And one of them in the name of the rest saying, that <hi>conscience neither would nor could be forced,</hi> he was presently laid upon the ground and beaten, and still denying to turn <hi>Catholick,</hi> when he could hardly speak, he was torn in pieces; The rest affrighted at this terrible spectacle promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obedience if time were given them.</p>
                  <p>In another place the Senator refusing to turn Apostates, the cheifest of them was made to ride the wooden horse, in the market-place, for six hours space, though he was very ancient, so that he was lame and half dead, when he was taken off.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There were many who would have died in the maintenance of their Christian faith, but there were none that would inflict death upon them; for these cruel Tyrants brought up in the devils school,<note place="margin">Prodigious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wickednesse.</note> would not kill the body but the soul, and therefore they sought by lingring and continual punishments to bring them first to stagger, and then to deny the truth.</p>
                  <p>When any man desired to be convinced by Scripture,<note place="margin">Blasphemy.</note> they answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with scoffs and jears, accusing the Scripture of imperfection, of obscurity, of ambiguity, saying that <hi>it was the Fountain of Heresie, the Sanctuary of Hereticks, and that Laymen had nothing to do with it</hi>: They called the Bible <hi>Wiblia,</hi> which in the <hi>Bohemian</hi> language, signifies <hi>vomit.</hi> They took away all Orthodox books from the people, that thereby they might be the more easily led into error.</p>
                  <p>In some places they shut up the people in the Church and forced them to receive in one kinde;<note place="margin">Prodigious wickedness.</note> and if they would not fall down to the Host, they used to beat their legs with clubs, till they fell down: Some they imprisoned and racked severall times to force them to auricular confession.

                  <p>Edicts also were published, forbidding all to entertain such as fled upon pain of forfeiting a hundred pieces of silver for every nights en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. Yet these miserable people could not go out of the Kingdom, not being acquainted with any other language: besides, they were told that ere long the like tragedy should be acted every where</p>
                  <p>Four men of <hi>Kossenberg</hi> continuing constant after long imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they were first exposed to cold for five weeks together in the depth of winter: Then for nine daies they were pined with hunger, they having only a small portion of bread that kept life and soul toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and drinking their own urine, and when they were threatned harder usage, if they turned not, they answered, <hi>We willingly imbrace all afflictions of famin, hanging, burning, or any thing, rather then we would sin against God.</hi> Thereupon,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> only twice a week there was given them a mouthfull of bread, and a draught of water.

                  <p>Others were kept in prisons and bonds till they died.

                  <p>HAving thus given you a brief Narrative of the Persecutions of the Church in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> from the first planting of the Gospel amongst them, to our present times: Before I proceed any further, let us a little look back to see how God fought for them, against their Popish adversaries, and thereby after a wonderfull manner plagued their persecutors. Much may be read hereof in my <hi>second Part,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Zisca</hi>; but after his death, there was a great fear, and sorrow seized on his Army, and the souldiers being divided amongst themselves, one part of them chose for their Captain <hi>Procopius Magnus,</hi> who still retained the name of <hi>Thaborites.</hi> The other part, thinking none wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to succeed <hi>Zisca,</hi> named themselves the <hi>Orphanes,</hi> by reason of the losse of their Captain; yet whensoever their Popish adversaries came against them, they both joyned together to defend themselves, and the liberty of the Gospel in <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About this time Pope <hi>Martin</hi> perceiving the Gospel and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of it to increase daily in <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Pope stirs up persecution.</note> he sent the Cardinall of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> an <hi>English</hi> man, into <hi>Germany,</hi> to stirre up the Emperour and <hi>German</hi> Princes to make war against the <hi>Bohemians.</hi> Hereupon three Armies were levied, one under the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi>; the second under the Marquesse of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> the third under <hi>Otho</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Trevers:</hi> These three Armies entred <hi>Bohemia</hi> three waies, and at last joyning all into one, besieged the City of <hi>Misna,</hi> which but the night before was won from the Papists by one <hi>Prichicho,</hi> a learned and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Protestant, and therefore the Popish Armies resolved to take that place before they marched any further:<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors. The Popish Army flies.</note> But so soon as news came that the Protestants had raised an Army, and were hasting to the relief of <hi>Misna,</hi> they speedily fled before they ever saw an enemy, leaving all their Engines of warre, and a great booty behinde them.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinall meeting them in their flight, used all the arguments that possibly he could to the Nobles and Captains, to turn them back again, magnifying their number and prowesse, and vilifying their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but when nothing would prevail, himselfe was fain to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them in the flight. Presently the <hi>Bohemians</hi> pursuing, fell upon their rereward, which made their flight much more fearfull and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered then it was before, neither did they leave flying till the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> left pursuing of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:41459:115"/>
The Emperour hearing of this shamefull flight, went to <hi>Noremberg</hi> and by the assistance of the Cardinall, a new Army was raised under the Command of <hi>Frederick</hi> Marquesse of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> which entred <hi>Bohemia</hi> one way,<note place="margin">A new Army raised.</note> and another great Army under <hi>Albert</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> which entred another way. In these two Armies were all the chiefest Nobles and Bishops in <hi>Germany,</hi> being above fourty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horsemen, besides foot.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bohemians</hi> as soon as they heard of their enemies approach, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered their Host with all speed to encounter them: But God marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously fought for them, for before the <hi>Bohemians</hi> came near them, the Popish Army was struck with such a marvellous sudden fear, that they began most shamefully to run away;<note place="margin">They fly when none pursues.</note> the Cardinall wondering at it, went up and down to the Captains, exhorting and encouraging of them, telling them that they were to fight for their Lives, Honour, Religion, and the salvation of souls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but notwithstanding all that he could say and do, the Ensignes were suddenly snatched up, and every man ran headlong away, so that the Cardinall was forced to do the like: The Protestants encouraged hereby, speedily pursued them, and obtained a very great booty. This so astonished both the Pope and Emperour, that afterwards they sought rather by subtilty to entrap them, then by force to compell them to forsake their religion, as we have seen in the foregoing story.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ANno</hi> 1540. there was one <hi>Francis Romane,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>F. Romanes</hi> Conversion.</note> sent by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> to <hi>Breme</hi> to take up some money that was due to them; where, being at a Sermon (through the marvelous working of Gods Spirit) he was so effectually wrought upon, that after the Sermon he went to the Preacher, and repeated the contents of his whole Sermon to him, and then betaking himself to the searching of the Scriptures, and conferring with learned men, in a short space he had attained to a great measure of knowledge in the Word of life; which the Minister observing, and withal finding him of a fervent spirit, he directed and exhorted him to circumspection in his carriage, more and more instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the knowledge of the Gospel, which he so greedily received as one that could never be satisfied. This made him give over seeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter temporal treasure, and instead thereof he bought good books, by reading of which, and conference with the Minister, he much impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his knowledge in all the chief Articles of Religion. Then did he write letters to his countrey-men at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> wherein he first gave thanks to God for revealing his truth to him;<note place="margin">Zeale.</note> then did he bewaile the grosse ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of his countrey-men, beseeching God to open their eyes to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the word of salvation, and so promised shortly to returne to them to conferre with them about the grace of God, which he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and lastly he declared his purpose of going into <hi>Spaine</hi> to acquaint his parents and friends with that wholesome Doctrine which God had communicated to him.</p>
               <p>Then wrote he other letters also to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to him the miserable state of Christs Church, desiring him to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the good thereof; especially to reforme the grosse corruptions of the Church of <hi>Spaine</hi>; he wrote also a Catechisme, and some other Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in the <hi>Spanish</hi> tongue.</p>
               <p>The Merchants at <hi>Antwerp</hi> having received his Letters, sent for him, pretending much good will, but secretly practising his destruction: For against his coming, they suborned some Friers, who so soon as he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted from his horse, seized upon him, rifled his books,<note place="margin">Subtilty.</note> and carrying him into a Merchants house, examined him;<note place="margin">Treachery.</note> But he mightily confuting them, they bound him hand and foot, calling him <hi>Lutheran</hi>; they also burnt his books before his face, threatning to burn him likewise. Then was he sent Prisoner to a Tower six miles from <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and cast into a deep dungeon, where he endured much misery for eight moneths, at the end whereof, the Merchants, supposing that he would be better advised for the time to come, released him. Then did he go to <hi>Lovain,</hi> where he had much conference with <hi>Driander,</hi> who advised him to continue in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41459:116"/>
of a Merchant,<note place="margin">Good counsel.</note> wherein he might have many opportunities of doing good; and for Religion, that he should do nothing for favour of men, whereby the glory of God should be diminished. He advised him also to take heed of inconsiderate zeal, lest he should do as some, who going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of their vocation, thinking to do good, and to edifie, they destroy and do harme. For said he, it is God that takes care of his Church, and will raise up faithful Ministers for the same: neither doth he approve such as rashly intrude themselves into that function without any calling thereto.<note place="margin">Note.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This advice <hi>Francis</hi> willingly hearkned unto, promising to follow the same. Not long after going to <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> where the Emperial Diet was held,<note place="margin">He goeth to the Emperour.</note> having opportunity, he boldly stept to the Emperour, beseeching him to deliver his countrey and subjects of <hi>Spaine</hi> from false Religion, and to restore them to the sincerity of Christs doctrine, protesting that the Protestants of <hi>Germany</hi> were in the truth; and that the Religion of <hi>Spaine</hi> was greatly dissonant to the Word of God, &amp;c. The Emperour all this while heard him gently, promising him to consider of the matter, and so to do therein as he trusted should be for the best.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Francis</hi> being encouraged with this answer, went again to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour a second and third time, and still received a quiet answer as before; yet not satisfied herewith, he went a fourth time, but was repulsed by some Spaniards about the Emperour, who were so incensed against him, that immediately they would have thrown him headlong into the river <hi>Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> if the Emperour had not restrained them, willing that he should be judged by the Lawes of the Empire: Then was he cast into prison, till the Emperours voyage into <hi>Africk,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Is imprisoned. Carried into <hi>Spaine.</hi>
                  </note> at which time he, with some other Captives, was carried into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and there delivered unto the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who cast him into a dark prison under ground; He was oft examined, loaden with many reproaches and contumelies, yet ever remained firme and unmovable, so that at last they condemned him to be burnt for an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick.<note place="margin">Condemned by the Inquisitors.</note> As he was led to the place of execution, they put upon him a Miter of paper, painted all over with ugly Devils; as he passed by a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den crosse, they required him to worship it, to which he answered, that the manner of Christians was not to worship wood: Being laid upon the pile of wood, when he first felt the fire, he lifted up his head towards heaven; whereupon the Inquisitors thinking that he would recant,<note place="margin">Burned.</note> caused him to be taken down, but when they found his constancy, they threw him on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, where he slept in the Lord. Then did the Inquisitors proclaime that he was damned, and that none should pray for him, and that they were hereticks whosoever doubted of his damnation.</p>
               <p>There was also dwelling at Saint <hi>Luca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> in <hi>Spaine</hi> one <hi>Rochus,</hi> a skilful graver of images:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rochus.</hi>
                  </note> but the Lord pleasing to enlighten him with the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge of his truth, he gave over making of idolatrous images, and imployed himself in making of seals: only he kept standing on his stall an image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> artificially graven for a signe of his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation.</p>
               <p>An Inquisitor passing by, and liking the image, asked the price of it:
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:41459:116"/>
                  <hi>Rochus</hi> set him a price, but was not willing to sell it: the Inquisitor bade him half so much: the other answered that he could not afford it so, and that he had rather break it than sell it; yea, said the Inquisitor, let me see that if thou darest? with that <hi>Rochus</hi> with a Chisel cut off the nose of the image; whereupon the Inquisitor presently commanded him to prison, and within three dayes he was condemned to be burnt. At the place of execution he poured out his fervent prayers to Almighty God,<note place="margin">Condemned.</note> and so made a blessed end, <hi>Anno</hi> 1545.</p>
               <p>Divers other godly persons being by the Inquisitors cast into loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some dungeons, ended their lives there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1550. At <hi>Validolid,</hi> the Inquisitors brought forth thirty priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners together, of high and low estate, as also the Coffin of a certain noble woman with her picture lying upon it, she being dead long before, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive judgement and sentence: for the solemnities whereof they had erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three great stages; the first for the Kings sister, the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> and his eldest sonne Prince <hi>Philip,</hi> with other States: The second for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Inquisitors: And the third for the Prisoners. Multitudes of people being assembled together, these dear servants of Jesus Christ, clothed with <hi>Sambito's,</hi> a yellow cloth hanging down before and behind,<note place="margin">Thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ty Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> powdred with red crosses, and having burning tapers in their hands, and Miters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads painted with Devils, were placed in their rankes: Then was a Sermon preached, after which an Oath was administred to the Princes and Nobles by the Inquisitors, that they should favour the holy Inquisition, and consent to the same, and that they should employ their uttermost endeavour to see all them executed which should swerve from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and adhere to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> without respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, of what degree, quality, or condition soever;<note place="margin">A wicked Oath.</note> and that they should compel their subjects to submit to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to obey all its lawes, &amp;c. Then was Doctor <hi>Cacalla</hi> called forth, a man of excellent learning, who had often preached before the Emperour whilst he was a Friar;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cacalla</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> but being now accounted to be the Standard-bearer to the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> he was called forth to hear his sentence, which was, that he should be degraded, and presently burnt, and his goods confiscated.</p>
               <p>The like sentence of condemnation was pronounced upon his brother <hi>Francis,</hi> a Preacher also, who having spoken boldly against the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they so stopt his mouth that he could not speak a word. Then <hi>Blanch</hi> their sister received the like sentence, and so did most of the other, only some few of them were condemned to some years imprisonment, and to wear their <hi>Sambito's</hi> all their life time, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then was the Coffin of the dead Lady with her picture it upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned likewise to be burnt. This good woman, whilst she lived, was a worthy maintainer of the Gospel, of great integrity of life, and one that had divers assemblies in her house for the true preaching of the Word of God; wherefore her house was also sentenced to be razed down,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> and a Pillar to be set up in the place thereof, with an inscription shewing the cause.</p>
               <p>Then were all these that were sentenced to death,<note place="margin">Malice.</note> together with the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:41459:117"/>
Coffin, delivered to the secular Magistrate, and so every one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set upon an Asse with their faces towards his taile, they were guarded by many souldiers to the place of execution: at which place there was for each of them a stake set up,<note place="margin">Many burnt together.</note> to which every of them were bound, and so they were first strangled, and then burnt to ashes; only one of them, who had been most vehement against them, was burnt alive, and his mouth stopped that he should not speak to the people. All men marvelled at their constancy and quiet end.</p>
               <p>At the same time also there were in prison at <hi>Validolid</hi> thirty seven o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which were reserved for another Tragedy and Spectacle of the bloody Inquisition. But seeing much mention is made of the Spanish Inquisition, and of the cruelty exercised thereby against the poor servants of Jesus Christ, I shall here set down the first Original, and Progresse thereof, as hereafter followeth.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Spanish Inquisition.</note> and other places of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who had lived there seven hundred, seventy, and eight years, they set upon the Reformation of Religion; and granted the conquered Moors liberty to stay, &amp; to enjoy all their goods, provided that they would turn Christians; and whereas also there were very many <hi>Jews,</hi> who had continued there since <hi>Titus</hi> conquered <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> they gave them leave to stay upon the same condition; but all such as refused, were commanded presently to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Yet afterwards, finding that those Persons were only Christians in name, and had submitted only to save their estates, instead of providing godly Ministers with meeknesse to instruct them, and to draw them from their errours;<note place="margin">Invented by Dominicans.</note> (by the advice of the <hi>Dominican</hi> Friers) they erected the Inquisition; wherein the poor wretches in stead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, were robbed of all their estates, and either put to most cruel deaths, or else suffered most intolerable torments by whipping, &amp;c. and leading the rest of their lives in ignominy and poverty; Neither was this only inflicted upon such as blasphemed Christ, but for the observation of the least <hi>Jewish,</hi> or <hi>Moorish</hi> ceremony, or the smallest errour in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion. But this Inquisition at first erected against <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> was afterwards turned against the faithful servants of Jesus Christ, and for the suppressing of the Gospel, and the Profession of it; and thus briefly you have the Original of it; let us now see what their practice and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise is.</p>
                  <p>As soone as information is given in against any one, though but for a very small matter, they do not presently cite the person to appear before

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty accused, uses thus to greet him; Sir, I was yesterday by accident at my Lords Inquisitors, who said that they had occasion to speak with you about certain of their affairs, and therefore they commanded me to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon you to appear before them to morrow at such an hour: The party not daring to refuse, goes to the place, sends in word that he is come to attend them, and so when he is called in, they ask him what suit he hath to them? and when he answers, that he comes upon summons, they enquire his name. For, say they, we know not whether you be the same man or not: but since you are come, if you have any thing to inform this Court of, either concerning your self or any other, you may let us hear it, for the discharge of your own conscience; The Parties safest way is constantly to deny that he hath any thing to declare to them. But if through simplicity he doth accuse himself, or any other they rejoyce, as having attained their desires, and so presently commit him to prison.</p>
                  <p>If nothing be confessed, they dismisse him, pretending that for the present they know not whether he be the Party or no: after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they let him alone for some space, and then send for him again, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting him that if he know, or hath heard any thing that concerns their holy Court, to disclose it to them; For (say they) we know that you have had dealing with some persons suspected in Religion, and therefore remember your self well; if you confesse you shall fare the better,<note place="margin">Subtilty.</note> and you shall but do therein as a good Christian ought to do. If still he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, they threaten, and so dismisse him.</p>
                  <p>Yet they have alwayes one or other to keep him company, to creep into his bosome, and grope his conscience: who under the colour of friendship shall visit him daily, and have an eye to all his dealings, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what company he keepeth, with whom he conferres, &amp;c. So that without Gods special assistance, it is not possible to escape their snares; The Inquisitors also if they meet him, speak courteously to him, promise to befriend him, &amp;c. and all to make him more carelesse of himself, that they may undo him before he be aware. But if the Party be a stranger, or one that is like to make an escape;<note place="margin">Their dealing with strangers.</note> or that they hope to gain any thing by his confession, they presently clap him up in prison: in which prison great numbers die, either starved with hunger, or by extremity of rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If any one that is accused chance to make an escape, they have many devices to finde and fetch him again. They have store of searchers, to whom besides the common signes, they give his lively picture, whereby they may easily know him:<note place="margin">Their Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars.</note> An Italian at <hi>Rome</hi> having wounded an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parator, fled to <hi>Sivil</hi>: the Familiars were sent to seek him, and when they had found him, though they had his counterfeit, yet by reason that he had altered his habit, they were doubtful whether it was he or no, the rather because he had changed his name, whereupon they followed him only upon suspicion: but one day as he was walking, and earnestly
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:41459:118"/>
talking with some Gentlemen, two of these Familiars suddenly called him by his old name: The Party earnest in talk, and not minding it, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed behinde him, and made answer, whereupon they presently apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, clapt him in irons for a long time, then whipt him, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to the Gallies during his life. So soone as any is arrested by the Familiars, they take from him all the keyes of his locks or chests whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and then they take an Inventory of all his goods, leaving them with some man that will undertake to be accountable for them: but in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questring and rifling the houses, if they have any gold, silver, or Jewels, these Familiars,<note place="margin">Sequestration.</note> which usually are bawds, theeves, shifters, and the vilest of people, will be sure to filch some of it; and the reason of this seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration is, that if the Party be condemned, the holy Inquisition may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his whole estate.</p>
                  <p>As soone as the Prisoner is entred within the first gate of the Prison, the Jailor asketh him if he have a knife about him, or money, or ring, or Jewels;<note place="margin">Stript of all in prison.</note> and if a woman, whether she hath knives, rings, chains, brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, or other ornaments, and all these the Jailor strips them of as his fee: And this is done that the poor prisoners may have nothing to relieve themselves with, during their imprisonment; They search them also to see whether they have any writing or book about them, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they take from them: then they shut them up in a Cabin, like to a little-ease, where they have little room for cleanlinesse, and but little light.</p>
                  <p>Some are thus kept all alone for two or three moneths, some as long as they live, others have company, as the Lords Inquisitors please. When the Party hath been in prison a week or two, the Jailor perswades him to petition for a day of hearing, telling him the sooner the better, and that it will much further his cause,<note place="margin">Subtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then pretending to shew him favour, they appoint him an Advocate to blind the peoples eyes, as if they proceeded according to the rules of Justice; but this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate dares not tell his Client any point of Law, that may do him good, for fear of angring the Inquisitors; neither may he speak privately with his Client, but either before an Inquisitor, or a Notary.</p>
                  <p>Two or three dayes after the Party hath had the Copy of his accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is called into the Court, where his Advocate is, as if he intended to defend his cause; but indeed he dare say nothing to the purpose for fear of angring the Inquisitors; only he chears up his Client, and bids him tell the truth in any case, as the only way to prevail in that Court, and then is the Prisoner sent back again who hopes that now his cause will be heard, and his businesse dispatched, whereas usually these good fathers let him lie, two, three, or four years in prison, without ever calling for him again; and if through loathsomnesse and intolerablenesse of the prison any sue to come to hearing, it may be with much ado he obtains it, but usually that favour is denied him: yet at length when they please, they call for him to hear the depositions of the witnesses against him: which yet is not done till the poor Prisoner by his grievous imprisonment is brought so low, as that they think he will rather choose death than such a life, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41459:119"/>
therefore will be willing to tell all, that so he may be rid out of his mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Then between rebuking and a gentle admonition, they tell him, that though he hath stood out so long, yet at length they would have him wiser to confesse the truth; but if he yet refuse to be his own accuser, then the Fiscal produceth the depositions, which are delivered to the Prisoner, but they are drawn up so intricately and ambiguously, that he knows not what to make of them; and this they do to conceal the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, lest he should except against them, and to set him on guessing, that so if he chance to reckon up any others to whom he spake any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any of those matters, they may thereby get more grists to their mill. For they presently out-law such persons as favourers of hereticks, for suffering an heretick to sow such pestilent seeds amongst them, without complaining thereof to the Inquisitors.</p>
                  <p>The Keeper of the Prison also is examined what he hath seen and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served of him in the Prison, and his testimony is as good as two witnesses to take away the Prisoners life.</p>
                  <p>They have also Promoters to bring in accusations, who are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though frantick Bedlams, or the veriest Varlets that be: and in their informations, if they chance to want words of weight, the Inquisitors will help them out, and prompt them word by word. Then after three or four dayes the Prisoner is called again to put in his answer to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions; but in the <hi>interim</hi> his Advocate never comes at him to assist or direct him, but he is left to himself without all help, save of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. His answer being viewed, he is remanded to prison again with this <hi>Item,</hi> that if he confesse not the truth, they will extort it out of him by extremity.</p>
                  <p>After two or three moneths more, he is called for once again, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to speak what he hath for himself, or else they must draw to an end: and if he still shrinks not, but stands firme in his own Justification, they proceed to other dealings, in comparison of which all their former proceedings are not only sufferable, but seeme very reasonable and full of gentlenesse. For their future actions farre exceed all barbarousnesse, the Devil himself being not able to go beyond them in their monstrous ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny: For not long after the Prisoner is called in before the Inquisitors, who tell him that they have deeply considered his whole case, and found out that he doth not declare the whole truth, and therefore they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved that he shall be racked, that by force they may draw from him what by fair means he will not acknowledge: and therefore they advise him rather to do it voluntarily, and thereby to avoid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the paine and peril that yet attends him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet whether he confesse or not confesse, all is one, for to the Rack he must go; Then is he led into the place where the Rack standeth,<note place="margin">They proceed to the Rack.</note> which is a deep and dark dungeon under ground, with many a door to passe through ere a man come to it, because the shreekes and cries of the tormented should not be heard: then the Inquisitors set themselves upon a scaffold hard by the Rack, and the torches being light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Executioner comes in, all araied from top to toe in a sute of black canvas, his head is covered with a long black hood that covereth all his

face, having only two peep-holes for his eyes: which sight doth more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright the poor soul, to see one in the likenesse of the Devil to be his tormentor. The Lords being set in their places, they begin again to exhort him to speak the truth freely and voluntarily: Then with sharp words they command him to be stripped stark naked, yea though the modestest maid, or chasest Matron in the City:<note place="margin">Their privy parts a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Party being thus stripped, the Inquisitors signifie to the Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how they would have him or her ordered. The first kind of torment is the Jeobit, or Pully; but first one comes behind him, and binds his hands with a cord eight or ten times about, the Inquisitors calling upon him to strain each harder than other; they cause also his thumbs to be bound extream hard with a small line, and so both hands and thumbs are fastened to a Pully, which hangs on the Jeobit:<note place="margin">The Jeobit.</note> then they put great and heavy bolts on his heels, and hang upon those bolts, between his feet certain weights of iron, and so hoise him, or her up from the ground; and whilst the poor wretch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hangs in this plight, they begin to exhort him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to accuse himself, and as many others as he knows of; Then they command him to be hoised up higher to the very beam till his head touch the Pully. Having hung thus a good while,<note place="margin">Inhumane cruelty.</note> they command him to be let down, and twice so much weight to be fastened to his heels, and so hoised up again, and one inch higher if it may be: Then they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the hangman to let him up and down, that the weights of the iron hanging at his heels may rent every joynt in his body asunder. With which intolerable pains if the Party shreek or cry out, they roare out as loud to him to confesse the truth, or else he shall come down with a vengeance. Then they bid the hangman suddenly to slip the rope, that he may fall down with a sway, and in the mid-way to stop; then give him the <hi>Strappado,</hi> which being as soon done, it rends all his body out of joynt, armes, shoulders, back, legs, &amp;c. by reason of the sudden jerk, and the weights hanging at his legs. If he yet remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, they adde more weight to his heels the third time, and the poor wretch already half dead is hoisted up the third time, and to encrease his misery, they raile upon him, calling him Dog, and Heretick, telling him that he is like there to make his end.<note place="margin">Rail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if the Party desire to be let down, promising to tell somewhat, that's the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:41459:120"/>
done they command him to be haled up again, and to be let down as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: so that usually these torments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are exercised upon him for three hours together. Then they ask the Jailor if his other torments are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to affright the poor soul; the Jailor answereth that they are ready, but he hath not brought them with him: Then the Inquisitors bid him to bring them against the morrow; for say they, we will try other ways to get the truth out of this fellow: and so turning to him that lies in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable pain, having all his joynts out; How now, Sirra, say they, how like you this gear? have you enough of it yet? Well, see that you call your wits to you against to morrow, or look to die then; for what you have yet felt is but a flea-biting in comparison of what is behind; and so they depart.<note place="margin">Threats.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Jailor plays the bone-setter so well as he can, setting his joynts, and so carries him back to prison, or drags him by the armes or legs most pitifully; If they mean to rack him no more, after two or three dayes they send for him again, and cause him to be brought by the Rack, where the hangman stands in the likenesse of a Devil as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the more to affright him. When he comes before the Inquisitors, they fall a perswading him to confesse the truth at last: and if he confesse any thing, he may chance to go to the Rack again, whereby they hope to extort more; and when indeed they intend to rack the Party again, then at three dayes end, when the ach in his joynts is most grievous and painful to him, they send for him, requiring him to declare all his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and to peach all such as he hath had conference with, about them, and all such as he knows to be of that minde: or else he must prepare himself for the Rack; and if he continue constant, he is again stripped of his cloths, and hoisted up with weights at his heels as before, besides which,<note place="margin">Another cruel tormen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yea sometimes they proceed to another kind of torture called the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selli,</hi> which is after this manner; There is a piece of timber somewhat hollowed on the top like a trough,<note place="margin">The trough.</note> about the middle whereof there is a sharp barre going a crosse, whereon a mans back resteth that it cannot go to the bottom: its also placed so that his heels shall lie higher than his head: then is the naked Party laid thereon: his armes, thighs and legs bound with strong small cords, and wrested with short truncheons, till the cords pierce almost to the very bone.<note place="margin">Divellish cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> Then they take a thick fine lawn cloth, laying it over the Parties mouth as he lies upright on his back, so that it may stop his nostrils also; then taking a quantity of water, they pour it in a long stream like a threed, which falling from on high, drives the cloth down into his throat, which puts the poor wretch into as great an Agony as any endure in the pains of death, for in this torture he
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41459:120"/>
hath not liberty to draw his breath, the water stopping his mouth, and the cloth his nostrils, so that when the cloth is drawn out of the bottome of his throat, it draws forth blood with it, and a man would think that it tore out his very bowels. This is iterated as oft as the Inquisitors please, and yet they threaten him with worse torments if he confesse not; and so he is returned to his prison again.</p>
                  <p>Yet many times after he hath lain there a moneth or two, he is brought again to the rack and used as before, yea sometimes five or six times, even as oft as they please, for their lust is a law.<note place="margin">Torment with fire.</note> And yet they have another torment with fire, which is no whit inferiour to the former; They take a Pan of burning charcole, and set it just over against the soles of the Parties feet, just before he goes to the Rack, and that the fire may have the more force upon them, they bast them with lard or bacon. But if all the extremity of torments wil not force him to confesse what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, nor to deny the truth, they use other means by subtil interrogatories,<note place="margin">Subtilty.</note> and frequent questionings to draw him into some snare or other: Yea, if yet they cannot prevaile, then some one of the Inquisitors comes to him in private, and shews himself much affected with his misery, weeps with him, comforts him, gives him advice, seems to impart such a secret to him as he would scarce impart to his father, or dearest friend alive: and this they use most with women, whereas they are but faire baits upon deadly hooks, whereby they seek to destroy them; whereof we have this example.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Sivil</hi> there were apprehended, a godly Matron, two of her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and her Neece,<note place="margin">A woman, and her tow daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and neece.</note> who all of them underwent the forementioned torments with manly courage and Christian constancie, because they would not betray each other, nor other godly Persons in that City. Then one of the Inquisitors sent for the youngest maid oft to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, pretended much compassion towards her, spake much to comfort her, told her what a grief it was to him to see her torments; then used fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and pleasant communication to her, then told her that he would advise her the best way to free her self,<note place="margin">A Judas.</note> mother and sister from these troubles: That he would undertake the ordering of their businesse; and then perswaded her to disclose the whole truth to him, and he bound himself with an oath that he would stop all further proceedings against them, and procure their dismission. Having thus outwitted the poor maid, who gave too much credit to him, she told him of some points of Religion which they had wont to confer of amongst themselves, and so when he had gotten out of her what possibly he could, like a perfidious Villain, contrary to his vows, promises, and oath,<note place="margin">Perjury.</note> he caused her to be racked again to get more out of her, yea they put her also to the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pain of the trough, and through extremity of pangs and torments they at last extorted from her a betraying of her own Mother, Sisters, and divers others, which were immediately apprehended, tortured, and at last burnt with fire. But when they were brought in great pomp upon the Scaffold, and had the sentence of death passed upon them, this maid went to her Aunt, who had instructed her in the principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41459:121"/>
and boldly without change of countenance, gave her hearty thanks for that great benefit which she had received by her means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating her to pardon her for what she had offended her at any time, for that she was now to depart out of this life. Her Aunt comforted her stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bid her be of good cheere, for that now ere long they should be with Christ. This woman was openly whipt, and kept in prison during her life; the rest were all presently burned.</p>
                  <p>Another device that they have is this: when they think that Prisoners which are together do talk together of Religion, exhorting and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another as they have occasion or opportunity, the Inquisitors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to prison under a colour,<note place="margin">Flie.</note> a crafty knave whom they call a Flie: who after two or three dayes will cunningly insinuate himself into the bosoms of the other Prisoners, and then pretending a great deal of zeal to Religion, he will proffer discourse to them, and by degrees get out of their mouths something whereof he may accuse them. Then doth he move for a day of hearing, and so getting to the Inquisitors, he peaches the Prisoners, who shall be sure afterwards to hear of it to their smart. Yea these Flies, as soone as they are out of one prison, for the hope of gain, will be content presently to be put into another, and then into a third, where they will lie in chains, as the other Prisoners do, enduring hunger, cold, stink, and the loathsomnesse of prison, and all to betray others. And this mans accusation is as strong and valid as the testimony of any other witnesse whatsoever. Other Flies also there be that serve the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inquisition abroad, slily insinuating themselves into the companies of the common people, who are suspected to be <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and when they can pump any thing out of them, they presently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray them. They have yet this other device, when they can catch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man that is noted for Religion, or a Minister that hath instructed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, after he hath been in prison awhile, they give it out that upon the Rack he hath discovered all his disciples, and acquaintance, and they suborn others to averr that they heard it, and this they do to draw the simple people to come of their own accord, and to confesse their faults to the Inquisitors, and to crave pardon, whereupon they promise them favour.</p>
                  <p>The Inquisitors and their Officers use to call their Prisoners Dogs and Hereticks:<note place="margin">Their cruel prisons.</note> and indeed they use them much worse than most men do their Dogs. For first, the place where usually each of them is laid, by reason of the straitnesse, ill air, and dampnesse of the earth, is liker a grave than a prison: and if it be a loft, in the hot weather, it is like a hot Oven or Fornace: and in each of these holes usually two or three are thronged together, so that they have no more room than to lie down in; in one corner is a stool of easement, and a pitcher of water to quench their thirsts. In these Cels they have no light, but what comes in at the Key-hole, or some small crany: other some there are much worse, not being long enough for a man to lie in, so that such as are put into them, never likely come out till they be half rotted away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or die of a consumption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:41459:121"/>
Their diet is answerable to their lodging: The rich pay large fees to the holy house, and every Prisoner is rated as the Inquisitors please: but such as are poor, the King allows them three pence a day, out of which the Steward, Landresse, and some other necessary charges are deducted, so that one half of it comes not to the Prisoners share; and if any be moved with compassion to relieve them, it is counted such an hainous offence, that it will cost him a scourging till blood come at least.</p>
                  <p>It once happened that there was a Keeper appointed for their prison, in the Castle of <hi>Triana</hi> in <hi>Sivil,</hi> that was of a courteous disposition by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who used the Prisoners well, and closely, for fear of the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, shewed them some favour: at which time there was a godly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron and her two daughters committed to prison, which being put into several rooms, had a great desire to see each other for their mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in their distresses; whereupon they besought the Keeper to suffer them to come together, if it were but for one quarter of an hour: the Keepe yielded, and so they were together about half an hour, and then returned to their former prisons. Within a few dayes after, these women being racked in a terrible manner, the Keeper fearing lest they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that little favour which he had shewed them, of his own accord went to the Inquisitors, confessed his fact, and craved pardon; but they deemed this so hainous an offence, that they presently commanded him to be haled to prison, where by reason of the extremity shewed him, he fell mad. Yet this procured him no favour: for after he had been a whole year in a vile prison, they brought him upon their triumphing stage,<note place="margin">All pity denied them.</note> with a <hi>Sambenito</hi> upon him, and a rope about his neck, and there they censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to be whipt about the City, and to have two hundred stripes, and then to serve in the Gallies for six years. The next day one of his mad fits coming upon him, as he was set on an Asses back to be scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, he threw himself off, snatched a sword out of the officers hand, and had slain him, if the people had not immediately laid hold on him; whereupon he was bound faster on the Asses back, had his two hundred stripes, and was for this offence condemned four years longer to the Gallies.</p>
                  <p>Another Keeper at another time had a maid, who seeing how mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably the prisoners were used, pitying their distressed condition, who were hunger-starved, and almost pined, she would sometimes speak to them at the grate, exhort and comfort them as well as she could,<note place="margin">A maid whipt for shewing them favour.</note> and sometimes would help them to some good and wholsome food: yea, by her means the Prisoners came to understand one anothers condition, which was a great comfort to them. But this at last coming to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors ears, they enjoyned her to wear the <hi>Sambenito,</hi> to be whipped about the streets, to receive two hundred stripes, and to be banished the City for ten years, with this writing on her head, <hi>A favourer, and aider of Hereticks.</hi> And whereas all other sort of persons in prison and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage are allowed to recreate and refresh themselves with singing at their pleasure,<note place="margin">The prisoners denied leave to sing Psalmes.</note> these poor souls are forbidden this small solace in their great misery: for if any of them sing a Psalm, or openly recite any portion of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:41459:122"/>
Scripture, the Inquisitors take it very hainously, and presently send to them, requiring them to be silent, upon the pain of Excommunication: and if the prisoner make light of this warning, he shall have a bit set on his tongue to teach him obedience: and this they do, both to deprive the poor souls of all kind of solace, and to keep other Prisoners from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how their friends do: So that it often falls out that a man and his friend, the Father and Sonne, yea the husband and wife shall be in one prison-house two or three years together, and not know of each others being there till they meet upon the scaffold upon the great day of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
                  <p>By reason of this cruel usage many of the Prisoners die, some, of their torments, others, of the stink of the prison, and others, of diseases contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by hunger, cold, ill diet, &amp;c. They have also an Hospital, unto which they remove such as fall sick in their prisons,<note place="margin">Their hospital</note> where yet they are not dealt more gently with in any thing, save that they have Physick al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them for their healths sake: But none are suffered to come to them but the Physician, and the servants of the Hospital: And as soon as the Patient is on the mending hand, he is carried back to the place whence he came.</p>
                  <p>If the Prisoner be half naked, or want something to lie on, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon pray the Inquisitor that his necessity may be considered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The answer which he receives is this, <hi>Well, now the weather is warm, you may live full well without either cloaths or couch</hi>; And if it be winter time, his answer is: <hi>True, it hath been a great frost of late, but now the cold is come down again, and it will be more seasonable weather.

                  <p>The last act of the Tragedy remaineth, wherein both Parties are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and have their desire;<note place="margin">Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</note> the Inquisitors in obtaining their prey, the Prisoners in finding some end of their miserable usage; but two or three dayes before the solemnity, they use severally to call before them, all such whose estates are confiscated, examining them what lands or goods they have, where they lie, charging them upon great penalties not to conceal one jot, telling them, that if any thing be afterwards found, felony shall be laid to their charge, and he with whom it is found, shall pay foundly for it, and when all is confessed, they are returned to prison a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>The night before the Festival, they cause all the Prisoners to be
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:41459:122"/>
brought into a large roome, where they are informed of the several kinds of pennances that they are to do the next day: The next morning very early, the Familiars come and attire the Prisoners in their several habits, in which they are to appear before the people:<note place="margin">Their habits.</note> Some in <hi>Sambe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito's,</hi> which is a long garment painted all over with ugly devils: on his head he hath an high-crown'd hat whereon a man is painted burning in the fire, with many devils about him, plying him with fire and fagots. Besides, their tongues have a cleft piece of wood put upon them, which nips, and pincheth them that they cannot speak; they have about their necks, cords, and their hands fast bound behind them. On this sort come these constant Martyrs disguised, first to the stage, and then to the stake; and in the like sort do all the rest come forth, arraied as the other, and set forth with the like notes of infamy, either more or lesse, as the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors please to disgrace them in the sight of the people. On each hand of every Prisoner goeth a Familiar, all armed, to guard him: as also two Friars with every one that is to die, who perswade him tooth and nail to deny that doctrine that formerly he hath professed, now at their going out of this world; which wicked importunity is a great grief to the poor servants of Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>The Inquisitors also passe in great pomp from the Castle of <hi>Triana</hi> to their scaffold: And when all are set in their places, a Sermon begins, framed on purpose in commendations of the holy house, and in confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such Heriticks as are presently to suffer: but the greatest part is spent in slanderous reproaches, wherewith they vilifie and disgrace the truth, and the Professors of it. The Sermon being ended, the sentences against the Prisoners are read; First, against such as have easiest punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and so in order to the greater; Which sentences are commonly these, Death without mercy; Whipping in such extremity that the Persons seldome escape with their lives; Condemnation to the Gally; Forfeiture of all their estates, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Then doth the chief Inquisitor absolve all such as have forsaken Christ, and are come home to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from all the errours for which they shewed themselves penitent; but though hereby they are absolved from the fault, yet not from the punishment; for notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Recantation, they must abide the punishment without mercy.</p>
                  <p>And whereas multitudes of people resort to this spectacle, some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming twenty Leagues to see it; The Inquisitors have this trick to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their Kingdome, They cause all the people present,<note place="margin">A wicked oath</note> to take an oath to live and die in the service of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hazarding both life and goods against any that shall oppose it; as also to their power, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and maintain the holy Inquisition, and to defend all the officers thereof, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Then if there be any amongst the Prisoners to be degraded, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed after this manner.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:41459:123"/>
knife till they bleed again, to scrape off the holy oyle, wherewith he was anointed at his ordination. In the end of their sentence which is pronounced upon such as are to be burned, they use this abominable hypocrisie: They bequeath him to the secular power, with this humble request to them,<note place="margin">Hypocrisie.</note> to shew the Prisoner as much favour as may be, and neither to break any bone, nor pierce the skin of his body: This shews their great impudence, that having already given sentence on him to be burned, they yet should pretend such mercy and clemency towards him, whom all along themselves have used with such extream cruelty.</p>
                  <p>They use also this trick further, that in reading the crimes for which he is condemned, they do not only misreport such things as he confessed upon his examination, but they devilishly father upon him such things as he never spake, or thought of in all his life: and this they do to disgrace him, and to make him and his opinions more abhorred of all men, and to encrease their own estimation and credit, as being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary officers to rid the world of such pestilent persons; and all this while the Prisoners tongue hath a cleft piece of wood upon it to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable pain and grief, that he cannot answer for himself, nor gainsay that they charge him with.</p>
                  <p>All these things being finished, the Magistrate takes them into his hand, and conveys them presently to the place of execution, with divers instruments of Satan about them, calling and crying to them to forsake the truth; and when they cannot prevail, after the Prisoner is tied to the stake, they break his neck in a trice, and then they report amongst the common people that they recanted their heresies at the last houre,<note place="margin">Abominable lyes.</note> and so came home to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore they felt no pain in the fire at all, which made them take it so patiently.</p>
                  <p>Such as are not condemned to die, are carried back to prison, and the next day brought out to be whipt, after which some of them are sent to the Gallies, others kept in prison all their life time: but all have this special charge given them,<note place="margin">Their cruelty concealed.</note> that they never speak of any thing that they have heard, seen, or felt, during their imprisonment in the Inquisition; for if the contrary be ever proved against them, and that they utter any of their secrets, they shall be taken for persons relapsed, and be punished with greatest severity, their judgement being death without Redemption; and hereby they keep in all their Knavery and Tyranny close and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to themselves: And if any of them be released because their faults were but small, they are yet so careful lest their cruelty should come to light, that they inhibit them the company or conference with any other, than such as they shall appoint and allow them; neither will they suffer them to write to any friend, except they first have the perusing of their letters.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes also, after they have imprisoned men in such a miserable state, for a year or two, and can extort nothing out of them by their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor prove any thing against them by witnesse, so that they must necessarily dismisse them, they then call them into the Court, and begin to flatter them, and tell them what a good opinion they have of them, and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:41459:123"/>
that they are resolved to send them home, for the which fatherly favour extended towards them in saving their lives &amp; goods,<note place="margin">Flattery.</note> they are to account themselves much beholding to their Lordships, &amp;c. And so at last they dismisse him with special charge of silence: and when he is gone, they have special Spies abroad to see how he takes the matter; and if they find that he complains of his punishments, or discloses their secrets, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently commence a new suit against him. On a time the Inquisitors at <hi>Sivill</hi> apprehended a noble Lady; the cause was, for that a Sister of hers,<note place="margin">A Lady impri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>soned.</note> a very vertuous Virgin, who was afterwards burned for Religion, had confessed in the extremity of her torments, that she had sometimes had conference with this her sister about matters of Religion: This Lady when she was first apprehended, was gone with child about six months, in respect whereof they did not shut her up so close at first, nor deal so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely with her as they did with others; But within foure dayes after she was brought to bed, they took the child from her; and the seventh day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The maid was scarce recovered when the Lady was carried out to be served with the same sauce, and was so terribly tormented in the trough,<note place="margin">They torment her in the trough.</note> that by reason of the strait straining of the strings, piercing to the very bones of her armes, thighs and shins, she was brought back half dead to her prison, the blood gushing out of her mouth abundantly, which shewed that something was broken within her: but after eight dayes the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered her from these cruel Tygers by taking her mercifully to himself.<note place="margin">She dyed.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon one of their dayes of triumph there was brought out one <hi>John Pontio,</hi> of a noble Family, a zealous Professor of the truth,<note place="margin">

                     </note> and one of an holy and blamelesse life, and well learned; he was eminent also in works of charity, in which he had spent a great part of his estate: Being apprehended for the Profession of the Gospel, he was cast into Prison, where he manfully maintained the truth in the midst of all their cruel dealings with him; At last they cast into prison to him one of their flyes, who by his subtilty and craft, so wrought upon him that he drew from him a promise to yield obedience to the Romish Church.<note place="margin">Humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> But though God suffered him to fall a while to shew him his frailty, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in much mercy he raised him up again with double strength to that which he had before, and before his execution he manfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the truth against a subtil Friar. The things which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for, were these; That he should say,<note place="margin">Recovery.</note> that from his heart he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred the idolatry which was committed in worshipping the Host: That he removed his houshold from place to place, that he might shun

coming to the Masse: That the Justification of a Christian resteth only in the merits of Jesus Christ apprehended by faith, &amp;c. That there was no Purgatory: That the Popes pardons were of no value, &amp;c. <hi>And for my self,</hi>

                     </note> but by his diligent study of the Scripture it pleased God to reveal his truth to him, so that he became a zealous Preacher of it, labouring in all his Sermons to beat into mens minds the true way, and means of our Justification to consist in Christ alone, and in stedfast faith in him:<note place="margin">Tormented in prison,</note> for which he was apprehended and cast into prison, where he endured all their cruely with a Christian courage; At last with two of his Sisters he was condemned: His mother and one of his brothers were also imprisoned with him for the truth, and executed shortly after: When he with his sisters went out at the Castle gate, having his tongue at liberty, he began to sing the 106. Psalm before all the People, who had oft heard him make many godly Sermons: He also condemned all hypocrites as the worst sort of People:<note place="margin">with a cleft stick.</note> Whereupon they stocked his tongue: Upon the stage he never changed countenance, nor was at all daunted. When they all came to the stake, they had their tongues loosed, and were commanded to say their Creed, which they did chearfully: when they came to those words, <hi>The holy Catholick Church,</hi> They were commanded to adde, <hi>Of Rome,</hi> but that they all refused: whereupon their necks were broken in a trice: and then't was noised abroad that they had added those words, and died, confessing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the true Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>There was in <hi>Sivil</hi> a private Congregation of Gods people, most of which the Inquisitors consumed in the fire,<note place="margin">A Church in <hi>Sivil.</hi>
                     </note> as they could discover any of them; amongst others that were apprehended, they took four women, famous above the rest for their holy and godly conversation, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the youngest of them, who was not above one and twenty years old, who by her diligent and frequent reading of the Scriptures, and by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with godly and learned men, had attained to a very great measure of knowledge: so that whilst she was in Prison, she non-plus'd and put to shame many of those Friars that came to seduce her.</p>

other Prisoners: The young maid especially came with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and cheerful countenance, as it were triumphing over the Inquisitors, and having her tongue at liberty, she began to sing Psalms to God, whereupon the Inquisitors caused her tongue to be nipped by setting a Barnacle upon it: After sentence read,<note place="margin">A cleft stick.</note> they were carried to the place of execution, where with much constancy and courage they ended their lives: Yet the Inquisitors not satisfied herewith,<note place="margin">Their death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

There was also apprehended another worthy member of the same Congregation called <hi>Ferdinando</hi>;<note place="margin">Ferdinando.</note> he was of a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent spirit, and very zealous in doing good: A young man, but for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of life very famous: He had spent eight years in educating of youth, and had endeavoured to sow the seeds of Piety in the hearts of his Scholars, as much as lay in him to do in a time of so great persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and tyranny; being at the last apprehended for a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> he was cast into prison, and terribly tormented upon the <hi>Jeobit,</hi> and in the <hi>Trough,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His torments.</note> whereby he was so shaken in every joynt, that when he was taken down, he was not able to move any part of his body; yet did those cruel tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors draw him by the heels into his prison, as if he had been a dead dog: But notwithstanding all his torments,<note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> he answered the Inquisitors very stoutly, and would not yield to them one jot. During his impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment God used him as an instrument to recal and confirme a Monk, who had been cast into prison for confessing the Gospel openly: But by means of the Inquisitors flatteries and fair promises he had somewhat relented: Gods Providence so ordering it,<note place="margin">Humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</note> that <hi>Ferdinando</hi> was cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same prison, and finding the Monk wavering, he rebuked him sharply; and afterwards having drawn him to a sight of, and sorrow for his sinne, he at last strengthned him in the promises of free grace and mercy; Hereupon the Monk desired a day of hearing, where, before the Inquisitors, he solemnly renounced his recantation,<note place="margin">Recovery.</note> desiring that his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer confession might stand, whereupon the sentence of death passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them both: after which the Inquisitors asked <hi>Ferdinando</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would revoke his former heresies; to which he answered, <hi>That he had professed nothing but what was agreeable to the pure and perfect Word of God, and ought to be the profession of every Christian man, and therefore he would stick to it to the death</hi>:<note place="margin">Execution.</note> Then did they clap a Barnacle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his tongue, and so they were burned together.</p>
                  <p>There was also one <hi>Juliano,</hi> called, <hi>The little,</hi> because he was of a small and weak body, who going into <hi>Germany,</hi> was there conversant with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers learned and godly men,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Juliano.</hi>
                     </note> by which means he attained to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, and became a zealous Professor of it, and earnestly long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the salvation of his Countreymen,<note place="margin">Zeale.</note> he undertook a very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous work, which was to convey two great dry Fats full of Bibles printed in <hi>Spanish,</hi> into his own Countrey: In this attempt he had much cause of fear, the Inquisitors had so stopped every Port,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>A</hi> special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> and kept such strict watch, to prevent the coming in of all such commodities; but
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:41459:125"/>
through Gods mighty protection, he brought his burden safely thither, and, which was almost miraculous, he conveyed them safe into <hi>Sivil,</hi> notwithstanding the busie searchers and catch-poles that watched in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very corner. These Bibles being dispersed, were most joyfully and thankfully received, and through Gods blessing wrought wonderfully amongst Gods people to ripen them against the time of harvest. But at last the matter broke out by the means of a false brother, who going to the Inquisitors played the <hi>Judas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A false brother.</note> and betrayed the whole Church to them. So that there were taken at <hi>Sivil</hi> at one time, eight hundred Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,<note place="margin">Twenty burnt.</note> whereof twenty of them were afterwards roasted at one fire.</p>
                  <p>Amongst these, this <hi>Juliano</hi> was one of the first that was apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and sent to prison, where he lay without any company laden with irons above three years; yet was his constancy so great and wonderful, that the tormentors themselves were sooner wearied in inflicting,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Juliano</hi>'s tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and constancy.</note> than he in suffering torments; and notwithstanding his weak and wearyish body, yet he remained undaunted in mind in undergoing all their tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, so that he never departed from the rack more dejected than he came to it; neither threatnings, nor pains, nor torments made him shrink or yield one jot to them: but when he was drawn back to his prison, he would tell his fellows how he had conquered and confounded his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, saying, <hi>They depart vanquished, they depart vanquished; The wolves flie with shame, they flie with shame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the day of their triumph, when he was brought out to be apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (with his other fellow Prisoners) in all their shameful habits, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them with a cheerful countenance, saying: <hi>My Brethren, be of good cheere, this is the houre wherein we must be faithful witnesses unto God and his truth before men, as becomes the true servants and souldiers of Christ, and ere long we shall have him to witnesse with us again: and within a few houres we shall triumph with him in heaven for ever</hi>; But hereupon they presently clap't a Barnacle upon his tongue that he should speak no more, and so he was led to his execution;<note place="margin">His death.</note> but though he could not speak, yet by his countenance and gestures he shewed his cheerful and quiet minde: Then kneeling down, he kissed the step whereon he stood, and being tyed to the stake, he endeavoured by his looks and gestures to encourage his fellow Martyrs in their sufferings, and so they quietly and patiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed up their spirits unto God.</p>
                  <p>There was also <hi>John Leon,</hi> a Tailor by Trade, who out of a blinde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to serve God,<note place="margin">

                     </note>There was also in <hi>Sivil</hi> one <hi>Arias,</hi> a man of a sharp wit and well-stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died in Divinity, but withal of a crafty wit and inconstant nature; which vices he yet covered with a cloke of Religion, whereby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived many: About this time there were also in that City two sorts of Preachers, and both had a great number of Auditors: The one taught School-Divinity, and were continually calling upon their hearers to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fastings, mortification, self-denial, frequency of Prayer, humility, &amp;c. But themselves practised nothing lesse than these things: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all their Religion consisted in works and bodily exercises, as run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Masses, hallowed places, shrift, &amp;c. The other sort dealt more sincerely with the holy Scriptures: out of which they declared what was true righteousnesse, and perfect holinesse: by means whereof that City above all others in <hi>Spain,</hi> bore the name for just and true dealing; and it pleased God that the brightnesse of this light did discover all the counterfeit holinesse, and Pharasaical devotion of the other party; The chief Labourers in this harvest were <hi>Constantino, Aegidius,</hi> and <hi>Varquius,</hi> all Doctors, and sober, wise, and learned men; who by this kind of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing procured to themselves many enemies; but above all others, <hi>Arias</hi> was the most spiteful and malicious;<note place="margin">He turns perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor.</note> yet he carried it so cunningly, that he still kept up his reputation with these men; but it was not long before he discovered himself: and that upon this occasion; There was one <hi>Ruzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> a learned man, questioned before the Inquisitors, for something that he had delivered in a Sermon about the Controversies in Religion; The Inquisitors appointed him a day of hearing; and two or three days before, <hi>Arias</hi> met him, saluted him courteously, and discoursed familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him; then did he pump out of him, all those Arguments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he intended to defend himself before the Inquisitors: When the day came, and <hi>Ruzius</hi> appeared, <hi>Arias</hi> went on that side where his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents were, which much amated <hi>Ruzius,</hi> and in the disputation, <hi>Arias</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared, did so wittily enervate all his Arguments, that <hi>Ruzius</hi> had nothing to say for himself, and so was fain to yield the cause, and <hi>Arias</hi> went away with the honour of the field, though he got it by treachery. Yet did this <hi>Arias,</hi> being of Saint <hi>Isidores</hi> Monastery, preach so practical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a great light began to dawn in that dark place; for the whole scope of his Sermons was to overthrow all their Profession; he taught
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:41459:126"/>
them that singing and saying of their Prayers day and night was no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, that the holy Scriptures were to be read and studied with diligence, whence alone the true service of God could be drawn, and which alone teach us the true obedience to his Will, to the obtaining whereof we must use Prayer as a means, proceeding as well from a sense and feeling of our own infirmities, as grounded upon a perfect trust and confidence in God.</p>
                  <p>By laying these foundations, through Gods blessing, he began to make them out of love with their Monkish Superstition, and much provoked them to the study of the holy Scriptures. Besides also his Sermons, he read daily a lecture upon <hi>Solomons Proverbs</hi> very learnedly, and made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication thereof with good judgement and discretion; also in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conference he did much good. The Lord also so ordered it in his wisdome, that he met with Schollers that were very tractable, such as were not greatly wedded to their Superstitions. And such was the force and might of Gods Election, that these few good seeds so fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that in the end they brought forth a great encrease of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. For divers of the Monks, that hereby had their consciences awakened and cleared to see their former hypocrisie and idolatry, sought out for further instructions, and, through Gods mercy, they light upon those Preachers which taught the truth with more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity:<note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> of whom they learned the Principles of pure and perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, so that by degrees they left that evil opinion which they had formerly conceived against the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and were desirous to read their books: And God miraculously provided for them, that they had all sorts of books brought them that were extant at that time, either in <hi>Geneva</hi> or <hi>Germany</hi>: whereby it came to passe that there were very few in all that cloister but they had some taste of true Religion and Godlinesse, so that instead of mumbling their mattens, they brought in Divinity-lectures, &amp;c. Vain fasting was turned into Christian sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, neither were any taught to be Monkish, but to be sincerely and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religious.</p>
                  <p>But considering that when this should be once known they could not live in any safety, they resolved amongst themselves to forsake their nest, and to flie into <hi>Germany,</hi> where they might enjoy more safety of their lives, and freedome of their consciences; But how to get thither was all the difficulty; If one or two should go first, the rest would be exposed to danger: if many should go together, a thousand to one but they would be taken again, being to travel from the furthest part of <hi>Spaine</hi> into <hi>Germany:</hi> yet upon debate they concluded, that they must all ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speedily depart, or shortly be apprehended by the Inquisitors, who now had got some inkling of the matter; And God seeing them in this distresse, shewed them a means how, under an honest pretence, a dozen of them might depart together within a month, and each betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a several way towards <hi>Geneva,</hi> where they appointed, by Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, all to meet within a twelve month; The rest which were but young novices were left behind, who yet not long after were so

                  <p>The aforementioned servants of Jesus Christ forsook that place where they lived in honour, ease and plenty, and by undertaking, for Christs sake, a voluntary exile, exposed themselves to shame, ignominy, wants, yea and were in continual danger of their lives also: And under God, <hi>Arias</hi> was a great means of this, who, by his ministry, had first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned them with the knowledge of the truth: for which he was often complained of to the Inquisitors, and was convented before them, where he so cunningly answered the matter, that he was still dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; But his last apprehension, through the mercy of God, brought forth in him the fruits of true repentance; for he did so deeply and unfainedly bewail, and repent of his former with-holding of the truth in unrighteousnesse,<note place="margin">

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41459:127"/>
so arrogantly: But having passed over some time, it so fell out that he met with a plain man, which gave him such instructions, that after a few hours conference he learned by him what the office and duty of a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was, and by what means he might attain thereto; and, through Gods blessing, his advice was so effectual, that now Dr. <hi>Aegidio</hi> was quite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and become a new man, thinking all his former life and labour ill spent, and therefore he resolved to steer another course; He also fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to acquaintance with Doctor <hi>Constantino,</hi> a man excellently well learned, by whose conference and advice he profited marvellously in his studies, fell to the reading of good Authors, and grew to profound knowledge in the holy Scriptures: so that after a time, he began to preach as learnedly, godly, and zealously, as he had before done coldly, foolishly, and unskilfully: Then did his hearers finde the marvellous force of that doctrine, which was taught them by these three worthy men, <hi>Aegidio, Constantino,</hi> and <hi>Varquia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ministers ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noured.</note> so that the more they crept out of their former ignorance and grew in knowledge, the more they esteemed and honoured them.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon there were daily complaints made against them to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors, especially against Doctor <hi>Aegidio,</hi> who did more openly than the rest inveigh against the adversaries of the truth.

                        <hi>Aegidio</hi> chosen Bishop.</note> Then did those hypocritical Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors bestir themselves on all hands, citing him to come before them, where articles were exhibited against him, and thereupon they cast him into prison, and examined him. But the Emperour,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Doctor <hi>Constantino</hi> of whom mention hath been made before, was a most famous Divine, and endued by God with such rare abilities as the like were hardly found in that age; he was a man of a very pleasant wit, and wondrous facetious, which he especially used against the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Monks and Friars; and though he lived in a barbarous age, wherein all good learning was almost lost, yet by his wit and industry he attained to a great deal of skill both in <hi>Latin, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and was also an excellent Oratour: and studied the Scriptures so hard, that he grew very exquisite therein; He was also so eloquent in his own language, that all his Auditors were brought into a great admiration of him;<note place="margin">His excellent vertues.</note> He was very discreet in all his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: which parts he attained to, both by his study and long practice and experience, but especially by profound knowledge in the holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Whensoever he preached, there was so great a resort to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that three or foure houres before he began, there was scarce a place in the Church to be gotten. He was farre from covetousnesse and ambition, insomuch as having a good Canonship in the Church of <hi>Toledo</hi> proffered him, he refused it, together with divers other Preferments. In his Ministry in <hi>Sivil</hi> he did so plainly set forth, and so sharply rebuke those hucksters that sold indulgences, pardons, &amp;c. That they were much incensed against him, fearing that he would prove a plague to the whole generation of them, so that they hated him dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet could finde nothing whereof to accuse him, but what would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to their own shame.</p>
                  <p>But for all this he neglected not to preach the truth faithfully, though he knew that they lay at catch, waiting for an opportunity to ensnare him;<note place="margin">Zeale.</note> And it was the singular Providence of God that that City should enjoy such preaching, when there were so many pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and malicious enemies to oppose it. For at this time <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quio</hi> read upon the Gospel according to <hi>Matthew,</hi> and upon the <hi>Psalmes: Aegidio</hi> preached daily; and <hi>Constantine,</hi> though not so often, yet to as great fruit and edification, thus continuing till God sent storms to try each mans faith; In the midst of which tempest <hi>Varquio</hi> dyed, and <hi>Constantine</hi> was sent for by the Emperour to be his houshold Chaplain: only <hi>Aegidio</hi> was left alone, like a Lamb amongst wolves, to be the object of their fury,<note place="margin">He goes to the Emperour.</note> of whose end we have heard before; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whose death <hi>Constantine</hi> left the Emperours Court, and returned to <hi>Sivil,</hi> where he preached the Gospel with as much zeale as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he did before:<note place="margin">His return to <hi>Sivil.</hi>
                     </note> Then was he chosen to preach every other day in the Cathedral, which he refused, because of a great fit of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which had made him very weak, but he was forced to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, though he was so weak a creature, that sometimes he was fain to be carried to Church,<note place="margin">His weaknesse.</note> and by reason of his faintnesse was
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:41459:128"/>
necessitated once or twice in a Sermon to drink a draught of wine to refresh himself. About this time there was one <hi>Scobario,</hi> a man fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for life and learning, chosen by the Magistrates of the City to the Government of the Colledge of Children, who out of his zeal to promote the Gospel converted his Stipend, to the erecting of a Divinity-lecture in the Cathedral Church; and <hi>Constantine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chosen Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity-Lecturer.</note> having recovered his health, was chosen to read it; who performed it excellently well, beginning with the <hi>Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,</hi> and the <hi>Canticles</hi>; which having passed through very learnedly, he began upon the book of <hi>Job,</hi> and proceeded to expound more than half of it. But some evil spirit envying the Progresse of the Gospel in that City, under a pretence of fervent zeal, caused him to forsake this course, and encombred him so many ways, that he was never clear of those trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to his dying day.</p>
                  <p>For not long after he was brought before the Inquisitors, and had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things laid to his charge; yet by his quick and ready answers he easily avoided them, and they could not by any means bring him to make an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Protestation of his faith, by which all their hope was to circumvent him; and so he might have escaped, had not God, by a special Providence, compelled him as it were briefly and plainly to confesse his faith; The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion was this.</p>
                  <p>There was one <hi>Isabel Martin</hi> apprehended, in whose house <hi>Constantine</hi> had hid some special books for fear of the Inquisitors: This womans goods being sequestred, her son conveyed divers chests of her best goods away to another place. This coming to the Inquisitors ears by means of an unfaithful servant,<note place="margin">A strange Providence.</note> they sent their Officer immediately to demand those Chests: The womans sonne supposing that the Officer came for <hi>Constantines</hi> books, said unto him, I know what you come for, and therefore if you will promise me upon your honest word to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part quietly, I will bring you to them: the Officer supposing that he meant the Chests, promised him so to do: Then did he carry him into a secret place, and plucking forth a stone or two in the wall, shewed him <hi>Constantines</hi> Jewels; of paper indeed; but farre more precious than gold or pearle; the Officer astonished to finde that which he looked not for, told him that he came for no such thing, but for certain Chests of his mothers goods, which he had purloined from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questrators; and that notwithstanding his promise, he must carry both him and his books to the Inquisitors: Thus came <hi>Constantines</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings into the Inquisitors hands, out of which they quickly found matter enough against him. Then did they send for him before them, and demanded if he knew his own hand; he shifted it off at the first, but afterwards perceiving that it was the Will of God that he should bear witnesse to the truth, he confessed it to be his own writing, protesting openly that all things therein contained were full of truth and sincerity; Therefore, said he, trouble your selves no further in seeking Witnesses against me, seeing you have so plain and apert a Confession of my judgment and faith,<note place="margin">Courage.</note> but deal with
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:41459:129"/>
me as you shall please; Then was he cast into prison, and kept there two whole years,<note place="margin">Imprisoned.</note> where partly by occasion of his corrupt dyet, but chiefly of grief to see such havock made of the poor Church of Christ, which himself and his brethren had with so great pains and care planted and watered, he began first to be crazy, and then not being able to endure the extream heat of the Sunne, which made his prison like an hot house, he was forced to strip himself to his very shirt, wherein he lay day and night, by occasion whereof he fell into the bloody flux,<note place="margin">His death.</note> and within fifteen days died in the stinking prison, rendring up his soul to Christ, for promoting of whose glory he had oft times manfully adventured it.</p>
                  <p>He never indeed felt those cruel torments which the Inquisitors used to inflict upon others, but it was not because they regarded such a man of eminency as he was, but because they intended to delay his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by keeping him long in prison, not expecting that he should so suddenly have been taken out of their hands. Yet did these Imps of Satan spread abroad a report, that before his death upon the Rack he had confessed to them who were his disciples; and this they did to make men come in and accuse themselves, upon hope to finde the more favour with the Inquisitors; They reported also that he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one of his veins with a broken glasse whereof he died, that so he might avoid the shame and punishment of his heresies. And against the day of their solemn triumph, his corps was taken out of his grave, and set in a Pulpit, with one hand resting on the Desk, and holding up the other, just as he used to do when he preached: Then they passed sentence upon him,<note place="margin">His Corps burned.</note> and so afterwards caused him to be burned.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have seen in some few examples the rage of these bloody Inquisitors against the poor Saints and Servants of Jesus Christ, whereof a great number were cruelly murthered in a few years space in that one City of <hi>Sivil,</hi> whereby we may partly guesse how great numbers have suffered in all other places, since the light of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ brake forth, untill this day under their cruel and bloody tyranny.</p>

                     <hi>ANno Christi,</hi> 1155. <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth, an <hi>English man,</hi> being Pope, there was one <hi>Arnald</hi> of <hi>Brixia,</hi> who coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched boldly against the corruptions which were crept into the Church, and found great favour amongst the Senators, and people, insomuch as when the Pope commanded this <hi>Arnald</hi> to be driven away as an Heretick, they resisted his command, and defended <hi>Arnald,</hi> till at last the Pope interdicting the whole City, at the importunity of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the Senators and Citizens were forced to send him away: and shortly after he was apprehended by the Popes Legat, Cardinal of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> out of whose hands he was rescued by the Vicounts of <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> with whom he remained, and to whom he preached the Gospel of Christ, and was had in such esteem that he was accounted a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after, <hi>Frederick Barbarossa</hi> the Emperour, coming unto <hi>Italy</hi> to be crowned, the Pope sent some Cardinals to him, requesting that he would deliver <hi>Arnald</hi> of <hi>Brixia</hi> into their hands, whom the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of <hi>Campania</hi> had taken from his Legat at <hi>Otriculi,</hi> whom they held for a Prophet in their Countrey, and greatly honoured him. The Emperour receiving these commands from the Pope, presently sent forth his Apparitors, and took one of the Vicounts prisoner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the other were so terrified, that they delivered up <hi>Arnald</hi> to the Cardinals; and this the Emperour did to gratifie the Pope that was to set the Imperial Crown upon his head.</p>
                  <p>Not long after the Pope being in his Ruff, marching with a brave Army into <hi>Apulia,</hi> commanded his Prefect at <hi>Rome</hi> to do execution upon <hi>Arnald,</hi> who accordingly most cruelly, first hanged, and then burned him for an Arch-heretick at the appointment of the Pope.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Arnald</hi> was born in <hi>Italy,</hi> and was trained up under <hi>Peter Abai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lardus</hi> in <hi>France</hi>: His heresies were, that he preached against the Pride and Covetousnesse of the Clergy and Monks: That he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed against the corruptions which were crept into the Sacraments, &amp;c. He first Preached in <hi>Brixia,</hi> and expounded to the people the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, who earnestly embraced his doctrine; whereupon the Bishops and Monks of that City complained of him to the Council that was held at <hi>Rome</hi> by Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> who (to prevent the spreading of his Doctrine) injoyned him silence, and banished him <hi>Italy.</hi> Then did he go beyond the Alps into a Town of <hi>Germany</hi> called <hi>Turengum,</hi> where, for a time he preached the truth, and did much good, till he

heard of the death of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> his old Adversary: at which time he returned into <hi>Italy,</hi> and went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where what his successe was we heard before: after his body was burnt, they gathered up his ashes, and threw them into the River <hi>Tybur. Otho Frising.</hi>

With which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions they were, through the mercy of God, clean altered in their carriage and judgement, highly admiring and honouring him now, whom a little before they derided and contemned; Then did he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed still to impart the Word of grace to them, declaring, that though he knew himself to be a miserable sinner, yet through faith in Jesus Christ and his grace, he was fully perswaded that his sins were forgiven; assuring them likewise that if they did repent and believe on our Lord Jesus Christ, they also should have their sinnes remitted unto them.</p>
                  <p>There were in that prison also some that having formerly lived very delicately, could not now endure the hardship of prison, to whom he administred much comfort in this their distresse, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they rejoyced in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>His Kinsfolk hearing of his imprisonment, his wife and sister came to him,<note place="margin">Tentation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted.</note> pitifully weeping and intreating him to consider and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his poor family, &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>Presently after, the Pope sent a command that <hi>Faninus</hi> should be executed, whereof when an officer brought him word, he much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced at it, thanking the Messenger: Then did he begin to make a long exhortation to his fellow-prisoners about the felicity of the life to come.</p>

He had life proffered him if he would recant, and he was put in mind what a sad condition he would leave his wife and children in;<note place="margin">Proffer of life refused.</note> whereupon he answered that he had committed them to an Overseer that would sufficiently care for them; and being asked who that was?<note place="margin">Faith.</note> he answered, Even the Lord Jesus Christ, a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Keeper of all that are committed to him; the next day he was removed into the common Prison, and delivered to the secular Magistrate.</p>
                  <p>In all his words, gestures and countenance, he shewed such mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, constancy, and tranquillity of mind, that they which before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly hated him, and thought that he had a devil, began now favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to hearken to him, and to commend him: yea with such grace and sweetnesse he spake of the Word of God, that many of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates wives which heard him, could not abstain from weeping: yea the Executioner himself wept.</p>
                  <p>As he was going to execution, one that saw him so merry and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, asked him what was the reason of it, whereas Christ before his death sweat blood and water?<note place="margin">Comfort in death.</note> To whom he answered, that Christ su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained all the sorrows and conflicts with hell and death that were due to us,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that by his sufferings we might be freed from the sorrow and fear of them all.</p>
                  <p>At the place of execution, after he had made his most earnest prayers to the Lord, he meekly and patiently went to the stake, where he was first strangled,<note place="margin">

From thence he went to <hi>Placentia,</hi> where he instructed the People also in many of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Religion, promising that he would next speak to them of Antichrist, whom he would paint out in his colours; but when he came the next day,<note place="margin">Apprehended.</note> he was apprehended by the Magistrate, whom he readily obeyed, saying, <hi>that he wondered the devil had let him alone so long:</hi> and being asked whether he would renounce his doctrine, he answered,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> that <hi>he maintained no doctrine of his own, but the doctrine of Christ,</hi>

                     <hi>which also he was ready to seal with his blood,</hi> giving hearty thanks to God for accounting him worthy to suffer for his name. Then was he committed to a filthy and stinking prison, where he remained some moneths, and was often solicited to revoke his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, or else he must suffer death: but, through Gods mercy, nothing could remove him from his constancy: being therefore condemned
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:41459:132"/>
to death, he was brought forth into the market-place, where he most heartily prayed for his enemies, instructed the People, and then was hanged, resting in peace in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>In Saint <hi>Angelo,</hi> there was an house of <hi>Augustine Friars,</hi> to whom there often resorted a Friar from the City of <hi>Pavia,</hi> who was a man very expert in the Scriptures, and of godly conversation, by whose la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours not only divers of the Friars, but other Townsmen were brought to the knowledge and love of Gods Word; and amongst the rest, one <hi>Galeacius Trecius,</hi> a Gentleman of good quality,<note place="margin">

                     </note> very weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and bountiful to the poor, was wrought upon to embrace the truth, and was afterward much confirmed and strengthened by <hi>Caelius Secundus,</hi> who being persecuted from <hi>Pavia,</hi> came to this place. After some time <hi>Galeacius</hi> having much profited in knowledge, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with a godly zeal to promote and propagate the knowledge of the truth unto others; But a light shining in such darknesse could not be long hid: Insomuch as <hi>Anno</hi> 1551. he was apprehended and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Bishop, by whom he was kept in bands, having only a pad of straw to lie on; and though his wife sent him a good bed and sheets, yet did the Bishops officers keep them from him,<note place="margin">Cruelty.</note> dividing it as a booty amongst themselves.</p>
                  <p>Thrice he was brought before the Commissioners, where he boldly rendred a reason of his faith, answering all their interrogatories with such evidence of Scripture and constancy of mind as astonished all that heard him: yet afterwards at the importunity of his friends and kindred, he was by much perswasion brought to assent to certain Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish points. But, through the mercy of God, he was after a while,<note place="margin">Humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Recovery.</note> brought to such repentance and bewailing of this fact, that afterwards he became more valiant in the defence of Christs quarrel; neither did he desire any thing more than to have occasion to recover again by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession that which he had lost by denial: affirming that as he never had felt more joy of heart then when he constantly professed the truth, so he never tasted more sorrow in all his life, then when he turned from the same by dissimulation: Professing to his Christian friends, that death was much more sweet to him with testimony to the truth,<note place="margin">Note.</note> then life with the least denial of it, and violation of a good conscience thereby. So that afterwards, through Gods mercy, he was so full of comfort, that divers which talked with him, continued all day without meat or drink, and if they might, would have stayed all night too, they were so delighted with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galeacius</hi> thus waiting for some occasion to manifest his Recovery,<note place="margin">Joy unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> it so fell out that the Inquisitors came into the Prison to him, supposing that now he would have confirmed what before he had granted unto them, requiring him so to do; But <hi>Galeacius</hi> on the contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted that, and boldly asserted the truth with more courage than he did before: and hereby his mind was greatly refreshed, and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries went away ashamed: yet did they condemn and deliver him to the secular Judge to be burned; Then was he brought forth in the

                  <p>Then was a new-found manner of death inflicted upon divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, never till then heard of, whereby they were drowned in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Sea; The manner of it was thus; After any of them had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the sentence of death by the Inquisitors, an iron chain was fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about their middle, with a very heavy stone tyed thereto, then were they laid upon a plank between two boats, and so rowed to an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place in the Sea, where the boats parting asudder, the Martyrs presently sunk into the bottome of the Sea and were drowned. Yet notwithstanding this cruelty, many godly persons ceased not to assemble together in a place appointed for that purpose, where they talked and discoursed of heavenly matters for their spiritual edification, and made collections for the relief of the poor amongst them. And <hi>Anno</hi> 1566. they called to them a Minister of the Gospel, and constituted a Church, where they enjoyed all the Ordinances with much comfort: but some false brethren creeping in amongst them, after a while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed them; then were many apprehended, cast into the Sea and drowned: Others were sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they were cast into prison till they rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and dyed there.</p>

                  <p>The Lords of <hi>Venice</hi> offered to restore to him his Patrimony, which was partly morgaged, and partly sold, if he would submit to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; but he resolutely refused that condition.

But he on the contrary perswaded him and others to come out of the snares of the Divel, and to cleave to Jesus Christ, and to live, not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit; For, said he, <hi>otherwise your unbelief will bring you into the lake of fire that never shall be quenched.</hi> When he came to the place where he was to suffer, the Captain lastned the chain and stone to him, whereupon, lifting his eyes to heaven, he said,

Shortly after the Jailor told <hi>Sega</hi> that he was to die one hour within night, at the hearing whereof he entreated <hi>Spinola</hi> to pray with him, and after prayer he said, that his soul was heavy unto death. <hi>Spinola</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>Fear not, for it will not be long before your soul shall partake of those joyes which shall endure for ever.</hi> At the appointed time he was fetched out of the dungeon, where he took his leave of <hi>Spinola</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prisoners: As he went into the boat, a Friar perswaded him to return to the Church of <hi>Rome; Sega</hi> answered, that he was already in the way to our Lord Jesus Christ, and so passing on, he called upon the name of God: He seemed to be a little amazed at the fastning of the chaine and stone to his body, yet presently recollecting his spirits, he took it patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and so commending his soul into the hands of God,<note place="margin">

                  <p>The third time that he was called before them, they asked him if he would not recant his errours? he answered, that the doctrine which he maintained was not erroneous, but the same truth which Christ and his holy Apostles taught, and for which all the Martyrs, both in former and later times, did willingly lay down their lives,<note place="margin">Humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</note> and endured the pains of death. Yet after all this, <hi>Spinola</hi> by the crafty perswasions of some seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friends, began to strike saile and to faint; but, through Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, he soon recovered again, and being called before the Judges,<note place="margin">Recovery.</note> he openly confirmed the truth, and so had sentence passed upon him that he should be drowned as an Heretick.

into a Church, and seeing their grosse idolatry, was so inflamed with zeal that he could not endure the sight of those horrible impieties, and therefore he went out into the Church porch, and as the Procession pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by him, he waited till the Bishop came that did bear the Host, and then stepping forwards, he plucked it out of his hands, threw it to the ground, saying aloud, <hi>Ye wretched Idolaters, do ye fall down to a morsel of bread?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An heroical act</note> This so provoked the People that they had almost torn him in pieces, and yet they spared him and sent him to prison.</p>
                  <p>Complaint being made to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth, he was so incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that he appointed him to be burnt the same day; but some of the Cardinals advised that he should rather be kept in prison, and examined by exquisite torments to find out his abettors and setters on.

                     <hi>Such was the will of God.</hi> Then was he adjudged to be led from the Capitol, naked to his middle, and to wear on his head the form of a Devil, his breeches to be painted over with flames of fire, and so to be carried all about the City, and then to be burnt alive.</p>
                  <p>When he heard this sentence, he lift up his eyes to heaven, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored the help of Almighty God. As he passed through the streets he was mocked and derided of all the People, but he continued his fervent Prayers to God; At last he spake something against the filthy lives of the Cardinals, which so enraged them, that they caused him to be gagged, which cruelty he patiently endured. When he came before the Church where he cast down the idol, the hangman cut off his right hand, and set it on a pole in the Cart to which he was tied; then did two Tormentors with flaming torches scorch and burn his flesh all the way as he went through the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> all which he bore with admirable patience; By that he came to the place where he was to be executed,<note place="margin">Patience.</note> his body was all over scorched, blistred and bloody, having no part free but his head; Then was he taken from the Cart, and seeing the Post to which he should be tied, he went of himself to it, and kneeling down, kissed the chains which should bind him to it; The Friars urged him to worship an idol which they presented to him, but he turning away his face shewed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of it, holding on his Christian course unto the end: and when the flames of fire seized on him,<note place="margin">His Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> he bowed his head, and quietly yielded up his soul to God.</p>
                  <p>The same year there was an old godly man that had long lain in the Inquisitors dungeons, who was at last brought forth and condemned; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the Friars brought to him a Crucifix, importuning him to kisse and adore it; He seeing their impudence, said unto them; <hi>If you take not this idol out of my sight, ye will constrain me to spit upon it</hi>; The Friars hearing this,<note place="margin">Idolatry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested.</note> sent him away immediately to the fire, where with great courage and constancy he resigned up his spirit unto God.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>WIlliam Gardiner</hi> was born at <hi>Bristol,</hi> and well educated, and when he was grown up, was placed with one Master <hi>Paget,</hi> a Merchant, by whom when he was twenty six years old, he was sent into <hi>Portugal</hi> to <hi>Lisbone,</hi> the regal City, to be a Factor: there he learned the countrey language, and became a profitable servant both to his Master and others. He was careful to keep close to God,<note place="margin">His going to <hi>Lisbone.</hi>
                     </note> and to avoid the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions of that countrey, and there being divers good men in that City, he associated himself with them, used good conference, and often bewailed to them his own weaknesse, as being neither sufficiently hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for his sins, nor yet enflamed with a love of godlinesse as he ought:<note place="margin">Humility.</note> he had also good books which privately he made much use of. Now whilst he was here abiding, it so fell out that a great marriage was to be solemnized betwixt the King of <hi>Portugals</hi> sonne, and the King of <hi>Spains</hi> daughter. Great preparations were made for it, and a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course there was of Persons of all Ranks that came to it; and upon the wedding day they went to Church in great pomp; and amongst mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Spectators, <hi>William Gardiner</hi> made one, rather for the novelty of the businesse, than for any desire that he had to see their Ceremonies, and going to Church early in the morning, he got a convenient place to hear and see in.</p>
                  <p>When all were come to Church, a Cardinal began to say Masse: The People standing with great silence and devotion: The fight of these superstitions did wonderfully grieve the mind of <hi>William Gardiner,</hi> not so much to see the folly of the common People,<note place="margin">Zeal.</note> as to see that the King himself, and so many sage Nobles should be led away with such abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable idolatry; wherewith he was so exceedingly moved in his spirit, that he had much ado to refrain himself from doing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereby he might manifest his dislike; but the great throng that he was in, hindred him, that he could not come neere to the Altar.</p>
                  <p>When all was ended he returned home very sad, seeking out solitary places, where falling down prostrate before God, with many tears he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed the neglect of his duty, and studied how he might revoke that People from their impiety and superstition. At length his mind was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly setlet not to defer the matter any longer, whereupon he renounced the world, exactly made up all his accounts, both what he owed, and what was owing to him to a farthing. Then did he continue night and day in Prayer unto God, and in continual meditation of the holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">Prayer.</note> so that he would scarce take any meat by day, or sleep by night, as one <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digrace</hi> his bed-fellow testified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:41459:137"/>
The Sabbath following Masse was to be celebrated with the like so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity; Whereupon <hi>William Gardiner</hi> went early in the morning handsomely apparalled to Church, setting himself neer to the Altar; After a while the King and States came; <hi>Gardiner</hi> with a New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his hand, stood near the Altar, privately reading it all the while. A Cardinal began the Masse, consecrated the Host, lifted it up an high, shewed his God to the people,<note place="margin">Grosse idolatry</note> they adored it: yet <hi>Gardiner</hi> contained himself all this while. Then the Cardinal took the Host, tossed it to and fro about the Chalice,<note place="margin">An heroical act</note> made divers circles, &amp;c. With that <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> stept to him, took the Host out of his hand, and trampled it under his feet, and with his other hand overthrew the Chalice.</p>
                  <p>At first all that were present stood amazed; then arose a great tumult, and one drawing his dagger wounded <hi>Gardiner</hi> in the shoulder, and as he was about to have slain him,<note place="margin">His danger.</note> the King commanded him to forbear, whereby his life was saved for the present; the tumult being ceased, the King demanded of him what Countryman he was? He answered, <hi>Most noble King, I am not ashamed of my Countrey, I am an Englishmam by birth and Religion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His speech to to the King.</note> 
                     <hi>and came hither as a Merchant, and seeing so great idolatry committed in this famous Assembly, I neither ought, nor could any longer suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it: neither could I forbear doing what you have seen: which thing, most noble Prince, was not done in contempt of your Presence, God is my witness, but to seek the salvation of this People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King hearing that he was an Englishman, and considering what alteration of Religion King <hi>Edward</hi> had made, presently conceited that he was suborned by some body to do this in scorn to their Religion; wherefore he asked him who was the Authour and procurer of this act? <hi>Gardiner</hi> answered that he was not moved thereunto by any man, but only by his own conscience; For, saith he, there is no man under heaven, for whose sake I would put my self into such manifest danger, but that I owed this service first to God,<note place="margin">Courage.</note> and then to your salvation: and if I have done any thing which is dispeasing to you, you ought to impute it to no man, but to your self, who so i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>reverently use the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament of the Lords Supper to so great Idolatry, &amp;c. Whilst he thus stoutly spake to the King, by reason of the losse of much blood by his wound, he was ready to faint. Whereupon Chirurgions were sent for to cure him, that he might be reserved for further torments.</p>
                  <p>Then were all other Englishmen in the City clapped up in prison, especially his bed-fellow, who was grievously tormented and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more then all the rest, and scarcely delivered after two years im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment; the rest got off sooner.</p>
                  <p>They searched also all his writings and letters, to see if they could find out any confederates; then they went to him seeking by torments to extort the Author of this fact. They also invented a new kind of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, exceeding <hi>Phalaris</hi> his brazen Bull; which was this: They made a ball of linnen cloth,<note place="margin">He is tortured.</note> which with violence they thrust down his throat to the bottom of his stomack, and with a string fastned to it, they pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it up again; and this they did divers times, which caused as bitter
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:41459:137"/>
pains as the pains of death; but when by this means they could get no confession from him, they asked him if he did not repent of his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fact? whereto he answered, that he was so far from repenting, that if it were to do again he should do it: yet was he somewhat sorry that it was done in the Kings presence, to his disturbance, but they were not to blame him for it, but the King was rather to be blamed, who having power, would not prohibit so great Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>When they had used all kinds of torments, and that he was so weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereby, that he was not like to live long, they first cut off his right hand, then carried him into the market-place, where they cut off his other hand also: then fastning a rope about his middle, with a Pully they hoisted him up an high, and making a great fire under him, they let him down,<note place="margin">His cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He answered that what torments soever they used, the truth was the same: that which he had confessed in his life, he would not deny at his death; and that when Christ ceased to be our Advocate he would pray to our Lady, &amp;c. And when they laboured to stop his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, and praising of God, he with a loud voice reheased the 34. <hi>Psalm:</hi> which being almost ended, the rope was burned in sunder, so that his body fell down into the fire, where he changed his momentany pains for eternal rest.</p>
                  <p>But the Lord suffered not this cruelty to go altogether unpunished in this life; for a spark of the fire wherewith he was burned,<note place="margin">Gods judgment on persecutors.</note> was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the wind into the Haven, where it set on fire one of the Kings great ships, and consumed it: The new-married Prince also died within half a year, and the King himself not long after.</p>

                  <p>The two Armies lay near together, and the Protestants offered battel to the Emperour, but he refused, assuring himself that they could not long continue together: The Army of the Protestants was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Hessen,</hi> who did not concur very well in their counsels; besides they wanted both victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and money, so as they were forced to dislodge and retire further off: the Emperour following, forced the Elector to fight with disadvantage; and God who doth not alwaies prosper the better cause, gave the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Emperour,<note place="margin">Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> and the <hi>Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> taken prisoners.

                  <p>Not long after he was set for to <hi>Meldorp,</hi> to preach the Gospel to them also; wherefore he thought good to try what God would work by him there; but the Citizens of <hi>Breme</hi> were very unwilling to part with him, because the Gospel had not as yet took much deep root a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, and because the persecution was very great, &amp;c. Yet <hi>Sutphen</hi> alledged, that in <hi>Diethmarch</hi> there was more need of his labours, the people being as sheep amongst Wolves, and that with a safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science he could not deny their request, and that he did not intend ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to forsake <hi>Breme,</hi> but only for a moneth or two, after which he would return to them again.

This so far prevailed with these ignorant men, that they resolved that he should be put to death unseen and unheard: They wrote also to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid

But the Gentleman still provoked them to accomplish his command: Then did the Minister say, I beseech you shew not such cruelty upon me, rather lead me to purge my self to my Prince, before whom I doubt not to purge my self from any thing wherewith I shall be charged, neither so violate ye the lawes of hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality which I have shewed to you and to other noble men, which used to resort to my house; besides consider what a sting this act will leave in your consciences: for I have faithfully and truly taught the doctrine of the Gospel, and that's the principal cause that my Prince bears me this ill will, &amp;c. But whatsoever this good man could say in his own behalf, the wicked Gentleman continued resolute, provoking his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to accomplish that which he commanded them, withal saying to the Minister, You shall gain nothing by your preaching in this sort, for I am fully determined that the Princes will shall be fulfilled. At last the servants took the Minister, and with great lamentation and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hanged him upon a beam in his own house,<note place="margin">He is hanged.</note> the Gentleman standing by and looking on.</p>

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1543. and 1544. There was a great persecution all over <hi>Flanders,</hi>

                        <hi>A</hi> great perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> so that there was neither town nor City in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, wherein some were not banished, beheaded, or condemned to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual imprisonment: neither was there any respect either of age or sex: But especially at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> many of the chief men were burned for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>Also at the Emperours going to <hi>Bruxels,</hi> there was a terrible perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and slaughter made of Gods People in <hi>Brabant, Artois, &amp;c.</hi> so that two hundred men and women were apprehended at one time, whereof some were drowned, some buried quick, some privily made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: others sent to perpetual prison; yea so many others were put to death, that the hands of the hangman were tired with slaying of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1545. There was one <hi>Martin,</hi> at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> a Fishmonger,<note place="margin">

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:41459:143"/>
the Captives in prison, comforted them in persecution, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the truth which were led to the fire.</p>
                  <p>The Friars seeing this, though formerly he had been very bountiful to them, yet now they conspired against him, whereby he was laid in bands, and by sharp and cruel torments they would have enforced him to recant, but not prevailing, he was condemned, and his goods confiscated; as he stood at the stake,<note place="margin">He is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> a Friar said to him, <hi>Martin, except thou dost turn, thou shalt go from this temporal to everlasting fire,</hi> to whom he answered, <hi>It is not for you to judge me</hi>;<note place="margin">His Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> and so he quietly slept in the Lord.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1545. There was in <hi>Mechlin</hi> one <hi>Andrew Thiessen,</hi> who had three sonnes and a daughter,<note place="margin">

At last they were condemned to the fire; and at the place of execution, they began to exhort the people, whereupon bals were put into their mouths; which through vehemency in desiring to speak, they thrust out again, intreating them for the Lords sake that they might have leave to speak;
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:41459:143"/>
and so singing with a loud voice, they were fastened to the stake, where they prayed for their Persecutors, exhorted one another,<note place="margin">Joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at death.</note> and endured the fire patiently: One of them feeling the violence of the flame, said, <hi>O what a small pain is this compared with the glory to come</hi>! and so, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their spirits into the hands of God, they finished their race.</p>

When the Friar was come down from the Pulpit, he charged him for preaching false doctrine, perswading the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the Scripture, that the bread was but the Sacrament of the Lords body; but the people making a tumult, carried him out of the Church in a croud; and he had not gone far before he was apprehended by an Officer, and carried to prison; Then came divers Friars to reason with

him; and he stood to the trial of the Scriptures only, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused. During his imprisonment he wrote a consolatory letter to his wife,<note place="margin">His letter to his wife.</note> exhorting her to bring up his children in the fear of God. Being condemned, he was commanded not to speak to the people; being bound to the stake,<note place="margin">His Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> he prayed for his enemies, and was first strangled, and then burnt.</p>

                     <hi>Bertrand</hi> took the cake out of his hand and trampled it under his feet, saying, that he did it to shew the glory of that god that they worshipped, or rather what little power he had; labouring to perswade them that the cake was not their Saviour; At first the people stood amazed, but presently they raised such a tumult that <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trand</hi> hardly escaped with life.</p>
                  <p>The Governour hearing of it, was exceedingly enraged, and sent for <hi>Bertrand</hi> into the Castle, asking him whether he was sorry for his fact, and whether he would do it if it were to do again? <hi>Bertrand</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That he would, and if he had a hundred lives to lose, he would lose them all in that quarrel;<note place="margin">Courage.</note> Then was he thrice put to the rack and tormented cruelly to draw from him who were his setters on;<note place="margin">Cruelty.</note> yet could they get nothing from him: Then was he condemned, and drawn from the Castle to the Market-place with a Ball of iron in his mouth: There he was set upon a stage, and had his right hand wherewith he did the fact,<note place="margin">Barbarous cruelty.</note> crushed between two hot irons with sharp edges, till the form of his hand was quite changed; Then did they bring other red hot irons for his right foot, which they used as they had done his hand, which he with marvellous patience and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy underwent, putting out his foot of his own accord to them; Then taking the ball of Iron out of his mouth,<note place="margin">Admirable patience.</note> they cut out his tongue: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding which, he continually called and cryed unto God, which caused them to thrust in the ball of iron again; Then was he let down in an iron chaine upon the fire and pulled up again,<note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> and so they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued pulling up and letting him down till he was burnt to ashes, which ashes they threw into the river.</p>

Another Friar said, Away Varlet, thou art the cause of thy Fathers perdition. Whilst <hi>Baudizon</hi> was stripping and fitting himself to be sacrificed, some of the Friars had fastned a Crucifix in the old mans hands, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading him that it would please the People, and that for all that, he might lift up his heart to God, &amp;c. But so soon as <hi>Baudizon</hi> saw it, he said, <hi>Alasse Father, what do you now? will you play the Idolater at your last hour?</hi> and so pulling the Idol out of his hand,<note place="margin">Zeal.</note> he threw it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>At the place of execution they were set upon a Scaffold, and <hi>Baudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon</hi> desired leave to make a Confession of his faith: answer was made, that he might confess himself to a Friar if he would, which he refusing, was readily haled to the stake, where he began to sing the 16.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. There was in <hi>Flanders</hi> one <hi>John Herwin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>John Herwin.</hi>
                     </note> a souldier of a very dissolute life: but God having a purpose to shew him mercy, put it into his heart to go into <hi>England,</hi> and accordingly he came to <hi>London</hi> in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reigne, and by Gods good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence was entertained in a Brewers family,<note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> where both master and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants feared God: His Master caused him often to go to the Dutch Church, where, by the Ministry of the Word he first began to tast,<note place="margin">His conversion</note> and afterwards more and more to increase in the saving knowledge of Christ. After a while he returned back into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and at <hi>Furne</hi> he was presently laid wait for by the Popish Bailiffe; This occasioned his removal to <hi>Honscot</hi>; and yet there also the Bailiffe being informed of him, went in the night with his Sergeants, and apprehended him; By the way they met some drunkards in the streets; whereupon the Bailiffe said, We have, as they say, many Gospellers in this town, but it little appears by these disorders. <hi>Herwin</hi> hearing him, said, <hi>Is drunkennesse a sin Master Bailiffe?</hi> The Bailiffe answered, what of that? <hi>Herwin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>Why then do you not commit these men to prison,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Herwin</hi> impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned.</note> 
                     <hi>seeing it is your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to punish vice, and to protect them that fear God?</hi> To this the Bailiffe answered not.</p>
                  <p>In the prison <hi>Herwin</hi> behaved himself so vertuously, that every one admired him. Being somewhat long before he was called before the Magistrate, he was much troubled at it, his heart being inflamed with an holy zeal to confesse Jesus Christ before his Judges.<note place="margin">Zeale.</note> Yet many of the brethren were very fearful of him, considering what his former life had been, and what a novice he as yet was in the Profession of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>At last he had his hearts desire, being brought before the Sheriffe; there a Priest was provided to dispute with him, to whose questions <hi>Herwin</hi> answered with such soundnesse of judgement and modesty, that it easily appeared that he had profited well in Christs school. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked of Christs real presence in the Sacrament, he answered, <hi>That the highest dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, &amp;c.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he admonished his Judges to examine the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by the true touchstone of Gods Word, whereby they might easily see how contrary it is to the Scriptures, &amp;c. And having made a free Profession of his faith, he craved Justice one way or other;<note place="margin">Courage.</note> but they still urged him to recant, to which he answered,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> 
                     <hi>My faith is not

built upon mans opinion, but the Lord hath taught me to eschew evil, and to do good</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then was he returned to prison again.</p>
                  <p>During his imprisonment he was dangerously assaulted by some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and cunning Friars, who alledged the sayings of diverse of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to prove their transubstantiation; but he, through Gods mercy, holding close to the Word of Christ, overcame them. In prison he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to recreate himself by singing of <hi>Psalms,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vincit veritas.</note> and the people used to flock together to the prison door to hear him; This so angred the Popish Clergy, that they sought to hinder him from singing, and for this end they caused two desperate Malefactors to be put into the same room with him;<note place="margin">Popish malice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and subtilty.</note> but within a few dayes, these Villains brake prison and escaped, leaving opportunity to <hi>Herwin</hi> to escape also; but he, fearing that his flight might be prejudicial to other godly persons in the City, upon whom it would be charged,<note place="margin">Flight refused.</note> resolved rather to remain there, than to flie: Presently after news was brought him that sentence of death was passed upon him, whereupon he thanked God for advancing him to so high an honour as to be accounted worthy to suffer for his name: Testifying the inward joy which he felt in his soul by a letter that he wrote to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,<note place="margin">Thanks for sufferings.</note> wherein he exhorted them to constancy and perseverance in the doctrine of the truth which they had received from God: Within a few dayes after he was carried forth to hear his sentence, at which time the Magistrate by earnest intreaties and large promises sought to bring him to a recantation,<note place="margin">Tentation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted.</note> and to worship their breaden God, promising that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he should be presently released: but <hi>Herwin</hi> refusing their offer of life upon those termes, was bound and carried into a Chappel where they celebrated the Masse; at which time, to shew his detestation of their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, he turned his back, winked with his eyes, and stopped his eares. At the elevation of the Host one asked him if Jesus Christ was not now between the Priests hands?<note place="margin">Zeale.</note> To which he answered, <hi>No, he is in heaven at the right hand of his Father:</hi> Then was the sentence of death read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
                  <p>As he was going to execution, he said to the people, <hi>See here how this wicked world rewards the poor servants of Jesus Christ: whilst I was a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, a player at Cards and Dice, living in all dissolutenesse and ungodly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whence perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ariseth.</note> 
                     <hi>I was never in danger of these bonds; yea, I was then counted a good fellow, and at that time, Who but I? But no sooner began I, through Gods grace, to seek after a godly life, but presently the world made war upon me, and became mine enemy, &amp;c. yet this discourageth me not; for the servant is not better than his Lord; seeing they persecuted him, no question but they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute us.</hi> At the place of execution, one gave him his hand, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him: then began he to sing the 30. <hi>Psalm,</hi> whereupon a Friar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted him, saying, <hi>Oh</hi> John <hi>turn, there is yet time and space</hi>; the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr disregarding his words, turned his back upon him; and some of the company said to the Friar, <hi>Turn thou, thou hypocrite</hi>; and so <hi>Herwin</hi> quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finished his <hi>Psalm</hi>; many joyning with him in singing of it; then said the Friar, Be not offended good people to hear this Heretick to sing of God; The people answered, <hi>Hold thy peace thou Balaamite, here is no body

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1561. There was apprehended in <hi>Antwerp</hi> one <hi>John de Boscane,</hi>

The officers chiefly aimed to apprehend the Minister, and having caught one of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, they thought him to be the man, crying one to another, <hi>Hold the Priest fast,</hi> striking him with their Pistols and staves, and so car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to the Drosart; they caught also two or three more, which afterwards made an escape: the man only that remained with the Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart whose name was <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> was often set upon to be turned aside from his holy Profession; <hi>Why,</hi> say they,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1568. There were apprehended in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> one <hi>Scoblant, John de Hues,</hi>

                  <p>Shortly after <hi>Scoblant</hi> was brought to his trial, where he made a good confession of his faith, and so was condemned.

                  <p>When news was brought him in the evening that he must die the next day, he retired himself, and poured out his soul in prayer unto God till ten a clock; and after his rest, the like he did the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:<note place="margin">Prayer.</note> Having ended his Prayer, he put on a clean shirt and washed himself; saying to his fellow-prisoners, <hi>Brethren, I am now going to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, I hope ere noon to drink of the wine of the Kingdome of heaven</hi>; When he came down he found three other prisoners that were to suffer with him.

The Popish Clergy of <hi>Gand</hi> having intelligence hereof, fearing lest by this means, their doctrine and authority would come into contempt, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to be apprehended and cast into a deep and dark hole, where he remained bearing his affliction patiently,<note place="margin">His imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and calling upon God night and day, praising him for accounting him worthy to suffer for his names sake.

him, receiving such instructions and consolation from him, that they could not be drawn to leave him till necessity enforced, neither then could they depart without abundance of tears.</p>
                  <p>The Priests and Friars sought by all means to draw him to a recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but to no purpose,<note place="margin">His constancy.</note> for he still kept himself close to the Word of God, which so vexed them, that at last they procured his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be hanged.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1568. There was a Goldsmith dwelling in <hi>Breda,</hi> who had long been a Deacon of the Church in that place, his name was <hi>Peter Coulogue</hi>: in his house the Church often met for the service of God;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Peter Coulogue</hi> and <hi>Betkin</hi> his maid.</note> the Popish adversaries being much enraged hereby, cast him into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which the faithful much grieved at, and endeavoured to visit and comfort him: This the enemies taking notice of removed him into the Castle; during his abode there, though all others were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from him, yet his Maid-servant brought him his food daily, never ceasing to confirm and comfort him out of the Word of God, as well as she was able, for which at length they imprisoned her also: This she was right glad of, thinking her self happy to suffer for righteousness sake.</p>
                  <p>Not long after <hi>Peter</hi> was put to the torment, which he endured pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently; then did they fetch <hi>Betkin</hi> also to it, whereupon she said, <hi>My Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, wherefore will you put me to this torture,</hi>

                  <p>The courage and constancy of the maid did so work upon many of the people, godly men and women, that not considering the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

they brake through the multitude, embracing the Prisoners, and praising God for their constancy, saying to them, <hi>Fight manfully, for the Crown is prepared for you:</hi> At the place of execution <hi>Betkin</hi> with a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and amiable countenance spake thus to the people: <hi>Dear brethren and sisters, be alwayes obedient to the Word of God, and fear not them that can kill the body, but have no power over the soul: as for me, I am now going to meet my glorious Spouse the Lord Jesus Christ</hi>; Then falling upon their knees they prayed to the Lord with great devotion; And the executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fastening them to the stake, strangled <hi>Peter, Betkin</hi> encouraging him till he yielded up the Ghost,<note place="margin">Their Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> and till the fire had taken hold of her self; and in the flames she was heard to magnifie the Lord, till she yielded up her spirit into his hands.</p>
                  <p>About this time multitudes of persons were murthered in <hi>Flanders</hi> by the bloody Inquisition, whose dead bodies were cast out to be gazed upon in every place;<note place="margin">A great perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> and multitudes of believers, both men and women were cast into prisons, where they languished till many of them died.

                  <p>Being thus assured, he drunk a cup or two of <hi>Malmsey,</hi> and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comxanied with his Ghostly father, he went to the Princes Court; at the stair-foot the Friar gave him his blessing, encouraged him, and so left him; The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was set at dinner, with the Earles of <hi>Laval, Hohenlo,</hi> and many other Noblemen; <hi>Joanville</hi> came into the dining-room, attired like a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> so that he was taken for a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

to some of those <hi>French</hi> Noblemen; He thrust forward twice or thrice to come behind the Prince to shoot him in the head, as he was directed, but was still repulsed by the Princes Gentlemen that stood about him; Dinner being done, the Prince was going to his retiring chamber, whereupon this Villain gat before a window in the Hall, close by the door of that room into which the Prince was to go; As the Prince passed towards it, he was shewing the Earle of <hi>Laval</hi> the cruelties that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had exercised in the Low-Countries, which were wrought in the hangings; and having his face turned, this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer discharged his Pistol at him; but the Prince,<note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> as God would have it, turning at the same instant, the bullet entred in at his throat under the right chap, being so near that the fire entred with the bullet into the wound, burning his Ruffe and Beard; it brake out one of his teeth, pierced the jugular vein, but hurt not his toungue, and so came out at his left cheek hard by his nose; the blow being given, one with an Halberd could not contain himself, but thrust the Villain through, and slew him.</p>
                  <p>The Chirurgions being sent for, found that the fire which entred the wound, had cauterized the jugular vein, and had done him much good, so that the wound was not mortal. The Friar was afterwards apprehended and executed.</p>

               <p>Their rage was so great against the Professors of the Gospel, that

neither <hi>Turks</hi> nor <hi>Heathens</hi> did ever exceed them.

                  </note> whereby some of them were choaked; If they suspected that any had hidden their gold or silver,<note place="margin">Horrible cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties.</note> they used exquisite torments to make them to confesse it; They wound and tied about the heads of some, strong matches or cords, and with short truncheons twisted them till blood came out of their eyes, ears, and noses, yea sometimes till their eyes started out of their heads; to others they tied burning matches between their fingers, yea to their eyes, ears, noses, tongues, cheeks, breasts, leggs, and secret parts; yea, such parts that nature hideth, they either stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with gunpowder, or hung bags of powder to them, and so gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fire to it, in an horrible manner they burst their bellies, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them. With bodkins they made holes, or with knives they cut the skin and flesh of many. They drew strings and cords through the fleshie parts of some, and through the muscles of their thighs, leggs, armes, &amp;c. or through their noses, ears, lips, &amp;c. Some they hung up in the smoak, drying them with small fires, and sometimes refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with small drink, or water, taking care lest in their torments they should die too soon. Some they put into hot Ovens, roasting or smothering them there. Some they roasted with fires of straw. Some they stifled, strangled, or hanged, and this was a great favour so soon to rid them out of their pain. Of many they bound their hands and feet so hard, that the blood spirted out their fingers and toes ends. Of some they tied their hands and feet backwards together, stopping their mouths with clouts to hinder them from praying. Some they hung up with ropes fastened to their privy parts, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their cries, strove by their roarings to drown their cries, as in sport.</p>
               <p>Where they found poor creatures troubled with ruptures, they enlarged them by villanous means, filling them with gunpowder, and blowing them up as a Mine by giving fire thereto. Many they drew up on high, hanging great weights at their feet to pull their bodies out of joynt. Of some they plained their faces with Chisels. Some men they openly gelded in the presence of their wives and children. The mouths of some they set wide open with gags, and then poured down their throats stinking water, urine, and other liquid things till they grew sick, and their bellies swelled like tuns, whereby they died leasurely with greater torment.</p>
               <p>Down the throats of some they violently thrust knotted clouts, and then with a string pulled them up again, whereby they displaced their bowels, and put them to miserable torment, insomuch as some were made dumb, others deaf, others blind, and others lame.</p>

If the Husband intreated for his Wife, or the Wife for the Husband, they would take the intercessour and torture him in the same manner before the others eyes; and when any of these poor creatures in their torments or agonies of death called and cryed unto God for mercy, they would command, and seek to force them to pray and cry unto the devil.<note place="margin">Blasphemy.</note> Yea their divellishnesse proceeded so far, that they studied to find out new and unheard of torments. Some they bound, hung up, and sawed off their leggs: Of others they rubbed off the flesh off their leggs to the very bones: Of others they tied the armes backwards, and so hanged them up by those distorted parts. Many they drew through the streets of the Cities stark naked, then brake and wounded them with axes and hammers, and generally used them with such barbarous cruelty, that many begged to be shot or slain instantly, rather than to live and be partakers of such miseries. In most places they took away all the corn and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of victuals, leaving the places so bare, that many of the best Rank for the space of divers dayes after saw not one bit of bread, but were glad to live with roots and water. In other places they spoiled the inhabitants of their garments, exposing them to that nakednesse, that neither Man, Woman, nor Child had clothes to put on. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fruitful Countries were totally ruinated: Cities, Towns, and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, were spoiled and turned into pillars of fire and smoake; Churches lay desolate, the Woods were cut down, the ground lay wast and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled.</p>
               <p>One reverend aged Divine they stripped, bound him backwards upon a Table,<note place="margin">A Minister kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a Cat.</note> and set a big Cat upon his naked belley, beating and pricking the Cat to make her fix her teeth and claws therein. So that both man and Cat, with hunger, pain and anguish breathed their last.</p>
               <p>The Crabats laboured much to teach their Horses, not only to kill men, but to eat humane flesh; and consulted how to find out more new and exquisite torments than ever were before used.</p>
               <p>At the taking of <hi>Magdenburg,</hi> a godly Minister of great esteem was found in one of the Churches,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Magdenburg.</hi>
                  </note> whom they dragged out to his own house, where they ravished his Wife and Daughters before his face; his tender Infant they snatched from the Mothers breast, and stuck it upon the top of a Lance; and when his eyes and heart were glutted with this so cruel a spectacle, they brought him forth bound into the street, and there burned him with his own Books.</p>
               <p>Rapes and Ravishings were committed beyond all humane mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty; Maids and Matrons, Wives and Widdows, they forced and violated without distinction, yea, and that in the presence of their Parents,<note place="margin">Rapes and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishings.</note> Husbands and Neighbours; yea, Women great with child, and others in Child-bed: Their beastliness was such that no pen can write it, no Faith can believe it; Chappels and Churches

were not freed from their filthy pollutions; yea, Hospitals, and Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam-houses were not spared.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Hessen</hi> land they took divers poor women, some mad, some dumb, some lame, and tying up their coats about their ears so used them, as a modest pen cannot expresse.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Pomeren</hi> they took the fairest maids, and ravished them before their Parents faces, making them sing Psalms the while. One beautiful maid being hid by her Parents in a dunghil, they found her out, had their pleasure of her, then cut her in pieces, and hung up her quarters in the Church. Yea very girles of ten years old and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they ravished till some of them died; vertuous and chast wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they would threaten to kill, to throw their children into the fire, if they would not yield to their lusts. Divers maids and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to avoid the lusts of these Hell-born furies, have leaped into Rivers and Wells, and some have otherwise killed themselves; and that which was never before heard of, they did not only violate sickly and weak maids and women till they died, but committed the like filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with the dead corpses.</p>

                  <hi>ANno Christi,</hi> 1209. There were certain learned men in <hi>France,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of one <hi>Almericus</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> whose names were, Master <hi>William</hi> a sub-deacon of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> well studied in the Arts, and Divinity: <hi>Bernard</hi> another sub-deacon: <hi>William Goldsmith, Steven,</hi> a Priest: <hi>Steven</hi> of the Seller, and one <hi>John,</hi> a Priest, who upon examination held, That God was no otherwise present in the Sacramental bread, than in any other bread: That it was Idolatry to build Altars to Saints, or to cense their Images. They mocked those that kissed the Reliques: They said that the Pope was <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and <hi>Rome Babylon:</hi> That God was not seene in himself, but by his creatures: For which (when they could not be drawn to recant) they were condemned to be burnt at <hi>Paris,</hi> which accordingly was executed: <hi>Bzorius out of Caesarius.</hi> And <hi>Almenneus</hi> who had been their Master, had his body digged up in the Church-yard, and was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the field. And all <hi>French</hi> books of Divinity were for ever condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and burned.</p>

                  <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1524. At <hi>Melden</hi> in <hi>France</hi> there was one <hi>John Clark,</hi> who set up a Bill upon the Church-door against the Popes pardons,<note place="margin">

                  </note> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come thither, wherein he called the Pope Antichrist; for which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehended, he was adjudged three several days to be whipt, then to have a mark burned in his forehead as a note of infamy;<note place="margin">A mother en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth her sonne.</note> his mother a good woman, when she saw her son so pitiously scourged &amp; branded, encouraged him, crying with a loud voice, <hi>Blessed be Christ, and welcome be these marks for his sake.</hi> Afterwards he removed from thence, and went to <hi>Metz</hi> in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> where for a time he followed his calling of a Woolcarder. But the people of the City used once a year all of them to go forth into the Suburbs to worship some Idols there; whereupon <hi>John Clark,</hi> inflamed with an holy zeal, went the night before and brake down all those images; The next morning when all the Clergy and people came to the place to worship them, they found all their Idols broken upon the ground;<note place="margin">Zeale.</note> This set all in a tumult; and great searching there was after the Author of this deed; and quickly was <hi>John Clark</hi> suspected and apprehended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he presently confessed the fact, and told them the reasons why he did it.</p>
               <p>The people hereupon cried out against him in a great rage: Before the Judges he professed the pure doctrine of the Sonne of God; and thereupon was condemned to a cruel death, which he sustained with admirable patience and constancy. First his right hand was cut off; then was his nose with sharp pincers pulled violently from his face: then were his armes and breasts pulled off with the same instrument: yet he, through Gods grace, endured all with great quietnesse,<note place="margin">His torments.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing

He went to the place of execution with much joy, exhorting the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all the way; at the place of execution they tumbled him out of the Cart, and when he was upon the stage he said, <hi>O Lord, make haste to help me, tarry not, despise not the work of thy hands:</hi> and seeing some Scholars, he said to them, My brethren, I exhort you to study and learn the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, for the Word of God abideth for ever: Labour to know the Will of God, and fear not them that kill the body, but have no power over your souls.

At the place of execution he had an iron ball put into his mouth, and so he patiently took his Martyrdom at <hi>Jenvile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the same time a company of the faithful of about three or four hundred were met together at an house in <hi>Paris,</hi> in the beginning of the night, to receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; some Priests getting intelligence of it,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> gathered many of that faction toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and came, and beset the house, making an outcry that the watch might come and apprehend them, so that in a short time most of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Paris</hi> was up in armes, supposing that there had been some conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy: The people following the noise, and perceiving that they were <hi>Lutherans,</hi> they grew into a great rage, seeking to murther them, and thereupon stopped the streets and lanes with Carts, and made fires that none might escape them; but, through Gods mercy, before this tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult began, the faithful had finished their administration and prayers, with as much quiet as ever they had done; and now seeing this sudden danger, they were somewhat amazed; whereupon the Pastors of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation exhorted them and fell to prayer; after which, considering the cowardliness of the multitude, it was resolved that such as had weapons should adventure through the press; which being put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, the admirable power of God appeared, in that notwithstanding the fires, and stopping of the passages, yet they all escaped safe, only one was beaten down with stones and slain: The rest,<note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> which wanted weapons, being about one hundred and twenty, stayed in the house with the women and children, some of which leaped into Gardens, where they remained till the Magistrates came; The women, which were all persons of good quality, save six or seven, perceiving their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by reason of the fury of the people, went up into the windows, shewed their innocency, and desired that they might be tryed in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of Justice; yet there they were inclosed by the rabble for six or seven houres; At last came the Kings Atturney with many Serjeants and Officers, who with much ado appeasing the people, entred into the house, and their seeing the quality of the persons, and their innocency, the Atturney much pitied them, yet carried them to prison in the little Castle; but as they went, the furious multitude plucked and haled the Gentlewomen, tore their garments, pulled their hoods from their heads,<note place="margin">Popish rage and cruelty.</note> and all besmeared their faces with dust and dirt.</p>
               <p>In the prison they were used no better; for the Villains and Thieves being let out of their holes, and stinking Caves, these Lambs of Christ were put into their rooms.<note place="margin">Popish lyes and slanders.</note> Then followed the cruel and slanderous reports of the Friars, who in their Sermons railed upon them, told the people that they were assembled to make a banquet in the night, after which, putting out the candles, they went together <hi>Jack</hi> with <hi>Jill,</hi> after a filthy and beastly manner;<note place="margin">Satans subtilty.</note> they charged them also with sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if they conspired against the King, &amp;c. And these cursed defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations were no sooner vented, but they were spread abroad farre and wide, yea in the Court itself, and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorraine</hi> procured a certain Judge to come to the King, who testified that he found in the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:41459:162"/>
House divers Couches, upon which they intended to commit their whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and adulteries, which much enflamed the King against them.</p>
               <p>These things made the enemies to triumph exceedingly, and on the contrary, the brethren which escaped, were full of perplexity, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, sorrowing not so much for themselves, as for the imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their friends; yet they much comforted themselves in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of ther own wonderful deliverance. They upon debate also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, First, that all of them should humble themselves before God in their own families.<note place="margin">Christian wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> Secondly, That they might stop the false rumours, to write two Apologies, one to the King, and another to the People. Thirdly to write consolatory letters to their friends in prison.</p>
               <p>The Apology to the King was written and conveyed privily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Chamber, where it was met with and read openly before the King and his Nobles; yet this prevailed little; for their adversaries suggested to him that all was false, and a pretence to hide their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: But that to the people did very much good, and so did their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solatory letter to their friends in prison.</p>
               <p>The adversaries all this while did bestir themselves to bring them that were in prison to execution, and procured a Commission from the King to certain Judges to hasten their trial. But it fell out by Gods Providence, that at this time the Protestant Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> were met at a Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy at <hi>Wormes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gods merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful providence.</note> to whom divers learned men resorted from <hi>Geneva,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing them to send their Ambassadors to the <hi>French</hi> King, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of these poor Christians thus imprisoned; by whose mediation, and the Kings other business, who was now in war with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> many of them were delivered, yet some of them were executed before the coming of the Ambassodors.</p>
               <p>Amongst them were <hi>Nicholas Clivet,</hi> and one <hi>Granvelle,</hi> both of them elders of the Congregation,<note place="margin">

                  </note> who stoutly defended the truth against the <hi>Sorbone</hi> Doctors, and afterwards patiently resigned up their soules to God in the cruel flames. Also a young Gentlewoman of about twenty three years old, which came from <hi>Gascoigne</hi> to joyn her self to the Church at <hi>Paris,</hi> was brought forth with the former, and endured many conflicts with the Judges and <hi>Sorbonists</hi>; who when she was urged to recant, said, <hi>That she had learned her faith from the Word of God, and therefore there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in she would live and die:</hi> Her neighbours testified against her that there was much singing of Psalms in her house,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> and that sometimes they had seen abundance of people come out of it, and that at the death of her husband no Priest was called for,<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors.</note> &amp;c. But presently after, two of these witnesses fell out, and one slew the other with a knife.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Sens</hi> much hastened this Gentlewomans death, that he might have her estate. When she was condemned, she had her tongue cut, as the two former also were served. Going to execution, she dressed her self like a Bride,<note place="margin">Courage.</note> being that day to be married to her Spouse Jesus Christ; she went to the fire without ever changing countenance, and so quietly yielded up her spirit to God.</p>
               <p>Divers others of this Congregation suffered in the like sort: the

rest at the mediation of the Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> and the Protestant Switzers were released.</p>
               <p>In other parts of <hi>France</hi> also sundry faithful Christians were impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, cruelly racked, had their tongues cut out, and finally were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, concerning whom because I find nothing extraordinary, I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to mention them.</p>

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1559. The King of <hi>France, Henry</hi> the second, coming into the the Parliament in <hi>Paris,</hi> there was one <hi>Anne Du Bourg,</hi> a noble Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, a man of singular understanding and knowledge, bred and nursed up in the bosome of the Church of Christ, who made a bold speech before him, wherein he rendred thanks to Almighty God,<note place="margin">A Christian speech.</note> for moving the Kings heart to be present at the decision of so weighty a cause as that of Religion was, humbly intreating him to consider well thereof, being the cause of Christ himself, which of good right ought to be maintained by Princes, &amp;c. But the King instead of hearkening to his good advice, was so far incensed against him, that he caused him to be apprehended by the County of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> Constable of <hi>France,</hi> and to be carried to prison, protesting to him in these words, <hi>These eyes of mine shall see thee burnt</hi>;<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> and presently after he sent a Commission to the Judges to make his processe.</p>
               <p>During his imprisonment there was a godly woman, who was Prisoner also in a Chamber just over against his, who at her window, sometimes by words, other sometimes by signes,<note place="margin">Gods mercy.</note> did much encourage him to persevere constantly in the truth, whereby he was so comforted, that when some of his friends perswaded him to recant, he said, <hi>God forbid, for a woman hath taught me my lesson, how I ought to carry my self in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; He was often examined about sundry points of Religion,<note place="margin">Tentation re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sisted.</note> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once asked whether he had conferred with any one about them, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that <hi>he had conferred with his books, especially with the holy Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having drawn up a confession of his Faith, he intended to present it to the Parliament; but some Advocates that belonged to that Court, who pretended great love to him,<note place="margin">Tentation.</note> laboured to draw him to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other confession, not contrary to the truth, but in such ambiguous terms as might satisfie his Judges, who would not stand strictly to examine it; <hi>Du Bourg</hi> long resisted,<note place="margin">Hum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:41459:163"/>
his Christian course: That the same of his constancy was spread, not only through <hi>France,</hi> but all <hi>Christendom</hi> over: that he had been a means to confirm many weak ones, and caused others to enquire after the means of salvation: that all mens eyes were fixed on him to enquire by what means he gat out of prison, so that, if through fear and faint-heartedness, he should enterprize ought that should contradict his first Profession, he would give much scandal and offence, and therefore he exhorted him to give glory to God, to edifie his Church; telling him that then he might assure himself that God would neither leave nor forsake him.</p>
               <p>These Letters brought <hi>Du Bourg</hi> to a sight of his sin, for which ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pardon of God,<note place="margin">Recovery af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a fall.</note> without any further delay he wrote to the Judges, retracting his last, and protesting to stand to his first confession; so that shortly after he was condemned.</p>
               <p>In the mean time great feasts were preparing in the Court, for joy of the marriages that should be of the Kings daughter and sister; The day whereof being come, the King imployed all the morning in examining the President, and other Counsellors of the Parliament against <hi>Du Bourg,</hi> and other his companions that were charged with the same doctrine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to glut his eys in seeing their execution, and then went to dinner.</p>
               <p>After dinner the King being one of the Defendants at the Tilting, which was near the prison where <hi>Du Bourg</hi> and his fellows lay,<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> entred the lists, and behaved himself valiantly, breaking many spears against Count <hi>Montgomery</hi> and others, whereupon he was highly commended of the Spectators, and all thinking that he had done enough, desired him to give over with praise; But he being puffed up with their commendations, would needs run another course with <hi>Montgomery,</hi> who kneeling on his knees craved pardon, refusing to run against him; the King being ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly set on, commanded him upon his Allegiance to run, and put the spear into his hands; <hi>Montgomery</hi> thus enforced, addressed himself to the course, and the King and he meeting together, brake their spears, and the Kings He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. XXXIV. The Persecution in the time of the Civil Wars.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ANNO</hi> 1562. The Duke <hi>de Guise</hi> passing towards <hi>Paris,</hi> and coming near to <hi>Vassy,</hi> understanding that the Bell rang to a Sermon, which was to be preached in a Barn, in which place there were assembled about twelve hundred men, women, and children, he presently went vvith all his Troops to the barn, and entring into it, they cryed out <hi>Death of God, kill, kill these Huguenots</hi>;<note place="margin">Christians murthered at a Sermon.</note> then did some of them shoot at those vvhich vvere in the Galleries, others cut in pieces such as they met with. Some had their heads cleft in twain, others had their Armes and hands cut off, so that the Walls and Galleries of the Barne were died with the blood of the slain; The Duke with his sword drawn stood amongst them, charging
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:41459:164"/>
his men to kill without sparing, especially the young men: Some of these godly persons getting upon the roof, hid themselves there: but at length some of this bloody crew spying them, shot at them with long pieces, whereby many of them were slain, falling down from the roof like Pigeons. Then they fell to murthering of them all without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction; the poor Saints of God made no resistance, only praying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: and every one running to save himself, as it pleased God to direct him, many men and women were slain; others being sore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, escaped, which died shortly after; the poor mans box was taken and emptied. The Minister in the beginning of the Massacre ceased not to preach still, till one discharged his Peece against the Pulpit; Then falling upon his knees, he intreated the Lord to have mercy upon him, and upon his poor persecuted flock; and so coming down from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, attempted to escape, but by the way he received divers wounds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon finding himself as he thought, mortally hurt, he cryed, <hi>Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy hand I commend my spirit, for thou hast redeemed me O Lord God of truth</hi>; yet before he was slain, some took him and carried him before the Duke, Who said to him, who made thee so bold thus to seduce the People?<note place="margin">Slanders.</note> Sir, said the Minister, <hi>I am no seducer, but have faithfully preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ to them.</hi> Then did the Duke curse and swear, saying, Death of God, doth the Gospel teach sedition? and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Provost, he said, Take this Varlet and hang him upon a Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet; Then was the Minister delivered to two Pages, who basely abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him; The popish women also threw dirt at him, and could scarce be restrained from tearing him to pieces. He was kept close Prisoner, none being suffered to bring him necessaries; and he was oft threatned to be sown up in a sack and drowned;<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> yet at last, through Gods mercy, he was released, at the earnest request of the Prince of <hi>Portion.</hi> The pulpit was broken down,<note place="margin">Barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> the slain stript stark naked, and so the Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with his bloody Troops, sounding his trumpets as if he had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great victory.</p>
               <p>When he came to <hi>Paris,</hi> he with the Constable and Marshal of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> seized upon the King, defaced and overthrew the places where they of the Religion used to assemble, which so encouraged the Popish party, that in every place they so abused those of the Religion, as the most cruel Barbarians would have been ashamed to do the like. This caused a Civil War, wherein the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> having taken <hi>Roan,</hi> sacked it for three dayes space, and executed many of the Citizens.</p>
               <p>Not long after he went to <hi>Orleance,</hi> boasting that within twenty four houres he would win the Town; and neither spare man, woman, nor child in it, and that he would so destroy the Town that the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it should be extinct for ever; But mans purposes; and God disposes; for the same night there was a young Gentleman named <hi>John Poltrot,</hi> who watching his opportunity,<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors.</note> shot him with his pistol laden with three bullets, whereof he shortly after died; and <hi>Poltrot</hi> declared at his death, that he did it to deliver <hi>France,</hi> and especially the City of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance</hi> from the violence of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>; After whose death peace
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:41459:164"/>
was shortly after concluded between the Queen-mother and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</p>
               <p>But before this peace took place, those of the Religion suffered much in sundry parts of the Realm.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Paris</hi> they were persecuted cruelly, the Popish people being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set upon blood,<note place="margin">Persecution in <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> and the Parliament there sparing neither great nor small that fell into their hands, either of that City, or such as were brought thither upon appeal, or summons.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Senlis</hi> many godly Christians suffered much, some were beheaded,<note place="margin">At <hi>Senlis.</hi>
                  </note> some murthered in a popular tumult, some were whipt, some impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, some fined, and others sent to the Gallies, not sparing the simple women. Yet through Gods mercy, some escaped, amongst whom was one <hi>Iohn Gardens</hi> and his Wife, who living with his Wife and child in the fileds, at length determined to go back into the City, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves upon Gods providence; but when they came into the suburbs, they met some who bade the souldiers to put them to the sword. The woman kneeling down, begged of the souldiers, that if they must needs dye, they would kill her child first, saying that so she should die with the more comfort;<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> which speech of hers so wrought upon the souldiers, that they spared all their lives.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Chaalons</hi> there was a godly Minister, called <hi>Fournier,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">At <hi>Chaalons.</hi> Mr. <hi>Fournier.</hi>
                  </note> apprehended and spoiled of all that he had: They stripped him also of his apparel, instead whereof they put on him a thredbare cloak, and so carried him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in a Cart, by reason of an hurt that he had gotten in one of his feet; by the way they did nothing but jeere and scoffe at him, and every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was in danger of his life; the rude people also had almost pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him in pieces; but it pleased God that he was preserved by those which had designed him to death. When he came to <hi>Munchon</hi> he was cast into prison, and after a while there came a Captain to him with many soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who mixing mocks and threatnings together, sware that within three houres he should be hewen in pieces. After them came in some of the Judges, commanding the Jailor to load him with irons, saying to him, You are no better I am sure then Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> whom they laid in irons: but if you have as much faith as he, God will then deliver you as he did him, by sending an Angel to you. I will not, said <hi>Fournier,</hi> compare my self with Saint <hi>Peter</hi>; yet it is not twelve years ago, since for preaching the same doctrine that <hi>Peter</hi> did, I was imprisoned at <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse,</hi> and there was admirably delivered. And though <hi>Peter</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of prison, yet in the end he glorified God by his death:<note place="margin">Faith.</note> and if I should be counted worthy with him to suffer for the truth, may it not be said that I have the like precious Faith with Saint <hi>Peter?</hi> When they were gone, the Jailor forbore putting bolts upon him, because of his sore legg, yet did he put him into a straiter prison.</p>
               <p>Afterwars the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> being made Governour in that place, he was put to the torture, where first they strained his thumbs so hard with a small cord that blood came forth: Then turning his armes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:41459:165"/>
his back, they hoisted him up with a rope put between his thumbs, twitching him up and letting him down five or six times; they tied also great stones to both his great toes, and let him hang till his spirits fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:<note place="margin">Popish cruelty</note> then they let him fall with such violence upon his face, that he was grievously hurt thereby. Then was he thrown into prison, and they would not suffer him to have a Chirurgion to cure him of the gashes which the cords had made in his flesh even to the bare bones: so that his torment and anguish was very great, neither could he lift his hands to his mouth, which he was likely to lose the use of. But it so fell out by Gods Providence, that after he was condemned, news coming of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> his death,<note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> his enemies began to tremble, and some of his Judges coming to him in prison, asked him if he did not bear them ill will? He answered, that men of his Profession and Religion ought not to bear malice to any, being enjoyned by God to love and pray for those that persecuted them; Shewing also that whatsoever troubles had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him, were none other but such as God had fore-ordained for the setting forth of his own glory, for which he esteemed himself most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; yet he warned them to lay to heart the wrong that they had done him, lest the vengeance of God did sooner or later overtake them for it. The next day <hi>Bussi,</hi> one of his persecutors, having received letters from the Constable of <hi>France</hi> to release him, swore that he should be delivered indeed, but into the hands of the multitude.</p>
               <p>But it pleased God that just at that time there came by the Prince of <hi>Portion</hi> with his Germane Souldiers,<note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> which were for the Protestants, who sent word that they would not leave so much as a house standing except they would deliver <hi>Fournier</hi>; This so affrighted his enemies that they released him out of prison, protected him from the violence of the multitude,<note place="margin">His delivery.</note> and conveyed him in safety to the Prince; There he was kindly welcomed and entertained, all grieving for the miseries which he had endured, and two dayes after he preached before the Prince and his followers, and the day after, at the instant request of the Protestants of <hi>Vitri,</hi> he went to them to preach and baptize their children, and shortly after was called to <hi>Ver,</hi> where he gathered a Congregation, and spent some time amongst them with wonderful fruit; but by reason he was so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly weakned by his strait imprisonment and tortures, being above fifty years old,<note place="margin">His death.</note> he soon after finished his course, and quietly resigned up his soul unto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">At <hi>Amiens</hi> Bibles burnt.</note>At <hi>Amiens,</hi> all Bibles, New Testaments, and Psalm-books were sought for and openly burnt, as also the Ministers Pulpit: Then did the <hi>Guisians</hi> proceed to killing of the Christians, and cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into the River, some they shot to death, and others they hanged.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Abbevilli</hi> they slew the Lord of <hi>Haucourt,</hi> with divers others; one <hi>Beliart</hi> they dragged along the streets with his face downwards,<note place="margin">At <hi>Abbevilly.</hi>
                  </note> and then drowned him in the river.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">At <hi>Meaux.</hi>
                  </note>At <hi>Meaux</hi> the Protestants were the stronger Party, and therefore conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the free exercise of their Religion for a while; but the Parliament of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:41459:165"/>
                  <hi>Paris</hi> gave judgment against them, and exposed them to the spoil of such as would undertake it; Then a company of Souldiers entring the Town, disarmed the Citizens, and slew about foure hundred of the Religion; Then <hi>Mounsieur de Boisy</hi> entring with more Souldiers committed a thousand villanies:<note place="margin">Abominable villanies.</note> women and maids were ravished in the open mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place and streets; some were beaten and hailed to Masse; children were re-baptized: others married again; houses were pillaged and plundred: Some that fled into the field died with hunger and cold. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, women and children, were massacred and drowned; infants were dashed against the walls; and some others were hanged. The Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners running into divers places, committed a world of mischief; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Priests amongst them slew some of the Protestants with their own hands.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Troys,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">At <hi>Troys</hi> Bibles burnt.</note> Bibles and Divinity-books were rent and torn in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; They of the Religion were murthered, and their houses sacked; Eighteen men were hanged; women were dragged through the streets, and cast into the river; and Infants were pulled from their Mothers breasts, and re-baptized.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Bar</hi> the Popish enemies entring the Town, committed such cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties as never were seen, especially against women and little children;<note place="margin">At <hi>Bar.</hi>
                  </note> Some of their breasts they cut open,<note place="margin">Popish cruelty</note> pulled out their hearts and gnawed them with their teeth, rejoycing that they had tasted of an <hi>Huguenots</hi> heart; A young Counsellor they hanged at the request of his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; with most horrible blasphemies they ravished women and girls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mounsieur de S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Esteen</hi> with his two brothers were cruelly stabbed by their own Cousin germane, their wives were spoiled of all they had, and led away prisoners.</p>
               <p>The Pesants in some places committed infinine murthers and mischiefs against those of the Religion; <hi>Monsieur de Vigney</hi> with his wife and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants they massacred in his own house, which afterward they pillaged and spoiled.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Crant,</hi> the Pesants entring the Town, murthered many; one young child together with his father they burnt.<note place="margin">At <hi>Crant.</hi>

                  </note> and their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked bodies thrown into the River; one hundred houses were plundered, the Church where they preached was defaced.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Auxerre</hi> one <hi>Cosson</hi> was barbarously massacred; a faire young Gentlewoman was stabbed and cast into the River;<note place="margin">At <hi>Auxerre.</hi>
                  </note> many other outrages and robberies were committed.</p>

                     <hi>At Nevers.</hi>
                  </note> whereof one perished miserably there; Another miraculously escaped; Children were re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, marriages reiterated, and many houses plundred.</p>
               <p>The Popish party entring <hi>Chastillon,</hi> left no kind of cruelty un-exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, neither upon Women nor Children, old nor young;<note place="margin">

                  </note>At <hi>Guyen</hi> they used all the cruelty that possibly could be invented: and some <hi>Italians,</hi> in hatred of the Religion, cut an infant in two pieces, and eat his liver.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Montargis,</hi> there lived the Lady <hi>Rene,</hi> Dutchesse Dowager of <hi>Ferrara,</hi>

                     <hi>At Mans.</hi>
                  </note> the houses of the Protestants were pillaged; such as were fled, were executed by their pictures, their goods confiscated, and their children made uncapable of their offices and estates, yea of inheriting their Lands. Some they beheaded; Others they hung up; Others they massacred, and being half dead, threw them into the River: Above one hundred and twenty men, women, and children were murthered in the neighbouring Villages. One Captain threw above fifty persons into his fishpond to feed his Pikes, and above as many more were thrown into Ditches.</p>
               <p>One godly man, a Weaver, had his throat cut, and his moutastuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with leaves of a New Testament which they found bouth him.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Above eighty other persons were executed.

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1562. a Decree was made by the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi>

This encouraged all sorts of rascals to rise up in Armes, forsaking their Vocations, and to march against the Protestants.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Ligueul</hi> they hanged up some, put out the Ministers eyes,<note place="margin">In <hi>Ligueul.</hi>

               <p>At <hi>Tours,</hi> one hundred and forty were murdered and cast into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; divers others were drowned, sparing neither man, woman,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Shortly after came thither the Duke <hi>de Monpensier,</hi> who caused gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, wheels and stakes to be set up, whereupon many more, especially of the richer sort, were murthered to the number of some hundreds: when they put any man or woman to death, they entred their houses, murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their children, and took all their goods.</p>
               <p>A poor woman, whose husband was a little before drowned, having a young infant sucking at her breasts, and a beautiful daughter of about sixteen years old in her hand; These bloody villains drew them to the River: there the woman on her knees prayed ardently unto God: then took her infant, and shifting it in the Sun, laid it upon the grasse: In the mean while this hellish Rabble endeavoured, partly by threats, partly by fair promises to seduce the young maid; and one of them finer then the rest, promised to marry her if she would do it,<note place="margin">Popish subtilty</note> so that the poor wench stood in a disway, which her mother perceiving, who was now ready to be thrown into the River, she earnestly exhorted her daughter to persist in the truth; the daughter hereupon cryed out, <hi>I will live and die with my Mother, whom I know to be a vertuous woman: as for your threats and promises I regard them not, do with me what you please.</hi> The mother was not yet dead when they threw in the daughter after her, where making towards her mother, they mutually embraced each other,<note place="margin">The Mother and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter drowned.</note> and so yielded up their souls into the hands of God.</p>
               <p>Also in the same City there was a godly Matron called <hi>Glee,</hi> who was carried before the Captain, where she gave a reason of her Faith,<note place="margin">

The Admiral was allowed to bring with him fifty Gentlemen armed for his greater security. When he came to <hi>Paris,</hi> he was honourably received and conducted to the King, who calls him his Father,<note place="margin">Divellish dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</note> protesting that in all his life he had not seen any day more agreeable to his mind than that, wherein he assured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to see the end of all troubles, and the beginning of firm peace and quietness in his Realm: the Queen-mother and the rest of the great Courtiers received him with greater favour than he expected: Then did the King send him one hundred thousand Franks out of his treasury for the losses which he had received in the wars, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Admiral had divers advertisements of the intended treachery; yet God so blinded him at that time, though a very prudent man, that he gave little heed to them. Yea such a general stupidity seized upon the Protestants, that their minds were very wavering,<note place="margin">Sin the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.</note> and few there were that shewed themselves zealously bent to Religion; but all both great and small, thinking deeply upon worldly matters, built them goodly Castles in the aire.</p>

               <p>The Admiral was again advertised of his danger; but he resting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the testimony of a good conscience, and the providence of God, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreted those advices, as if they proceeded from men desirous of new troubles. Many Lords and Gentlemen of the Religion, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France,</hi> the better to delude the Protestants, spake open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he gave not his sister to the King of <hi>Navar</hi> only, but as it were to the whole Church of the Protestants to joyn with them in an indisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble union,<note place="margin">Dissimulation.</note> and as a tie to their peace and safety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>August</hi> 17. <hi>Anno</hi> 1572. The King of <hi>Navar</hi> and the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> were married by the Cardinal of <hi>Bourborn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The K. of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var</hi> married.</note> upon a scaffold in the sight of all the people, and that day was spent in banquets, dances, and masks, with a strange mixture of Protestants and Papists together; but in the mean time the Queen mother with her Privadoes, as also the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> with the <hi>Guises,</hi> consulted about killing the Admiral, and dividing the Protestants.</p>
               <p>Five dayes after, as the Admiral came from the Court, accompanied with about fifteen Gentlemen, reading a petition as he went, one shot at him with a Caliver;<note place="margin">The Admiral shot.</note> the bullet taking away his right fore-finger, hurt him in the left arm: he that shot had a Spanish Jennet at the back-door of his lodging, upon which he immediately mounted and esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: The door being burst open, it was found that the Caliver left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, was brought to the house the day before by one <hi>Chally,</hi> steward of the Kings house, and a great dealer for the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>; the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral being conveyed to his lodging, shewed most admirable piety, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and constancy.</p>
               <p>The King complained of the mischief, swearing and promising to execute such justice upon the offendor, that the Admiral and all his friends should thinke themselves well satisfied. He caused also all the gates of <hi>Paris</hi> to be shut,<note place="margin">Dissimulation.</note> swearing and blaspheming, that he would not that they which had done the fact should escape; he also appointed many Lords and Gentlemen of the Protestants to lodge in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals quarter, the better, as he pretended, to secure themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any danger.</p>
               <p>After noon the King went to visit the Admiral, and there, with many Oaths and protestations, assured him of his love to him, care over him and them of the Religion, and that he would severely punish the Authors of his present hurt. Presently after the <hi>Vidame</hi> of <hi>Chartres [John de Ferri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers]</hi> advised the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Admiral, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chief Lords of the religion,<note place="margin">Good counsel neglected.</note> presently to depart out of <hi>Paris,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring them that that blow was but the beginning of the Tragedy
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:41459:170"/>
which was soon to ensue, but they trusting to the Kings word, rested se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</p>
               <p>That day also the King wrote to the Ambassadors of forrein Princes, and to the Governours of all his Provinces how much he was offended at the Admirals hurt, how severely he would punish it,<note place="margin">Deep dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> yea he desired that all the world might know how much he was offended at it; and the Queen-mother wrote the like.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Dukes of <hi>Anjou</hi> and <hi>Guise</hi> employed some to go from house to house to take the names of all the Protestants,<note place="margin">The Massacre suspected.</note> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Catalogue to them, so that presently after they of the Religion began to discover that some bloody intentions were hatching against the Admiral and his friend. For the King set a guard of fifty Harquebushires at the Admirals gate. Great store of Armes were carried into the Loure, and about evening all the people were in Armes.</p>
               <p>The chief of the Protestants hereupon assembled again in the Admirals lodging, where the <hi>Vidame</hi> of <hi>Chartres</hi> advised as before, that they should essay presently to carry the Admiral out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that the rest should presently dislodge; yet all the rest refused this counsel, resolving to relie upon the Kings word, who had promised them Justice.</p>
               <p>In the evening some Protestant Gentlemen proffered to watch with the Admiral, but he would not suffer them: At night the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> sent for the Captain of the Switzers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shewing him his Commission to kill the Admiral and all his partakers,<note place="margin">The Kings Commission shewed for it.</note> exhorting him and his men to be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious in shedding of blood. At midnight the Provost, Sheriffs, and Captains of every Ward had the same shewed them, with assurance that through the whole Realm the like should be done to all the Protestants, and that the watchword for the general Massacre should be the tolling of the Bell in the Palace to be rung at the break of day, and the Badge of the Executioners should be a white Handkerchif tied on their armes, and a white Crosse in their hats:<note place="margin">The Massacre begins.</note> The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> and his Associates were to begin at the Admirals lodging: Some of the Protestants being awakened with the noise in the streets of men running up and down in armes, and with torches, gat up to enquire what was the matter; but presently the Bell rung, and the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> with his cutthroats hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and knocked at the Admirals gates: he that opened them was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently stabbed; The Admiral hearing the noise, gat out of bed, and joyned with his Minister [Master <hi>Merlin</hi>] in fervent prayer, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his soul into the hands of God; Then said he,<note place="margin">Of <hi>Merlins</hi> miraculous escape, see in my book of Examples.</note> 
                  <hi>It is long since I dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed my self to die; save you your selves if it be possible, for you cannot save my life; I commit my soul into the hands and mercy of God</hi>; Then did <hi>Merlin</hi> his Minister, and the rest get up to the top of the house, and crept out of windows into the gutters to hide themselves; yet most of them were slain in the next house: Then seven or eight men brake into the Admirals chamber, and one of them went to him with his naked sword offering him the point, to whom he said; <hi>Young man, thou oughtest to respect any age and infirmity, yet shalt thou not shorten my life</hi>; with that he thrust him into the body, and all the rest laid at him, so that he fell to the ground,<note place="margin">The Admiral slain.</note> where he

lay gasping: The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> below called to them to throw his body out at window, which they did: his face being all bloody, the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> wiped it, and looking on it, said, <hi>Now I know him, it is he,</hi> and so kicked him on the face with his foot, whom all the murtherers in <hi>France</hi> feared so much when he was alive.</p>
               <p>Then went he out into the streets, crying, <hi>Courage my fellows, we have here made a good beginning, let us now fall upon the rest, the King commands it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>All the Attendants of the King of <hi>Navar</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> which lay in the Kings Palace were massacred; the like was done to the Lords and Gentlemen that lay about the Admirals lodging, and then through all the City were the Protestants murthered,<note place="margin">Ten thousand slain in <hi>Paris.</hi>

               <p>The Lords and Gentlemen were most inhumanely mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There were at this time in <hi>Paris</hi> about sixty thousand men with pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stols, pikes, curtelaces, poinards, knives, and such other bloody instruments, that ran up and down swearing and blaspheming the sacred Majesty of God, cruelly massacring all that they met with: The streets were cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with mangled bodies, gates and doors defiled with blood; Shoutings &amp; howlings of the murtherers, mixed with the cries and groans of the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;<note place="margin">The river died red with blood</note> the breaking open of doors and windows, with the noise of guns and pistols, all which made an hellish noise; multitudes of dead bodies were thrown into the <hi>Seine,</hi> which was died red with their blood.</p>
               <p>The King certified the King of <hi>Navar</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> of all that was done, saying, that he saved their lives upon condition that they should renounce their Religion, and turn Papists. The King of <hi>Navar</hi> desired him not to force his conscience, but to remember the Alliance so lately contracted betwixt them: The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> with more zeal told him,<note place="margin">Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de's</hi> zeal, and courage.</note> that his body and estate were in his power to do with them what he pleased; but for his Religion he was fully purposed not to forsake it, but to remain constant therein to the losse of his life; he put the King in minde also that he had given his faith to him, and to those
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:41459:171"/>
of the Religion, and therefore he hoped he would not falsifie his oath, &amp;c. This so enraged the King that he called him rebel, and the sonne of a rebellious person, with horrible threatnings that he should lose his head if within three days he altered not his mind.</p>
               <p>The King and his Confidents perceiving that this Massacre would not quench the fire, but rather stirre up the Protestants in other parts of the Kingdome to defend themselves; they presently dispatched away letters to the Governours of Towns, with expresse commands to mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scacre all the Protestants: yet at the same time the King wrote other letters, wherein he laid the fault of the murther of the Admiral up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Duke of <hi>Guise:</hi>

               <p>Upon the receipt of the first letters, the Papists fell upon the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants at <hi>Meaux, Trois, Orleance,</hi> and other places, and murthered them without all pity, besides such as were massacred in Villages and Fields, where they thought to save themselves, so that in a few weeks there were above thirty thousand persons massacred in <hi>France.</hi> But besides this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral account, some particulars deserve remembrance,<note place="margin">Above thirty thousand mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacred in three moneths</note> which are these that follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monsieur de la Place,</hi> President of the Court of Requests, had a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain armed that came into his house, telling him that the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> had slain the Admiral at the Kings appointment, with many other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots, and that he was come to protect him in that common destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, only he desired a sight of the Gold and Silver that was in his house: The <hi>L. de la Place</hi> amazed at his audaciousnesse, asked him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he thought that there was a King or no?

               <p>A godly young man going early abroad on the Sabbath morning, and hearing of the death of the Admiral, and seeing the insurrection, out of a singular child-like affection to his mother, he hasted home, informed her of the danger, secured her in a place of great secresie; after which he shut himself up in his study,<note place="margin">A dutiful and loving son.</note> by Prayer to fit himself for death, into which the murtherers breaking with battleaxes and staves, so loaded him with blows on the head, that he received his blood into his own hands; and when they had killed him, they threw him into the river.</p>

The dead corpses were carried out, and lay spread like dung upon the face of the earth, and when they were about to throw them into the river, an Apothecary told them that much money might be made of their grease, whereupon all the fat bodies were sought out, ripped up,<note place="margin">Their grease is sold.</note> and their grease sold for three shillings a pound; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, after many jears bestowed upon the dead carcasses, some were tumbled into a great pit, others thrown into the river.

Then were all the prisoners brought together into one place, and letters procured from the King to massacre them all: and accordingly some leud persons, armed with axes and butchers knives, were sent to effect it, who calling them out one by one, murthered them all, not permitting them so much as to speak, much lesse to pray. The number of the slain was above three hundred, who were all stript stark naked,<note place="margin">Three hundred murthered.</note> and their bodies left to the common view of all for two dayes together: then were they, thus naked, thrown into pits one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, only the Counsellors were hung up in their long gowns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Elme in the Palace-yard; all their houses vvere also sacked and plundred.</p>

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1573. <hi>Sancerre</hi> was besieged by the Lord of <hi>Chastre,</hi> with an Army, who planting his Cannons, played incessantly upon the Town, so that the stones of the wall,<note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> the pavement in the streets, and the shivers of timber flew about continually, yet the mighty power and providence of God herein appeared, that none within the City were slain, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one maid that was slain with the breath of a Cannon-bullet: yet were the stocks of Musquets sometimes broken in the hands and on the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the townsmen, and themselves not hurt; yea some had their coats, breeches and hats shot through, and their bodies not hurt; yea some stones that were beaten off the wall, flew violently between a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters legs, and hurt him not. Many were the assaults given to this Town, yet still the Assailants were beaten back with great losse.</p>
                  <p>The siege continuing long, the Townsmen began to be in want,<note place="margin">A terrible Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</note> so that they were forced to eat their Horses, Asses, and
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:41459:175"/>
Mules, which food lasted but a moneth, then they did eate all the dogs, cats, rats, mice, and moles that they could get: and those also being spent, they lived upon hides of beasts, Calves and Sheep-skins: then did they eate parchment, horse and beasts hoofs, hornes, Lanthorns, halters, and furniture for horses, girdles o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> leather, herbs and wild-roots; and these being all spent, and no bread left in the City, such as could get Linseed, or any other seed, ground it, or beat it in a morter, and made bread thereof, as also of herbs mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with bran if they could get it: This being spent they eate bread made of straw-meal, powder of nutshels, yea of slates; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, old ointments, and other old grease served to make pottage, and with it also they fried the excrements of horses and men, which they did eate, yea the filth in the streetes was not spared.</p>
                  <p>In this extremity a poor labourer and his wife were taken and executed for eating the head, intrals and brains of their daughter of three years old, that died of famine; they had dressed also the rest of her body to eat at other times; and that which aggravated their fault was, that it was proved that that day there was given to them a little pottage made with herbs and wine,<note place="margin">Two executed for eating part of their own daughter.</note> which might have satisfied them in that necessity: Such as went forth of the walls to seek relief, were either slaine by the enemy, or lived upon sprigs of vines, black-berries, red snailes, and herbs; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other sad and lamentable spectacles, one was of a labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and his wife found dead amongst the Vines, and two of their children crying by them, the lesser being but sixe weekes old, which a charitable Widow took home to her house and sustained: Many dyed in this famine, some in their houses, others fell down in the streets, and gave up the ghost; most of the children under twelve yeares old died: Lamentable it was to heare the poor fathers and mothers mourning and weeping to see their misery and yet they could not relieve them; Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse most of them did wonderfully encourage themselves with the assurance of the grace of God, whereof there is this notable example.</p>
                  <p>A boy of five years old, languishing divers weeks, ran along the streets, till nature failing him, he fell down in the presence of his father and mother, who wept and lamented over him; and feeling upon his armes and legs, they were as dry as a stick; whereupon the child said; <hi>Why do you thus weep to see me die of hunger? I ask you no bread, mother,</hi>

                        <hi>A</hi> remarkable story.</note> 
                     <hi>for I know you have none; but seeing it is the Will of God that I should die in this sort, I must take it thankfully: Had not the holy man</hi> Lazarus <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? Have not I read it in my Bible?</hi> and saying so, he yielded up his spirit unto God.</p>
                  <p>That which preserved all from being famished, was this; There were yet sixe Kine kept to give milke for some infants, and certaine horses of service which were reserved for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity;
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:41459:176"/>
These were killed, and their flesh sold to comfort those that lived. Also some little corne was brought into the Towne by stealth, which was sold for two shillings sixe pence a pound.</p>
                  <p>The war killed but eighty four persons, but the famine killed above five hundred, besides those which were brought so low that they hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered.</p>
                  <p>During these miseries, divers souldiers, and some townsmen gat out, chusing rather to die by the sword of the Enemy, than by famine, of whom some were slain, others imprisoned, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1593. There was one <hi>Margaret Pierron</hi> of the Town of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who by her maid-servant was accused to the Jesuites, for not going to Masse, and for keeping a Bible in her house, in reading whereof was her whole delight; The Jesuites, complaining hereof to the Magistrate, caused her to be apprehended, yet had she some notice of it before-hand from her friends that advised her to flie from the danger; but God had a purpose that she should bear witness to his truth, so that she was taken and cast into prison; After a while the Judges sent for her, saying, <hi>Margaret, Are you not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to returne home to your house, and there to enjoy your husband and children? Yes,</hi> said she, <hi>if it may stand with the good Will of God; Then,</hi> said they, <hi>if thou wilt do but a small matter thou shalt be set at liberty;</hi>

                     <hi>If,</hi> said she, <hi>it be not contrary to Gods glory and mine own salvation, you shall hear what I will say to you. No such thing,</hi> said they, <hi>for all that we require is but this, that a Scaffold being set up in the chief part of the City, you shall there crave pardon for offending the Law, and a fire being by, you shall burne your Bible in it without speaking a word. I pray you my Masters,</hi> said she, <hi>Tell me, is my Bible a good Book or no? Yea,</hi> said they, <hi>we confesse it is: Why then,</hi> said she, <hi>would you have me cast it into the fire? On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> said they, <hi>to give the Jesuites content: imagine it to be but paper, and then you may burne it, and you may buy you another Bible at any time, and hereby you may save your life.</hi> Thus they spent above two hours in perswading her, that thereby she might do a lesse evil, and a greater good would come of it: But she confidently answered, that by the help of God she would never do it: <hi>What will the people say</hi> (said she) <hi>will they not say,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">She chooses to be burnt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to burne her Bible.</note>

                  <p>Then did they commit her close prisoner, fed her only with bread and water, and her friends were debarred from coming to her: but when nothing could remove her from her constancy, she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

               <p>THe <hi>Grison</hi> Lords, who were the Soveraign Magistrates of this Countrey, had by sundry Decrees granted liberty to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants to exercise their Religion freely: But when as the Minister of <hi>Tell,</hi> with his Congregation,<note place="margin">Popish trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</note> were met together about the service of God, the bloody Papists rising in arms, set upon them, slew one, and beate others so cruelly with staves, that they were forced to desist from their purpose: Shortly after they murthered some others,<note place="margin">Cruelty.</note> and conspiring with some other bloody villaines, they set guards upon all the passages of the valley, that so none of the Protestants should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape them; then ringing their bells, they raised all the Countrey, and if any Protestants stirred out of their houses, they murthered them in the streets: they also brake into the houses of others, drew them out of their beds, and murthered them. Some of the Protestants retired to the houses of Papists that were neer of kin, or otherwise engaged to them, to secure themselves, but there they were betrayed and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered: Some they strangled; some they shot; Of some they beate out their brains, and others they drowned in the river <hi>Alba.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A noble Gentleman that had hid himself in the river,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> Noble Gentleman murthered.</note> was found by them, who requested them to spare his life, for his dear childrens sake: But they told him that this was no time for pity, except he would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure his faith, and swear by the Popes Bull: Nay said he, <hi>God forbid, that to save this temporal life, I should deny my Lord Jesus Christ, who with his precious blood upon the Crosse redeemed me at so dear a rate;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Christ prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before all.</note> 
                  <hi>and having through his grace so long freely and publikely professed him, that I should now hazard the losse of eternal life, to which I was elected before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world; I say God forbid.</hi> Hereupon in a barbarous and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage manner they murthered him. They brake also into the Palace of the Governour, and murthered him; women and maidens they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floured; and of all the Protestants in that part of the Countrey, there were onely three that escaped over the horrid and vast mountains of the <hi>Alps</hi> into <hi>Rhetia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These wicked villaines having thus dispatched the Protestants in this place, they marched to another, coming just at the time when the Protestants were at Church hearing a Sermon: They were guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the place by two Friers; the Protestants seeing them coming, shut the Church doors, barricadoing them up with benches: these villaines laboured to break open the door, but when they could not readily do it, they clambred up into the windows, through which they shot with their musquets at the people, whereby they

Then did they more openly discover their malice, killing the Protestants where ever they met them: hereupon some eighteen of the Protestants, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with some Ladies and young children gat together; and the men being well armed, they marched close together, repulsing their enemies, and at last came to a Church in the mountain of <hi>Sondresse,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which place a Minister, and some others, in all, about seventy three men were gathered together, and after their prayers made unto God, they passed the Valley of <hi>Malaneo,</hi> which was beset by the enemy on two sides; but such as kept the passages, were by Gods special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,<note place="margin">

               <p>Then did the Pesants joyne with these villaines to rob and plunder the houses of the Protestants, and amongst them, divers Noblemens houses richly furnished with great abundance; They ran up and down also through fields, woods and mountains, searching every bush for the Protestants; and as they found any of them, they presently murthered them.</p>

               <p>Immediately after dinner the fire was prepared, and he was led to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution; yet most men thought that it was only to terrifie him, and to cause him to recant. But God, for his own glory, the good of his servants, and for the manifestation of their beastly tyranny, had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise decreed: for he so strengthned him, that neither the love of life, nor fear of that cruel death could once move him to swerve from the truth which he had professed. At the place of execution he gave to his servant that had long attended him,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> his Gown, Coat, Cap, and his other garments, saying, <hi>These will not profit in the fire, they will profit thee; After this of me thou canst receive no commodity except the example of my death, which I pray thee to beat in minde; for though it be bitter to the flesh, and fearful before men, yet it is the entrance into eternal life, which none shall possesse which denies Christ Jesus before this wicked generation</hi>; and so being tyed to the stake in the midst of coals and timber, they gave fire to some powder, which with the blast scorched his left hand and the side of his face, but neither killed him nor kindled the wood and coals; till they ran to the Castle for more powder, and more combustible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which being at last kindled, with a loud voice he cryed: <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus receive my spirit; how long shall darknesse overwhelme this Realme? and how long wilt thou suffer the tyranny of these men?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> The fire was slow, and therefore put him to the greater torment; but that which most grieved him was the clamour of some wicked men set on by the Friars, who continually cryed, <hi>Turn thou Heretick; call upon our Lady; say</hi> Salve Regina, &amp;c. To whom he answered, <hi>Depart from me and trouble me not thou messenger of Satan</hi>; And speaking to one <hi>Campbel,</hi> a Friar that was the Ringleader, who still roared on him with great vehemency, he said to him; <hi>Wicked man, thou knowest the contrary, and hast confessed the contrary to me; I appeale thee before the Tribunal seat of Jesus Christ</hi>; after which words he resigned up his spirit unto God, <hi>Anno Christi,</hi>

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1534.

He much frequented the company of the Laird of <hi>Dun Areskin,</hi> whom God in those dayes had marvellously illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated: hearing the text read, (for he could not read himself) <hi>He that denieth me before men, or is ashamed of me in the midst of this wicked generation, I will deny him before my Father and his holy Angels</hi>; At those words being suddenly as one revived, he fell upon his knees, and stedfastly lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, at length he burst forth into these words; <hi>O Lord, I have been wicked, and justly mayst thou withdraw thy grace from me; but, Lord, for thy mercy sake,</hi>

               <p>Not long after the burning of these two holy men; There was one Deane <hi>Thomas Forret,</hi> who used to preach every Lords day to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishoners, out of the Epistles and Gospels as they fell in order:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thomas Forret.</hi>
                  </note> This was counted a great novelty, for none used to preach but the Friars, and therefore they envying him, accused him to the Bishop of <hi>Dunkel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> for an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and one that shewed the mysteries of Scripture to the vulgar people.</p>
               <p>The Bishop instigated by the complaint of the Friars, called the said <hi>Deane Thomas</hi> before him, to whom he said, <hi>My joy</hi> Deane <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, I love you well, and therefore I must give you counsel how to govern your self</hi>; The Deane thanked him; and then he proceeded, <hi>My joy</hi> Deane Thomas, <hi>I am informed that you preach the Epistle and Gospel every Sunday to your people, and that you take not your dues from them, which is very preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the Churchmen; and therefore my joy</hi> Deane Thomas, <hi>I would have you take your dues, or else its too much to preach every sunday; for by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you make the people think that we should do so also; Its enough for you when you find a good Epistle or Gospel, to set forth and preach the liberty of holy Church, and let the rest alone.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> answered, <hi>My Lord, I presume none of my Parishoners complaine for my not taking my dues; and whereas you say its too much to preach every Sunday, I think it is too little, and wish that your Lordship would do the like.

Death cannot hurt us, for it is already destroyed by him for whose sake we now suffer.</hi> And thus passing chearfully on, they constantly triumphed over death and Satan, in the midst of the flaming fire where they gave up their spirits to God.</p>

formerly a Professor of Religion, inhibited him from preaching, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring him that he should trouble their Town no more, for he would not suffer it; and this was spoken to him in the publick place; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he mused a space, with his eyes bent unto heaven, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards looking sorrowfully upon the speaker and people, he said, <hi>God is witnesse that I never minded your trouble, but your comfort; yea your trouble is more dolorous to me then it is to your selves:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Prophesie.</note> 
                  <hi>But I am assured that to refuse Gods Word, and to chase from you his Messenger, shall not preserve you from trouble, but shall bring you into it: for God shall send you Ministers that shall neither feare burning nor banishment. I have offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you the word of salvation; with the hazard of my life I have remained amongst you: Now ye your selves refuse me, and I must leave my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency to be declared by my God; If it be long prosperous with you, I am not led by the spirit of truth: But if unlookt for trouble come upon you, acknowledge the cause, and turn to God who is gracious and mercifull; but if you turn not at the first warning, he will visit you with fire and sword</hi>; and so he came down from the Pulpit. Some Noble men being present, would have perswaded him to stay, or to have gone with them into the Countrey, but by no means would he stay till he had past the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Tay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then went he into the West-countrey, where he made offers of Gods Word,<note place="margin">He goeth into the West.</note> which was gladly received by many, till the Bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> by the instigation of the Cardinal, came with his Traine to the town of <hi>Ayre</hi> to resist <hi>Wischard</hi>; The Earl of <hi>Glencarne</hi> and some other Gentlemen hearing of it, came thither also with their retinue, and when they were all come together, the Bishop would needs have the Church himself to preach in. Some opposed, but <hi>Wischard</hi> said, <hi>Let him alone, his Sermon will not do much hurt, let us go to the Market-Crosse,</hi> and so they did,<note place="margin">He is opposed by the Bishop.</note> where he made so notable a Sermon, that his very enemies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were confounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wischard</hi> remained with the Gentlemen in <hi>Kyle,</hi> preaching some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in one place, sometimes in another, but coming to <hi>Machlene,</hi> he was perforce kept out of the Church; Some would have broken in, but he said to one of them, <hi>Brother, Jesus Christ is as mighty in the fields as in the Church, and himself often preached in the Desert, at the Sea-side and, other places. Its the Word of Peace God sends by me: the blood of none shall be shed this day for the preaching of it</hi>; and so going into the fields, he stood upon a bank, were he continued in preaching to the people above three houres; and God wought so wonderfully by that Sermon,<note place="margin">The power of the Word.</note> that one of the wickedst men in all the Country, the Laird of <hi>Sheld</hi> was converted by it, and his eyes ran down with such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of tears, that all men wondred at it. Presently news was brought to <hi>Wischard</hi> that the plague was broke out in <hi>Dundee,</hi> which began within four dayes after he was prohibited preaching there, and raged so extreamly,<note place="margin">His Prohesie accomplished.</note> that its almost beyond credit how many died in twenty foure houres space; This being related to him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the importunity of his friends, he would needs go thither, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:41459:184"/>
                  <hi>They are now in trouble, and need comfort; Perhaps this hand of God will make them now to magnifie and reverence that Word of God, which before they lightly esteemed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Coming to <hi>Dundee,</hi> the joy of the faithful was exceeding great, and without delay he signified that the next day he would preach;<note place="margin">His second<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> coming to <hi>Dundee.</hi>
                  </note> and because most of the inhabitants were either sick, or imployed about the sick, he chose the East-gate for the place of his preaching, so that the whole were within, and the sick without the gate; His text was <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. <hi>He sent his Word and healed them, &amp;c.</hi> wherein he comfortably intreated of the profit and comfort of Gods Word, the punishment that comes by the contempt of it, the readinesse of Gods mercy to such as truly turn to him, and the happinesse of those whom God takes from this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, &amp;c. By which Sermon he so raised up the hearts of those that heard him, that they regarded no death, but judged them more happy that should then depart, rather than such as should remain behind; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that they knew not whether they should have such a Comforter with them. He spared not to visit them that lay in the greatest extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and to comfort them.<note place="margin">Charity.</note> He provided all things necessary for such as could take food, the Town being very bountiful to them, through his instigation. But whilst he was thus busying himself for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the afflicted, the Devil stirred up the Cardinal, who corrupted a desperate Popish Priest, called <hi>John Weighton,</hi> to slay him. And on a day the Sermon being ended, and the people departed, suspecting no danger,<note place="margin">He is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being murthered.</note> the Priest stood waiting at the bottome of the stairs with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked dagger in his hand, under his gown, but Master <hi>VVischard</hi> being of a sharp piercing eye, seeing the Priest as he came down, said to him, <hi>My friend what would you have?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and withal clapping his hand upon the dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, took it from him; The Priest herewith being terrified, fell down upon his knees, confessed his intention, and craved pardon; A noise being hereupon raised, and it coming to the ears of those which were sick, they cryed, <hi>Deliver the Traytor to us, or we will take him by force,</hi> and so they burst in at the gate, but <hi>VVischard</hi> taking him in his armes, said, <hi>VVhosoever hurts him shall hurt me, for he hath done me no mischief,</hi>

                  <hi>but much good, by teaching me more heedfulnesse for the time to come</hi>; and so he appeased them, and saved the Priests life.</p>
               <p>When the plague was almost quite ceased, he took his leave of them, saying, that <hi>God had almost put an end to the battel, and that he was now called to another place</hi>; for the Gentlemen of the West had written to him to meet them in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where he should dispute with the Bishops, and should be publickly heard, which he willingly assented to: but first he went to <hi>Montrosse,</hi> to salute the Church there, where he sometimes preached,<note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Montrosse.</hi>

               <p>Amongst others that came to hear him preach, there were two Gray-friars, who, standing at the Church door,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> whispered to such as came in: which <hi>Wischard</hi> observing, said to the people, <hi>I pray you make roome for these two men, it may be they come to learn</hi>; and turning to them, he said, <hi>Come neer, for I assure you, you shall hear the Word of truth, which this day shall seale up to you either your salvation or damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; and so he proceeded in his Sermon, supposing that they would be quiet; but when he perceived that they still continued to disturb all the people that stood near them, he said to them the second time with an angry countenance; <hi>O Ministers of Satan, and deceivers of the souls of men; will ye neither hear Gods truth your selves, nor suffer others to hear it?

               <p>Afterwards he preached in divers other places, the people much flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after him; In all his Sermons foretelling the shortnesse of time that he had to travel, and the near approaching of his death.</p>

                  </note> the cause, as it was conceived, was this, The Earle <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who had great observance in those parts, by the instigation of the Cardinal, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited both those of the Town and Countrey from hearing him.

his mind: at last he went into the Pulpit, and his Auditory being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry small, he began on this manner: <hi>O Lord, how long shall it be that thy holie Word shall be despised, and men shall not regard their own salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? I have heard of thee, O</hi> Haddington, <hi>that in thee there used to be two or three thousand persons at a vain and wicked play:</hi>

Sore and fearful shall be the plagues that shall ensue upon this thy contempt; with fire and sword shalt thou be plagued; yea thou</hi> Haddington <hi>in special, strangers shall possesse thee; and you the present inhabitants shall either in bondage serve your enemies, or else you shall be chased from your own habitations, and that because ye have not known, nor will know the time of your visitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Prophesie was accomplished not long after, when the <hi>English</hi> took <hi>Haddington,</hi> made it a garrison, enforced many of the inhabitants to flie: oppressed others; and after awhile, a great plague breaking forth in the Town, whereof multitudes died, the English were at last forced to quit it, who at their departure burnt and spoiled great part of it, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be possessed by such as could first seize upon it, which were the <hi>French</hi> that came as Auxiliaries to <hi>Scotland,</hi> with a few of the ancient inhabitants, so that <hi>Haddington</hi> to this day never recovered her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer beauty, nor yet men of such wisdome and ability as did formerly inhabit it.</p>
               <p>That night was Master <hi>Wiseheart</hi> apprehended in the house of <hi>Orme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi>

                  </note> by the Earle <hi>Bothwel,</hi> suborned thereunto by the Cardinal. The manner was thus; After Sermon he took his last farewel of all his friends in <hi>Haddington; John Knox</hi> would faine have gone with him; but he said, <hi>Return to your children, and God blesse you; One is sufficient for one sacrifice</hi>; Then went he the Laird of <hi>Ormestons</hi> with some others that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him. After Supper he held a comfortable discourse of Gods love to his children, then he appointed the 51. <hi>Psalm</hi> to be sung, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to his chamber.</p>
               <p>Before midnight the house was beset: and the Earle <hi>Bothwell</hi> called for the Laird of the house, and told him that it was in vain to resist, for the Governour and Cardinal were within a mile with a great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but if he would deliver Master <hi>Wischard</hi> to him, he would promise upon his honour that he should be safe, and that the Cardinal should not hurt him; Master <hi>Wischard</hi> said, <hi>Open the gates, the Will of God be done</hi>; and <hi>Bothwell</hi> coming in, <hi>Wischard</hi> said to him, <hi>I praise my God that so honourable a man as you, my Lord, receive me this night; for I am perswaded that for your honours sake you will suffer nothing to be done to me but by order of Law? I lesse feare to die openly, than secretly to be murthered:</hi> Then said <hi>Bothwel, I will not only preserve your body from all violence that shall be intended against you without order of Law,</hi>

                  <hi>but I also promise in the presence of these Gentlemen, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Governour, nor Cardinal shall have their will of you, but I will keep you in mine own house, till I either set you free, or restore you to the same place where I receive you</hi>; Then said the Lairds, <hi>My Lord, if you

make good your promise, which we presume you will, we our selves will not only serve you, but we will procure all the Professors in</hi> Lothain <hi>to do the same, &amp;c.</hi> These promises being made in the presence of God, and hands being stricken by both parties, the Earle took Master <hi>Wischard</hi> and so departed.</p>
               <p>Master <hi>Wischard</hi> was carried to <hi>Edenburgh</hi>; But gold and women ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily corrupt fleshly men; for the Cardinal gave <hi>Bothwel</hi> gold;<note place="margin">He is carried to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi>
                  </note> and the Queen, that was too familiar with him, promised him her favour, if he would deliver Master <hi>Wischard</hi> into <hi>Edenburgh</hi> Castle, which he did;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bothwel</hi> falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his promise</note> and shortly after he was delivered to the blood-thirsty Cardinal: who, seeing that it was forbidden by their Cannon Law for a Priest to sit as a Judge upon life and death; he sent to the Governour, requesting him to appoint some Lay-Judge to passe sentence of death upon Master <hi>Wischard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Governour would easily have yielded to his request, but that <hi>David Hamilton,</hi> a godly man told him, that he could expect no better an end than <hi>Saul,</hi> if he persecuted the truth which formerly he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, &amp;c. Hereupon the Governour sent the Cardinal word, that he would have no hand in shedding the blood of that good man; The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal being angry, returned this answer, that he had sent to him of meer Civility, and that he would proceed without him, and so to the great grief of the godly, the Cardinal carried Master <hi>Wiseheart</hi> to Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> and put him into the Tower there;<note place="margin">He is carried to St. <hi>Andrews.</hi>

Master <hi>Wischard</hi> was sent for to appear before them, to give an account of his seditious and <hi>Heretical</hi> doctrine, as they called it; The Cardinal caused all his retinue to come armed to the place of their sitting, which was the Abby-church, whither when Master <hi>Wischard</hi> was brought, there was a poor man lying at the door, that asked his almes, to whom he flung his purse; when he came before the Cardinal, there was a Dean appointed to preach; whose Sermon being ended, <hi>Wischard</hi> was put up into the Pulpit to hear his charge: and one <hi>Lawder,</hi> a Priest, stood over against him, and read a scrowle full of bitter accusations and curses, so that the ignorant people thought that the earth would have opened and swallowed up <hi>Wischard</hi> quick:<note place="margin">His accusation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> but he stood with great patience without moving, or once changing his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; The Priest having ended his curses, spat at Master <hi>Wischards</hi> face, saying, <hi>VVhat answerest thou? thou Runnagate, Traytor, Thief, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His patience.</note> Then did Master <hi>VVischard</hi> fall upon his knees, making his prayer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; after which he said, <hi>Many and horrible sayings unto me a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man, many words abominable for to hear, have ye spoken here this day, which not onely to teach, but even to think, I ever thought it a great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination, &amp;c.</hi> Then did he give them an account of his doctrine.

               <p>But they without having any regard to his sober and godly answers,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:41459:187"/>
presently condemned him to be burnt. After which sentence he falling upon his knees, said,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>O immortal God, how long wilt thou suffer the rage, and great cruelty of the ungodly to exercise their fury upon thy servants, which do further thy Word in this world,<note place="margin">His Prayer.</note> whereas they on the contrary seek to destroy the truth, whereby thou hast revealed thy self to the world, &amp;c. O Lord, we know certainly that thy true servants must needs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for thy names sake persecutions, afflictions, and troubles in this present world; yet we desire that thou wouldest preserve and defend thy Church which thou hast chosen before the foundations of the world, and give thy people grace to hear thy Word, and to be thy true servants in this present life.</q>

               </p>
               <p>The Captain of the Castle with some friends coming to Master <hi>Wischard,</hi> asked him if he would break his fast with them: yea, said he, very willingly, for I know you be honest men; In the mean time he desired them to hear him a little; and so he discoursed to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Lords Supper,<note place="margin">He admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> his sufferings and death for us, exhorting them to love one another, laying aside all rancor and malice as becomes the members of Jesus Christ, who continually intercedes for us to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Afterwards he gave thanks, and blessing the bread and wine, he took the bread and brake it, giving it to every one, saying, <hi>eate this, remember that Christ died for us, and feed on it spiritually</hi>; so taking the Cup, he bade them <hi>remember that Christs blood was shed for them,</hi> &amp;c. Then he gave thanks and prayed for them, and so retired into his chamber.</p>
               <p>Presently came two Executioners to him from the Cardinal, one put on him a black linnen coat, the other brought him bags of powder, which they tied about several parts of his body, and so they brought him forth to the place of execution; over against which place, the Castle windows were hung with rich hangings, and Velvet Cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons laid for the Cardinal and Prelates, who from thence fed their eyes with the torments of this innocent man; The Cardinal fearing lest <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart</hi> should be rescued by his friends, caused all the Ordnance in the Castle to be bent against the place of his execution,<note place="margin">The Cardinals feare.</note> and commanded his gunners to stand ready all the time of his burning; Then were his hands bound behind his back, &amp; so he was carried forth; In the way some
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:41459:187"/>
beggars met him, asking his alms for Gods sake: To whom he said, My hands are bound wherewith I was wont to give you almes: but the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Lord, who of his bounty and abundant grace feeds all men, vouchsafe to give you necessaries both for your bodies and souls. Then two Friars met him, perswading him to pray to our Lady to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate for him; to whom he meekly said, <hi>Cease, tempt me not, I entreat you:</hi> and so with a rope about his neck, and a chaine about his middle, he was led to the fire: then falling upon his knees, he thrice repeated; <hi>O thou Saviour of the world have mercy upon me; Father of heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Prayer at death.</note> 
                  <hi>I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my spirit into thy holy hands:</hi> Then turning to the people, he said:
<q>Christian brethren and sisters, I beseech you be not offended at the Word of God for the torments which you see prepared for me; but I exhort you that ye love the Word of God for your salvation,<note place="margin">His exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the People.</note> and suffer patiently, and with a comfortable heart for the Words sake, which is your undoubted salvation and everlasting comfort; I pray you also shew my brethren and sisters which have often heard me, that they cease not to learne the Word of God which I taught them, according to the measure of grace given to me, for no persecution or trouble in this world whatsoever; and shew them that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was no old wives fables, but the truth of God; for if I had taught mens doctrine, I had had greater thanks from men: but for the Word of Gods sake I now suffer, not sorrowfully, but with a glad heart and minde: For this cause I was sent that I should suffer this fire for Christs sake; behold my face, you shall not see me change my countenance: I feare not the fire; and if persecution come to you for the Words sake, I pray you <hi>fear not them that can kill the body, and have no power to hurt the soul, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
Then he prayed for them which accused him, saying, <hi>I beseech thee father of heaven, forgive them that have of ignorance, or of an evil mind, forged lies of me:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He prayes for his Persecutors</note> 
                  <hi>I forgive them with all my heart; I beseech Christ to forgive them that have condemned me this day ignorantly:</hi> Then turning to the people again, he said, <hi>I beseech you brethren, exhort your Prelates to learn the Word of God, that they may be ashamed to do evil, and learn to do good, or else there shall shortly come upon them the wrath of God which they shall not eschew</hi>; Then the Executioner upon his knees, said, Sir, I pray you forgive me, for I am not the cause of your death; and he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to him, kissed his cheeks, saying, <hi>Lo here is a token that I forgive thee; My heart, do thine office</hi>; and so he was tied to the stake, and the fire kindled.</p>
               <p>The Captain of the Castle coming near him, bade him be of good courage, and to beg for him the pardon of his sin; to whom Master <hi>Wischard</hi> said, <hi>This fire torments my body, but no whit abates my spirits</hi>; then looking towards the Cardinal, he said, <hi>He who in such state from that high place, feeds his eyes with my torments, within few dayes shall be hanged out at the same window to be seen with as much ignominie as he now leans there with pride</hi>; and so his breath being stopped,<note place="margin">A Prophesie.</note> he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed by the fire.</p>

                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:41459:188"/>
This Prophesie was fulfilled, when after the Cardinal was slain, the Provost raising the Town, came to the Castle gates, crying, <hi>What have you done with my Lord Cardinal?

               <p>But God left not the death of this holy man long unrevenged: for the people did generally cry out of the cruelty used against him, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>John Lesley,</hi> brother to the Earle of <hi>Rothes,</hi> and <hi>Norman Lesley</hi> his Cousin, fell foul upon the Cardinal for it: but he thought himself strong enough for all <hi>Scotland,</hi>

He kept himself for his greater security in his Castle; and on a Friday night there came to the Town of Saint <hi>Andrews, Norman Lesley, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Kircaldy, John Leslley,</hi> and some others; and on the Saturday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they met together not far from the Castle, waiting till the gate was opened,<note place="margin">The Castle surprized.</note> and the draw-bridge let down, for the receiving in some lime and sand, to repair some decays about the Castle, which being done, <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caldy,</hi> with six more, went to the Porter, falling into discourse with him, till the <hi>Leslies</hi> came also with some other company: the Porter seeing them, would have drawn up the Bridge, but he was prevented, and whilst he endeavoured to keep them out at the gate, his head was brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and the Keys taken from him; The Cardinal was asleep in bed, for all night he had for his bedfellow, Mistris <hi>Mary Ogleby,</hi> who was a little before gone from him out at the Postern gate,<note place="margin">Popish un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse.</note> and therefore the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was gone to his rest.</p>
               <p>There were about one hundred workmen in the Castle, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was done, cried out, but, without hurt, they were turned out at the wicket gate; Then <hi>VVilliam Kircaldy</hi> went to secure the Postern lest the Cardinal should make an escape that way: The rest going to the Gentlemens chambers, who were above fifty, without hurting them, they turned them all out at the gate; They which undertook this enterprise were but eighteen men. The Cardinal being awaked with the noise, asked out at the window what was the matter? Answer was made, that <hi>Norman Lesley</hi> had taken his Castle: Then did he attempt to have escaped by the Posterne, but finding that to be kept, he returned to his chamber: and with the help of his Chamberlain fell to barrica-doing up the door with chests, and such things: Then came up <hi>John Lesley</hi> and bids open the door: The Cardinal asked, who was there? He answered <hi>John Lesley:</hi> The Cardinal said, I will have <hi>Norman,</hi> for he is my friend: Content your self, said the other, with those that are
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:41459:188"/>
here: and so they fell to breaking open the door; in the mean time the Cardinal hid a box of gold under some coales in a secret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Then he said to them, <hi>Will ye save my life? John Lesley</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, It may be that we will. <hi>Nay,</hi> said the Cardinal, <hi>sweare unto me by Gods wounds that you will, and then I will open the door</hi>; then said <hi>John,</hi> that which was said, is unsaid, and so he called for fire to burn down the door, whereupon the door was opened, and the Cardinal sate him down in his chair, crying, <hi>I am a Priest, I am a Priest, ye will not slay me?</hi> Then <hi>John Lesley</hi> and another struck him once or twice; But Master <hi>James Melvin,</hi> a man that had been very familiar with <hi>Wischard,</hi> and of a modest and gentle nature, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them both to be in choler, plucked them back, saying, <hi>This work and judgement of God although it be secret, ought to be done with great gravity</hi>: And so presenting him the point of his sword, he said, <hi>Repent thee of thy former wicked life, but especially of sheding the blood of that notable Instrument of God, Master</hi> George Wisheart, <hi>who though he was consumed by the fire before men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Cardinal slain.</note> 
                  <hi>yet cries it for vengeance upon thee, and we from God are sent to revenge it; for here, before my God I protest, that neither the hatred of thy person, the love of thy riches, nor the feare of any hurt thou couldst have done me, moveth me to strike thee; but onely because thou hast been, and still remainest an obstinate enemie against Jesus Christ and his holy Gospel</hi>; and so he thrust him through the body, who falling down, spake never a word, but <hi>I am a Priest, I am a Priest: Fie, Fie, all is gone.</hi>

               <p>The death of this Tyrant was grievous to the Queen Mother, with whom he had two much familiarity, as with many other women; as also to the <hi>Romanists,</hi> though the people of God were freed from their fears in a great measure thereby.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XL. The Persecution of the Church in <hi>Ireland, Anno</hi> Christi, 1642.</head>
               <p>THough the barbarous cruelty used by the <hi>Irish</hi> against the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> go usually under the name of Rebellion, yet I rather look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as, and chuse to call it a persecution, because their cruelties were exercised upon Protestants only, so farre as ever I could hear; neither were the <hi>English</hi> Papists murthered, yea they joyned with the <hi>Irish</hi> in murthering of their brethren. Besides, the Jesuites, Priests, and Friars were the chief instigators to these murthers, stirring up continually all sorts, both of the Gentry and Communalty, to shew the utmost of their zeal therein; and when their designe was so surely laid, that they thought it impossible to be prevented, they did in their publick devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions recommend by their Prayers the good successe of a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, tending much to the advancement of the Catholick cause; and that they might stir up the people with the greater animosity and cruelty to put it in execution, they everywhere declaimed loudly against the Protestants, saying, <hi>That they were Hereticks, not to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any longer to live amongst them; that it was no more sin to kill one of them, than to kill a dog;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> 
                  <hi>and that it was a mortal and unpardonable sin to relieve or protect any of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They also with much acrimony represented the severe courses taken by the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> to suppresse the <hi>Romish</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and utterly to extirpate the Professors of it:<note place="margin">Popish lyes.</note> They told them that in <hi>England</hi> they had caused the Queens Priests to be hanged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her face, and that they held herself under a most severe disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; and that the like cruel Laws should be made against Popery in <hi>Ireland, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When their plots were ripe for execution, we finde their first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings against the <hi>English</hi> very various; some of the <hi>Irish</hi> only stripping and expelling them; others murthering man, woman, and childe without mercy; yet all resolving universally to root out all the Protestants out of <hi>Ireland</hi>; yea, so deeply malicious were they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>English</hi> Protestants,<note place="margin">The malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi>
                  </note> that they would not endure the very sound of that language, but would have all such punished as spake <hi>English</hi>; and the names of all <hi>English</hi> places they would have changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to old <hi>Irish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In many places they killed the <hi>English</hi> Cowes and Sheep, meerly
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:41459:190"/>
because they were <hi>English</hi>: sometimes they cut off their legs, or cut out a piece of their buttock, and so left them to live in pain: yea in some places, what they could not devoure, they killed, and left in great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes stinking in the fields.</p>
               <p>The Priests gave the Sacrament unto divers of the <hi>Irish,</hi> upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that they should neither spare man,<note place="margin">Popish malice and cruelty.</note> woman nor childe of the Protestants, saying, <hi>that it did them a great deale of good to wash their hands in their blood.</hi> One <hi>Halligan</hi> a Priest, read an excommunication against all those, that from thenceforth should relieve or harbour any <hi>English, Scotch,</hi> or <hi>VVelch</hi> man, or give them almes at their doores, whereby many were famished to death. The Friars with tears ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them not to spare any of the <hi>English</hi>; they boasted, that when they had destroyed them in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they would go over into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and not leave the memorial of an <hi>English</hi> man under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>They openly professed, that they held it as lawful to kill a Protestant, as to kill a sheep or a dog. One of their Priests said, that it was no more pity or conscience to take their lives or estates from them, than to take a bone out of a dogs mouth.</p>
               <p>The day before this Massacre was to begin, the Priests gave the people a dismisse at Masse, with free liberty to go out and take posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all their lands, which they pretended to be unjustly detained from them by the <hi>English.</hi> As also to strip, rob, and despoil them of all their goods and cattel; the Protestants being as they told them, worse than Dogs, for they were Divels, and served the Divel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the killing of such was a meritorious act, and a rare preservative against the pains of Purgatory; for that the bodies of such of them as died in this quarrel should not be cold, before their soules should ascend up into heaven, so that they should not need to feare the paines of Purgatory; and this caused some of these Murtherous <hi>Cains</hi> to boast, after they had slain many of the <hi>English,</hi> that they knew that if they should dye presently they should go strait to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>The chief Gentlemen of the <hi>Irish,</hi> when this persecution first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, perswaded many of their Protestant neighbours, that if they would bring their goods and cattel to them,<note place="margin">Popish perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnesse.</note> they would secure them from the rage of the common people; and hereby they got abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance peaceably into their hands, whereof they cheated the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, refusing to restore them again; yet so confident were the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants at first of their good dealing in regard of former familiarity, that they gave them Inventories of all they had; nay digged up such of their best things as they had hidden in the ground, and deposited them in their custody. They also gat much into their hands by fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and deep oaths and engagements, that if they would deliver them their goods, they would suffer them with their wives and children quietly to depart the Country; yet having got what they could, they afterwards murthered them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:41459:190"/>
Having thus seised upon all their goods and cattel, ransack't their houses, and gotten their persons under their power, the next work was to strip man, woman, and childe stark-naked, and so to turn them out of doors,<note place="margin">Prodigious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cruelties</note> not suffering them so much as to shelter themselves under bushes, or in the woods, strictly prohibiting all the <hi>Irish,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great penalties, not to give them any relief as they passed in the high wayes; and their great designe herein was, that they on whom they would not lay their hands and cruelly murther in cold blood, might miserably perish through cold, nakednesse, and want; and therefore if any of them gat any old rags to cover their nakednesse with, they stripped them again and again, sometimes twice or thrice over, the <hi>Irish</hi> women being very active herein, yea they taught their very children to do the like; yea they would not leave to the women so much as a smock or an hairlace: So that many of them being starved, fell down dead in the high wayes: Others that gat to any <hi>English</hi> town, by reason of famine, and cold suffered by the way,<note place="margin">Many starved and strip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the town of <hi>Colerain,</hi> of these miserable people, that fled thither for succour, many thousands died in two dayes, so that the living being not able to bury them, laid the Carkasses of those dead persons in great ranks in waste and wide holes, piling them so close and thick as if they had packed up herings together.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Magdalen Redman</hi> deposed that she, and divers others Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, amongst whom were twenty two widows, were first robbed, and then stripped stark-naked, and when they had in an house covered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with straw, the bloody Papists threw burning straw in amongst them on purpose to burn them; Then did they drive them so naked in to the wilde woods in frost and snow, so that the snow covered their skins, where a long time it lay unmelted, and some of their Children died in their armes with the extremity of the cold; and whereas some of these poor soules went towards the <hi>Burre</hi> for shelter, the cruel <hi>Irish</hi> turned them back again, saying, they should go to <hi>Dublin</hi>; and when they went towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> they beat them back, saying, they should go to the <hi>Burre,</hi> and so tossed them to and fro, that some of them died; those which through many difficulties gat to the <hi>Burre,</hi> many of them died there; and those that survived, lived miserably by reason of their many wants.</p>
               <p>Yet though these bloody Villaines exercised such inhumane cruelties towards the poor Protestants, they would commonly boast, that these were but the beginnings of their sorrows; and indeed they made it good; for having disarmed the <hi>English,</hi> robbed them of their goods, and cattel, stript them of their cloathes, and having their persons in their power, they furiously broke out into all manner of abominable cruelties, horrid massacres, and execrable murthers, so that it would make any Christians eare to tingle, and his heart to ake to hear the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</p>
               <p>For there were multitudes murthered in cold blood, some whilst
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:41459:191"/>
they were at plough, others as they sate peaceably in their houses, others travelling upon the high wayes;<note place="margin">Horrible mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> all without any manner of provocation given by them, were suddenly destroyed.</p>
               <p>In the Castle of <hi>Lisgool</hi> were about one hundred and fifty men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children consumed with fire. At the Castle of <hi>Moneah</hi> were one hundred slain altogether. At the Castle of <hi>Tullah,</hi> which was delivered to <hi>Mac Guire</hi> upon composition, and faithful promises of faire quarter, as soon as he and his entred the Court, they began to strip the people, and most cruelly put them to the sword, murthering them all without mercy.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Lissenskeah</hi> they hanged and killed above one hundred of the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Protestants,<note place="margin">Popish perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</note> shewing them no more favour than they did to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi> Yea the County thereabouts being well planted and peopled, was in a most horrible manner quite destroyed. In the Counties of <hi>Armagh</hi> and <hi>Tyrone,</hi> where the Protestants were more numerous, their murthers were more multiplied, and with greater cruelty, if it were possible, than in other places.</p>

               <p>At <hi>Portendown</hi> Bridge there were one thousand men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren carried in several Companies, and all unmercifully drowned in the River, the Bridge being broken down in the midst, and the people driven and forced on till they tumbled down into the water.

               <p>In one place one hundred and fourty <hi>English</hi> were taken and driven like cattel for many miles together. Other companies they carried out under pretence of safe conduct, thereby causing them to march chearfully till they had got them to some place fit for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then murthered them there. One hundred and fifteen men, women, and children they sent with Sir <hi>Philem Onenles</hi> Passe, till they had brought them to the bridge of <hi>Portendowne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Popish trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</note> and then forced them all into the water, and such as by swimming, or other means sought to escape, they either knocked them on the head, and after drwowned them,

or else shot them to death in the water. One Mistris <hi>Campbel</hi> being forced by them to the River,<note place="margin">A just reward.</note> and finding no meanes to escape their furie, suddenly clasped one of the chief of them in her armes, and so both tumbling into the River, they were drowned together. At another time one hundred and fourty Protestants being thrown in at the same place, as any of them swam to the shore, the bloody vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines with the butt-ends of their muskets knockt out their brains.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Armagh, O Cane</hi> gat together all the Protestants thereabouts, pretending to conduct them to <hi>Coleraine</hi>; but before they were gone a dayes journey, they were all murthered, and so were many others, though they had protections from Sir <hi>Phileme O Neale.</hi> The aged people in <hi>Armagh</hi> were carried to <hi>Charlemount,</hi> and there mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>

In one house twenty two Protestants were burned; In <hi>Kilmore</hi> all the inhabitants were stript and massacred, being two hundred families: Some they set in the stocks till they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed where their monie was, and then massacred them; The whole County was a common butchery,<note place="margin">Prodigious cruelties.</note> where many thousands perished in a shor time, by sword, famine, fire, water, and all other cruel manner of deaths that rage and malice could invent.</p>
               <p>To many, these bloody Villains shewed so much favour as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch them presently, by no means allowing them so much time as to pray. Others they imprisoned in filthy Dungeons full of dirt and mire, and there clapping bolts on their legs, suffered them to perish at leasure. One told <hi>John Cowder</hi> that they would kill him,<note place="margin">They deny them liberty to pray.</note> but first bid him say his prayers, and when he kneeled down to pray, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently cut off his head. When some others upon their knees begged but leave to pray before they were slain, they would bid them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath their soules to the Divel; others would ask them, <hi>why do you desire to pray? your soules are already with the Divel</hi>; and so would immediately slaughter them. At <hi>Casel</hi> they put all the Protestants into a loathsome Dungeon, where they kept them twelve weekes in great misery. Some they barbarously mangled and left them langush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the high wayes, crying out but for so much mercy as to be dispatched out of their paine; some they hanged up twice or thrice: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers they buried alive. Some when they were half-hanged, they cast into pits, covering them with a little earth,<note place="margin">Some buried alive.</note> where they sent out most lamentable groanes for a good while after.</p>
               <p>In Queenes County, an <hi>English</hi> man, his wife, five children, and a maid, were all hanged together, then put into a hole; the youngest child being not dead, put up the hand and cried <hi>Mammie, Mammie,</hi> and yet without mercy they buried it alive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Mason</hi> in <hi>Laugal</hi> was extreamly beaten and wounded, yet his wife and some others carried him away, whereupon these Villaines cruelly hacked, slashed and wounded them, and then dragged the said
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:41459:192"/>
                  <hi>Mason</hi> into an hole, and there threw stones on him with the weight whereof they kept him under: there he lay languishing and groaning till his own wife, to put him out of paine, stopped his breath with her handkerchief.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Clownes</hi> seventeen men were buried alive, yet so as their pitiful cryes were heard afar off.</p>
               <p>Some were deadly wounded, and so hanged upon tenter-hooks. Some with ropes about their necks were drawn through the water.<note place="margin">Some were hung upon tenter-hooks.</note> Some with ropes about their middles were drawn through woods and bogs.</p>
               <p>In Castle <hi>Cumber</hi> one of these cut-throats took two boyes, wounded them, and hung them upon a butchers tenters. Some were hanged up, and taken down several times to make them confess their monie, which when they had done, they presently murthered them. Some were hung up by the armes, and then with their swords they made experiment how many blowes an <hi>English</hi> Protestant would endure ere he died. Some had their bellies ript up, and so were left with their guts running about their heels.</p>
               <p>An ancient woman coming towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> was stript seven times in one day,<note place="margin">Blasphemy.</note> and they bade her go and look for her God, and bid him give her cloaths again.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Kilkenny</hi> they cruelly beat an <hi>English</hi> woman, till they forced her into a ditch,<note place="margin">Many had their bellies ript.</note> where she died; then they took her child, a girle of about six years old, ript her belly, and let out her guts.</p>
               <p>One they forced to go to Masse with them, yet afterwards wounded him, ript his belly, took out his guts, and so left him alive.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Scottish</hi> man they stripped and knocked on the head, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards coming to himself, went into the Town naked; Then did they again take him and hewed him all to pieces; They also ript up his Wives belly, so that a Child dropped out of her womb. Many other women great with childe they hung up, then ript their bellies, and let the Infants fall out. Sometimes they gave their children to be devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Swine and Dogs. One <hi>John Stone</hi> with his son, two sons in law, and their wives, they took and hung them all up; and one of the young women being great with child, they ript her belly, took forth her child, and used such beastly barbarous actions to her as are not fit to be mentioned. At the <hi>Newry</hi> they ript up a womans belly that was great with two children, throwing them to be devoured of swine. Also another woman being delivered of a childe in the fields, they which had formerly killed her Father and Husband, killed her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so with two of her children, and gave the new-born infant to be devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Dogs.</p>
               <p>In the County of <hi>Armagh</hi> they Robbed, stripped, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered abundance of Protestants, whereof some they burned, some they slew with the sword, some they hanged, and some they starved to death; and meeting Mistris <hi>Howard,</hi> and Mistris <hi>Frankland</hi> with six of their
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:41459:192"/>
children, and themselves both great with child, with their pikes they killed and murthered them all, ript open the Gentlewomens bellies, took out their children, and threw them into a ditch. A young <hi>Scottish</hi> womans child they took by the heeles,<note place="margin">Children had their brains dashed out.</note> and dash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the braines out against a tree; the like they did to many other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anne Hill</hi> going with a young child on her back, and four more by her side, these cruel persecutors pulled the child off her back, trod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on it till it died, stripped her self and the other four children starke naked, whereby they died of cold.</p>
               <p>Some others they met with, hanged them up upon a Windmill, and before they were half dead, cut them in pieces with their Skeins. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Protestants, especially women and children they pricked and stabbed with their Skeins, Forks and Swords, slashing, cutting and mangling them in their heads, faces, breasts, armes and other parts, yet killed them not, but left them wallowing in their blood, to languish, starve and pine to death, and when they desired them to kill them out of their paine, they refused; yet sometimes after a day or two, they would dash out their braines with stones or clubs, which they accounted as a great favour.</p>
               <p>One goodwife <hi>Harvey</hi> at <hi>Kilkenny</hi> was forced to go to Masse, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, together with her children was stripped, and one of her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had her belly ripped that her intrails fell out; and her self was so beaten and wounded, that she hardly escaped with life.</p>
               <p>The Castle of <hi>Lisgoole</hi> being set on fire by these mercilesse Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, a woman leaped out at a window to save her self from burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but they presently murthered her;<note place="margin">Many burned.</note> the next morning her child was found sucking at her breast, which they murthered also. And whereas many Protestants with their wives and children fled into vauls and cellars to hide themselves, they were all murthered there. One <hi>Jane Addis</hi> they stabbed, and then putting her child of a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter old to her breast, bid it <hi>suck English bastard,</hi> and so left it to perish there.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Mary Barlow</hi> had her husband hanged before her face, and her self with six children were all stript stark naked in frost and snow, after which, sheltring themselves in a Cave,<note place="margin">Some perish by famine.</note> they had nothing to eat for three weeks, but two old Calves skins, which they beat with stones, and so eat them hair and all, her children crying to her rather to go out and be killed than to famish there.</p>
               <p>In the cold weather many thousands of Protestants of all ranks, ages, and sexes, being turned out stark naked, perished of cold and hunger, thousands of others were drowned, cast into ditches, bogs, and turf-pits. Multitudes were inclosed in houses, which being set on fire they were burnt miserably. Some that lay sick of feavors they drew out of their beds and hanged them. Some men, women, and children they drove into boggie pits; and if any of them endeavoured to get out, they knockt them on the heads.</p>

                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:41459:193"/>
Some aged men and women, these Barbarians enforced their own children to carry them to the river where they were drowned: yea some children were compelled unnaturally to be the Executioners of their own Parents:<note place="margin">Unnatural cruelties.</note> wives were forced to help to hang their own husbands, and mothers to cast their own children into the water, after all which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were murthered. In <hi>Sligo</hi> they forced a young man to kill his own father, and then hanged him up: In another place they forced a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to kill her husband, then caused her son to kill her, and then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly hanged the son; and this they did that they might destroy both soul and body. Yea such was their detestable malice against the <hi>English</hi> Protestants, that they taught their children to kill <hi>English</hi> children; One of these Villains wives was very angry with their souldiers, because they did not bring the grease of a fat Gentlewoman,<note place="margin">Children kill <hi>English</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> whom they had slaine, with them for her to make candles of.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Irish</hi> women that followed the Camp, egged on the men to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, always crying out, <hi>kill them all, spare neither, man, woman, nor child.</hi> They took the child of one <hi>Tkomas Straton,</hi> being about twelve years old,<note place="margin">Some boiled in Cauldrons.</note> and boiled him to death in a Cauldron. One Goodwife <hi>Lin</hi> and her daughter were carried into a Wood, where they first hanged the mother, and then the daughter in the hair of the mothers head. Some women and children of the <hi>Irish,</hi> meeting an <hi>English</hi> woman great with child, stript her to her smock, then pulled off her smock, and so rent and abused her, that the poor woman falling into labour, both she and her child died under their hands.</p>
               <p>In some places they plucked out the eyes, and cut off the hands of the Protestants,<note place="margin">Some had their eyes pulled out</note> and so turned them out into the fields to wander up and down till they perished. The very women in some places stoned the <hi>English</hi> women to death, together with their children. One man they shot through both his thighs; then digging a hole in the ground, they set him in it upright upon his feet, and then filled up the hole, leaving out only his head, where they left him till he pined and languished to death. Of another man they held his feet in the fire till he was burned to death.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Munster</hi> they hanged up many Ministers in a most barbarous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. One Minister they stripped stark naked, and drove him through the town, pricking him forwards with darts and rapiers, and so pursued him till he fell down dead.</p>
               <p>Neither did all the malice that they bore to these poor Christians, end with their lives when they had slain them, but extended after death to the denying burial to their carcasses, casting some into ditches, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving others to be devoured of ravenous beasts and fouls; yea some that had been formerly buried they digged up, and left them as dung upon the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>These barbarous Villains vowed that if any Parents digged graves to bury their children in, they should be buried therein themselves. They stripped one <hi>William Loverden</hi> naked, then killed him before his wife and children, cut off his head, and held it up for them to gaze at;
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:41459:193"/>
and when his wife had buried hin in his garden, they digged him up, and threw him into a ditch. Divers Ministers bones that had been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried some years before, they digged up, because they were, as they said, Patrons of <hi>Heresie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Poor children that went out into the fields to eate weeds and grasse, they killed without all pity. And a poor woman, whose husband was taken by them, went to them with two children at her feet, and one at her breast, hoping to beg her husband, but they slew her and her sucking infant; brake the neck of another, and the third hardly escaped: And which was a great aggravation of their wickednesse, they exercised all this cruelty upon the <hi>English</hi> Protestants who never provoked them thereto, yea that had alwayes lived peaceably with them, administring help and comfort to them in distresse, putting no difference betwixt them and those of their own Nation, and cherished them as friends and loving neighbours. Notwithstanding all which courtesies, they now shewed them no favour or pity. Alas, who can comprehend the fears, terrours, anguish, bitternesse, and perplexity that seized upon the hearts of the poor Protestants, finding themselves so suddenly surprized with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy, and inextricably wrapt up in all kind of outward miseries, which could possibly by man be inflicted upon humane creatures! What sighs and groans, trembling and astonishment, what shrikes, cries, and bitter lamentations of wives, children, servants and friends, howling and weeping, finding themselves without all hope of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from their present miseries! How inexorable were their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tormentors that compassed them in on every side, without all bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of compassion, or the least commiseration and pity! One <hi>Ellen Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> they put into an hole, fastning her in with stones, and left her there to languish to death, bragging how many of them went to see her kick and tosse in the hole. Yea they boasted upon their successe, that the day was their own, and that ere long they would not leave one Protestant Rogue living, but would uttery destroy every one that had but a drop of <hi>English</hi> blood in them; their women crying out, Slay them all, the <hi>English</hi> are fit meat for dogs, and their children are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards. Yea so implacable was their malice, that they vowed that they would not have an <hi>English</hi> beast alive, nor any of the breed of them. How grievous was it to any Christian heart to hear a base Villain boast, that his hands were so weary with killing and knocking down Protestants into a bog, that he could not lift up his armes to his head! Another boasted that he had been abroad and had killed sixteen of the rogues. Others boasted that they had killed so many, that the grease and fat which stuck upon their swords, might well make an <hi>Irish</hi> candle. Yea two boyes boasted, thar at several times they had murthered and drowned thirty six women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>These mercilesse Papists having set a Castle on fire, wherein were many Protestants, they rejoycingly said amongst themselves, <hi>O how sweetly do they fry</hi>!</p>

                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:41459:194"/>
At <hi>Kilkenny</hi> when they had committed many cruel murthers, they brought seven Protestants heads, amongst which one was the head of a Reverend Minister, all which they set upon the Market-crosse, on a Market day, triumphing, slashing, and mangling them; and putting a gag into the Ministers mouth, they slit up his cheeks to his ears, and laying a leaf of a Bible before it, they bid him preach, for his mouth was wide enough; it cannot be imagined with what scorn and derision they acted these things, and with what joy and exultation their eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the sad spectacle of the Protestants miseries; what greedy delight they took in their bloody executions.</p>
               <p>An <hi>English</hi> woman, whom they had stripped stark naked, gat a little straw, which she tied about her middle to cover her nakednesse; but these impudent villaines set fire to it, boasting what brave sport they had, to see how the fire made the <hi>English</hi> Jade dance.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Kilmore</hi> they put many Protestants, men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren together into a thatched house, and then set fire on it, boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the lamentations and out-cries that they made whilest they were in burning, and how the children gaped when the fire began to burne them; taking pride, and glorying in imitating those cries.</p>
               <p>They took one Mistris <hi>Maxwel</hi> being in labour, and threw her into a river,<note place="margin">Prodigious cruelties.</note> boasting that the childs arme appeared, and that it was half-born when the mother was drowned.</p>
               <p>These bloody Persecutors took great pleasure and delight in their cruelty, and to encrease their misery, when they butchered them, they used to say, <hi>Thy soul to the Devil.</hi> One of them coming into an house with his hands and cloaths all bloody, made his boasts, that it was <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> blood, and that his skeine had p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>cked the cleane white skins of many of them, even to the hilt thereof. When any of them had killed a Protestant, many of them would come one after another, each of them stabbing, wounding, and cutting his body in a most despiteful manner, and then leave it naked to be devoured of dogs, beasts, and fouls; and when they had slain any number of them, they would boast that they had made the Devil beholding to them, in sending so many souls to hell.</p>
               <p>But its no wonder that they carried themselves so towards these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Christians, when they spared not to belch out their execrable blasphemies against God and his holy Word.</p>
               <p>In one place they burnt two Protestant Bibles, and then said it was hell-fire they burnt.<note place="margin">Bibles burnt.</note> Other Bibles they took, cut in pieces, and then burnt them, saying, that they would do the like to all Puritane Bibles.

               <p>They did most despitefully upbraid the Profession of the truth to those blessed souls, whom neither by threats nor terrours, pains nor torments they could draw to forsake their Religion. And though some by extreme torments were drawn to professe the change of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yet did they finde no more favour with these hell-hounds, who with great scorn used to say,<note place="margin">Aposttaes murthered.</note> 
                  <hi>That it was fit to send them out of the world whilst they were in a good mood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Claslow,</hi> a Priest with some others, drew about forty or fifty <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> and <hi>Scottish</hi> Protestants to be reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and then he told them that they were in a good faith, and for fear they should fall from it and turn <hi>Hereticks,</hi> he with his companions presently cut all their throats.</p>

                  <hi>John Nicholson</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> his wife, being received into the Protection of one <hi>Fitz Patrick,</hi> he laboured to perswade them to go to Masse, and to joyn in the present massacre; but they professed, that rather than they would forsake their Religion they would die upon the swords point;<note place="margin">Constancy, and Courage.</note> Then he would have had the woman burn her Bible; but she told him, rather than she would burn her Bible, she would die the death; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Sabbath morning after they were both of them cruelly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered; but he that acted the villany was so tormented in conscience,<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors.</note> and dogged with apparitions of them, as he conceived, that with inward horror he pined away.</p>
               <p>In the County of <hi>Tipperary</hi> near the Silver works, some of these barbarous Papists met with eleven <hi>English</hi> men, Protestants, ten wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and some children, whom they first stripped off their cloaths, and then with stones, poleaxes, skeins, swords, &amp;c. they most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously massacred them all; this was done on a Sabbath evening, the day having been very fair and clear; but just at that time God sent a fearful storme of thunder, lightning, wind, haile and rain, so that the murtherers themselves confessed, that it was a signe of Gods anger against them for this cruelty, yet they persisted in their bloody act, hacking, hewing, flashing and stabbing them, so that most of them were cut in pieces then tying withs about their necks, they threw them into an hole which they made for the purpose; yet it pleased God, that one <hi>Scottish</hi> and an <hi>English</hi> man, though they had many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouous wounds, and were left for dead, after a while revived, and with much difficulty escaped with their lives; but as God shewed his great mercy in preserving them, so he shewed his just judgment upon <hi>Hugh Kennedy,</hi> the chief of those murtherers, who presently fell into a most

desperate madnesse and distraction, neither resting day nor night, till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight days after he drowned himself.</p>
               <p>In the County of <hi>Mayo,</hi> about sixty Protestants, whereof fifteen were Ministers, were upon Covenant to be safely conveyed to <hi>Galway</hi> by one <hi>Edmund Burk</hi> and his souldiers; but by the way this <hi>Burk</hi> drew his sword,<note place="margin">Popish perfid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</note> teaching thereby the rest of his company to do the like; and so they began to massacre these poor Protestants, some they shot to death; some they stabbed with their skeins, some they thrust through with their pikes; some they cast into the water and drowned, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men they stript stark naked, who lying upon their husbands to save them, were run through with pikes, so that very few of them escaped with life.</p>
               <p>In the town of <hi>Sligo</hi> fourty Protestants wete stript and locked up in a Cellar; and about midnight a Butcher, provided for the purpose, was sent in amongst them,<note place="margin">Many knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the head</note> who with his axe knocked them all on the heads.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Tirawly,</hi> thirty or fourty <hi>English,</hi> who had formerly yielded to go to Masse, were put to their choyce whether they would die by the sword, or be drowned? they chose the latter, and so being driven to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, these barbarous villaines with their naked swords forced them into the Sea; the mothers with their children in their armes wading to the chin, were afterwards overcome by the waves, where they all perished.</p>
               <p>But present death was counted too great a favour, and therefore of some they twisted withs about their foreheads till the blood sprang out at the crown of their heads: Others they hanged, and let down several times, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The sonne of Master <hi>Montgomery,</hi> a Minister, aged about fifteen years, met with one of these blood-suckers, who formerly had been his school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master, who drew his skein at him, whereupon the boy said, <hi>Good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>

               <p>In the Towne of <hi>Sligo,</hi> all the Protestants were first stript, and robbed of all their estates; afterwards they were summoned to go into the Goale, and such as refused, were carried in; and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight they all were stripped stark naked, and there most cruelly and barbarously murthered with swords, axes, skeins, &amp;c. some of them being women great with child, their infants thrust out their armes and legs at their wounds; after which execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble murthers, they laid the dead naked bodies of the men upon the naked bodies of the women in a most immodest posture,<note place="margin">Berbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence.</note> where they left them till the next day to be looked upon by the <hi>Irish,</hi> who beheld it with great delight; Also <hi>Isabel Beard,</hi> great with childe, hearing the lamentable cries of those that were murthered, ran forth into the streets, where she was barbarously murthered, and was found the next day with the childs feet coming out of the wounds in her sides: many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

               <p>The Popish <hi>English</hi> were no whit inferiour, yea rather exceeded

the natural <hi>Irish</hi> in their cruelty against the Protestants that lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, within the pale, being never satisfied with their blood till they had seen the last drop thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anne Kinnard</hi> testified that fifteen Protestants being imprisoned, and their feet in the Stocks, a Popish boy being not above fourteen years old, slew them all in one night with his skeine.

               <p>An <hi>English</hi> woman, who was newly delivered of two children, some of these villains violently compelled her in her great pain and sicknesse to rise from her bed, and took one of the infants that was living, and dashed his brains against the stones, and then threw him into the River of the <hi>Barrow</hi>; the like they did by many other infants. Many others they hanged without all pity.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Mont Garret</hi> caused divers <hi>English</hi> Souldiers that he had taken about <hi>Kilkenny</hi> to be hanged,<note place="margin">Souldiers han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> hardly suffering them to pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their death; they dyed very patiently, and resolutely in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Protestant faith; and one of them, being an <hi>Irish</hi> man, had his life offered if he would turn Papist, but he rather chose to dye,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> and so was executed with the rest.</p>
               <p>Some of these Persecutors meeting a poor young Girle that was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to see her friends, they first half-hanged her, and then buried her quick.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Fitz Patrick</hi> enticed a rich Merchant that was a Protestant, to bring all his goods into his house, promising safely to keep them, and to redeliver them to him. But when he had thus gotten them into his possession, he took the Merchant and his Wife, and hanged them both:<note place="margin">Popish perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnesse.</note> the like he did by divers others.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>English</hi> mens heads that they had cut off, they carried to <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny,</hi> and on the market day set them on the Crosse, where many, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the women, stab'd, cut, and slashed them, every one accounting themselves happy that could but get a blow at them.</p>
               <p>One of the heads being a Ministers, a woman struck so hard with her fist, that the same night her hand grew black and blew, and so rankled, that she was lame of it a quarter of a year after:<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors.</note> Another woman that looked on those heads with much rejoycing, presently after fell so distracted, that neither night not day she could rest, but cryed out continually that she saw those heads before her eyes.</p>

Some after they were hanged, they drew up and down till their bowels were torn out.</p>
               <p>How many thousands of Protestants were thus inhumanely mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by sundry kinds of deaths in that one Province of <hi>Ulster</hi> we have heard before; What the number of the slain was in the three other Provinces, I find not upon Record; but certainly it was very great; for I finde these passages in a general Remonstrance of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed Protestants in the Province of <hi>Munster.</hi>

apparitions, went thither one Evening, at which time they saw one like a Woman rise out of the River breast-high, her haire hanging down, which, with her skin, was as white as snow, often crying out, <hi>Revenge, Revenge, Revenge,</hi> which so affrighted them that they went their way.</p>
               <p>Divers Protestants were thrown into the river of <hi>Belterbert,</hi> and when any of them offered to swim to the Land, they were knocked on the head with Poles, after which their bodies were not seen of six weeks: but after the end thereof, the murtherers coming again that way, the bodies came floating up to the very Bridge where they were.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Con mac Gennis</hi> with his company slew Master <hi>Turge,</hi> Minister of the <hi>Newry,</hi> with divers other Protestants, after which the said <hi>Mac Gennis</hi> was so affrighted with the apprehension of the said Master <hi>Turge</hi> his being continually in his presence, that he commanded his souldiers not to slay any more of them, but such as should be slain in battel.</p>
               <p>A young woman being stript almost naked, there came a Rogue to her, bidding her give him her money, or he would run her through with his Sword. Her answer was, <hi>You cannot kill me except God give you leave,</hi>

               <p>But besides these forementioned judgements of God which befel them for their inhumane cruelties; we may observe how the hand of God hath been out against them ever since, and that in a special manner, by emasculating and debasing of their spirits; whereby it hath come to passe that ordinarily a few <hi>English</hi> Souldiers have chased multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of them, and generally in all the battels and fights that have been betwixt them, they have always been beaten, though the ods was great of their side; And as they made themselves formerly drunk with the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood of the unresisting Protestants; so now God hath given them their fill of blood <hi>in jealousie and fury.</hi> Many thousands of them have perished by the Sword of War; And how heavy hath the hand of God lain further upon them this present year, 1650. in that terrible and universal plague that hath been scattered all over the Nation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many thousands more of them have perished, and God is still fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against, and probably will continue their destruction, till they either shall truly be humbled for their horrid sins, or be utterly consumed from the face of the earth!</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ANNO Christi</hi> 1561. the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> published an Edict in favour of the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Churches in the Vallies of <hi>Piemont,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An Edict in favour of the Protestants.</note> wherein he granted an indemnitie to the people of the Vallies of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grognia, Bobio, Villaro, Valguicchiardo, Rora, Tagliaretto,</hi> and <hi>La Rica di Boneti</hi> at the end of <hi>La Torre,</hi> Saint <hi>Martino, Perosa, Roccapiatta,</hi> and Saint <hi>Barthelemo,</hi> from all former actings, and restoring them into his favor, as if they had never acted any thing against his Highness; receiving them into his safegard and protection: He granted them also to have preaching Assemblies, and other Ministerial Offices according to their Religion in their wonted places, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But in the year 1565. Another Edict was published at the instigation of the <hi>Popish party,</hi> whereby all men who lived in the Duke of <hi>Savoy's</hi> Dominions, and would not conform to the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion,<note place="margin">A cruel Edict.</note> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to come and declare the same to their respective Magistrates within ten dayes after the publication thereof, and two moneths after to leave the Country, having one years time given them to dispose of their goods movable, and unmovable, during which time they should enjoy the revenue thereof, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The tidings of this cruelty so wrought upon the hearts of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> that they sent an Embassie to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to intercede in their behalf: Amongst whom the Prince Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> was exceeding zealous,<note place="margin">The Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for them.</note> sending one of his Counsellours of State, a person of singular worth, to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to mediate in their behalf; at whose return the Prince being informed by him of the unworthy dealing of that Court, and finding that notwithstanding all their faire promises, they did not at all cease from persecuting these poor people, he wrote a very smart and pathetical letter to the said Duke, challenging him for breach of promise to himself and the other <hi>Germane</hi> Princes, in that he suffered his Ministers still to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and banish those poore innocent people, meerely upon the account of Religion, concluding that such severity was neither pleasing to God nor man; neither (saith he) <hi>is it the way to bring men to the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, which should be done by perswasions, and Scripture-proofs, not by persecutions, &amp;c. Wherefore I pray your Highnesse that you will give us an evidence of that which you have for us, by delivering those poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:41459:199"/>
who are now in the Gallies, and by recalling those who have been lately banished, as you promised by your Letters. Have compassion upon so many poore wandring Exiles, deprived of all their goods and estates: Call them home, and restore them to their habitations; and grant them, and the other inhabitants of your Highness Countries the publick exercise of their Religion, which they prefer before their necessary food: Free them from their false ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations, that they may live in peace under your Highnesse Government, &amp;c. If your Highness will grant me this request, I doubt not but you shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally finde the favour and blessing of God, and you shall oblige us to you in all things: If otherwise, you will both provoke God to lift up his hand against you, and estrange from you the affections of those who desire to do you pleasure and service, &amp;c.</hi> Dated 1566.</p>
               <p>Now that you may see upon what occasion the Prince wrote this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you are to understand that <hi>Castrocaro</hi> (one of their <hi>Popish</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours) being extreamly troubled that the Prince Electors Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor had obtained several promises at the Court for the poor peoples ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, did immediately after the said Ambassadors departure, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish through the Valley of <hi>Lucerna,</hi>

               <p>This Letter stopped the fury of <hi>Castrocaro</hi> for the present: but it was far from working any change of affections in him, as was evident by his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-actings: For in the year 1571. he did so incense the Governour of <hi>Bobio</hi> against the poor inhabitants of the Valley, that he did not only grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously molest them upon all occasions as they came under his clutches, but also wrote bitter Letters to the Duke against them, improving the uttermost of his parts and power for their ruine and extirpation: and certainly <hi>Castrocaro</hi> had then effected his designe, had not the Dutches upon the joynt supplications of the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Churches, very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally interposed for them,<note place="margin">Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for them</note> and procured the continuation of their just and undoubted priviledges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1571. Many of the poor Protestants of the Valleyes were grievously molested under pretext that in the former War of <hi>France</hi> against those of the <hi>Religion,</hi> they had joyned themselves to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Troops. But King <hi>Charles</hi> the 9th being moved with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion towards them,<note place="margin">King of <hi>France</hi> intercede; for them.</note> wrote a Letter to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, requesting him to receive them with gentleness into his grace and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:41459:199"/>
favour, and to re-establish them in their estates, &amp;c. The subject of which Letter was not only satisfactory to those for whom it interceded, but also to all other faithfull ones of the Valleyes, out of the great hopes they had of future tranquillity. But it endured no longer than till their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had an opportunity of molesting them, which they greedily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced upon the news of the horrible massacres in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Castrocaro</hi> did thereupon so threaten the poor Protestants, that they retired themselves, with their families, and movables,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> to the tops of the neighbouring Mountains, and into all other places where they hoped for safety:<note place="margin">Gods mercy.</note> But the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> not approving the cruelties exercised against the <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> sent to those his Subjects, who were thus withdrawn, commanding them to return to their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and habitations, promising that they should suffer no prejudice, nor incur the least danger thereby. Neither indeed were their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings great afterwards, so long as Madam the Dutchess was living, who was a refuge to them upon all occasions.</p>
               <p>After the death of this Princess which happened <hi>Octob.</hi> 19. 1574. the Popish party came forth like Lions, improving the uttermost of their endeavours to devoure and destroy this poor people upon all occasions; but the goodness of God was so great towards them, that they always found some considerable friends about the Duke, who inclined his heart to gentleness and moderation: But after the death of this <hi>

               <p>Such was the condition of this poor people from the year 1595. to the year 1602. at which time all the Masters of Families in the Valley of <hi>Lucerna,</hi> professing the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, were cited to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Count <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lucerna,</hi> the Governour <hi>Ponte,</hi> the Arch Bishop <hi>Broglia,</hi> and others, and were by them commanded in the Dukes name, either to go to Masse, or to quit <hi>Lucerna,</hi> and all their pretensions thereto, without the least hopes of ever obtaining favour to return, or in case of disobedience, to prepare themselves for inevitable mischiefs and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: which threats were pressed with so much violence, that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed many of the poor creatures to submit, at least seemingly, to the change of their Religion, though many others of them were the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier rooted by these shakings.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Lucerna</hi> the aforenamed Lords removed their seat to <hi>Bubiana</hi> where they found the <hi>Reformed</hi> so stiff in their Principles,<note place="margin">Popish subtilty prevented.</note> that they could not remove them an hairs bredth from the same, wherefore they caused the chief of them to be summoned to appear at <hi>Turin,</hi> thinking that the Dukes presence might prevaile more with them than all their threatning speeches: The persons thus summoned were Master <hi>Valentine,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Boules,</hi> his brother, with one <hi>Peter Morese,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Falc,</hi> who were brought one after another before hi Hisghnesse: Mr. <hi>Valentine</hi> was the first, whom the Duke perswaded to embrace the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion,</hi> and to draw others to do the like, promising him great rewards and preferments if he obeyed, &amp;c. To this Mr. <hi>Valentine</hi> answered, that next to the service of God,<note place="margin">Courage and Constancy.</note> he had no greater desire then to obey, and please his Highness, in whose service he would willingly adventure his person and estate, when ever there should be occasion: But as for his Religion which he knew to be true, and confirmed by the Word of God, he could not abandon it without disobeying God, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Conscience, so as never to enjoy any comfort in his soul afterwards: and therefore he humbly intreated his Highness to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with what he could do with a good conscience: and to leave him to the liberty of his Religion which he valued above his life: the Duke replyed, that he also doubted not of the truth of that Religion which he professed, and that such as embraced it, should find how much they had gratified him in so doing, yet would he not force the Conscience of any man, and so he gave them leave to depart.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLII. The Marquisate of <hi>Saluces</hi> described, with its several troubles and Persecutions.</head>
               <p>THe Marquisate of <hi>Saluces</hi> is on the South side of the Valleys of <hi>Predmont,</hi> containing in it several Cities, and considerable Valleys, very fruitfull in all sorts of fruits. Its most Northerly Valley is that of <hi>Po,</hi> where the famous River <hi>Po</hi> hath its rise, and source; one onely Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain separates this from the Valley of <hi>Lucerna</hi> on the North side: In this Valley were those ancient Churches, <hi>viz. Pravillem, Biolets,</hi> and <hi>Bietone,</hi> who retained the purity of Christian Religion for several hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years, and lived in great union with their neighbouring Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1561. The Church of <hi>Dronier,</hi> which was one of the most flourishing, understanding that the publick exercise of the Reformed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was permitted in <hi>France,</hi> obtained Letters from the Kings Council to Sieur <hi>Lovis</hi> of <hi>Birague,</hi> Governour of that Country in the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> absence, whereby he was ordered to provide for the Petitioners a convenient place for the publick exercise of their Religion: But not long after their Adversaries, by their importunity, prevailed so far that the said letters were revoked:<note place="margin">They are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, but again molested.</note> This occasioned the said Church to send Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Francis Galatee,</hi> their Minister, into <hi>France,</hi> with some others, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover (if it were possible) their former priviledges. But this falling out in the time of their troubles in <hi>France,</hi> all that they could obtaine, was only bare promises. In the mean time they received many hortatory and consolatory letters from the chief Ministers in the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> and amongst others from those of <hi>Grenoble, Lions, &amp;c.</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to patience, and perseverance in that truth which they had embraced: which accordingly they did, notwithstanding all the malice and subtilty of their adversaries: So that their Churches were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and upheld,<note place="margin">They are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.</note> convenient order being had for the preaching of the Word, administration of the Sacraments, exercise of their discipline, &amp;c. only there wanted in some places liberty of having General Assemblies, and publick Sermons.</p>
               <p>For the better safety of their Ministers in the places that were most dangerous,<note place="margin">Their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> one Pastor had the charge of the faithful in several Cities and Communalties, which rendred their residence and exercises less vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to their Adversaries: Hereby the Gospel (through Gods mercy) made a very considerable progress at <hi>Dronier, Verzo,</hi> and some other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e. The Church of <hi>Aceil</hi> in the Valley <hi>de Mairi</hi> was extraordinarily peopled, and enjoyed more liberty than the others, by reason of the scituation of the place: but Satan the Enemy of Christs Church and Kingdom, perceiving such a growth of the reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:41459:201"/>
in those places,<note place="margin">Satans policy.</note> ceased not to imploy all his power and policy to hinder the same; and therein he made use of instruments for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: <hi>viz.</hi> first the <hi>Anticodemites,</hi> whose ringleader was <hi>Baronius,</hi> who lived at <hi>Valgrane</hi> and thereabouts, accommodating himself to the times:<note place="margin">Dissembling Hypocrites.</note> For when the Church had rest and ease, he wrote strange things, and cryed out of the abuses in <hi>Popery</hi>: But in times of persecution he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually played the Hypocrite, and laboured to draw others to do the same, by which means he had a multitude of followers, and amongst them the Lord of <hi>Valgrane,</hi> and <hi>Maximilian de Saluces,</hi> who set his name to <hi>Baronius</hi> to add luster to his writings against the Ministers, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for that they would not give way to any dissimulation in their Disciples, whereby they exposed them to great extremities. This Lord had some learning and knowledge of the truth; but to avoid the bearing of the Cross, he thought it convenient to dissemble, and condemned those who any way gain said the <hi>Papists.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> Yet Monsieur <hi>Gelido,</hi> Minister of <hi>Aceil,</hi> opposed them both, very learnedly in several letters that he wrote unto them: So did Monsieur <hi>Truchi,</hi> Minister of <hi>Dronier,</hi> together with other Pastors of the Neighbouring places, demonstrating both by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Testimonies, and by the Example of the Primitive Church, that they had done nothing but what they ought to do, and what every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Christian was bound to, and consequently that the opinion of <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and his followers was pernicious to the Church in times of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
               <p>The other instruments that Satan made use of to the prejudice of the Church, were the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, with their passionate Proselites, who would faine have done to these godly Christians, as their brethren in iniquity had done to their neighbours in the Dukedom of <hi>Savoy: viz.</hi> Banish, imprison, kill, and confiscate the goods of the <hi>Protestants</hi>: But (through Gods mercy) they were hindred by the Kings Edicts, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to those his Subjects of <hi>Saluces</hi> a peaceable habitation, without being molested for their Conscience and religion, or questioned for any thing they did in their private houses (provided they abstained from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick exercise of it) by which means their Ministers had opportunitie of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling in small Companies, baptizing, marrying, comforting the sick, and instructing every one in particular; which provoked their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to bend themselves chiefly against the Ministers, thinking that if they could find out any meanes to extirpate them,<note place="margin">Popish policy.</note> they should easily prevaile upon the common people, having none to animate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them.</p>
               <p>Accordingly they published an Edict of <hi>Octob.</hi> 19. 1567. in the name of the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> Governour for the King on this side the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, injoyning all of the religion there inhabiting or abiding, that were not the Kings natural Subjects, to depart, together with their families within the space of three dayes, and never to return thither to inhabit, pass,<note place="margin">Persecution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</note> or otherwise to abide without a special safe conduct, upon pain of life, and confiscation of their goods.</p>
               <p>Now the greatest part of the Ministers not being natural subjects to

                  </gap> to obtain a safe conduct, or lastly to incur the penalty: A safe conduct they could not obtain, and yet they thought themselves bound in Conscience not to abandon their people; wherefore continuing with their Congregations, two of them were apprehended and imprisoned: <hi>viz.</hi> Monsieur <hi>Francis Truchi,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Francis Soulf,</hi> where they were detained four years, four moneths, and odd dayes, the poor people being not able by any means to obtain their deliverance, though they continually sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited <hi>de Berague</hi> their Governour,<note place="margin">Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and others that had undertaken the management of these affairs: yet the Lord was so pleased to restrain the power of their Enemies that they could not take away their lives: yea by degrees they obtained for them a more spacious and convenient pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son than that whereunto they were at first confined.</p>
               <p>To procure their full deliverance the Churches of the Marquisate sent their supplications to the King by the aforesaid Minister <hi>Galat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When Sieur <hi>Galatee</hi> returned, he was overjoyed, as well for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous successe of his negotiations, as for the great hopes of a profound peace, founded upon the smooth promises of his Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this joy lasted but from the moneth of <hi>May</hi> 1572. to the beginning of <hi>Septemb.</hi> at which time there arived the lamentable news of the massacre of many noble persons, and multitudes of others who were most inhumanely murthered in divers places of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The massacre of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> to the great astonishment of all the faithful in those parts.</p>
               <p>About the same time there arived letters from the King to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Birague,</hi> by which he was required to have an eye, that, at the arival of the news of what happened at <hi>Paris,</hi> they of the Religion should make no combustion; remitting the rest of his pleasure to those instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which he had sent him by the bearer, the contents whereof were, that he should put to death all the chief of the <hi>Protestants</hi> within his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, whose names he should find in the Roll that should be present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Birague</hi> having received this command, together with the Roll afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, was much troubled, and immediately called his Council to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whom he acquainted with the Kings Orders: whereupon some were of opinion that they should be immediately executed: But others, seeing the King in his late Patents, not many moneths before, had enlarged the Ministers that were imprisoned, and had ordered that those of the reformed Religion should not be any wayes molested for
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:41459:202"/>
their Conscience sake: as also upon consideration that nothing had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred since that time worthy such a change, they therefore thought it sufficient to secure the persons of such as were enrolled,<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> and to defer execution for a while, and in the mean time to inform the King that they were persons of Honour, faithful to his Majesty, living peaceably with their neighbours, and inoffensive in their lives: adding that in case his Majesty was resolved that they should be put to death, there was yet time enough to execute his pleasure therein.</p>
               <p>This advice <hi>Birague</hi> approved of, and accordingly apprehended some, but others escaped, and concealed themselves: and in the mean time he dispatched a Messenger to the King, to inform him as abovesaid, and to know his further pleasure. This Messenger met another at <hi>Lions,</hi> where the King had sent to <hi>Birague</hi> to advertise him, that in case his former Order was not already executed, he should desist from it, and only have a special care that those of the Religion should make no insurrection, nor have any publick exercises.</p>
               <p>But they of the reformed Religion in the Marquisate were not a little troubled when they heard of the cruel massacre of their brethren in <hi>France</hi> without distinction of age, sex, or quality, insomuch as divers of them fled; many <hi>Papists</hi> also secretly caused the families of their kind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This was the condition of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches in <hi>Saluces</hi> during the time that it was under the Dominion of the King of <hi>France,</hi> which continued to the year 1588. at which time the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> took the possession, who, for a while suffered them to enjoy their priviledges in general: But in particular, some of the chief Members of the Church of <hi>Dromier,</hi> being cited to <hi>Turin,</hi> were so befooled with subtile Artifices, that one part of them promised to go to Masse, which gave a conside<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable blow to the said Church, yet it lost not its courage in general, although the great failings of the former encouraged their adversaries to attempt the like upon others by both words and letters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1597. the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> wrote his Letter to them, wherein he told them how desirous he was that all his Subjects in the Marquisat of <hi>Saluces</hi> should embrace the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion,<note place="margin">The Dukes let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to draw them to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</note> and finding that his exhortations had prevailed with some, he hoped that they would have the same effect upon the rest, desiring that laying aside their <hi>Heretical</hi> obstinacie, they would embrace the true Religion out of respect to Gods glory, and their own good, making large promises to such as should submit, and telling them that it should return to their great advantage.</p>
               <p>The Churches of the Marquisat having received this letter, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,<note place="margin">Their answer.</note> first, that they returned his Highness many thanks for that

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly they humbly intreated him to continue to them the said benefit, as also to grant them his protection, seeing that they knew that their Religion was founded upon the holy Scriptures, according to which they ordered their lives and conversations, so as none had any just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of offence: and considering that even the <hi>Jews</hi> and other enemies of Christ were suffered to live in peace, and to enjoy their Religion, they hoped that those which were found Christians, faithful to God, and loyal to their Prince, should not be denyed the same privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>

               <p>This unexpected <hi>Edict</hi> being published through the Marquisate, <hi>July</hi> 1601. much troubled those of the reformed Religion, who immediately sent Deputies to his Highness to obtain a revocation, or at least a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of it: and indeed they had some hopes given them by divers persons of quality, so that many of the poor people resting upon this <hi>broken reed,</hi> let slip much of the said prefixed time without preparing for their departure, whereby they were the more amazed when they understood, not many dayes before the time was expired; that all hope of favour was now wholly taken away: yet most of them prepared for their departure; some recommending their goods to their kindred and friends who remained in the Country, others leaving all they had at random, except what they could carry with them to serve for their present necessities.</p>

               <p>In the beginning of this Persecution, the adversaries fearing some resolute union amongst these poor persecuted souls, to prevent any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion, they gave it out in the Churches of the Mountains, that though the Edict was general, yet the intention thereof was only to unlodg those in the lower Plains,<note place="margin">Popish subtilty</note> in the great Villages, and other publick places: and that such as inhabited amongst the Mountains might be sure to live in peace and quiet: This indeed was a cause that at the first there was not such an universal union amongst those of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> that were destinated for slaughter, as they could have desired: But this fraud at length appearing occasioned a more close union amongst them: Neither was it without cause: for at last they spared those in the Mountains no more then those of the Plains: only that they made no enquiry after the Church of <hi>Pravillelm,</hi> and the quarters thereabouts, who thereupon trusting to the ancientness of their possession, troubled not themselves to make any declaration to the Magistrate, or to prepare themselves for their departure, as if the Edict had not at all concerned them: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed were they disturbed till all the rest were departed out of the Province, and scattered in several places: But at length they were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to understand, that seeing they had not yeilded obedience to the <hi>Edict,</hi> they were liable to the punishment therein appointed: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some warned them to have a care of themselves both in general, and each particular: Hereupon they repaired to the <hi>Syndicks</hi> of the Communalty, requesting them to intercede for them, shewing the reasons why they conceived not themselves concerned by the <hi>Edict,</hi> and therefore they had not offended out of any malicious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy have several persons under pay, whose business it is to kindle strifes and quarrels amongst the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them in suits of Law one against another:<note place="margin">Popish subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> and when they see them reduced to poverty and despair, they secretly offer them all the favour imaginable, provided that they will either openly revolt, or remain as <hi>Spies</hi> amongst their brethren to betray them: and the better to dispose them hereto, they assure them that they shall get a full victory over their Enemies, in case they will imploy some Churchmen to recommend their affairs to the Judges, who in all publick imployments are prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and made their superiours, that so they may over-rule them as they list.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy also knowing that young men are apt to be in love, which captivates reason, they propound to them by their Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, a match with some <hi>Papist,</hi> whose portion and other advantages they amplifie by officious lyes, and so they inveigle some poor souls, sometimes without, and sometimes against the consent of their Parents, and friends: and if any amongst the <hi>Protestants</hi> be so wicked as not to regard the admonitions of their Ministers and Elders, so that they are
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:41459:204"/>
forced to excommunicate them, these Monks and Priests perswade them to embrace the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, where they shall be protected against such as pursue them for their crimes: yea they promise that they shall be set over them in all publick Offices, by which means they may have power in their hands to be revenged of them. This was the practice of the Monks in the year 1640, 1641, &amp;c. even towards some who were manifestly convicted of Witchcraft, who, revolting to <hi>Popery,</hi> had their lives spared, and were set at liberty: yea they have often rewarded them with money, merchandizes and other things; withall exempting them from all manner of Taxes: and when the <hi>Protestants</hi> complained hereof, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> indeed gave them a favourable answer by his <hi>Edict,</hi> dated in <hi>June</hi> 1649. but they could never obtain the putting of it in execution.</p>
                  <p>But of all the means used for these last sixty years to root out, and ruine the <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches in the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> there hath been none like that of the <hi>Missionaries</hi> established by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 8th, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1596. For the Monasteries of these firebrands have ever been as so many Citadels in the Valleys, wherein very many wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed instruments have been harbored, who never ceased to contrive mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief by their lyes, calumnies and slanders wherewith they have filled the ears of the Magistrates and Princes, who have alwayes given more credit to them, than to the true complaints of these poor people in their own just defence, whereupon they have published many bloody <hi>Edicts</hi> against them: and though the <hi>Protestants</hi> reiterated their humble supplications to his Highness, and therein declared their own innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the boldness of those <hi>Missionaries,</hi> which was grown to such a heighth as was altogether intolerable, yet have they prevailed nothing: and that which makes these Monks the more confident, is, that they know they are not to be punished by any Magistrate for whatsoever they say or do against the <hi>Protestants</hi>; no not when they steale away their Children from them: whereas the <hi>Protestants</hi> are put to death if they speak but the least word against these <hi>Missionary</hi> Priests, or but go about to disswade any, though of their own families from turning <hi>Papist.</hi> Yea by the Dukes <hi>Edict</hi> any one witness is sufficient against a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,</hi> and a reward of an hundred Crowns is promised to any that will come and witness against them, whereby all those are encouraged, who either out of revenge, envy, or covetousness, shall report such false things against them as by the Romish Friars they shall be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to.</p>
                  <p>By vertue of this <hi>Edict</hi> the Monks have made bold upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions both in the streets, yea in the very Curches, and that in the Sermon time to set upon the <hi>Protestant</hi> Ministers, with all the most base, vile, and unsufferable speeches they could possibly devise, knowing that no man durst either censure their zeale, or witness against them for what they said or did against the <hi>Protestants,</hi> for fear of the severe penalties ordained against the favourers of <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Nay, if their abusive carriage could but draw any word out of the Ministers, or out
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:41459:204"/>
of any other mans mouth that did not please them, they had their hired witnesse in a readinesse to bring the Minister, or other <hi>Protestant</hi> to the stake, and that without redemption.</p>
                  <p>These men got an <hi>Edict</hi> from Madam Royal, of <hi>Jan.</hi> 16. 1642. having made her believe that the <hi>Papists</hi> were compelled to contribute towards the maintenance of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Ministers, with some other such like fictions; upon which they obtained an Order for the Officers called <hi>Castellani,</hi> to give the <hi>Missionaries</hi> all the Writings they should demand of them; by means whereof they usurped power over the said <hi>Castellani,</hi> and so over the poor <hi>Protestants,</hi> compelling the <hi>Castellani</hi> to make most unjust Ordinances against these poor people: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; when the question is concerning their habitation, the <hi>Missio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> do perswade them that come to witnesse the truth, that so to do is to favour the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> whereby they will fall irrevocably under the censure of Excommunication; whereas its a meritorious work to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse against them by such officious lies as are suggested to them by the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy: Nay, the Judges themselves durst not passe a righteous sentence, when it reflected in the least upon the <hi>Catholick</hi> party. And that they may have the opportunity of negotiating with the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> they procure of his Highnesse every year,<note place="margin">Popish subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> the Assignations of Grain, and other Impositions, that so they of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> being obliged to make their payments to these <hi>Publicans,</hi> they may have the advantage to shew favour, and give ample rewards to such as will comply with their superstitious Idolatry, and to lay heavy burdens upon the backs of those that are true to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                  <p>Mention might here be made of their frequent falling into the said Valleys with Troops of Armed men, under pretence of quartering them there; whereby they have miserably surprized, and made a prey of them: As likewise the cunning stratagems which they have used in all their Treaties, which have been as full of <hi>Jesuitical</hi> Equivocations, as of lines and sentences, following therein their old <hi>Maxime,</hi> that <hi>Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this may be added their diligent search, and strict enquiry after all <hi>Protestant</hi> Books and Writings, which they commit to the fire with much devotion, lest they should discover their rotten principles, and the wickednesse of their actions to the world.</p>
                  <p>Another stratagem they have to allure men to revolt, wherein are proffers of great rewards made, and published in the Princes name; as may be seen in the Dukes own letter, wherein are these words. <hi>To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Hereticks to turn Catholicks, it is our pleasure, and we do hereby expresly command, that all such as shall embrace the Holy Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Faith, shall enjoy an exemption from all, and every tax for the space of five years commencing from the day of their conversion, &amp;c.</hi> Which term of five years he hath sometimes lengthned out to ten or fifteen years; whereas indeed the burden that they took off from these Revolters, they laid upon the backs of those that persevered in their
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:41459:205"/>
Religion, the better to break and destroy them.</p>
                  <p>But as if all this were too little to compass their ends, the Duke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a <hi>Congregation for extirpating the Hereticks,</hi> who were to judge concerning the rights of the <hi>Protestants.</hi> Their meeting place was in the Arch-bishops house, the Bishop himself being President, together with the Dukes Confessor, and divers others, every one of them hired by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to undermine the liberties of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, by robbing them of their Ancient Priviledges under sundry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and upon false Informations. And the better to disguise their proceedings, they usually incense the Duke by grievous accusations, and so procure grievous <hi>Edicts</hi> from him against the poor <hi>Protestants.</hi> These were they who procured from <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> Anno Christi 1602. An <hi>Edict,</hi> wherein he enjoyns the <hi>Protestants</hi> upon pain of death to banish from amongst them all manner of Schools both publick and private, (as <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate had formerly done to extirpate the Christian Religion) And by another <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 18. 1622. he forbade them to receive any strangers amongst them that should be either Ministers or Schoolmasters, as also from sending their youth into Forreign Schools suspected of <hi>Heresie.</hi> He also debarred all manner of <hi>Protestants</hi> from publick Offices, either great or small. In another <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,</hi> all <hi>Protestants</hi> were commanded either to go to Masse, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part within two moneths after the publication thereof: And by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Edict</hi> the same was commanded, and but fifteen dayes given them.</p>
                  <p>Another order was given out, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 18. 1634. enjoyning the <hi>Protestants</hi> of <hi>Campiglione,</hi> to leave that place within twenty foure houres, and that upon pain of death, which was executed without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The same was done <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1655. by <hi>Gastaldo,</hi> who gave no longer than twenty foure houres to those of the Valleys of Saint <hi>Martino</hi> and <hi>Perosa,</hi> to depart upon pain of death; and to those that lived beyond <hi>Pelice,</hi> but three days.</p>
                  <p>Many times when these <hi>Missionary</hi> Fathers could not possibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade his Royal Highnesse to an open Persecution against the generality of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> then they usually tormented them one by one upon sundry false pretences, whom they delivered up to the <hi>Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> who contrary to all Forms of Justice, forthwith condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, without so much as hearing them, or letting them know their accusers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1622. They took one Mr. <hi>Sebastian Basan,</hi> and after the <hi>Inquisitors</hi> had cruelly tempted and tormented him for the space of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen months, they burned him alive at <hi>Turin,</hi> Novemb. 23. 1623. where he dyed, singing the praises of God in the midst of the flames.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1655. These <hi>Missionary</hi> Fathers stole away very many of the <hi>Protestants</hi> children in the time of the Massacre; whom they would not afterwards restore, though his Highness had promised it by his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; which practice is the most execrable of all the <hi>Turkish</hi> tyrannies:
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:41459:205"/>
Yet there is this difference, that the <hi>Turks</hi> do so only to their own Subjects, whereas the <hi>Popes</hi> Ministers do it to those over whom they have no right at all. Two instances may be given (amongst many others) of the subtile insinuations of the <hi>Jesuites</hi> to withdraw men from the truth; There were two Ministers, the one Mr. <hi>Peter Gros,</hi> the other Mr. <hi>Francis Aguit,</hi> with whom they had thus prevailed: But the Lord in mercy shewing them the greatnesse of their sin,<note place="margin">Humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> they made a publick Recantation in a full Congregation, <hi>August.</hi> 28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29. 1655. at <hi>Pinache</hi> in the Valley of <hi>Perouse,</hi> wherein they testified their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream sorrow for their defection through infirmity, from the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, during the time of their Imprisonment at <hi>Turin,</hi> together with their abjuration of <hi>Popery,</hi> which they conclude thus.</p>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:41459:206"/>
the Courtiers for persecuting the <hi>Reformed</hi> party are rewarded with Prebendaries, Bishopricks, Abbies, and Priories, especially such as are members of the <hi>Council for extirpating of Hereticks.</hi> 3. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this pretext, the poor people of the Valleys become a prey to the said Courtiers, who daily rob, and spoil them, extorting the best part of their livelishood by sundry subtile devices. 4. The Gentry of <hi>Lucerna</hi> (who are very poor) promote this work all they can by perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual calumnies against them, rendring themselves by such good Offices capable of meriting, and receiving those pensions which are assigned them by the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> for the same purpose. 5. For this end of late they have made the Gentlemen of the respective Valleys subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the Monks, and Masse-Priests, who teach and appoint them what to do, as to the bearing of false-witnesse against their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, sowing discord amongst them, murthering of some, procuring the Assasination of others, stealing, and carrying away their children, &amp;c. without the performance whereof they refuse to pay them their yearly Pensions. 6. But the chief ground of all why the Court of <hi>Savoy</hi> strives so much to extirpate this poor people, is, the Designe that they have to wrest <hi>Pignorolio</hi> out of the hands of the King of <hi>France,</hi> to which the habitation, and liberty of those people are a great hindrance: For they, inhabiting the neighbouring parts of <hi>Pigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolio,</hi> both in the Plaine and Mountains, cannot, upon the account of conscience, be brought to make any agreement with the <hi>Spanish</hi> party for assaulting, and surprizing that place: Hence the Court of <hi>Savoy</hi> seeks all manner of occasions to root them out, especially those of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, Fenile, Bobio, Campiglione, Bricheras,</hi> and Saint <hi>Secondo,</hi> which are near <hi>Pignorolio,</hi> and to deprive it thereby of all sorts of commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which it receives from the Valleys, which alone doth furnish it with more than all the neighbouring Valleys which belong to the Duke. Now if these people were extirpated, and others put in their places, men forward to execute their Designes, they might easily seize on <hi>Malange,</hi> a narrow passage above <hi>Pignorolio,</hi> on that side which looks towards <hi>France,</hi> where a very few persons would be able to hinder the <hi>French</hi> Armies from relieving <hi>Pignorolio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon these, and the like grounds the Court of <hi>Savoy</hi> hath sought their destruction, though its true, that in all the persecutions which they have raised against them, especially in this last, 1655. those <hi>ravening wolves</hi> approached <hi>in sheeps cloathing,</hi> the better to deceive, and destroy the <hi>innocent Lambs</hi> of Christ. For these <hi>Evangelical</hi> Churches had, long before that fatal year, cleared themselves of all those calumnies which the <hi>Council for the extirpation of Hereticks,</hi> to the end that they might enjoy their promised Pensions, had cast upon them. Yea, his Royal Highnesse had now given an ample testimony of his being fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this point, and by an authentick Decree published <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1649. had confirmed all former Confessions; which confirmation was again renewed <hi>Anno</hi> 1653. confirming the Grants made to them in the years 1603. and 1620. without any addition, or diminution, amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or restriction whatsoever.</p>

Now as these poor people sought for an <hi>Interination</hi> of these Grants, His Royal Highness, knowing that the delay thereof proceeded not from any negligence of their part, but was occasioned by the multitude of Troops that were then quartered upon them, whereby they could not possibly have the convenience of assembling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out of his goodness towards them, he declared by an <hi>Edict,</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 19. 1654. that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was that they should enjoy the Concessions as effectually as if they had been again <hi>interinated,</hi> upon condition that they did procure the <hi>Interination</hi> thereof within three moneths following. So that till this time of <hi>May</hi> 19. 1654. none can say that those of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> had committed any thing whereby to be deprived of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their Concessions; yet contrary to all their expectations, short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, <hi>viz. January</hi> 25. 1655. this infamous Order was published by <hi>Andrew Gastaldo,</hi> Doctor of the Civil Law,<note place="margin">

                  <p>It's easie to conjecture the miserable inconveniencies of a flight in the midst of winter, especially to such a people amongst whom were many aged and decrepit, many sick and diseased, besides a multitude of women big with childe, or newly brought to bed, together with a number of tender Infants, yet all forced to flye, and none being in capacity to succor another. Yet did these bloody beasts in the most violent and rigorous winter-season chase and drive out of their houses
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:41459:207"/>
all on a sudden those poor people, who scarce had clothes to cover their nakedness, much less were they provided to resist the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of cold, and hunger; thinking hereby either to force them to change their Religion,<note place="margin">Popish cruelty</note> or to cause them to dye in the craggy Rocks and snowy Mountains; yea, they were so subtilly malicious as to chuse those very days, when by reason of the multitude of violent wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Plain, and of snow upon the Mountains, they judged it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for those silly sheep ever to escape.</p>
                  <p>But these poor people considering that the Apostacy propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was the way to eternal damnation, chose rather to follow Christ in bearing his <hi>cross,</hi> and to hazard their temporary lives, rather than to lose their souls for ever; yet that they might leave no lawful means unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, they presently dispatched their Deputies to the Governor, to represent to him the strangeness of this command, to force them with their Families to abandon their antient habitations; as also that it was impossible for so many souls as there were in number to subsist in the said place, to which by the <hi>Edict</hi> they were confined, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing scarce sufficient to supply in any sort those that inhabited them: As likewise, that this command was contrary to all their former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions, upon which account they <hi>protested and appealed</hi> to his Royal Highness. But the Governor knowing well the intention of the <hi>Council for the extirpating of Hereticks,</hi> would neither admit of the one or of the other. Hereupon the poor people, seeing they could obtain nothing of him, entreated him to grant them at least some time to have recourse to the Duke by humble supplications; but this also was deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unless they would draw up their Petition by a model which he should prescribe, which indeed was prejudicial both to their just Rights and Consciences. These poor people (I say) seeing this, to the end that they might remove all pretext for accusing them of Rebellion, under that colour to ruine and destroy them; hoping also that at last they might finde some means to lay their griefs at the feet of his Royal Highness, and that his Clemency and Justice would in the end re-establish them in their ancient habitations,<note place="margin">They go into banishment.</note> they chose rather to suffer this violence; and therefore recalling their <hi>Protestation,</hi> thereby to testifie their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found respect to their Prince, they quitted their houses, and goods, and retired with their Familes, their Wives and Children, great and small, young and old, whole and sick; yea, halt, lame and blind; drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after them such as were infirm by sickness or age through Rain, Snow, Ice, Waters, and a thousand difficulties.</p>
                  <p>Oh think with your selves, what bitter tears, what wringing of hands, what smitting upon the breasts, what mournings, sighings, and lamentations there were in the families of these miserable and distressed Creatures, who were now reduced to the utmost of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; before them were a multitude of violent and roaring waters, on each hand most barbarous and snowy mountains; behinde them, men sevenfold worse than the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> ready to butcher and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them; yet recommending themselves, Souls and Bodies
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:41459:207"/>
to Gods protection, they are resolved to undergo the worst of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary miseries, rather than by denying their Religion,<note place="margin">Constancy.</note> to damn their Souls.</p>
                  <p>This their Constancy and Resolution was no small comfort to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, and a matter of great astonishment to their Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors; the rather considering the great advantages they might have purchased by quitting their Religion; as Pardon for all crimes, Liberty if in Prisons, exemption from all manner of Taxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They were no sooner departed from their houses, but a number of Thieves and Robbers entred them, spoiling and pillaging whatever the people had left behinde them, pulling down their houses, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down all their trees, and turning their habitation into a desolate wilderness; of which violence the poor people complained to the Duke, and received from him such an answer, that they apprehended his intentions were not that they should wholly quit their houses till their cause might be heard and judged; in confidence hereof, they sometimes returned to their houses to guard them from these Robbers, and to husband their ground, that so they might have wherewithal to pay their Taxes; yet for this they were bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Rebellion, though they had neither taken up arms, nor act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any other hostility, every one living peaceably without giving any cause of offence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gastaldo</hi> having thus driven these poor people from their antient inheritance, without legal citing them, hearing their plea,<note place="margin">Popish cruelty</note> or giving them the least time to provide for so sad a flight; their last refuge was to have recourse to the Lord by fervent prayers, and to their Prince by humble supplications; which was done not only by those that were driven from their houses, but by the other Churches of the <hi>Reforned Religion,</hi> the cause being common to them all. But alas! they found both his and all other his Ministers ears stopped to their wosull crys; neither could they obtain so much as admittance into the presence of his Royal Highness.</p>
                  <p>Amongst other cunning Artifices used by their malicious Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries to imbitter the spirits of his Highness, and the Dutchess his Mother against these poor <hi>Protestants,</hi> this was one; <hi>John Ressan,</hi> President of the Province of <hi>Pignorolio,</hi> having for many years born a deadly spleen against the popish Priest of <hi>Fenile,</hi> hired one to assassinate him; and then by his Secretary, he spread it abroad all over the Country that the <hi>Protestants</hi> were the Authors of the murther, who yet five days before were driven out of <hi>Fenile,</hi> which report flew far and near, being entertained as an undoubted truth by those <hi>Papists</hi> who lived far off, encreasing also with carriage, though upon the place the author of this murther was well known, so that by all their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports they were not able to fasten any blemish in the minds of the dead Priests friends and Kindred, nor to hinder them from apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the Master and his Secretary; by which means the innocency
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:41459:208"/>
of the <hi>Reformed party</hi> was so cleared to the world, that the Marquess of <hi>Pionessa,</hi> in his Letters, wherein he sought all the devices he could to lay something to their charge, never mentions this for fear of blemish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the credit of all the rest.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after one <hi>Berru</hi> basely murdered <hi>Peter Rovier</hi> Consul of <hi>Mean</hi>; and then fled to <hi>Pignorolio,</hi> where he was met by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Rissan,</hi> who was lately returned from <hi>Turin,</hi> where he had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned for the former murther, and now had his liberty no otherwise than upon good security, because the said <hi>Berru</hi> and some others had taken their oathes against his Secretary [<hi>D. Agot</hi>] and himself, for being guilty of the aforementioned assassination; but after some private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences had between them <hi>Rissan,</hi> so wrought upon that wretched <hi>Berru,</hi> by gifts and promises, that he was perswaded to return back with him to <hi>Turin,</hi> and there not only to retract his former oath, but to swear that he had been sollicited thereto by the two Pastors <hi>Leger</hi> and <hi>Mechelin,</hi> as also by <hi>Antonio,</hi> and <hi>Francis Danna,</hi> chief <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church of S. <hi>Giovanni</hi>; by means of this devilish retractation and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie, <hi>Rissan</hi> and his Secretary were discharged in the very heat of the War between the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> so that they had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of forging what lies they pleased against the <hi>Protestants,</hi> both at <hi>Lucerna</hi> and <hi>Turin,</hi> without the least contradiction, which accordingly they did to the purpose; for at <hi>Lucerna</hi> there were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished at the same time two personal <hi>Citations</hi> against the said <hi>Leger, Mechelin,</hi> and <hi>Danna</hi>; and as for <hi>Berru,</hi> he was also at the same time, as a recompence for his perjury, discharged, and set at liberty, though he had been convicted of two murders, the one the afore-mentioned, and the other at S. <hi>Giovanni,</hi> upon one <hi>Giovanni Bertot,</hi> a <hi>Protestant.</hi> After this base action, he came to the said <hi>Leger,</hi> and many other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of the Valleys,<note place="margin">Popish dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</note> and chief men, and leaning upon his staff, and bemoaning his condition, he protested to them that he could scarce stand upright, by reason of the many blows which he had received from the <hi>Papists</hi> to force him to forswear himself against the said <hi>Leger</hi> and the rest; but as he could not in conscience do so wicked an act, so he had withstood them to the utmost; telling them plainly, who so urged him, that he would rather be torn with wilde horses than do it; and that they thereupon seeing his constancy, had beaten him most unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and then cast him out into the open streets, where he had mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably perished, had not a certain <hi>Jew</hi> pitied him, and took him up, as he was grovelling on the ground, and ready to give up the ghost.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Treaty of Peace being concluded at <hi>Pigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolio, Aug.</hi> 1655. Mr. <hi>Leger</hi> and the rest against whom the Process had been made, as against <hi>Criminals,</hi> staying a while at <hi>Pignorolio,</hi> chanced to hear of it, and thereupon went presently to the Prefect <hi>Rissan,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating him to tell them if it were true that <hi>Berru</hi> had thus accused them; <hi>Rissan</hi> made them such a doubtful answer, that they judged it high time to have immediate recourse to the Senator <hi>Prerrastino,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:41459:208"/>
him to declare to them the truth of the whole matter, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them a set time and place to make their justification: Hereupon he told them plainly that <hi>Berru</hi> had accused them for suborning him to swear falsly against <hi>De Agot</hi>; and his Master; and withal he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them a copy of the <hi>Citation</hi> against the said <hi>Leger,</hi> and the rest of his Complices, which was to banish them out of the Dukes Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, if they did not appear personally at <hi>Turin</hi> to answer to such <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories</hi> as should be proposed to them about that business. Upon this Sieur <hi>Leger,</hi> by the assistance of <hi>David Leger,</hi> a Minister, handled the matter so, that the said <hi>Berru</hi> was shortly after apprehended, as he was lurking in the Highways, with a purpose to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the said <hi>Leger</hi> upon the first opportunity. This wretch being thus apprehended, used all the devices imaginable to have got out of their hands; though they assured him, that all that they intended was only to make him verifie what he had already confessed before a full Assembly of their Ministers and others. <hi>Leger</hi> being assured that <hi>Berru</hi> was in safe custody, went and declared the whole matter to the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Perichvini,</hi> and to <hi>Referendano Tarquin,</hi> yea and to <hi>Rissan</hi> himself, who was on a sudden not a little surprised at it; afterwards he told it to the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador, and to the Ambassadors of the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Cantons,</hi> and with much ado he got leave to bring the said per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured person to <hi>Pignorolio</hi>; where he hoped to obtain leave of coming face to face against him in open Justice, importuning all the Dukes Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Justice, and the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Switzers</hi> Ambassadors for their intercession, the last whereof openly protested, that in case of refusal, they would complain that Justice was denied them; yet could they prevail no further,<note place="margin">Popish inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</note> but that there should be a letter written to <hi>Turin</hi> about it: from whence after a while they had an answer, that nothing could be done in it; and so <hi>Leger</hi> was fain to content himself, that he and the rest that had been accused were declared as persons altogether innocent, and clearly acquitted from the accusation that <hi>Berru</hi> had made against them.</p>
                  <p>Upon this and the like feigned accusations, the Deputies of these poor people and their Supplications were miserably rejected at the Court of <hi>Savoy</hi>: For when they instantly beseeched the chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of State at <hi>Turin,</hi> that they might be admitted into the Dukes presence, there to cast themselves at his feet, the <hi>Council for extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Hereticks</hi> would not suffer them to have audience of his Highness, and contrary to all equity they usurped the cognisance of this business, which belonged not to them, they being of the adverse party; nay, they were not suffered to come in personally before them to plead their own cause, but were forced to send in their Procurator <hi>Gibellino,</hi> a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,</hi> who, knowing that Excommunication is the certain punishment of all those that any way favored the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> durst not speak a word till he had fallen down on his knees and begged leave of the Archbishop, who was President of that Council; and the conclusion was, that those of the Valleys were commanded to make no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:41459:209"/>
to his Royal Highness, unless they would send Deputies with procuration, and power to accept and promise all that should be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them; yet they (like the importunate widow) sent again their Deputies to <hi>Turin,</hi> with their requests, and with order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to get audience of his Royal Highness; they also, beside other intercessions, instantly requested Madam Royal to have pity on them, and to procure the same for them; they wrote also other Letters to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Princes of the blood to mediate for them about the same; but all in vain, for they could get no answer from any of them; and the Marquess of <hi>Pionessa</hi> slighted their supplications, thirsting violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the blood of these poor creatures; yet that he might not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discover the black design of the <hi>Council for extirpating of Hereticks,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Popish sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</note> before the hour of its execution, he disguised his answers to them in such doubtful terms, that though he gave them but cold comfort, yet he left them not without some glimmering hopes at least of a day of audience for the hearing of their complaints, that so during this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of time all things might be in a better readiness for the day of slaughter, as you shall hear in the next Chapter.</p>

               </head>
               <p>UPon <hi>Saturday April</hi> 17, 1655. whilst the deputies of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> were by the subtilties of <hi>Pionessa,</hi> detained at <hi>Turin,</hi> as you heard before, there arrived a great Army at St. <hi>Giovanni,</hi> which was now, with <hi>La Torre,</hi> and all the lower parts unpeopled, and in a sad and lamentable condition; this Army continued there for some hours, and in the dusk of the evening fell into <hi>La Torre,</hi> where they met with none of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> only about eight or ten persons, not thinking of an enemy, were seeking up and down for something to satisfie their hunger; but so soon as they came near to the Convent they were saluted with a volley of shot, which killed <hi>Giovanni Combe,</hi> and hurt <hi>Peter Rostain,</hi> whereupon the rest, seeing the danger fled for their lives.</p>
               <p>The next day being the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the enemy ranged about through the Communalties of <hi>La Torre,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Popish cruelty</note> and St. <hi>Giovanni,</hi> plundering and pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all before them; and the day after, heir number being encreased, to about Fifteen thousand, they set upon the <hi>Protestants</hi> in several quarters
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:41459:209"/>
amongst the little hills of St. <hi>Giovanni,</hi> and <hi>La Torre.</hi> But the poor people, being prompted thereto by the Law of Nature,<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants defend themselves.</note> stood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own defence, and the enemy was vigorously opposed on every side; in one place by Captain <hi>Jahier,</hi> and in other places by the Officers of St. <hi>Giovanni, Angrognia, Roccapiatta</hi>; and their Troops. <hi>Tuesday April</hi> 20. The <hi>Popish</hi> Army made three several attempts to take away the Bell of St. <hi>Giovanni,</hi> and to burn the Church; but those of the poor people in arms did so couragiously resist them, that they were driven to a shameful retreat, with the loss of about Fifty of their men; and had not their Cavalry defended the Plain, they had been utterly routed: But of the <hi>Protestants</hi> party there were onely Two slain, upon whose dead bodies they basely revenged themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wednesday</hi> the 21. which was the fatal day to the <hi>Protestants,</hi> the Marquess of <hi>Pianessa</hi> held the Deputies of the Valley of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerna</hi> in parley till noon, and then entertained them with a large Dinner, and sent them away with many fair promises, that there should be no hurt done to any except those of St. <hi>Giovanni</hi> and <hi>La Torre,</hi> as being the places specified in the Order of <hi>Gastaldo</hi>;<note place="margin">Popish sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</note> but for the rest, if they would but quarter a few Troops as a token of their obedience, and that but for a short time, they might be fearless of the least inconvenience. Hereupon the Agents of <hi>Angrogna</hi> bestir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves to perswade their own party from making the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance; the same did the Agents of <hi>Villaro</hi> and <hi>Bobio:</hi> But no sooner were those Troops entred, but they put all to fire and sword, slaying all they met with that had but the likeness of mankind, and that in the most barbarous manner they could possibly devise: As you may see by this extract of a Letter written by some of those poor <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> wherein they thus write; <hi>The Army having gotten footing, became very numerous by the addition of a multitude of the neighboring inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who hearing that we were given for a prey to the Plunderers, fell upon us with an impetuous fury: To these were added a great number of Out-laws, Prisoners, and other Offenders, who thought hereby to have saved their souls, and filled their purses: We were forced also to receive five or six Regiments of the</hi> French <hi>Army, besides some</hi> Irish <hi>(to whom as it was said, our Country was promised) and several other Troops of High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-men, and Vagabonds, under a pretence of coming into the Valleys only for fresh Quarters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The multitude being licensed by</hi> Pianessa, <hi>encouraged by the Monks, and led by our wicked Neighbors,</hi>

                  <hi>fell upon us with such violence on every side, and in so treacherous a manner, especially in</hi> Angrognia, Villaro <hi>and</hi> Bobio (<hi>to whom</hi> Pianessa <hi>had plighted his troth, that if they would but quarter one Regiment, they should be secure from all harm) that in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time all was turned into a confused heap, and the inhabitants constrained after skirmishes that they made in the way, to fiye for their lives, together with their Wives and little children; and that not onely the inhabitants of the Plains, but of the Mountains also, who had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:41459:210"/>
been certainly betrayed and surprised. Yet was not all their diligence sufficient to preserve very many of them from destruction; for in many places they were hemmed in on every side, that there was no way left for their flight, but they were most inhumanl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In one place they cruelly tormented One hundred and fity Women and Children, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards chopped off the heads of some, and dashed out the brains of others against the rocks: Multitudes of Prisoners they took; and such of them from fifteen years of age and upward who refused to go to Mass, they hanged up some, and nailed the feet of others to trees, with their heads hanging downwards, all which they constantly endured. Mr.</hi> Gross, <hi>one of the Pastors, with some of his Family they sent to</hi> Turin: <hi>They made such havock of all, that there were neither any Cattel or other Provision left in the Valley of</hi> Lucerna; <hi>Yea, in the Communalties of St.</hi> Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni, La Torre, <hi>&amp;c. a Franciscan Friar and another Priest set fire on houses and Churches that they left not one of them unburnt. In these desolations the Mother was bereaved of her sweet Childe, the Husband of his dear Wife. Those which were richest amongst us are forced to beg their bread; yea, they are weltring in their own blood, and deprived of all outward comforts; and whereas there were some Churches in St.</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino, <hi>that were always formerly as a Sanctuary to the persecuted, they are now commanded to quit their dwellings, and every soul of them presently to depart without any respite, and that under pain of death.</hi>

The Declaration of Monsieur <hi>du Petit Bourg,</hi> first Captain of the Regiment of <hi>Gransey,</hi> subscribed with his own hand at <hi>Pignerol, Nov.</hi> 27. 1655. in the presence of two other Commanders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Sieur du Petit Bourg being commanded by Prince Thomas to go, and joyne my self with the Marquesse of Pianessa, who was then at La Torre; upon my departure I was requested by the Ambassador to speak to the Marquesse, and to use my endeavour to accommodate the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which were amongst those of the Religion in the Valleys of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, which accordingly I did, entreating him with much earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that he would give way thereunto, and I doubted not but I should be able to effect it: but he refused this my request, and that divers times, notwithstanding all the endeavours I could possibly use to perswade him thereto; and instead of the least mitigation, I was witnesse to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great violences, and extreme cruelties exercised by the Bandets, and souldiers of Piemont upon all sorts, of every age, sex, and condition, whom I saw massacred, dismembred, hanged up, burnt, and ravished, together with many horrid confusions, which I beheld with horror and regret: and without any distinction of those that resisted, and such as resisted not, they were used with all sorts of inhumanity, their houses burnt, their goods plundered; and when prisoners were brought before the said Marquesse, I saw him give order to give them no quarter at all, saying, his Highnesse was resolved to have none of the Religion within his Dominions. And whereas in his Declaration he protests that there was no hurt done to any but during the fight, nor the least out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage committed upon any persons that were not fit to beare Armes: I will maintaine that it is not so, having seene with my eyes many persons killed in cold blood: as also women, aged persons, and young children, miserably murdered, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>IN the former Chapter you have a faithful Narration of what cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were exercised against the <hi>Reformed</hi> party in the Valleys of <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> from the first arrival of, the Marquesse of <hi>Pianessa</hi>'s forces at St. <hi>Giovanni,</hi> which was <hi>April</hi> 17. 1655. to the 21. of the same: by which time they had made such havock of the poor people, that there was now onely the little Communalty of <hi>Roras</hi> which was left entire, and untouched: But that they also might in all things be made like unto their suffering brethren of the other Churches, and that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the destruction was designed to be universal, the Earle of <hi>Christophle</hi> upon that very day, being <hi>April</hi> 21. sent three hundred Souldiers secretly by the way of <hi>Villaro,</hi> to surprize them of <hi>Roras,</hi> and to put them all to the sword: This party being got upon a little hill called <hi>Rumer,</hi> belonging to <hi>Roras,</hi> it pleased God that they were met with by some Souldiers belonging to Captaine <hi>Joshua Gianavel</hi> (whom God raised up at that time as a choice Instrument for the preservation of the poor scattered remnant of his people). These Souldiers being but seven or eight of them, yet having been beforehand placed in <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscado</hi> at a convenient Post to prevent the inrode of the enemy, they fired upon them, and plyed them so hard, that many of them were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the place, and the rest, supposing by the great number of bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets that flew about their eares, that the men in <hi>Ambuscado</hi> were sixe times more in number than indeed they were, they fled back in great disorder, and confusion: which the others perceiving, they fell upon their Rear, and chased them at least three quarters of a League amongst the Rocks, and Woods, doing notable execution upon them in their flight.</p>
               <p>The Members of this little Church of <hi>Roras,</hi> to take away all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of exceptions, presented their complaints to the Marquesse of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anessa,</hi> who, that he might have the better opportunity to deceive, and
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:41459:216"/>
surprize them, answered, that those of his Souldiers that went to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Popish subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</note> were but Thieves, Robbers, and Out-lawes, that herein had whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disobeyed his Orders; adding that they had done him a singular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in driving them out of their Countrey; and that he would take a course to prevent their being disturbed for the future: and hereupon he published an Order whereby he straightly charged his Souldiers, not to give them any further causes of complaints, nor to molest them in any kind hereafter. Yet perfidiously, the very next day he sent a party of five hundred chosen men to put his first bloody designe in execution.</p>
               <p>As these men were passing over a little hill of <hi>Roras,</hi> they were so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by eleven Musqueteers of the <hi>Protestants,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> and six men with slings under the conduct of Captaine <hi>Gianavel,</hi> who had divided them into three Squadrons, that the enemy was soone put to flight: and this poor handful of despicable men pursued them for an whole League, slaying a very great number of them, without the losse or hurt of any one of themseves, which shews the admirable Providence of God in preserving, and prospering those that fight his battels.</p>
               <p>The Marquesse of <hi>Pianessa,</hi> though he had failed this second, yet was resolved to make a third attempt; and still to deceive them, he made new promises, and protestations that no injury in the world should be offered them, and that in regard of the Intercession of the Earle of <hi>Christophle,</hi> their Lord and Patron, he would protect, and defend them; yet the very morrow after he sent a party of seven hundred men, who first seized upon, and secured all the passes, that none might escape their bloody hands, and then most barbarously burnt, and destroyed whatsoever they met with thorow all the Communalty of <hi>Roras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon seventeen housekeepers, whose hearts God had marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously strengthened, and encouraged for their poor Brethrens preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, seeing what they must expect, and that nothing but death, and destruction waited for them, unlesse some admirable providence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it: as also calling to mind those signal deliverances which God had vouchsafed to his ancient people of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in their greatest straits: they unanimously resolved to cast themselves with their lives, and estates into the hands of the same God, resting upon his gracious promises, and freely submitting to his good will and pleasure for the issue of their undertaking. The Captaine of this valiant party was the aforesaid <hi>Gianavel,</hi> who marching up with this little Band, suddenly surprized, and dexterously carried away their Court of Guard with their Centinel from off a little hill where they were placed: At which bold attempt, the enemy being not a little amazed, withdrew from the place where they were, resolving to march thorow a little meadow, and so to get to <hi>Villaro</hi> or <hi>La Torre:</hi> But being not nimble enough, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers met with them at <hi>Piampra,</hi> and there slew many of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the losse of any one of their own, and took from them all the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and other things which they had plundered from the neighbouring places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pianessa</hi> seeing all his designes thus frustrated, and that his specious
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:41459:216"/>
promises were but as so many watchwords to bid these poor people to stand upon their guard; he speedily sent to all those of <hi>Lucerna, Bubbia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Barges, Bagnol, Famolas, Cavors,</hi> and the adjacent places, who wete able to bear arms, to come and joyn with a good part of his own Army, to environ these poor people on every side. But God, who infatuates mens Counsels as he pleaseth, though the time of their Rendezvouse was punctually assigned them, yet they came two hours too late; all except the Troop of <hi>Bagnol,</hi> which was conducted by one <hi>Mario,</hi> a notorious persecutor, and an inveterate Enemy to the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches: This <hi>Mario</hi> with his ragged Regiment of Theives, Outlaws, and a great number of <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels, assaulted this poor people on the upper and lower part of the Canton of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> who were not about Seventeen in number; yet the Lord was pleased so to encourage them, that they presently gat upon the top of the mountain, and there after a long skirmish forced their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, though full of fury and malice, yet to give back, and to flie as far as the Cliff called <hi>Pairo Capello</hi>; in which fight and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit they killed above Sixty of them, and wounded many more, and many of them being laden with plunder, as they fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Precipices</hi> of the Rocks, fell down, and were dashed in pieces. Those of them that were lighter, and nimbler, gat safe to <hi>Pairo Capello</hi>; but when they came there they found greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to contest with than before; for being closly pursued and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed in on every side, they were forced to take the Ropes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they had bund up their plunder, and tying them to shrubs, to slide down the Rocks by them, and to fall into the River that ran below; but by reason of the violence of the torrent, and the great confusion that was amonst them, one falling on the neck of another, and such as could not swim, catching hold of them that could, the greatest part of them were there drowned. Captain <hi>Mario</hi> also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest threw himself into the River, and had not several of the Souldiers that could swim excellent well, ventured their lives to fetch him out, he had gone with the rest to receive present pay from the Devil.</p>
               <p>This Captain <hi>Mario,</hi> having thus escaped,<note place="margin">Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors.</note> was carried to <hi>Lucer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> in his shirt, without either Hat or Shoos, as a man at his wits end; and shortly after he fell into a desperate disease, whereof he died: But before his death he oft cried out in a most despairing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he felt a grievous burning in his bowels, as a just Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him for having burnt so many innocent persons, and their habitations.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Protestants</hi> after this gallant action, being somewhat weary with their hard service, as they were marching back to refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they spied another company of Murtherers coming from <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laro,</hi> whereupon forgetting their weariness, they placed themselves in <hi>Ambuscado</hi>: when the Enemy drew near the place, they perceived some of them; but not being able by their colours to discern of

what party they were, they called to them for <hi>THE WORD</hi>; the <hi>Protestants</hi> answered not, but beckned to them to come nearer, which they did in a careless posture, supposing them to be friends, and when they came near, the others suddenly discharged upon them, and slew many of them upon the place, and the rest they pursued near to <hi>La Torre,</hi> and <hi>Villaro.</hi> After which signal Victory, Captain <hi>Gianavel</hi> rallied his men upon an high ground not far off, and in the very sight of his enemies, he caused them to kneel down, and with a loud voyce to give thanks unto the Lord for this very great mercy in their deliverance.</p>
               <p>Three days after, the Marquess of <hi>Pianessa,</hi> being highly incensed by this success of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> sent to the people of <hi>Roras,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly charging them to change their Religion, within the space of Twenty four hours, and that upon pain of death, and of having their houses burnt to the ground: To which they answered, That they would much rather chuse death, than to obey any such Order. The Marquess vexed at their resolute answer, presently dispatched away Eight thousand men, besides the <hi>Militia</hi> Forces of the neighboring Commonalties; who according to his order were divided into three Squadrons, the one to set upon the poor people on the side of <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> the other upon the Mountains of <hi>Bagnol,</hi> and the third on that part which looks toward <hi>Lucerna</hi>; which accordingly they did, not only murthering man, woman and childe, but exercising all manner of cruelties upon them, taking much pleasure (like bloody villains) in torturing those poor creatures, and in tossing their little Infants from off their Pikes and Halberts, and dashing their brains against the Rocks, whose cryes would have melted an heart of <hi>Adamant,</hi> but theirs were harder; the number thus taken and slain was about One hundred twenty six, the rest almost miraculously escaped their bloody hands.</p>
               <p>Having thus shewn their valour upon naked men, women and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and being glutted with the prey that they found in the Country, they turned their houses into ashes; and such as survived they sent priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to <hi>Turin,</hi> amongst whom was the Wife and Children of Captain <hi>Gianavel,</hi> and so they marched back to <hi>Lucerna</hi> with great joy and acclamations.</p>
               <p>Shortly after <hi>Pianessa</hi> wrote to Captain <hi>Gianavel</hi> promising him great preferment if he would change his Religion; Otherwise, threatning that his Wife and Children should be burnt: He also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised a great sum of money to any that should bring him the said <hi>Gianavel</hi> either alive or dead. To this Captain <hi>Gianavel</hi> presently answered, <hi>That there was no torment so violent, nor death so cruel, that he did not much prefer before the abjuration of his Religion; and that all these promises and threats did but the more fortifie him and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then his Faith: And for his Wife and Children, he told the Marquess that though he had gotten them into his power, yet he could but kill their Bodies; And as for their Souls, he recommended them, together with his
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:41459:217"/>
own into the hands of God, in case it so happened that he should fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Captain <hi>Gianavel</hi> having gotten together a small party of men upon part of the <hi>Alps</hi> called <hi>La Pellas des Jamies, May</hi> 22. went out in the evening to a place about three leagues off, not far from <hi>Bubiana,</hi> where he first sought God by prayer, and afterwards being informed of the number and strength of the enemy, finding them too many to be attachqued by such a handful of men, he turned towards <hi>Lucernetta,</hi> where he was furiously assaulted by the Garison of <hi>Lucerna,</hi> but he couragiously encountred them without the loss of any one man, only himself was shot into the leg, by a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that had hid himself behinde a tree, with a purpose to have slain him; but the Captain perceiving whence the shot came, lame as he was, he made to the place, where he quickly dispatched him for his pains.</p>
               <p>Whilst these things were acting, the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses Army, thinking to make themselves Masters of <hi>Babbiana,</hi> under a pretence of protecting them against the <hi>Barbets,</hi> the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants of the place perceiving their drift, took occasion to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with them, and after drove them out, killing a great number of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 26. 1655. Captain <hi>Gianavel</hi> wrote to Captain <hi>Jahier</hi> and the rest that were retired into <hi>Val Lucerna,</hi> to meet at a <hi>Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz</hi> at <hi>Angrognia,</hi> which accordingly they did, and the day after they marched together to a place in the Plain called <hi>Garcigliana,</hi> thinking to have entred the Town; but they met with a great party of Horse and Foot, yet they disputed it with them a long time, but being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowred, they were forced to retreat; though they got six yoke of Oxen, and many other small Cattel, and some prisoners, and that with the loss of one only man in the retreat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> 28. They marched to St. <hi>Secondo,</hi> where, having first kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down, and prayed for a blessing upon their undertaking, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging one another, they attaqued the place with incredible valor; and the better to secure themselves against their enemies, who had lodged and fortified themselves in houses, they got Planks, Barrels, and such other things as they met with to keep off the bullets, which were poured out upon them out of those houses, and so quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made themselves Masters of the doors of those houses, to which immediately they set fire, and so forced their entrance, putting all the Souldiers they found to the sword; and no marvel; for they had been extreamly provoked to this rigour by the others cruel usage of their Wives and Children: Besides every room of those Houses was filled with the plundered goods of the Protestants; yet did they not meddle either with Women or Children.</p>
               <p>Then did they set fire on the Town, and plundred the Churches, which they found full of their own goods and cattel, and carried away seven of their Mass-Bells.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="436" facs="tcp:41459:218"/>
                  <note place="margin">Many Irish slaine.</note>At this time they slew about four hundred and fifty of their enemies, and amongst others a whole company of <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels, who chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be burnt than to crave Quarter. Of the <hi>Protestants</hi> there were only seven slaine, and six or seven more slightly wounded, whereof they soon recovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Munday June</hi> the fourth, the Captaines <hi>Jahier, Laurentio, Giana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, Genolat, Benet,</hi> and other officers of the <hi>Protestants</hi> went to <hi>Angrog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and having called a Councel of warre, they concluded the next day to alarum the enemy at <hi>Briqueras,</hi> and Saint <hi>Giovanni:</hi> and accordingly the Captaines <hi>Laurentio</hi> and <hi>Jahier</hi> went by the way of <hi>Reccapiatta,</hi> that by the help of the thick woods wherein they shrouded themselves, they might the better approach <hi>Briqueras,</hi> and having gotten upon a little hill near the Town, Captaine <hi>Laurentio</hi> made there a stand to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any relief that might be sent them from Saint <hi>Secondo,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Jahier</hi> marching down, set fire on several Houses and Barnes.</p>
               <p>At the sight of this fire, they of <hi>Briqueras</hi> gave notice to those of <hi>Cavors, Fenile, Bubiana, Campiglione,</hi> and other neighbouring places, whereupon the enemy quickly advanced towards them, and were as soone beaten back again: in the mean time there came a party of about twenty Horse and stood at Saint <hi>Secondo,</hi> lest the <hi>Reformed</hi> party should Salley out that way, really believing that they had a designe upon <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queras:</hi> But Captaine <hi>Jahier</hi> marched with his company by the way of Saint <hi>Giovanni,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Laurentio</hi> went an higher way, yet both met at the place appointed, where Captaine <hi>Gianavel</hi> was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the Enemies from <hi>Lucerna,</hi> and <hi>La Torre,</hi> against whom he had defended himself very stoutly: Then did Captaine <hi>Jahier</hi> charge them on the Flanck, and Captaine <hi>Laurentio</hi> on the Front, seasonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing his company in that place where the enemy had thought to have surrounded Captaine <hi>Gianavel,</hi> so that the <hi>Popish</hi> party was soone routed, leanving one hundred men behinde them, besides many that were wounded, the Reformed party having but one slaine upon the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> the second, three hundred of the Enemies went from <hi>La Torre</hi> to fetch a Convoy into the Fort of <hi>Mirebuc,</hi> situate between the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and <hi>Piemont:</hi> But Captaine <hi>Gianavel</hi> being at <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec,</hi> though he had but nine souldiers with him, fell upon them, and fought a great while with them to the great astonishment of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: but at last was forced to retreat without the losse of a man, only four were slightly wounded.</p>
               <p>Afterwards Captaine <hi>Gianavel</hi> with a small party marched to <hi>La Palle des Guienets,</hi> from whence he sent to some that were retired into <hi>Villora,</hi> requiring that all those of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in twenty four hours come out of the said place where Masse was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, and that upon the paine of being dealt with as enemies, and that such as through weaknesse had abjured, and would persist in their abjuration, should depart thence upon the same penalty. Hereupon all the <hi>Papists</hi> fled presently out of <hi>Villaro,</hi> and the <hi>Protestants</hi> came in to
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:41459:218"/>
Captaine <hi>Gianavel,</hi> and such of them as were able to bear Armes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him chearfully: the rest contributed according to their abilities towards the maintenance of him, and his Troops. Those which through frailty had abjured their Religion went over the Mountain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Valley of <hi>Queires</hi>; yet not long after they returned like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wandring Sheep to the true Shepherd of their souls, and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their repentance, were again received into the bosome of the Church.</p>
               <p>After those of <hi>Lucerna</hi> were retreated, the Captaines <hi>Jahier,</hi> and <hi>Gianavel,</hi> with some other Officers called a Councel of Warre, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they resolved to sally out, and if it were possible, to surprise those of <hi>La Torre,</hi> most of which were <hi>Irish.</hi> But the enemie having time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notice, was so prepared, that they killed some who had passed the Bridge at <hi>Angrognia,</hi> which so encouraged them that they thought to have enclosed all the small body of <hi>Protestants,</hi> and to have cut them all off: but after many assaults to no purpose, they were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to <hi>La Torre</hi> with the losse of very many of their Souldiers, besides many others that were dangerously wounded.</p>
               <p>The next day the Captains, <hi>Jahier,</hi> and <hi>Gianavel</hi> went before <hi>La Torre,</hi> against whom many of the Souldiers came out; but not sallying forth in a full body, they were all slain upon the place, which their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains seeing, they thought fit to send out no more: whereupon the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> retreated towards <hi>Angrognia,</hi> to a place called <hi>La Verne,</hi> where a few houses were yet left unburnt.</p>
               <p>The next day was spent in the review of their Army, and holding a Councel of warre, where they resolved to send a party against the Communalty of <hi>Crusol,</hi> the inhabitants whereof had made Incursions upon them, and committed many Outrages in the beginning of the Massacre: and accordingly they marched all night, being four hundred ninety and five men, and passing by <hi>La Torre</hi> undiscovered, a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter midnight they arrived at <hi>Crusol,</hi> where they took four hundred head of Cattel, six hundred sheep and Goats, with much other booty, and that without the least resistance: For the Inhabitants of <hi>Crusol,</hi> being terribly affrighted, had cast themselves into the mouth of a most fearful Rock, whence they could not be gotten out: and so the <hi>Protestants</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned over one of the <hi>Alps</hi> of <hi>Villaro,</hi> where arriving the next day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evening, they divided the spoil amongst the Souldiers.</p>
               <p>Presently after their departure the enemy from <hi>Lucerna, Cavors, Briqueras,</hi> and other places to the number of eight hundred, having heard of their designe against <hi>Crusol,</hi> marched to their relief: but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were gone too farre to be overtaken, they resolved not to lose their labours, and so fell a plundering the poor people (though their friends) much worse than the <hi>Protestants</hi> had done, and afterwards falling out amongst themselves about dividing the spoil, they destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one another instead of doing hurt to the <hi>Reformed</hi> party.</p>
               <p>The very same day that this enterprize was against <hi>Crusol,</hi> the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at Saint <hi>Secondo</hi> advanced to burn the rest of the houses at <hi>Roccapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atta,</hi>
                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:41459:219"/>
and being advanced as farre as to the little hill of <hi>Angrognia,</hi> they thought to have surprized the rest of the forces left under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Captaine <hi>Laurentio,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Jahiers</hi> brother: But they having timely intelligence of it, marched presently to the top of the Mountain with one half of the Souldery, leaving the other halfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of Captaine <hi>Bennet</hi> of Saint <hi>Germano,</hi> who also with all possible expedition, took his Post upon the said little hill with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen of his men, and placed the rest in <hi>Ambuscado.</hi> But the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hearts misgiving them, they shamefully retreated, at which time they took one <hi>Giovanni Pietro Ragio</hi> as he was coming from <hi>Pinachia,</hi> and binding his head with a cord, they strained it with such violence, that they made it sink into his brains, and so they sent him to <hi>Turin,</hi> where he ended his dayes shortly after by a languishing, and miserable death.</p>
               <p>Eight dayes after, Captaine <hi>Gianavel,</hi> having waited three whole dayes at <hi>Angrognia</hi> for the coming of Captaine <hi>Jahier,</hi> that with joint forces they might assault the Town of <hi>Lucerna,</hi> when he came not, he resolved to assault it himself, and so marching all night, he arrived at <hi>Lucerna</hi> by break of day. His first work was to cut off the Pipes that conveyed water into the Town, and brak down the Bridge that no relief might come to them from <hi>Bubiana, Barges,</hi> and <hi>Bagnol</hi>: then did he assault the Town, and quickly defeated two of the out-guards: but the Regiment of Monsieur <hi>de Merolles,</hi> and divers others being got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town the night before, he was constrained to give over the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and to retreat, whereas if Captaine <hi>Jahier</hi> had come in time, and joyned with him, probably they had carried the place,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> the eighth, Captaine <hi>Gianavel</hi> being left alone at <hi>Angrognia</hi> only with his own Company, and some few others, was assaulted early in the morning by the Souldiers of <hi>La Torre</hi> and others, one part of them getting upon the top of the Mountain, and the other part go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lower passage to possess themselves of the Gate of <hi>Angrognia</hi> by the way of Saint <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> intending suddenly to fall upon Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Gianavel</hi> and his small company, having already devoured them in their hopes: But it pleased God that at the sound of the Trumpet, when all should have fallen on, Captaine <hi>Gianavel</hi> soone awaked, and having first sought unto God by prayer,<note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> he fell upon the enemy, and gat the advantage of the place from them, and after a short Dispute, forced them to turne their backs, though there were at least two thousand five hundred of them, and all the Captaines company was not above three hundred, yet did that handful of men pursue them as farre as to the descent of <hi>Angrognia,</hi> into the Woods, and steep places of the Rocks, where they slew a very great number of them.</p>
               <p>Captaine <hi>Gianavel</hi> seeing it impossible to think of any further at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for the present, entreated Captaine <hi>Jahier</hi> to give over for that day, and to refresh himself and his Souldiers: but he being at that time more passionate than prudent, refused his good counsel, and picking out one hundred and fifty choice men, sweetly took his leave of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:41459:219"/>
                  <hi>Gianavel</hi> (little thinking that it should be his last) and so marched down into the plaine, where he burnt several of their Houses who had formerly burnt, and destroyed so many of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> bringing away with him a good Booty of Cattel, and other Goods.</p>
               <p>This valiant Captaine who hitherto had been so successeful in all his attempts,<note place="margin">His Charactea</note> thinking in the close of the day to Crowne all his former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, as he was now near the execution of his Designe, Lo a Squadron of Horse surrounded him and his fourty five men (for at this time he had no more with him) at a Countrey house, not farre from <hi>Ossac:</hi> and though he and his men did all that could possibly be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, killing three Captains, with the Commander in chief of that Squadron, besides many others, yet he at last and thirty five of his followers, all lost their lives; and the enemies in great Triumph, cut off Captaine <hi>Jahiers</hi> head, and the heads of his sons, and carried them to <hi>Turin,</hi> presenting them to the Duke and his Mother, who rewarded them with six hundred <hi>Ducatoons</hi> for their good service therein.</p>
               <p>Captaine <hi>Jahier</hi> deserves to be renowned, especially for his great piety, and zeale for the service and honour of God, and the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his poor afflicted Church and Members. He was of so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted a spirit, that the terrors of death, and the most cruel torments could never affright him. He was bold as a Lion in his enterprizes, but meek, and humble as a Lamb in the middest of his Victories, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lifting up his hands towards Heaven, from whence he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged all his help to come, and alwayes recited fit and comfortable passages out of the Scriptures (wherein he was admirably versed) for the encouragement of all his followers, and the strenthening of their faith upon all occasions. As to his outward parts, and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he was a man of a sound understanding, and good judgement, and above all, of a wonderful active spirit, which had he but used with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, he had been hardly to have been paralleld.</p>
               <p>The death of so brave a Commander, and the wound of Captaine <hi>Gianavel,</hi> in that juncture of time did not a little startle the <hi>Protestants:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A special Providence.</note> But necessity often puts inconsiderable men upon bold enterprizes: for these poor men did not despond, nor lose their courage, but assembling shortly after in a Mountaine of <hi>Angrognia,</hi> they descended into the plaine, where twice they were assaulted with violence, the last of which was by a dangeros <hi>Ambuscado,</hi> where the enemies were at least six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, and they not above one hundred: But God of his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse so encouraged their hearts, and guided their hands, that they slew very many of their enemies, and amongst them many principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, whereas the <hi>Reformed</hi> party lost onely one <hi>Michael Bertino,</hi> a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant of <hi>Angrognia,</hi> and had but one common souldier wounded. The sonne of the said <hi>Bertino</hi> seeing his father fall dead at his feet, was so farre from being discouraged, that he immediately stepped into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers place with these words, <hi>Though my father be dead, yet be of good courage my fellow souldiers, for God is a father to us all.</hi>

                  <hi>Munday</hi> following they had a very sharp dispute at <hi>La Torre,</hi> and about <hi>Tagliaretto,</hi> where they killed and wounded a great number of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, without the losse of any of their own men. Indeed in this time the enemies reaped their Corne in the plaines of Saint <hi>Giovanni,</hi> but they could not carry it away but with the losse of many of their lives.</p>
               <p>About the same time there came to them one Monsieur <hi>Andrion,</hi> a Major of a Regiment of Horse, with two other Gentlemen that were strangers, who were followed with some Volunteers, whose friendly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit of their poor afflicted Brethren, and their good advice in such a juncture of time, was taken (as it deserved) very kindly: and God made it a singular means to uphold the fainting spirits of some weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who seeing others come in <hi>to the help of the Lord against the Mighty,</hi> went on with a great deale more chearfulnesse, and ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity: and these staid with them till the peace was concluded at <hi>Pigner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>July</hi> the eleventh 1655. Sieur <hi>John Leger,</hi> Pastor of the Church at Saint <hi>Giovanni,</hi> who deserves to be remembred for the great paines, and many services performed by him in the behalf of the Churches of the Valleys, having notice that the enemies were of opinion that he was come back from his journey with Armes and Money, and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and thereupon presuming that they would suddenly make some notable attempt to prevent what they so much feared, he went to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Andrion,</hi> and pressed him to put his designe in execution.</p>
               <p>The poor people had as yet no standing Army: but the Bands of each Commonalty were quartered at a great distance the one from the other; and certainly they had been cut off every man of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few dayes, had not their Centinels been very watchful; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, if Captaine <hi>Charforan</hi> had not on the one side timely disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the enemy, an the poor people on the other side been exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly heartned to the Battel by the great valour, and singular conduct of the Sieurs <hi>Andrion, Michelin,</hi> and <hi>Leger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Enemy was very numerous, having been lately reinforced with many Troops. They encamped themselves within half a League of the <hi>Reformed</hi> party, and early in the morning they divided themselves into four Brigades, three whereof fell upon the <hi>Protestants</hi> with a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous Resolution in three several places at once: the fourth stood still, ready to succour their friends if there were need. The fight continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at least four hours without intermission, and was the sharpest that ever was fought in the open field: and that which made the enemies more fierce, was, their hopes to have beaten back the <hi>Protestants</hi> from their Post called the <hi>Castelas,</hi> which if they could have effected, they had been certainly Masters of the Valleys <hi>Perosa,</hi> Saint <hi>Martino,</hi> and <hi>Lucerna:</hi> But the poor people having lifted up their hearts by earnest supplications to the Lord of Hosts (as they used to do upon all such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions) Major <hi>Andrion,</hi> and the two other Captaines which he had brought with him, gave forth such orders as were necessary, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

their men exceedingly, so that without budging a foot, they kept their ground, all save a few who were either quite tired, or faint for want of food, or that wanted powder, or flints in their fire-locks: But these, the Sieurs <hi>Mechelin</hi> and <hi>Leger</hi> imployed in rolling down great stones upon their enemies heads as they came to attacque them, which proved ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry successeful, doing much execution upon the enemy, and causing them to abate much of their fury; and whereas in the beginning of the fight they cryed alwayes, <hi>Advance, Advance, ye relicts of Jahier:</hi> the <hi>Protestants</hi> now began to cry as fast, <hi>Advance, Advance, ye relicts of Saint Secondo,</hi> and withal they ran upon those murtherers as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lions, and caused them to turn back, and flie towards <hi>La Torre</hi> and <hi>Lucerna</hi> as fast as they were able, leaving behinde them fifty five upon the place, and about fourty that were killed in the flight, besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others who were carried either dead, or dangerously wounded, to <hi>Lucerna.</hi> Themselves confessed that in this encounter they lost at least three hundred men, amongst which were many Officers of a <hi>Bavarian</hi> Regiment.</p>

               <p>Two dayes after this great fight, the enemy being much enraged for their great losse, spread themselves all over <hi>Angrognia,</hi> and began to set the Corne on fire, which being seene by the Company of <hi>La Torre,</hi> who at that time were upon the Mountaine of <hi>Tagliaretto,</hi> they speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave notice to those of Saint <hi>Giovanni,</hi> and <hi>Angrognia,</hi> who hasted thither, and charged them so fiercely, that they forced them to flie, and to leave most of their Ammunition behinde them: and in the meane time Captaine <hi>Belin</hi> assaulted the Towne of <hi>La Torre,</hi> killed the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel, and souldiers upon the works, and gave the Towne such an hot Alarum, that most of them fled towards the River of <hi>Pellice</hi>; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably if he had had a few more men with him, he had at that time made himself Master of <hi>La Torre.</hi>

Captaine <hi>Belin</hi> gave the first onset, who being followed with many other Officers, and Souldiers, they quickly made a considerable breach in the Garden-wall next to the <hi>Convent,</hi> which so encouraged the rest, that they fell on with an invincible resolution, and in a short space burnt both the <hi>Convent,</hi> and most of the Towne down to the ground. Those in the Fort finding themselves hardly beset, began to Parley about surrendring of it upon honorable termes: But some horse coming seasonably to their relief from <hi>Lucerna,</hi> which the <hi>Protestants</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XLVI. A brief account of the Intercessors to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in the behalf of these poor people, and the successe therof.</head>
               <p>UPon the first supplication of that terrible Order of <hi>Gastaldo,</hi> which was a forerunner of the <hi>Massacre,</hi> the <hi>Protestant Cantons</hi> of <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being their near neighbours, and therefore could soonest take notice of it, wrote their Letters to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples behalf. To which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> shortly after gave a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental, but cold answer, which was little better than a plaine deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of their request, and mediation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> the 29. being the Lords day, newes of the horrible Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre was brought to the Council of <hi>Zurick,</hi> who immediately gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for a Publick day of Humiliation through all their Territories, as also for making a Collection for their relief: resolving to give notice of this doleful newes to their <hi>Protestant</hi> friends; and amongst others, they wrote to the <hi>States General</hi> of the united Provinces, acquainting them with the sad condition of this poor people, intreating them to consider of some expedient for the accommodating their affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the fifth they sent Monsieur <hi>Gabriel Weis,</hi> Captaine Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of <hi>Berne</hi> as their Deputy to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who in very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectful termes requested him to re-establish those who had survived the Massacre in their ancient priviledges, the free exercise of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and for the enlargement of their Prisoners, delivering him a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the same purpose. The answer which the Duke (or rather his Mother) gave, was, that though they were not obliged to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their actions to any Prince in the world, yet out of respect to the amity which they had compacted with his Masters the <hi>Cantons,</hi> they had given order to the Marquesse of <hi>Pianessa</hi> to acquaint them with the truth of those affairs: and shortly after when Major <hi>Weis</hi> spake with the Marquesse, he laboured to justifie all his proceedings, and to lay the load upon the backs of the poor people, protesting that he never intended to force their Consciences, and that all the reports about such strange cruelties exercised towards them were meer forgeries, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Major <hi>Weis</hi> replyed that the Massacre was so notorious, that it could not be denied, and that their right of habitation in those places was founded upon Justice, being granted to them by the Dukes Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:41459:221"/>
and purchased by them of the present Duke for six thousand <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catoons.</hi> The Marquesse answered that all those Grants were upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion should be freely exercised amongst them, which yet they would never suffer. Master <hi>Weis</hi> still pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their sad condition, and the necessity of finding an expedient for accommodation, &amp;c. the Marquesse desired him to apply himself to the poor people, and to cause them to desist from Hostility, which would be the way to obtaine favour from the Duke: and no marvel though he moved this: For about this time (through Gods mighty as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance) these poor people began so to prevaile, that their enemies began to fear what the successe might be, and therefore the Marquess laboured to get the sword out of their hands by such a stratagem as this.</p>
               <p>Major <hi>Weis</hi> went to <hi>Perosa,</hi> propounding these things to the poor people: who returned humble thanks to the <hi>Cantons</hi> for what they had already done in their behalf; and said, that if the six <hi>Evangelical Cantons</hi> would engage that the Treaty should be carried on upon honest and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable termes, they were ready to hearken to it; Otherwise they were resolved never to trust those who had so oft deceived them, and whose principle was, that <hi>Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With this answer Master <hi>Weis</hi> returned, and sued for the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prisoners, or that at least he might be suffered to speak with them: but neither the one nor other would be granted; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he returned to his Masters, and upon his report to them, being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from any farther proceedings, they resolved to expect what would be done by other Princes, and States.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> 1655. Letters were brought to <hi>Oliver</hi> Lord Protector of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of this doleful newes, whereupon he invited all the people of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> to seek the Lord by Humiliation, and Prayer, and withal, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to a liberal Contribution for the succour of these poor souls. He sent also Master <hi>Samuel Morland</hi> as his Envoy to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to meditate on their behalf. He wrote also to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and to the <hi>Evangelical Cantons</hi> of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> requesting all their Mediations in the behalf of these poor people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the twenty sixth 1655, Master <hi>Morland</hi> set out on his journy, and <hi>June</hi> the first he came to the King of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>La Fere,</hi> to whom he delivered the Lord Protectors Letters, wherein he solicited his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty to improve his power, and interest with the Duke, that the cruel Order of <hi>Gastaldo</hi> might be recalled, and the poor people restored to their ancient liberties, and habitations. The King of <hi>France</hi> three dayes after returned an answer to the Lord Protectors Letter, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Morland</hi> proceeded in his journey to the Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Rivole,</hi> where the Court was, <hi>June</hi> the 21. and demanded au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as the Lord Protectors <hi>Envoy,</hi> which accordingly was granted: and at his appearing he made a speech in the behalf of the poor people, and delivered the Lord Protectors Letter.</p>

Madam Royal, the Dukes Mother answered, That she could not but extremely applaud the singular charity of his Highnesse the Lord Protector towards their Subjects, whose condition had been presented to him so exceeding sad, and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nds</hi> discourse it was; yet withal she could not but extremely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that malice should proceed so far as to clothe their fatherlike chastisements of their rebellious Subjects with so black a character, thereby to render them odious to all their neighbouring Princes, and States with whom they desired to keep a good understanding, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with so great and powerful a Prince as the Lord Protector. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that she doubted not but when the truth of all passages should be made known to him, he would rest satisfied with the Dukes proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Yet for his Highnesse sake they would pardon their rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Subjects, and grant them such priviledges, and graces, as should shew to the Lord Protector how great a respect they bore both to his person, and Mediation: And withall Master <hi>Morland</hi> was requested to go to <hi>Turin,</hi> where by the Dukes Order he was entertained with all outward demonstrations of Civility, and respect imaginable during his abode there.</p>
               <p>Master <hi>Morland</hi> after a while pressed for his dispatch, and had it, and so according to the Lord Protectors Order he went to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was Collected in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> towards the relief of these poor souls the full summe of thirty eight thousand, ninety seven pounds, seven shillings, and three pence, the greatest part whereof was at several times transmitted to them; and what remained, being about nine thousands pounds, was put out to Interest, that so both the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, and the Improvement might be disposed of for their best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: and further to shew what effects the Lord Protectors inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession had, I finde that presently after, the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> the Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Brandenberg,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other <hi>Protestant</hi> Princes and States did either by their Letters to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> or otherwise, declare their deep resentment of the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Massacre, especially the Lantgrave of <hi>Hessen</hi> wrote most zealously in their behalf. They had also many Consolatory Letters written to them from sundry particular Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> From <hi>Franckfort, Zurick, Hanaw, Flushing, Middleburgh, &amp;c.</hi> and large Contributions according to their respective abilities. Divers Commissioners also were sent from <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> to joyne with those of the <hi>Evangelical Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> for the procuring a well-grounded peace for those poor people: but before they came, the <hi>Switzer</hi> Ambassador had concluded a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador; and betwixt them, they had hudled up a Peace, the woful effects whereof these poor people were quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sensible of; and to this day they labour under heavy burdens laid upon their shoulders by their <hi>Popish Taskmasters:</hi> they forbid them all manner of traffique for their sustenance: they rob them of their goods, and estates; they drive them from their ancient habitations, and force

them to sell their <hi>Birth-right for a messe of Pottage:</hi> They banish their Ministers, that the Shepherds being gone, they may the more easily devour them: they ravish their young women, and maidens, they murther the innocent as they passe along the high-wayes upon their occasions: they continually mock and revile them, and threaten an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Massacre, sevenfold more bloody than the former: Through the malice and subtilty of their <hi>Popish</hi> adversaries their Valleys are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a Dungeon, to which the Fort of <hi>La Torre</hi> serves as a door, whereby at their pleasure they may let in a Troop of murtherers ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to destroy and extirpate those innocent people: and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all those large supplies that have been sent them from <hi>England,</hi> and other <hi>States,</hi> yet so great are the necessities of those poor hungry creatures, and so grievous are the oppressions of their <hi>Popish</hi> adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who lie in wait to bereave them of whatsoever is given them, that some of them are yet ready ever and anon to eate their own flesh for want of bread: their miseries are more sad, and grievous than can be expressed; they are dying, even whilst they live: When that which was collected for them is once spent, they must inevitably perish, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the Lord in whose hand are the hearts of Princes, shall incline the heart of their Prince to pity these his poor, harmlesse, and faithful Subjects, who are so farre from thoughts of Rebellion, that could they but enjoy the freedom of their Consciences in peace, they would be the first that would be ready to sacrifice their lives for the good, and safety of his Royal Highnesse.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Church of Saint <hi>Giovanni</hi> contains within it a very fair Plain, and little hills, very fruitful, and abounding with Corn, Vines, Chest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, Figgs, Olives, and other fruits, but it wants Pastures, and Woods, so that they have not many Cattel, but only some Oxen to till the ground, and to carry their wine to <hi>Turin,</hi> and other places to sell. This Church hath annexed unto it <hi>Lucerna, Lucernetta,</hi> the Vineyards of <hi>Lucerna, Fenile, Bubiana,</hi> and <hi>Bricheras.</hi> In the City of <hi>Lucerna</hi> the third part of the Inhabitants were <hi>Protestants.</hi> In <hi>Lucernetta,</hi> and the Vineyard of <hi>Lucerna,</hi> almost all the Inhabitants professed the <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion time out of mind.</p>

                     <hi>Fenile</hi> is lower on the other side of the River <hi>Pelice</hi> towards the <hi>South,</hi> being a more fatt and fertile soil than any place in St. <hi>Giovanni,</hi> in all sorts of Fruit and Grain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bubiana,</hi> as to the Plain, is like to <hi>Fenile,</hi> and neerly adjoyning to it: but the <hi>Protestants</hi> have often been driven out of it, so that what they possessed was mostly in the hills, where they have little Corn, &amp; Wine; but abundance of Chestnuts: So that the inhabitants, which were about fifty Families, were generally poor, living by their hard labour, and by their profit which they made of wood, which they carried to sell to the towns of <hi>Babiana,</hi> and <hi>Lucerna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The hills of <hi>Bricheras,</hi> where there have been alwayes <hi>Protestant</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, are like those of Saint <hi>Giovanni.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>La Torre</hi> is the same for situation and quality with that of Saint <hi>Giovanni,</hi> containing one Plain, where is the Town of <hi>La Torre,</hi> and hills adorned with the same kind of fruits as those of Saint <hi>Giovanni.</hi>

                  <p>The Church of <hi>Villaro</hi> adjoyns to that of <hi>La Torre,</hi> but is a little higher towards <hi>Dauphine,</hi> containing a little Plain where is the Town, and the hills adorned with Vines, and Chestnuts.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Bobio</hi> is near to that of <hi>Villaro,</hi> being a little higher towards the Mountain on the <hi>West,</hi> but as fertile as that of <hi>Villaro</hi>: and being environed with many Mountains, and having fat Pastures, the Inhabitants had many oxen, Kine, and smaller Cattel, together with milk, and wool in abundance, as also they had many Chestnuts, which being cleansed, and dried, they sold, or exchanged for other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Rorata</hi> is a little Valley, situated on the other side of the River <hi>Pelice,</hi> on the <hi>West</hi> of <hi>Lucerna,</hi> being bounded by the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Villaro.</hi> It abounds in Pastures, and is very fruitful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> especially in Chestnuts.</p>

                  <p>The Church of <hi>Villaro,</hi> and St. <hi>Germano</hi> is situated in the lowest part of <hi>Perosa,</hi> about a mile from <hi>Pignorolio</hi>: the <hi>West</hi> and <hi>North</hi> part of <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> on this side the River <hi>Clusone,</hi> belong to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and St. <hi>Germano</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> on the other side of the said River, which running through the whole length of the said Valley, separates the Kings Territories from those of the Dukes.

The Church of <hi>Pinachia</hi> is within the <hi>French</hi> Dominions, adjoyning on the <hi>VVest</hi> part to that of <hi>Villaro,</hi> and contains a fair, and beautifull Plain, on the <hi>North-side</hi> fenced with pleasant hills: On the <hi>VVest</hi> is the Town, and fort of <hi>Perosa</hi>; on the <hi>South,</hi> the River <hi>Clusone,</hi> and some hills, but scarce any Plain at all. It abounds with Corn, Wine, Nuts, Grass, and other Fruits.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>La Capella</hi> is on the <hi>VVest</hi> of that of <hi>Pinachia</hi> in the upper end of the Valley of <hi>Perosa</hi>; on the <hi>West</hi> it joyns to the Valley of <hi>Pragela</hi> (which belongs to the King of <hi>France</hi>) On the <hi>East</hi> to the Citadel of <hi>Perosa</hi>: It hath several very fruitfull hills in it: It hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it <hi>Pomare,</hi> and <hi>Inverso del Perosa,</hi> and some other small Villages, called <hi>Le Mean,</hi> making a little Communalty at the foot of the Valley of <hi>Pragela.</hi>

                  <p>The Church of <hi>Villa Secca</hi> is at the lowest part of the Valley of St. <hi>Martino,</hi> where there is almost no Plaine but where the river <hi>Germanasco</hi> takes its course; the Hills which lie <hi>South</hi> from the said River are very cold, so that there grow no Vines: but those on the <hi>North</hi> which lie open to the <hi>South</hi>-sun are hot, and so have many Vines. In general, its tolerably fruitful in Corne, Fruits, and Pasture.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Maneglia</hi> which is on the <hi>West</hi> part of <hi>Villa Secca,</hi> comprehends three little Communalties, <hi>viz.

                  <p>The Church of <hi>Prali</hi> is situated in the uppermost part of the Valley of Saint <hi>Martino,</hi> and contains two Communalties, <hi>viz. Prali,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi> bounded on the <hi>South</hi> with the Alps, and the Valley of <hi>Lucerna</hi>; On the <hi>West</hi> by the Valley <hi>Queyras</hi> in <hi>Dauphine</hi>; and on the <hi>North</hi> by the Valley of <hi>Pragela:</hi> Here is nothing but Hay and Grasse.</p>
                  <p>Generally in all these Churches (except on the tops of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains) there are plenty of Fruits, especially of Chestnuts, and in some places there are vast spaces of Ground yielding almost nothing else: as in the little Hills of <hi>Bubiana,</hi> and all along the Valley of <hi>Lucerna,</hi> and in the <hi>South</hi> parts of the Valley of <hi>Perosa</hi>: So that the Inhabitants in those places dry, and clense great quantities of them, part whereof they keep for their own use, and the rest they sell, or exchange for Corne, and that, quantity for quantity, with the Inhabitants of the Plaine, it being a great part of their food in <hi>Piemont.</hi> They also dry these Nuts in an Oven, or on a Kilne, and make thereof an excellent sort of Bisquet, which they first string as they do their Beades, and so hang them up in a moist place the better to preserve them. These they frequently make use of instead of <hi>Maqueroons,</hi> and such sweetmeats.</p>

                  <p>THe All-wise, and holy God, whose wayes of Providence are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes righteous, though often secret, and unsearchable, hath made it the constant lot, and portion of his people in this world to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Sonne in bearing his Crosse, and suffering persecutions. For they that are <hi>borne after the flesh,</hi> do alwayes persecute <hi>them that are borne after the spirit.</hi> But scarcely have any sort of the Churches enemies more clearly followed the pernicious way of <hi>Caine</hi> herein, than hath that <hi>Antichristian</hi> faction of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Mother of Harlots and Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> whose garments are died red with the blood of Saints, which they have alwayes cruelly shed, and made themselves drunk with. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those chosen and faithful witnesses, the Lord seemeth very sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to have raised up those Christians, who (though dispersed in divers Countreys) have been commonly known by the name of <hi>Waldenses,</hi> who for some Centuries of years have lived amongst their enemies as Lambs amongst Wolves, to bear their testimonies to the Truths of Christ, against the Apostasies, and Blasphemies of <hi>Rome</hi>; for which they have been <hi>killed all the day long, and accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One part of this little flock, and remnant which the Lord hath left, &amp; reserved, are scattered partly in the Valleys of <hi>Piemont,</hi> of whose Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical sufferings you have had a faithful account in the precedent Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the other part of this poor, but precious remnant, have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed in the Kingdomes of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> whose sufferings, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Lords signal Providences about them, are now to be spoken of, as they have been related to the Lord Protector <hi>O.C.</hi> and the State here by two godly persons delegated by those persecuted Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which are now the sad Monuments of their enemies rage, and of the Lords sparing mercy.</p>
                  <p>These sometime flourishing Churches were by degrees worne out by the constant underminings, and open outrages of the Antichristian party; being first driven out of <hi>Bohemia</hi> into <hi>Poland</hi>: and then after their taking root, and spreading in <hi>Poland</hi> into a numerous company, they were forced out of their chiefest Cities there, and at last by the <hi>Jesuited,</hi> and enraged <hi>Popish</hi> Army, were persecuted in their few hiding places with fire and sword.</p>
                  <p>Their Ministers were tortured to death by most exquisite, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Barbarisme, by cutting out of the tongues of some, pulling out the eyes, and cruelly mangling the bodies of others. Yet did not their rage, and brutish cruelty reach only to the Ministers, but to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate persons also; yea, even to women, and to young children, whose heads they cut off, and laid them at their dead mothers breasts.</p>
                  <p>Nay their rage brake out, not only against the living (not one of
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:41459:226"/>
whom they spared that fell into their hands) but also against the dead, plucking the bodies of Honorable persons, and others out of their graves, tearing them to pieces, and exposing them to publick scorne.</p>
                  <p>But the chiefest eye-sore, and object of their fury was the City of <hi>Lesna,</hi> which after plundering and murthering of all whom they found therein, they burned to ashes, and laid it in the rubbish. Only the Lord in mercy having alarm'd the City by the report of their enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, the greatest part of the Inhabitants (being three famous Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) saved themselves by flight, and are now wandring up and down in <hi>Silesia,</hi> the Marquisate of <hi>Brandenburg, Lusatia,</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> poor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, afflicted, and naked, the relation whereof you have in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Narrative written in <hi>Latin</hi> by some of themselves, and called <hi>Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae Excidium.</hi>

                     <hi>LEsna</hi> a City of great <hi>Poland,</hi> almost thirty years ago began to be famous both far and near; but now being suddenly and utterly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed hath nothing left beside the name and fame thereof. For the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler discovery of this businesse from the beginning, we must briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Original and progresse of this town.</p>
                  <p>When above seven hundred years ago, <hi>Mieczislaus,</hi> then Duke of <hi>Poland,</hi> took to wife the daughter of <hi>Boleslaus</hi> Duke of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and together with her received the Christian Faith, it happened that among those of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Nobility that accompanied him, there was one <hi>Peter de Bernstein,</hi> whom, because he was a person endowed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vertues, <hi>Mieczislaus</hi> was willing to detain him in <hi>Poland,</hi> and to that end bestowed upon him rich possessions, the chief whereof was a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage called <hi>Lezsyna, (i. e.</hi> a grove of hasle-trees) upon the very confines of the lower <hi>Silesia,</hi> being situate twelve miles from <hi>Wratislavia,</hi> five from <hi>Glogaw,</hi> and ten from <hi>Posnania.</hi> From this place therefore of his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Peter de Bernstein</hi> taking the rise of his denomination, according to the custome of the Nation, he and all his posterity were called <hi>Lez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scynii,</hi> and were afterwards admitted to all sorts of Dignities in the Realm; so that of this family there were never wanting some or other that were Captains, Governours of Castles, Palatines, Marshals, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours, Bishops, or Archbishops, even to this day: and besides this, for their noble management of affairs in several Embassyes to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, they were adorned with the title of Earles of the Empire, which they still enjoy. But <hi>Leszcyna</hi> it self begun by little and little to change its name, and by contraction was called <hi>Lessna,</hi> and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <hi>Germans</hi> called it <hi>Lissa</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Village, something above one hundred
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:41459:226"/>
of years ago had the dignity and title of a market town granted to it by the famous King <hi>Sigismund,</hi> and tradesmen were invited hither out of the neighbouring <hi>Silesia,</hi> and so the use of the <hi>German</hi> tongue was brought in together with them. As for Religion, it was reformed in <hi>Lesna</hi> about the same time, by the most illustrious Count <hi>Andrew,</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine of <hi>Bernstien,</hi> according to the rites of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Confession, which it hath retained to this day, and became as it were the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Churches of that Confession, throughout all the greater <hi>Poland.</hi> And when, after the year 1620. a very sharp persecution was raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Professors of the Gospel in <hi>Bohemia</hi>; and not long after the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Nobility were banished, they were fain to seek refuge in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whom that most pious Noble man, the Lord <hi>Raphael de Lesna,</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine of <hi>Belse,</hi> received under his protection, appointing <hi>Lesna, Wlodava,</hi> &amp; <hi>Baranovia</hi> for their places of refuge. But for as much as the greater part did seat themselves at <hi>Lesna</hi> because of the neernesse thereof, and not long after, a far greater company flocked thither out of <hi>Silesia</hi> (for there also the butchery of souls grew wonderful fierce, in the years 1628. and 1629.) it came to passe that <hi>Lesna,</hi> by the addition of many streets, grew into a large City, having three market places, four Churches, a large School, above twenty streets, one thousand six hundred houses, two thousand freemen of the City, and abundance of other company. There was built also a very fair Church for the service of God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rites of the <hi>Augustane</hi> Confession, which had over it three Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, learned men; and a School for the mother tongue with some Schoolmasters, beside the Free-schoole, which had a learned man of the forementioned Confession appointed over it, by the title of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector.</hi> The Citizens also having ordered themselves according to the best policy they could, there were found out handsome wayes for a publick revenue that made no noise, and were little felt, and without any mans dammage or burden, so that they were able for some years to maintaine workmen for the compassing of the City about with a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark and Trench, and for the building of gates with walls and faire turrets: And lastly, there was built a very fair Court-house in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the market-place of the old City; there was scarce the like in all great <hi>Poland,</hi> except at <hi>Posnania.</hi> In a word, Civility, trading, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize (for all things were here bought and sold) and Religion did so flourish here, that this City did not come behinde any City in <hi>Poland</hi> for its admirable pleasantnesse. All this was matter of joy, not only to those pious Christians that were scattered out of several places for the Gospels sake, and here gathered together under the protection of God, but to others also that came hither from all parts, as strangers: but it galled the enemies of the Gospel extremely, so that it made them leave no designe unassayed for the overthrow of this City of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for the godly. At the first (<hi>Annis</hi> 1628, &amp; 1629.) they made use of several accusations and slanders to King <hi>Sigismund</hi> the third, suggesting to him that it was a confluence of all sorts of men that were enemies and traytors to his Majesty; that it was good to nip them
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:41459:227"/>
in the bud, &amp;c. But through the prudence of that great Senator, the Lord of the place, whose wisdome went beyond their envy, and who knew well enough how to counter-work all malicious projects of that kinde, all those their battering-rams were at that time used in vain.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Anno</hi> 1653. after that the <hi>Swedes</hi> were broken by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours army in <hi>Germany,</hi> and were driven out of <hi>Silesia,</hi> new plots were hatched at <hi>Glogaw</hi> to send out one or two of the Emperours regiments, who should suddenly invade <hi>Lesna,</hi> sack the town, and put the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to the sword, or at least scatter them. But it pleased God so to order it, that this plot was discovered by some of themselves two days before the appointed time, and so vanished into smoak, though the smoak of their devices did not yet cease to rise. For after the death of the most illustrious Prince Palatine of <hi>Belse,</hi> when his estate was divided amongst his sons and heirs, and the County of <hi>Lesna</hi> fell to the illustrious Lord <hi>Boguslaus,</hi> his third son, then newly returned from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, the Plotters were not wanting so to lie in wait to insnare this candidate of great wisdome and vertue, that after they had wearied him for some years with the promises of honours (unto which there was no door of entrance but by entertaining the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) at last they enticed him to professe Popery. But however they heaped many honours upon him, procuring him some Captainships, afterwards the Generalship of great <hi>Poland,</hi> and lastly the Arch-treasurership of the Realme, yet could they not procure his hatred of the Professors of the Gospel, and the dissipation of his sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jects, which was the thing they hoped for, but he still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served intire to his <hi>Lesna</hi> those priviledges both Civil and Religious, which his father, of blessed memory, had promised, offered, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to them. They attempted therefore this other device: The Bishop of <hi>Posnania</hi> ventured to redemand the old Parish-Church, because it was of ancient foundation, and pretended that it might not any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be left to the use of <hi>Hereticks.</hi> The Lord Treasurer answered, that his Grandfather (<hi>Andrew</hi> Palatine of <hi>Brenstien</hi>) had built another Church for the <hi>Catholicks</hi> (whose number was very small in the town, scarce ever above three or four Citizens) to exercise their Religion in, and endowed it with revenues to that purpose, that the greater number of Citizens might enjoy the greater Church. But all was in vain, though he doubled the maintenance of the <hi>Roman</hi> Parish-priest: for <hi>Anno</hi> 1652. they brought the Lord Count before the tribunal of the Realme, where the cause must needs go against him, the very same persons being accusers, witnesses and Judges; yet he obtained that this Church should not suddenly be taken away from his Subjects the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of old <hi>Lesna</hi> until they had built themselves a new one. This building they presently set about with the help of forrein Churches: (according as they were in a capacity to help, things being every where in confusion) But when the adversaries saw that it went on apace, and that this was like to be bigger than the other (for so great now was the multitude of Citizens of this Confession, that the old Church was not
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:41459:227"/>
able to contain them) they began again to mutter and threaten, <hi>that this might not be endured, that the Hereticks should have a bigger Church than the Catholicks; that they did but build this also for the Catholicks, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>At length the irruption of the <hi>Swedes</hi> into <hi>Poland (Anno</hi> 1655. gave them the long wished for occasion of oppressing and rooting out not only the <hi>Lesnians,</hi> but also all the Professors of the Gospel (or as they were wont to be called, the <hi>Dissenters from the Roman Religion)</hi> throughout <hi>Poland.</hi> For although the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted with the <hi>Swedes</hi> at their coming out of <hi>Pomerania</hi> (in the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Uscia</hi>) and had delivered to them expressely and by name the chief Cities, <hi>Posnania, Kalisch, Fraustat, Meseritz,</hi> and <hi>Lesna,</hi> and the rest, after some weak resistance, had yielded themselves up to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> yet while the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was slowly, and as it proved, dangerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly busied in <hi>Prusia,</hi> they took counsel together for the resuming of their armes, to fight for the liberty of their Countrey, and the Catholick Religion (as they call it) to drive the <hi>Swedes</hi> out of the Countrey, and to root out all the dissenters in grosse. That this their purpose might make the quicker progresse, and be set on the more strongly, there were <hi>Jesuites</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> sent out every way, to intimate these things to the multitude, and to encourage them to so glorious an undertaking, compelling those that were slow with the thunderbolt of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and promising the relaxation of the pains of Purgatory, and eternal rewards to them that were forward. To this end King <hi>Casa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire</hi> being recalled out of <hi>Silesia,</hi> they commanded the Nobility to flock to him, and to give the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> a meeting in his return out of <hi>Borussia.</hi> The Commonalty also they stirred up against the Professors of the Gospel, making themselves their furious leaders; and such was their successe, that in lower <hi>Poland</hi> a great number of families (it is not yet known how many, because the furious tumult still continues) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most within the compasse of a moneth (in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March</hi>) were miserably butchered, men and women, young and old being murthered without distinction, all, save such as could escape into the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and so save their lives by flight. But the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the greater <hi>Poland,</hi> most of them having retired themselves into <hi>Silesia,</hi> began there to gather themselves into small companies, in the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> and to break forth; by whose coming the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encouraged, made a great slaughter of the <hi>Swedes</hi> that were garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd in the small towns, so that General <hi>Muller</hi> was fain to go forth with an army of <hi>Swedes</hi> to restrain them.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Lesna,</hi> the hereditary Lord thereof, the Treasurer of the Kingdome, was gone into <hi>Borussia</hi> to salute the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> some way to take care for the safety of his Countrey: But about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>April</hi> he returned to <hi>Lesna</hi> without seeing him, the King then being full of action, and ranging up and down. This businesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured much more envy both to himself and the City, as if he had plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Swedes</hi> against his Countrey, having never been true and faithful either to the Church or his Countrey: therefore they breathed out
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:41459:228"/>
flames, and belched out threats so much the more fiercely both against him and his City. However there were not wanting such as by private messages gave him hope of pardon, if he would but withdraw himself from them, as afterwards he did. But the enemies prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to destroy that so populous a City by force (if they could) or else by flames, furnishing themselves with many sorts of weapons for that purpose. Of this doing although the inhabitants of <hi>Lesna</hi> had notice by several messengers, yet a fatal security prevailed with them to think that there was no fear of such an enemy as was not furnished either with Infantry or Artilery for such a designe. Upon <hi>Easter</hi> day a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>On the third Holy-day in <hi>Easter</hi> the report was very hot that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had lost all, and that the King was slain: upon which account when the Lord Treasurer did betake himself to <hi>Wratislavia</hi> in <hi>Sil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ours of horse) did encourage them; as did also the Administrator of the City and County of <hi>Lesna,</hi> who requiring anew the oath of fidelity from the Citizens, did promise them to stay with them, and bid them be of good courage. Being lifted up with this hope, and drawn on with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of new Auxiliary forces to come very suddenly to them, they promised themselves all manner of security, so that no man took any care to get out of the way, or to carry any thing of his goods to a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer place: yet they kept strong guards night and day, sometimes the third part of the Citizens, and sometimes half being upon duty. The <hi>Swedish</hi> horse also ever and anon made excursions to see what the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was a doing, and whether they were neer. But they never brought back any other news, but that there were no footsteps or signes of any enemy appearing: Yea, even that very day in which the <hi>Poles</hi> came in the afternoon, the <hi>Swedes</hi> returned with good booty, but not a word of the enemy. But about three dayes after upon Thursday, <hi>April</hi> the 27. an army of the <hi>Polonian</hi> Nobility, mixed with a rout of peasants, shewed themselves unexpectedly out of the Woods, and anon they drew forth into the open field, and so set themselves within sight of the City, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five or six furlongs from the Suburbs. When this was percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the alarm was given, and the Citizens hasten to their armes, and place themselves on the walls; yet not knowing who they were, and with what intent they came, and wondring much, why, according to the custome they did not send forth a Trumpeter. (For that which they did bruit abroad afterwards, and many perhaps beleeved, that the <hi>Lesnians</hi> gave the occasion of hostility by killing their Trumpeter, is just nothing: Heaven and earth will bear witnesse that this was devised
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:41459:228"/>
meerly to colour over the hainousness of the fact:) At length they begin their work with firing a Brick-kiln, that stood not far from the Suburbs. Then the Swedish Troopers (about one hundred and fifty in number) which were already mounted &amp; gone out of the City, going a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, encountered with the Enemy in light skirmishes, for the space of two hours; in which many of the <hi>Poles,</hi> and some of the <hi>Swedes</hi> were slain. But while the <hi>Swedes</hi> were earnest with the Citizens for some help, as it were to defend the Suburbs from further burning, some were drawn forth (about seventy of the younger Citizens) who mixed themselves rashly and confusedly among the Horse-men; which when the <hi>Poles</hi> saw, they feighned a flight, returning towards the Wood: But as soon as they perceived that they had drawn them far enough from the Walls, they wheeled about, some fetching a compass to come behind the <hi>Lesnians,</hi> and so to get between them and home, and the rest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning straight upon them, fell on in a full body. The <hi>Swedish</hi> Horse when they saw this, turned their backs, leaving the Foot to the mercy of the Enemy; but the <hi>Poles</hi> followed them so close at heels, that two Colours (about four hundred men) passed through the Suburbs to the very gate, and wanted but little of entering the City it self with them, had not some good confident fellow, ventured to step in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, and bar the Gate against them, while others of the Citizens sent a showr of Bullets among them, and so beat them back: So the <hi>Poles</hi> being glad to stop, yea, and retire (just at Sun-set) set fire on the outward parts of the Suburbs, and burnt some Granaries and Wind-mills, thereby making the whole night light to us; while themselves returned through the Wood to <hi>Oseczno,</hi> which the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> call <hi>Storoknest.</hi> The City being thus filled with fear, spent the whole night without sleep; the men in watching upon the Walls, and the women in gathering themselves together in the Market-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Church-yards, and other open places, and there wearying Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with <hi>Psalms</hi> and Prayers to God.</p>
                  <p>When the morning came, and no enemy appeared, the Citizens went forth and fetched in the slain to bury them; among whom were found about forty Citizens, but above a hundred of the <hi>Poles,</hi> and among them their chief Commander himself, <hi>Cresky,</hi> who formerly had taken Pay under the <hi>Swedish</hi> General <hi>Banier,</hi> and was accounted more expert then the rest: In the mean time it was hotly reported that the Administrator of the County and many of his Retinue were wanting and gone; whereupon the courage of the Citizens began to fail, and they went to the Senate, to desire leave to send away their wives &amp; children, that if the enemy should come again they might be the more couragious in defending themselves, not being daunted with the out-cryes and tears of the women. Some disswaded them with good reasons, saying, That those that should be sent forth under pretence of convoying the rest in safety, would not return again, and so the rest of the Citizens should be left in greater fears; That the <hi>Spartans</hi> of old were wont to take their wives &amp; children to the war, with them, that having them in their
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:41459:229"/>
eyes, they might fight the more stoutly for their safety. But all was in vain, though the <hi>Swedish</hi> Commanders also endeavoured to hinder the flight of the richer sort, which they could not do, being overcome with the cryes of the multitude. There were some <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> also who desired leave to depart for a few dayes, because that the <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> fury was bent chiefly against them: But the Senate left it to their consciences, whether in such a case they could leave the people then when they would most need instruction and comfort; especially if wounded and dying. But the others persisted in their importunity, and there went out before Noon about three hundred Waggons, which were all that could be got in the City.</p>
                  <p>After this there followed some quietness, with hopes that the Enemy would return no more, having found by experience how well able the <hi>Lesnians</hi> were to defend themselves and theirs; and perhaps they had never returned indeed (as it was know afterwards) had they not been encouraged by that Hight of the Citizens: For two dayes after the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight of <hi>April,</hi> there was a Letter delivered to the Consul from the Commanders of the <hi>Polish</hi> Forces, in which they demanded the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the City, and gave them hope of good usage; but if they would not embrace that offer, they then threatned to destroy them with fire and Sword, having now such an addition of Foot souldiers, that they were able to take the City by storm. They added moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that they had received a Letter from the Lord Treasurer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he intreated them to spare his <hi>Lesna</hi> upon their submission, saying, that he had already given them a command to set open their Gates. If ever there were indeed any such command, it must needs have been suppressed by some one; so that the Citizens never knew of it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they would have provided a little better for the safety of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their goods. But so it must needs be, that our sins (through others treachery) should be brought to punishment. This message of the <hi>Poles</hi> to the Senate did wonderfully daunt the Citizens; For these things were not kept secret, but before the Consul could call together the Senate and the Commanders of the souldiery, the report thereof had run through the whole City, as also that there was very little Gun-Powder left, and they had not wherewithal to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; so that the Citizens being taken with a <hi>pannick</hi> fear, cast away their weapons and courage together, and betook themselves to flight; especially when presently after, they who were on the Guard, discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Body of the Enemies coming the same way they came before; For they forsaking every man his station, hasted home, advising their wives, children, and neighbours to flye, themselves leaving their weapons upon the Walls, or at the Gates; or afterwards casting them away in the fields, that they might not be a burden to them. When the <hi>Swedish</hi> souldiers saw the Citizens thus in amaze and running away, they also soon mounted, not to meet the Enemy (as before) but to run away too from the face of the Enemy. Then followed the Senate in such a trembling fit of fear, that every one run out at the Gate that
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:41459:229"/>
was next him, or over the very Forts and Ditches; so that in one hours space, a most populous City was left destitute of inhabitants: Save a company of sick and aged people, and a few others that could not so suddenly get away, or for some other cause were necessitated to await the issue. But all hastened to those <hi>Moorish woods,</hi> by which <hi>Poland</hi> is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Silesia,</hi> in such confusion, that when the nearest passes (to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards <hi>Thorlang</hi> and <hi>Krosken</hi>) were not wide enough, they tumbled by Troops to other passes (<hi>Strizwik, Prybisch,</hi> and <hi>Hundsloch</hi>) that were more remote. The <hi>Swedish</hi> Troops went to <hi>Fraustad,</hi> and from thence, taking the Garrison along with them, towards <hi>Meseritz:</hi> But the passage through the <hi>Moors</hi> was very difficult, in regard that the company crouding one upon another, as if the Enemy were just at their heels, did not onely many of them stick in the deep Mud (in vain cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out for help to those that passed by, every one being solicitous on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his own preservation) but were also mired and lost! Here chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren lost their parents, and parents their children, wives their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and one friend another; so that they could scarce find one ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther again; in two, three, and four days time.</p>
                  <p>The Enemy by a Trumpeter, who was sent to <hi>Posnania gate</hi> enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what the Citizens meant to do; to whom <hi>John Kolechen,</hi> a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Citizen, and well acquainted with many of the Nobility (in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence whereof, having sent away his wife he adventured to stay) came forth and answered, That the Gates stood open, the <hi>Swedish</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies were gone, and the rest of the Citizens stood to their courtesie, and desired their favour.</p>
                  <p>A little after that, came the illustrious <hi>Grzymaltowsky</hi> with many of the Nobility to the same Gate, and when the aforesaid <hi>Kolechen,</hi> with another in his company, had gone out to them and scarcely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded them that the City was forsaken, and that there was no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery; they went in, and when they were disposed into the next fair houses, they were entertained with a noble supper (which was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to sweeten them a little, if it might be) and had plenty of Wine out of <hi>Dlugosses</hi> Cellar, who was a rich Senator.</p>
                  <p>At last when they were half Drunk, they set upon <hi>Kolechen</hi> with threats, and would have made him their Prisoner, but that he escaped wonderfully out of their hands, and saved himself by flight. But they durst not stay all night in the City, for fear the <hi>Swedes</hi> and Citizens should set upon them unawares out of some Ambuscado; and so they returned to their own company, and in the morning with many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Waggons they came back, killing all they met, and setting themselves to plunder the City. Here then you might have seen strange examples of barbarous cruelty on the one side, and blockish fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the other. For though no man made resistance, yet like Mad Dogs they flew upon all that either came out or were drawn out of the holes wherein they had hid themselves. Of some they pulled out their eyes; Of some they cut off their Noses and Tongues; Of others they cut off their Hands and Feet; others they stabbed and slashed, and
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:41459:230"/>
so butchered them with innumerable wounds, that it could not be known who they were: And (which was more) they spared not his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Prince <hi>Frederick, Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Hassia,</hi> though dead, whom they had slain half a year before at <hi>Costena,</hi> and who was decently Embal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the <hi>Lessians,</hi> and kept laid up in the Chappel of the New-Church upon a Scaffold, till he might be transported to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: They first rifled his Coffin, which was handsomely adorned, taking away his silver and guilt keyes, and all the silk that was about it; then they set upon the Princes corps, and took away his silk robe, lined with Ermines, and so left him once again naked, and lying on the ground. But (after the burning of the City, his body being found in the same place, untouched by the fire) he was cloathed again by the ancient <hi>Lesnians,</hi> and put up in his Coffin, and buried in a certain place, where he is still honourably kept. But that mad rabble shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abundance of folly in this, that whereas they might have made <hi>Lesna</hi> their nest (the <hi>Swedes</hi> having Garrisoned themselves in the strongest places of the Province) or at least might have gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the richest of the plunder; (for there was such abundance of victuals, wares, housholdstuff of all sorts, and treasure that was brought hither from other places, as to a place of safety, that a thousand Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons could scarce have carried it away in many dayes) yet such was their over-eager desire of their destroying this hated City, that the very same day; yea before noon, they set fire to the City and Suburbs in every street, (for the Waggons which they brought with them were not empty, but loaded with Torches, Pitch, Straw, and such other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible matter) and so cruelly destroyed that most pleasant City, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all that abundance of all sorts of things that was in it.</p>
                  <p>This fire lasted three whole dayes, and there were those that took care that nothing should scape it; for when the New-buildings of the New-churches, did not easily take fire, they brought Straw, Pitch, and dry wood; and put under the roofs and the in-side of the steeples, and so forced them to take fire: And they came again upon the third day (1. <hi>May</hi>) and whatsoever was left they set fire to again. They burnt also the very Wind-mills, whereof there were seventy about the <hi>City</hi>; and a very pleasant Park of the Countesses, which lay close by the Castle; that every place might be filled with spectacles of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and at length it might come to be said, <hi>En cineres ubi Lesna fuit</hi>!</p>
                  <l>Where fairest <hi>Lesna</hi> stood of old,</l>
                  <l>Now nought but <hi>Ashes</hi> we behold!</l>
                  <p>The Citizens sadly beholding these flames some miles off, ran thither next day by Troops; whether out of a desire of quenching the fire (if it were possible) or else to save something out of the flames;
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:41459:230"/>
(for most through fear had gone away empty handed) but the Enemy came upon them; and although they stoutly defended themselves, and slew many of their Enemies, yet many of themselves were slain; and many others also on the dayes following, when some Villages that belonged to the County of <hi>Lesna,</hi> and were inhabited by professors of the Gospel, were in like manner burnt down. There perished in these flames many aged and sick people, that could not get away; besides such abundance of houses, houshold-stuff of all sorts, precious wares, corn (many thousand bushels whereof were brought hither) libraries and other things, that the loss would amount to many Tuns of gold; and many thousands were thereby reduced to meer beggery. But that which was saddest of all, was, that the Church of the faithful, that was here gathered together out of divers places and Countryes, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the pure worship of God, was so utterly overthrown, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but cry out with <hi>Sion</hi> of old, when it was rased by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> Lament. 1. <hi>and</hi> 3. <hi>O all ye that pass by, behold and see, if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger! For he hath sent a fire into my bones, and it prevaileth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me; he hath made me a desolation, so that I am not able to rise up; my children are desolate, because the Enemy prevailed.</hi> Sion <hi>spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her. I called for my lovers, but they deceived me. Mine Enemies chased me sore, like a Bird, without cause. They have cut off my life in the Dungeon. Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: Thou saidst, Fear not; It is of the Lords mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It must not be concealed what wonder hapned the first day of the burning of the City about evening, at <hi>Czirna</hi> (which is the first Town of <hi>Silesia,</hi> next to <hi>Lesna,</hi> about two miles distant) Some of the <hi>Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> went out to look upon the sad smoke of their Country; and as they were looking, there fell from the clouds which carried the smoke over <hi>Silesia,</hi> together with the soot, a leaf of burnt paper, which when they took up, they found to be a leaf of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Bible, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 6<hi>th.</hi> and part of the 7<hi>th.</hi> chapters of <hi>Matthew</hi>; where those words of Christ came first to sight, <hi>With what measure ye meet, it shall be measured to you again</hi>; with many other of Christs exhortations to trust in the fatherly Providence of God. This leaf was presented to the Lord of the place; and a <hi>Lesnian</hi> Physitian, who was there by chance, that read and interpreted it, and divers others, can bear witness to the truth hereof; and the Lord of the place laid it up among his rarities! What now should <hi>Sion</hi> do, but cry out under the cruel oppression of the Enemy, <hi>Render unto them a recompence, O Lord, according to the works of their hands,</hi> Lament. 3.64. And indeed God began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge his peoples wrongs the fourth day after, when they furiously as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted <hi>Costena,</hi> a Town four miles from <hi>Lesna,</hi> where they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repulsed stoutly by the <hi>Swedish</hi> Garrison; and having suffered a great slaughter (about five hundred of them being wanting) they were
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:41459:231"/>
forced to retire in great confusion. The like also they met withall at <hi>Kalissia,</hi> and other places, being slain and put to flight by the <hi>Swedes.</hi> Herein it hapned unto them much after the same manner, as it did to <hi>Tilly</hi> formerly when he had ruined <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> the God of vengeance manifesting himself the avenger of his people: And now they begin to acknowledge and upbraid one another with their folly; the Nobles, in that they have spoiled their mart and treasury; and the Clergy, in that it is hapned otherwise than they intended. For their purpose was, utterly to ruine the Hereticks (as they term them) with their nest; but now that they see the nest spoiled, and the birds sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it is much more matter of grief and vexation than of joy to them. For here God performed what he promised of old to <hi>Baruch, I will give thee</hi> (in the midst of thy Countryes ruines) <hi>thy life for a prey,</hi> Jer. 45.5. So God gave to thousands of his worshippers, who were snatched out of the midst of those ruines, their life for a prey, having set bounds to the fury of the Devil, which he could not pass; as he did of old, when he gave <hi>Job</hi> into his hands, as to all that he had, but so, that he should spare his life. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we have cause to say with <hi>David</hi> (Psalm 124.) <hi>If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us, then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us, then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul; then the proud waters had gone over our soul: Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth: Our soul is escaped, as a Bird out of the snare of the Fowlers; the snare is broken, and we are escaped; our help is in the Name of the Lord, who made Heaven and Earth.</hi> Oh the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full providence of our God! which then saves when he seems to have forsaken, and then makes alive where he seems to have killed. <hi>We had been undone, if we had not been undone</hi>: We had been undone in our lives, those furies gathering together soon after, in far greater troops, if we had not been undone in our estates, which were left to them for a prey by our flight (which the fatherly providence of God, fore-seeing greater evils, procured, by sending that fright among us.) Blessed be the Name of the Lord again and again: We notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with other afflicted ones, in what Nation soever, whom that proudest <hi>Babylonian</hi> flood of waters seeks to swallow up, will not cease to cry, <hi>How long, O Lord, wilt thou be angry with thy people? How long shall thy jealousie burn like fire? O remember not against us former ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Psalm</hi> 79. And with the souls of those that were slain for the word of God, that lie under the Altar of Christs merits, for whose faith we are killed, <hi>How long</hi> (O Lord) <hi>holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth!</hi> Rev. 6.9, 10.</p>

            <head>The Delegates of these poor persecuted Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Churches coming over into <hi>England</hi> to move for a <hi>Contribution</hi> towards the relief of their distressed Brethren, Published this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Narrative.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The utmost Fury of Antichrist against the Protestants or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Confession in <hi>Poland,</hi> set down in a brief (but faithful) Narrative, and according to the truth of the matter.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Spouse of Jesus Christ, she who in the Cradle was besprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the blood of a Protomartyr, hath alwayes brought forth into the world men like <hi>Abel</hi> or <hi>Stephen,</hi> that so there might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be wanting to cry from the earth unto God, and that the wounds of that Rose which lies among the Thorns of Persecution might not be concealed. Every age, and every year in each age, and every moneth and day in each year, hath produced new inundations of blood unto this day; and yet the little flock of the Lord hath alwayes encreased under persecutions, one while here, another there, shifting their seats and habitations. While it pleased God by the means of <hi>Wicklef</hi> to kindle the light of the Gospel in <hi>Great Britain, John Huss</hi> asserted the truth of Jesus Christ in the midst of thick darknesse of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> many thousands being stirred up by God to receive it, who despising all the cruelty of Tyrants, received it with joy, untill by Gods assistance they took rooting in the Kingdom, and grew up into flourishing Churches. In a short time after, Antichrist breathing out his fury, the Truth was banished out of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the Confessors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven out, transplanted the Gospel into <hi>Poland</hi>; where being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably entertained by King <hi>Sigismond,</hi> they in a short time encreas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to so great a number, that being little inferiour to the Papists, they were able to boast of an equal authority and priviledges with them. Hence it came to passe that the Kings at their Coronations were wont, not only to promise, but solemnly to swear protection to such as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed from the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and therefore they proceeded not to open persecutions, save only in those Cities where the Jesuits had seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves in power (to wit) <hi>Cracovia, Posen, Lublin, Vilna, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="464" facs="tcp:41459:232"/>
where, by their disciples, and by stirring up the common people to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Churches of the Reformed Professors were a good while ago demolished, and divers Ministers cruelly massacred. Neverthelesse the malice of the Enemies being no whit allayed, they were many ways afflicted, first indirectly, afterwards by pretences under colour of Law, until those Churches being worn out by degrees, and overthrown, were not many years ago reduced to a very inconsiderable number, especially when as in the Reign of the late King, the Enemies being confident they might do any thing, brought things to this passe at length, that there were no more than twenty one Congregations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Greater <hi>Poland,</hi> and those also ready to perish. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong these twenty one remaining Churches, the chief, and as it were the Mother of them all, was that of <hi>Lesna,</hi> which was divided into three Congregations, the <hi>Bohemian,</hi> the <hi>Polonian</hi> and the <hi>German</hi>; each of which had their own Pastors, but the Communicants joyntly were about two thousand: Therefore it was that this Church was in the first place exposed to the Enemies malice, and of late designed to the slaughter, as well by reason of its being very much frequented and grown famous, as also because of the Synod there usually celebrated, as likewise a famous University and Printing-house, and books fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently published to the world. When therefore in the year 1655. the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army out of <hi>Pomerania</hi> drew near to the borders of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Nobility were summoned to Arms, according to the custome of the Countrey, it came to passe that the Papists brake forth into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny furious expressions, crying out, That the Hereticks had invited the Enemy, and therefore they were first of all to be put to the sword and extirpated; which reports, though most falsly scattered abroad (for the searcher of the heart and the reins knoweth, that we never so much as dreamt of it) yet they easily found credit among the sworn Enemies of the Gospel, who sought nothing more than our ruine. Hereupon they who first consulted to agree with the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army, being terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by its power, concluded about the surrender of all Great <hi>Poland</hi> into the Kings protection, and namely, the Royal Cities of <hi>Posen, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissen, Meserick, &amp;c.</hi> to which also <hi>Lesna</hi> was expressely added: In a little time after they endeavoured to cast off the <hi>Swedish</hi> Yoke, and turned their Arms not against the <hi>Swedes,</hi> but first against our Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Professors, as conspiring with the <hi>Swedes</hi> upon the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and none of them scrupled to take revenge upon them. They first of all set upon those of <hi>Lesna,</hi> with resolution of putting all to the sword, and destroying that Heretical City by fire, and they had effected both, unlesse God had by sending some persons before, who by signifying the coming of the Enemy, and with what intent they came, had possest the Citizens with a Panick fear, so that leaving all their Estates, they every man fled; and thus within the space of one hour, a most populous City abounding with all manner of wealth, was left without Inhabitants, who in a miserable condition wandered then into the neighbouring Woods and Marishes into <hi>Silesia.</hi> But the
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:41459:232"/>
               <hi>Polish</hi> Nobility with their Army entring the City, did what they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, slaying a number of decrepit old people, and sick persons that were not able to save themselves by flight; then the City it self was first plundred, and afterwards so destroyed by fire for three dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that no part of it remained beside rubbish and ashes. In what manner they would have handled the Citizens, especially their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, they shewed by their heroick actions performed in other places, by the most savage slaughtering of divers Ministers of the Church, and other faithful Members of Christ, of both Sexes; for of all that they laid hold on, they gave not one man quarter, but very cruelly put them to death with most exquisite tortures. They endeavoured to force Master <hi>Samuel Cardus,</hi> Pastor of the Church of <hi>Czuertzinen,</hi> to renounce his Religion, after they had taken him, and miserably hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him with all manner of cruelty; but he stoutly resisting, they first put out his Eyes, and led him about for a spectacle, then they pulled off his Fingers-ends with pincers; but he not yet condescending to their mad Fury, they found out a new kinde of torment, poured molten Lead into his mouth, and at length while he was yet half alive, they clapt his Neck between folding Doors, and violently pulling them together, severed his Head from his Body. They took <hi>John Jacobides,</hi> Pastor of the Church of <hi>Dembnick,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Wartens</hi> his Colleague, and another that was in company with them, as they passed through the Toun of <hi>LUBIN,</hi> and hurrying them up and down for divers hours, and grievously handling them after the manner of Tyrants, then last of all cutting their Throats with a Razor, threw them headlong, while they were yet breathing, into a great pit, which had been before-hand prepared for their Martyrs, and stifled them by cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down Dung and Dirt upon them. They a great while pursued <hi>Andrew Oxlitius</hi> a young man designed for the Ministery, whom after long seeking, they at last found in the open field, and in the end ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken him, they cut off his Head with a Sithe, chopping it into smal pieces, and the dead carcase also they slasht in a barbarous manner. The same fate befell <hi>Adam Milta,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Lesna</hi>; but they more grievously handled an old man of above seventy, whose name was <hi>Simon Priten,</hi> and many others, whose names it were too tedious to relate. Of that barbarous execution which they did upon the weaker Sex, there were besides other examples, horrid Trophies of Cruelty erected in the said City of <hi>Lesna:</hi> a pious Matron there, who was the mother of three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not being able quick enough to leave the City, and being slain in the open street, they cut off her hands, &amp; feet, &amp; cutting off her childrens heads, they laid two of them at her breasts, and the third by her side. In like manner, another woman having her hands and feet cut off, and her tongue cut out, being inclosed and bound in a Sack, lived the space of two dayes, making most miserable lamentation. Grief forbids us to adde more; for they behaved themselves so furiously towards us, that there remains not an example of any one man saved of all those that happened to fall into their hands. It is notoriously known how
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:41459:233"/>
that fury of theirs tyrannized also over the dead; some they dragg'd out of their graves, and cut in pieces, as at <hi>Zichlin</hi>; others they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed naked for a publick Spectacle, as at <hi>Lesna</hi>; of which outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous action we had an example, even in the dead body of the most Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Landgrave of <hi>Hassia,</hi> which was drawn out of the grave, who was heretofore slain in a most barbarous and tyrannical manner at <hi>Kos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> but buried by our Friends at <hi>Lesna.</hi> The like was acted also upon the Body of the most Noble <hi>Arciszevius,</hi> heretofore the valiant Admiral of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in <hi>Brazile,</hi> which was likewise dragg'd out of the grave, and being stript of the grave-clothes, was found after the firing of <hi>Lesna.</hi> There are divers other examples, which the Christian Reader may finde in the Book, Entituled, <hi>Lesnae Excidium,</hi> faithfully written, and lately set forth in print; but they are such examples onely as are commonly known; for who is able to relate all things in particular? as burning men alive, drowning others with stones tied about their necks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Lesna</hi> being destroyed, the fury of the Enemy proceeded to the persecutions of others; they in a short time utterly demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished all our Congegations, not onely driving away the Pastors, but also either burning or leaving most of the Temples desolate, as at <hi>Karmin, Dembnick, Skochy, Czriuczin, &amp;c,</hi> yea and the Auditories themselves were either slain (as in the Town of <hi>Sko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> where there was a very flourishing Church of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Exiles; Sixty persons, both men and women were cruelly put to death) or else they were scattered abroad, so that there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not one place wherein the Worship of God may be celebrated. Lo, this is the most miserable state and condition of our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; moreover our Countrey-men, to the number of five thousand, besides youths and children, being dispersed in banishment (which hath now befallen most of us the second time) especially through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Silesia,</hi> as also through the <hi>Marck, Lusatia, Hungary, &amp;c.</hi> find no comfort, but much misery, and are there exposed to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and envy of men. We that are Pastors dare not openly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to our Auditories with the Word and Sacraments, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in private Meetings, or in Woods among Fenny places, God onely seeing us, who is witnesse of these calamities, and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in extremities. Indeed being thus destitute of all things, we lead a wretched life in banishment, being afflicted with hunger and nakednesse, and are become next to the most miserable <hi>Waldenses,</hi> the greatest spectacle of calamity to the Christian world; for so it hath seemed good to that Soveraign Wisdome that governs all things, that we should be inheritors of the Crosse and persecution of those men from whom we have derived the original of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and external Succession: For truly we are the remaining Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny even of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> with whom being raised from the ashes of blessed <hi>Huss,</hi> and with whom combining into the same holy Fellowship of the Faith and afflictions of Christ, we have for
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:41459:233"/>
two whole ages and more, been perpetually subject to the like storms of Calamities, until at length we fell into this calamity, greater than ever was known in the memory of our Fathers, and which threatens us with utter destruction, unlesse God prevent it. The truth is, this businesse constrains us to amazement and tears, greater than can be exprest in words, to set forth our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and sorrow: If there be any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, we desire that this affliction of <hi>Joseph</hi> may be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, especially to all that are of the houshold of Faith. Let them not suffer those to perish whom the same Faith, and the same Spirit of Christ hath joyned with them in so near a relation; we beseech them in the name of Christ, that they would rather make haste to relieve those who are ready to perish, we being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that we suffer this persecution upon no other account, than for the confession of the Truth, from those Enemies who have acted such things as these are against us in times past, and are now at length by Gods permission, pouring out their fury upon us.</p>

            <head>A BRIEF REPRESENTATION OF THE Protestant Cause in <hi>GERMANY.</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">In what Case it hath been, since the Peace of MUNSTER; and how it stood in the year 1657. and how it is now this present year 1659.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Justice of the late civil warres in <hi>Germany,</hi> which were composed at the Peace concluded in <hi>Munster</hi> and <hi>Osna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgge</hi> in the year 1648. was grounded upon this; That the Protestants were necessitated to enter into a League or mutual union together, for the maintaining of their rights and priviledges in the Empire, against the infections thereof, and manifold disturbances of their profession, which contrary to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer agreements at Imperial <hi>Dyets,</hi> did befal unto them in many places by the Popish and Jesuites practices, whereof they could obtain no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse by any peaceable Treaties: Therefore finding that there was a design formed in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> and by the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> to be put in execution, tending by little and little to wear out and deprive them of their liberties; they formed an union among themselves, to stand upon the defence of their rights, and to oppose the power of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> by whose means, both in <hi>Germany</hi> and in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites did drive the design of rooting out Protestants. The head of this union (who by his place was bound to appear in it) was the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Palatine:</hi> but he being a soft man, of no experience in war, and beset in his Counsels and enterprises with such as did betray him, the cause was soon overthrown; and by his overthrow, the intended perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution against Protestants to root them out, what by power, and what by policie, was openly carried on by the house of <hi>Austria</hi>; which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> Christian the IV. and after him the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to come upon the Stage: the <hi>Dane</hi> was soon overthrown, but God gave such successe unto the <hi>Swedes,</hi> to the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Hessen</hi> their associate, and to the <hi>French</hi>; (who joyned with them to ballance the power of <hi>Austria,</hi> after the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> had made his peace at <hi>Prague</hi> with the Emperour, and deserted the Protestant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest): that from the death of King <hi>Gustavus,</hi> they continued the war with various successes till the year 1648. at which time the <hi>Swedish</hi> being masters in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the Emperour brought so low, that he
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:41459:234"/>
saw little hopes to recover his strength without a Peace, he yielded to the conditions which the Protestants and the French stood upon. The <hi>Swedish</hi> stood upon their satisfaction, and to keep a foot in the Empire, to be able upon all occasions to secure or help the Protestant party; And the Protestant Princes they stood upon the setling of all things and of themselves in their former rights and possessions, as before the war; and chiefly upon this point the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed party and the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Hessen,</hi> who headed them, stood, that thence forward the reformed Protestants (<hi>alias</hi> called Calvinists) should have equal freedom and liberty of conscience, for the exercise of their profession in the Empire, with the Papists and Lutherans. This condition being obtained, and a way determined to give the agrieved parties in point of dammage further satisfaction, Armies were dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, a new convention of States was held at <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> to settle the remaining matters within the Empire, which at <hi>Munster</hi> and <hi>Osnabrugge</hi> could not well be handled, by reason of the Treatie with forreigne States, and afterward a <hi>Dyet</hi> was called at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> to confirme all what formerly had been treated on and concluded, and to put the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of grievances in a way to be rectified: To which effect at the dissolution or rather adjournment of the Imperial <hi>Dyet</hi> at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> a Committee of Deputies from all the States of the Empire, of equal number of both parties, (that is, so many of the Protestants as of the Popish partie) were named to meet at <hi>Franckford,</hi> and prepare (by way of disquiry of rights) the matters then remaining undecided, that at the next Session of the <hi>Dyet,</hi> there might be a full decision and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of them; but before these Delegates did meet, the Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> did broach a new quarrel with the Elector Palatine, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to abridge him of much of his right, and to make him inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable to the Protestant party; but the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> his cousin (for he is a younger brothers son of the house <hi>Palatine</hi>) and the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Hessen</hi> his Brother in Law, did appear for him so farre, that the Emperor and the Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> fearing a new breach on his behalf, did leave him unmolested. Soon after the composure of this quarrel, the Committee of Imperial Deputies, met according to the appointment of the last <hi>Dyet</hi> at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> and they have continued at <hi>Franckford,</hi> debating and disputing one with another concerning their respective rights, in the several cases which remained undetermined. This meeting of Deputies hath agitated matters in the years 1655 — 56 — 57. till these new affairs were come into consideration, which the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> his war with <hi>Poland</hi> hath occasioned: for from that time that he went into <hi>Poland</hi> and prospered there, the Deputies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they did not dissolve their meeting, yet did in a manner alter the course of their treating one with another, as looking much upon the event of that war, till the death of the late Emperour hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Scene, and a <hi>Dyet</hi> for the election of a new Emperour hath been called.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Swedens</hi> war with <hi>Poland,</hi> did alarm the Popish party
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:41459:235"/>
in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the house of <hi>Austria</hi> extremely: and did terrifie the States of the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> lest if he should be master of the <hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> their Trade should be thenceforward under his power, with whom they had no friendly correspondence, by reason of some reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally conceived injuries, for which they could not trust him. This moved those of <hi>Holland</hi> who are the chief traders in those Seas, to stir up enemies against him, and openly to appear for, and correspond with <hi>Dantzick</hi> to oppose him: and it is known to the Swedish, that they have dealt underhand with the <hi>Muscovite,</hi> with the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> King, with the <hi>Austrians,</hi> and above-board with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to combine against him; by which means after that he had conquered <hi>Poland,</hi> his forces were distracted, first to oppose the <hi>Muscovite</hi> in <hi>Livonia,</hi> who besieged <hi>Riga</hi>; and afterward to put himself in a defensive posture against the <hi>Austrians,</hi> who came to the assistance of the King of <hi>Poland</hi>; and lastly, to retire from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> to oppose the <hi>Danish</hi> forces, who had invaded his Territories of <hi>Bremen.</hi> Being come into <hi>Germany</hi> upon this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, he did conquer from the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> the last Summer all <hi>Hostein</hi> and <hi>Jutland,</hi> and although by these conquests he was able to live in his quarters in the Winter: yet his enemies being round about him on all hands, and he having neither money, nor convenient places to recruit his Army, it was expected, that in the spring the Combination of his enemies who compassed him about, would have swallowed him up: but God was pleased to appear for him, and direct him in a way to escape and overcome these diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: For in <hi>January</hi> last, he formed his design to assault the other Territories of the <hi>Danish</hi> King; namely the Islands which lie between <hi>Germany</hi> and the Continent of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and to that effect had prepared his men to march over into <hi>Fuenen,</hi> either by a bridge of Ships if the Sea were not frozen so as to bear: or over the Ice, if it should be strong enough: having then notice gotten, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end of <hi>January</hi> the Ice did bear, he took of horse and foot not above six or seven thousand, and therewith did march over the Sea into <hi>Funen,</hi> where the <hi>Danish</hi> King had placed his chief for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to defend the place. And although some dangetous and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full accidents did befal him in that his march over the Sea, yet he went on and fought the <hi>Danish</hi> forces more in number than he had with him, which on firm land stood in a readinesse to receive him, and beat them, took the chief Commanders prisoners, and the spoil of the Island, which is one of the richest that belongs to that Kingdom. Having made himself Master of that Island, he went forward to the next Island, over the Sea, called <hi>Langland,</hi> where he found a body of five hundred men to resist him, but being charged, they were instantly defeated; so he went from thence to the next called <hi>Laland,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Falster,</hi> and from <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> to <hi>Zeland,</hi> the frost still continuing to make a bridge for him in all these marches. And from the time he came into <hi>Funen,</hi>
               <pb n="471" facs="tcp:41459:235"/>
till he entred <hi>Zeland,</hi> he spent onely five or six dayes. In <hi>Zeland</hi> (where the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was at <hi>Coppenhagen</hi>) M. <hi>Medows,</hi> the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Minister of the State, sent from thence to reside with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> came to him and desired him to admit the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to a Treaty; this he condescended unto, and by the interposition of M. <hi>Medows</hi> and of the French <hi>Ambassadour</hi> (for he would not admit the Hollands <hi>Ambassadour</hi> to be a Mediator) the place was concluded about the twentieth of <hi>February,</hi> after twelve dayes treaty. The conditions are, That he restore to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> all what he had taken from him in <hi>Germany,</hi> namely <hi>Holstein,</hi> and <hi>Jutland,</hi> and the Islands of <hi>Fuenen, Langland, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Falster,</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi>; and in lieu thereof the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> quits unto him all his rights in the Provinces of <hi>Haland</hi> and <hi>Schonen,</hi> and of <hi>Blieken,</hi> which are the Continent of <hi>Sweden,</hi> on the North side of the Sound; and doth moreover surrender unto him the Island of <hi>Bornholm,</hi> and the Lordships of <hi>Bahusen,</hi> and of <hi>Drunthen</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> which lie most convenient to cause the Trade of <hi>Sweden</hi> to flourish. Some other conditions there are, but lesse considerable. The Peace being concluded and ratified by both Kings, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> feasted the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dayes, and at several times both Kings were together alone, for the space of two or three hours at a time, whereby it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that they have contracted a nearer and stricter alliance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, than the Publick Treatise can mention. This being done, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> went into his own Countrey; and hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated the States of his Kingdom at <hi>Gottenburg,</hi> to dispose of his affairs with their advice, and to take up further resolutions in time to come.</p>
            <p>This unexpected and miraculous successe of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Kings enterprise, hath disappointed all the Counsels and plots of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries against him, for which he is obliged to none but unto God alone: and from hence his friends have just cause to gather, that God hath raised him out of his straits, and redoubled his strength to make further use of him towards the advancement of the common cause of Protestants, in whose behalf he concluded the Peace at <hi>Munster,</hi> and which he thinks himself in conscience and honour obliged to see maintained for the Protestant interest; <hi>tanquam altera pars paciscens,</hi> as in a letter of his to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour he did expresse himself. So that it seems the Protestant cause in <hi>Germany</hi> will finde in him a Protector of so much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and resolution, and conduct, as any that could be expected or desired: And it is known to all that know him, that he is earnestly bent to take away the differences, and advance the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement of Protestants within themselves: and that he makes no difference between <hi>Lutherans</hi> (as they are called) and <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> but makes use of both alike, according to their abilities, as he findes them fitted for employment to forreign affairs: for
