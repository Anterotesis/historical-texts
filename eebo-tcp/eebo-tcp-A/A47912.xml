         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Copy you sent us of some Reasons
for Addressing, with an Answer to 'em,
and several Arguments against it drawn
up by the <hi>Oxford-Clergy,</hi> doth most
extreamly afflict and surprise us; for,
what Man of Sense could in the least imagine, that our
<hi>Clergy,</hi> who once had obtain'd the highest Applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for their Loyalty, should at last do any thing that
may seem to justifie the Insinuations of those, who
always said, That <hi>Church-of-England-Loyalty</hi>
would continue no longer than the Prince was of their
Religion: For <hi>now</hi> it looks as if our Loyalty must be
no longer liv'd than our Church is in a Flourishing
State; why else do our Clergy thus <hi>Remonstrate</hi>
against rendring His Majesty their humblest Thanks
for the Assurances He has given 'em of Protection in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93120:3"/>
the Free Exercise of our Religion, and in the full En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of their Ecclesiastical Possessions? Don't
they know, that they are owing to His Majesty's
Grace for this much, and that, unless His Majesty had
embrac'd that most Christian and Heroic Principle,
That <hi>Conscience ought not to be constrain'd,</hi> and
had also excell'd all his Royal Predecessors in Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
he could never forgive the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by
whom so many Sanguinary Laws have been made
against Men of His Religion; or, have forborn the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
that Prerogative in Matters Ecclesiastical,
which our Church hath often recogniz'd to be Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in the Crown, and by which our Church may
be in a great measure <hi>Legally subverted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then can be more manifest to a Person of the
least Thoughtfulness, than that Our Church is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
oblig'd to His Majesty for Her present Standing?
Or, what more certain, than that She is most disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
ungrateful, if She acknowledges not so much?</p>
            <p>This Paper therefore, which is sent abroad on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to ensnare the Members of our Church, must not
escape our Animadversions; and, that we may the
more effectually prevent its design'd Mischief, we will
lay down every Argument in the Words of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and endeavor that our discussing 'em may be with
the greatest Evenness and Moderation.</p>
            <p>In the First place then, we must make our Remarks
on the Method taken to abuse the Reader, by propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
but Two Considerations, and that very lamely
too, <hi>for</hi> Addressing; but as many more, with all the
Advantages imaginable, <hi>against</hi> It; thereby tempting
the Unwary to conclude, That the rendring His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
their Thanks, was a thing most Ridiculous. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
we'll propose those feeble Arguments that are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93120:3"/>
for Addressing, with the Clergys Answer, and try
whether it's so easie a Matter to blow 'em off the Stage,
as these Gentlemen would have us think.</p>
            <div type="reasons">
               <head>Reasons for this Address may be Two.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST,</hi> That it may continue His Majesty's
Favor; and the Omission may irritate the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury
to demand a Review of the First-fruits, to
the full Ualue, upon the Fifth Bond.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <head>The CLERGIES ANSWER.</head>
               <p>As to the Kings's Favor, if the known Loyal Principles
and Practices of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc'd
themselves (one would think) so acceptable to
this Prince in the Instance of the <hi>Exclusion,</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
will not secure us, so not this Address (which
only copies out Fanatical Loyalty and Gratitude) can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
it.</p>
               <p>Yet our Thanks at this time might not seem improper,
if the Favor of continuing the Laws to us (which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
with all the Endeavors to the contrary cannot be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd)
were as great as the Repealing those for the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters</hi>
Sake; which the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent
Addresses</hi> say, His Majesty will engage His Parliament
to, and for which they principally give Thanks.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="reply">
               <head>OUR REPLY.</head>
               <p>1. These Gentlemen think they have done enough
already to merit the Continuance of His Majesty's
Favor, because some of 'em were against the <hi>Bill of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93120:4"/>
Exclusion,</hi> and endeavor'd the Suppression of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth;</hi>
not considering, how many of our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
were the Active Persons both in the Matter of
the <hi>Exclusion</hi> and <hi>Monmouth.</hi> It's true, at that time
some were very Loyal, and but some. Consult the
late King's <hi>Narrative,</hi> and observe the Rise and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of that Conspiracy, and you will find, 'twas
from First to Last begun and carried on by Church
of <hi>England</hi> Men: For, tho the Fanatics had their
Hand in it, yet they were not the Only, nor the Chief
Actors. If you go back so far as the Excluding Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
they were, Five to One, Church of <hi>England</hi>
Men. Or, if you look on the Contests about the
Sheriffs, you will find the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be
the Chief in that Transaction; and in truth, no one
that had been a Dissenter, could act as a Sheriff or
Common-Council-Man, until he had forsaken his
Communion with the Dissenters, and incorporated
himself with our Church: So that whatever they did
in these Public Capacities, they did it not as Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but as Members of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
Come nearer home, to the late Rebellion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
who were the Heads of it, and 'twill appear,
that they were of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Or go
down to <hi>Winchester,</hi> where were above Four hundred
of the Meaner sort, and, except Twenty or Thirty, all
declare themselves to be of the Church of <hi>England:</hi>
Or read <hi>Julian,</hi> a Church of <hi>England</hi> Divine, in
which the Doctrin of <hi>Non-resistance</hi> is so much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded,
and you may soon be convinc'd, that the
whole is said for Resistance, is only for the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Church of <hi>England</hi> Men to fight in Defence
of the Religion by Law Establish'd; not a Word to
affect a Dissenter, whose Religion is by Statute-Laws
condemn'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:93120:4"/>
So that our Church must take the Shame of all
these things to her self, and confess, she has more
reason to insist on his Majestie's <hi>Grace,</hi> than her own
<hi>Merit,</hi> for the continuance of the King's Favour. But,</p>
               <p>2. It is granted by these Gentlemen, That if the
Favor of continuing the Laws to us were as great
as the repealing those against the Dissenters, it might
not be improper to give Thanks. So that its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessd
to be but just in the Dissenters to make their
Addresses. And we doubt not but that we shall make
it manifest, that such is the present State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that it's as much
in the Power of the King to humble our Clergy, as
'tis to comfort the Dissenter; and that our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
are as much owing to the Kings Grace for the
present exercise of their Religion, and Enjoyment of
their Possessions, as the Dissenters are for the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
We mention not this to lessen his Majestie's
Favor to the Dissenter, but that you may see the
Transcendency of the Kings Grace to our Church.</p>

               <p>1. There being so much Reason why our Clergy
ought to make their Address of Thanks to the King,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93120:6"/>
it would be very strange if such a Practice cannot be
found amongst the <hi>Licita</hi> and <hi>Honesta</hi> of our Church;
and if it comes within this Pale, and the Ordinary
commands it, it's beyond us to conceive how Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
in the Clergy can escape the Guilt of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.
For the Oath express'd in the Instrument of
the Clergies Institution is in these words, <hi>Te Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitùs
de legitima &amp; Canonica Obedientia nobis &amp; Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soribus
nostris, in omnibus licitis &amp; honestis Mandatis
per te praestanda &amp; exhibenda, ad Sancta Evangelia ritè
juratum admittimus.</hi> So that they are sworn to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Lawful and Canonical Obedience to their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
in all his lawful and honest <hi>Mandates.</hi> The
Bishop then commands 'em to thank the King for
his Grace and Clemency in a matter for which once
heretofore they did it. Is this Lawful or Unlawful?
Honest or Dishonest? Not Unlawful nor Dishonest;
because when the King declared <hi>only</hi> to the Council he
would protect the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they then judg'd
it their Duty; now the King doth but make the same
Declaration to the whole Kingdom, and if not Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and their Ordinary commands it, they are bound
by their Oath to obey, how then can they disobey and
not be at least forsworn? But,</p>
               <p>2. How comes it to pass, that their Obeying their
Ordinary disunites 'em from the most, the best and
soundest of the National Clergy? What! are the
whole Clergy so insensible of the Kings Grace, that
they'll not acknowledge it? what a prodigious Change
is this? And why must they not rather regard their
own Ordinary, than the Sense of others? If the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
requir'd, be (as we have prov'd it to be)
Lawful and Honest, do they make nothing of an
Oath? and is Church-of <hi>England</hi> Unity in danger of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93120:7"/>
being broken? That surely is ominous, and no doubt
will open the Mouth both of Papist and Protestant
Dissenter. Is the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Case so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
that they must either be ungrateful to their
Prince, or be divided amongst themselves? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Their Bishop shews no Pastoral Regard to 'em,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">They declare, That the Book of Common-Prayer, and of Ordering of Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> containeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it contrary to the Word of God, and that it may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully used, and that they will use the Form in the said Book prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, in Public Prayer, and Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and <hi>none other.

Submission to an Address worded to their Hands, not
leaving 'em the Liberty to express the Sense of their
Hearts.</hi> So the Paper. And what hurt in all this? It's
to be presum'd, they'l make more bold with their
Prince than with God; and therefore seeing they are
not to be trusted, when they make their Addresses to
God, how can they expect to be trusted when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themselves to their Prince? Are not their Prayers
all worded to their Hands? Have they Liberty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the Sense of their Hearts in Publick? No, they
have solemnly promis'd, they'll use the Church-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and <hi>none other;</hi> why then should they expect a
Liberty of expressing their Sense when they are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
to the King? Ay but,</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Bishops upon their Consecration should declare what
Faith they are of, as they did in the Primitive Times.</hi>
What's this but too high a Reflection upon our Church,
an Accusation that we are fallen from the Primitive
Purity? Tho it must be acknowledg'd, that all the
Clergy Subscribe, Assent, and Consent to the Thirty
nine Articles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is not that enough? Or, have
they forgotten how solemnly they did swear Canonical
Obedience to their Ordinary; that they now tell us,
they must maintain Unity with their Bishop with <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
thereby encouraging even the Nonconformists

               <head>ANSWER.</head>
               <p>As for their Possessions, they are setled on them in
no other manner than they were on the Clergy in
Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s and K. <hi>James</hi> the First's Days, when,
for not subseribing to Articles never then enjoyn'd by
Act of Parliament, many hundreds of the Clergy were
suspcnded, and depriv'd of all their Ecclesiastical Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions:
And should a strict Enquiry be made into our
Clergy, it's to be fear'd, that too many of 'em would
be found so very guilty, as to deserve not only a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spension,
but also a Deprivation; and we therefore
cannot think it to be the Wisdom of our Clergy to
provoke the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to make a
close Search after their Miscarriages, especially seeing
Deprivations have been anciently for Dilapidations,
and such like Offences.</p>

               <hi>SECONDLY,</hi> As to our Religion, This Address
(referring to the Declaration) necessarily herds
among the various Sects under the Toleration,
who for suspending the Laws have led the way
in these Addresses, owing their Exercise of their
Religion to no Legal Establishment, but only to
Sovereign Pleasure and Indulgence, which at
pleasure is revocable.</p>
            <div type="answer">
               <head>ANSWER.</head>
               <p>1. They'll not deny, but that they now agree with
the other Sects, in Dissenting from his Majesty's Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and are equally with them owing to the King's
Grace, and His most Christian Principle, <hi>That Conscience
ought not to be constrain'd,</hi> for the Protection the King
vouchsafes them in the Enjoyment of the Free Exercise
of our Religion. They see how easily the King can
humble them; and had he not been for Liberty of
Conscience, he must esteem himself under the most
powerful Obligations of endeavoring <hi>it,</hi> and a Change
of our Religion: Why then should they be so much
against concurring with the various Sects among us in
rendring the King their Thanks? What, shall the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natic
out-do us in point of Ingenuity and Gratitude?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They say,</hi> That the Dissenters owe the Exercise of
their Religion to no Legal Establishment, but only to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Pleasure.</p>
               <p>What a strange Change is this! The other day, in

grant a Dispensation with a <hi>Non obstante</hi> to any Act of
Parliament, as well as give out a Particular Pardon to
the Transgressors of any Statute, and these particular
Dispensations and Pardons may be given out to every
particular Subject that needs 'em, has been the
avow'd Principle even of the greatest Opposers of
Arbitrary Government. Besides, in Matters Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical,
which comprehend the Dissenters Case, the
Sovereignty of the King is as full and compleat, as
any of His Majesty's Royal Predecessors, and theirs the
same with that Power the Popes did <hi>de facto</hi> exercise
according to <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> with a <hi>Non obstante</hi> to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

               <p>But what need we insist on these things? Have not
the <hi>Clergy</hi> gone higher in exalting the Sovereign Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
above all Laws, even in <hi>Civils,</hi> when in the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that all our <hi>Clergy</hi> subscribe, they distinguish
between the Sovereign Pleasure of our King, and His
Authority of Law; and that the Law or Authority,
if it at any time falls in competition with the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Pleasure, must defere to Sovereign Pleasure; it
being a Trayterous Practice to observe the Law, in
opposition to any Commission'd by Sovereign Power?</p>

So that the inevitable consequence of this

on their Metropolitan, and without the
previous Concurrence of the rest of their Order)
must be a fatal Division among the Clergy, and

               <p>One would think that the Bishop and Clergy of
a Diocess might safely enough make their Address of
Thanks of the King, without the previous Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the rest of their Order, or consulting their
Metropolitan. For the Union between Bishop and
Bishop, and the Dependance of all the Bishops in a
Province on their Metropolitan, ought to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
within those matters, that relate to Purity of
Faith and Manners; but is Non-addressing a matter of
Faith, or Addressing, contrary to the Rule of good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
that it must not be adventur'd on without the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of a Colledge of Bishops, or the leave of a Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan?
But if we do more closely pursue this point, we
shall find the Constitution of our Church to be such, that
in all matters of <hi>Consultation,</hi> the Birth must not be at
<hi>Lambeth,</hi> but at <hi>Whitehall.</hi> For what Power Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
to a single Bishop hath the Metropolitan, but what is
<hi>Juris positivi,</hi> and derived from the King, the Fountain
and Source of all Provincial and National Church-Power

Pontif, and then it will inevitably follow, that his
Majesty in the first place is to be consulted, whose
Mind in this matter is sufficiently known, and it's
as much the Duty of the Metropolitan to consult
and obey the King the Supreme Ordinary of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church, as it can be for a single Bishop to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
his Metropolitan; for which Reason we think
it a Presumption, very near to what is unpardonable
in the Inferior Clergy, to dispute what is agreeable to
the Sense, both of their Ordinary, and Supreme Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</p>
               <p>And as for the Talk of Schism, as if these, who
are for Addressing, must needs be <hi>Schismatics;</hi> we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say, that making Differences about matters of this
