            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'<seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Is commonly ſaid, that, by the Pattern, a man may judge of the whole Piece; ſo, from the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries endur'd by the Perſon, from whom we have the enſuing Relation, it may the more eaſily be inferr'd, what is ſuffer'd by forty thouſand, reduc'd to the ſame wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched condition of Captivity. What he writes therefore is not to be look'd on as a kind of Romance, to pleaſe ſuch as fondly imagine, that moſt of what is acted on the Stages of remote Countries is onely the iſſue of inſinuating Fiction; but as a ſincere and plain Relation of that diverſity of ſtrange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and adventures, good or bad, which happen'd to himſelf or others, during the time of his Slavery.</p>
            <p>Whereof having given a particular account, from the beginning of his misfortunes, to his happy return into his native Country, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards comes to give an exact, but ſhort one, of the Antiquity of the City of <hi>Algiers</hi> and its reduction under the power of the
<pb facs="tcp:56140:5"/>
               <hi>Turks</hi>; wherein may be ſeen many particular remarks relating to <hi>Africk.</hi> At laſt, he clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes up the Work with fifty <hi>Relations,</hi> which he names <hi>Particular,</hi> as happening to divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, his fellow-Captives, either during the time of his Slavery, or not long before, or after it. From all which may be inferr'd the ſtrange uncertainties, whereto humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs are ſubject; and what advantages ſome make of their afflictions, and how irreform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able others are in theirs.

The ſame night it came to the Point we wiſh'd it in, ſo that the next day, I went aboard with the three friends above-named, but within two hours after we were got to Sea; the weather grew calm, and the ſame night the wind prov'd contrary, ſo that we were forc'd to Laveer, hoping it would in time prove more favourable to us.</p>
            <p>Having ſpent four days in that manner, we found our ſelves at the Altitude of <hi>Rochel</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where we met with a Frigat of that City, a Pyrat, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently came up to us, and finding ours to be an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, the Captain ſent out the Boat with four Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers aboard us, to ſee our Maſter's Paſs-port, who immediately ſhew'd it them, giving the Souldiers a piece of money; which done, the Souldiers return'd to give their Captain an account. Whereupon the Captain coming up on the ſtern of his Frigat, cry'd out to our Maſter, that he ſhould look to himſelf, for there were five <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pirates under ſail at the mouth of the Channel. But our Maſter being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of no great experience, preſum'd that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>

Men of War; which ſometimes came out of that Channel, would ſecure that Coaſt againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and ſlighted the danger, not conſidering how unable he was to oppoſe his enemies, and ſo went on his Voyage, confident that it was impoſſible the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pyrates ſhould come out ſo far, where the Privatiers of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> were perpetually cruſing. Thus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he wind continuing ſtill contrary, we had been aboard ſeven days ſince our departure from St. <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>'s, and were ſtill on the Coaſt of <hi>Brittany</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame day about two in the afternoon, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd at a great diſtance two Ships, which we took to be Merchant-men; and ſoon after we could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive but one, to wit, the leſſer of them, making all the ſail ſhe could towards us, and as ſhe came neerer and neerer, we found her to be a <hi>Caravel.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Maſter order'd the ſails to be furl'd up, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this reaſon, that it was not the cuſtom of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to run away at Sea; ſo that the Ship which follow'd us bearing all the ſail ſhe could, was got within Canon-ſhot, without putting up any colours, whence it might be eaſily judg'd that ſhe was a Pyrat. But our ignorant Maſter, order'd the Boat to be put out, to enquire what they were, thinking it had been ſome <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dunkirk</hi> Pyrat. The <hi>Turks,</hi> who were in the <hi>Caravel,</hi> (as I underſtood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I was taken) ſeeing they were expected with the ſails furl'd up, and that the Boat was put out to Sea, and in a word obſerving all that is wont to be done when a fight is intended, attributed that procedure to the want of experience in our Maſter, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he had to defend himſelf. The Captain of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56140:11"/>
               <hi>Caravel</hi> in like manner caus'd his men to furl up their ſails, being unwilling to come any neerer us. In the mean time, night came on, and the <hi>Caravel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd ſtill in ſight, with a Lantern at her ſtern, as a ſignal to her Companions. This was the judgement of us Paſſengers, but our Maſter laugh'd at us. All we could obtain of him by fair words, was to put our Ship into a poſture of defence; in which preparation we ſpent the night; but, of four pieces that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, there was onely one fit to be us'd. All theſe things paſt while both Ships were in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at a ſtand, both having their ſails furl'd up.</p>
            <p>In that poſture the night paſs'd away, and about 5. in the morning (<hi>Aug.</hi> 22) we diſcover'd two great Ships making all the ſail they could toward us. That oblig'd us to entreat our Maſter to make away; but he continued obſtinate, every one gave his reaſons, and the Maſter, who had not any himſelf, would not hearken to any from others. About 10. in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two Ships got up to the <hi>Caravel,</hi> but all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any colours. Soon after they had got the wind of us, and were come up within Musket-ſhot. There was upon the ſtern of the greater of the two Ships a <hi>Turk,</hi> who had a little Flag or Streamer about his arm, and there ſtood by him a Chriſtian Slave, who cry'd out in the <hi>Flemiſh</hi> tongue, <hi>Str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of Chriſtendom; for it ſometimes happens that when the <hi>Turks</hi> take a Ship upon treaty, they keep their words, and ſet the Priſoners aſhore in ſome Chriſtian Country aſſoon as they can. But our gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Maſter, inſtead of treating, onely ask'd whether he ſhould have good Quarter? Anſwer was made from the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ships, <hi>Yes, yes, good Quarter.</hi> Whereupon without any more ado; the Maſter caus'd the Flag at the ſtern to be taken down, and with three or four of the Seamen got into the Boat, and made towards the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ships, to deliver themſelves up into the hands of their enemies.</p>
            <p>Aſſoon as they were aboard there, the <hi>Turks</hi> gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of pillage, came preſently in their Boat, to the number of ten or twelve aboard our Ship, under the conduct of a Captain, who was an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> but a Renagado.

            <p>Having rifled thoſe who were on the Deck, and at the Stern, they carried us aboard one of their Ships, leaving in ours about a dozen <hi>Turks,</hi> to conduct it; and the wind being Eaſterly, they turn'd towards the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> and within two dayes, we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd

            </p>
            <p>I was all this while as it were in a dream, wherein a man ſees ſtrange apparitions, which cauſe fear, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and curioſity, reflecting on the ſeveral Languages (for they ſpoke the <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> the <hi>Arabian, Lingua Franca, Spaniſh, French, Dutch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi>) the ſtrange habits, the different Armes, with the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Ceremonies at their Devotions, aſſuring you, that all this found me matter of ſpeculation. But admiration, fear, curioſity, and melancholy find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me nothing to eat, and my ſtomach calling for it, I joyn'd with four Chriſtian ſlaves, who, though they were allow'd nothing but Bisket, yet made pottage of Rice or ſomething elſe they had brought with them from aſhoar. 'Tis to be noted, theſe ſlaves came in one of the <hi>Algiers</hi> Ships, for the <hi>Turks</hi> make uſe of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſlaves for Sea-men. The wind continu'd ſtill favourable.</p>
            <p>The eleventh day after our taking, we got to the ſtreight of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> at which paſſage the <hi>Turks</hi> obſerve many ſuperſtitious ceremonies; among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, one is, they caſt into the Sea a pot full of Oyl, and believe that that pot goes to a mountain, called by Seamen, <hi>La Montague des Signes.</hi> For the <hi>Turks</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All theſe ſuperſtitions are perform'd with many prayers and ceremonies.</p>
            <p>The third day after our paſſage through that ſtreight,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56140:12"/>
we were got about Sun-riſing oppoſite to the City of <hi>Algiers,</hi> whereupon the Captain caus'd the great Guns to be diſcharg'd, which noiſe brought all the curious perſons about the City to the water-ſide. For my part, I was aſleep among thirteen other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> every one with a foot chain'd, and they had caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor ere we were got out of the Irons. Aſſoon as I had my feet at liberty, I got up on the Deck, whence I ſaw the Sea-ſide cover'd with <hi>Alarbes.</hi> I ask'd the Captain (who was an affable perſon) what thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were, for they had no other cloathing, then three or four Ells of cloath wrapp'd about their bodies, without any Taylor's work about it; he told me, <hi>Theſe are the poorer ſort, and the Inhabitants of the Villages of this Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here begins our Tragedy. The Owners of the Ships which had taken us, having got us aſhoar, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted us to the Market, where the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are ſold, to ſee if any one there knew us. Thence we were brought to the Palace of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. Some give him the title of King, but he is onely a Vice-roy, inaſmuch as he receives his part of the new ſlaves, to wit, of eight, one falls to him. He was ſet in the Hall of Audience, croſs-legg'd, as Taylors are here when they are at work, on a ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeat, cover'd with a piece of blew Tapiſtry. He had in his hand a plume of Feathers like a Fan. His Garment was a long Gown of red Silk, and he had on his head a great Turbant, neatly interwoven, but his leggs were bare. He was a perſon of a goodly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But before we were ſent to him, he had already been inform'd that the Knight <hi>Philip de Cherf</hi> was a noble Cavalier, and ſo he took him for his eighth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56140:13"/>After the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had taken his right, we were brought to the houſe of an honourable <hi>Turk,</hi> who was one of the Owners of the Ships which had taken us. As we were going into the houſe, he ask'd us in <hi>Italian,</hi> whether we had eaten any thing that day; whereto we anſwering that we had not, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of his Chriſtian ſlaves, to bring us a basket of Grapes, and ſome Bread. The houſe was built after the <hi>Italian</hi> way of building, the Galleries were of white Marble, both the Pavement and the Pillars, and the Arches very well proportion'd, according to the rules of Architecture. We were to lye in the night in thoſe Galleries, on the floor; but I could have wiſh'd my ſelf lodg'd in the Stable, upon Straw. For being not accuſtom'd to ſuch accommodations, in the mornings we were ſtiff, and in a manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of the uſe of our arms and leggs. We were not to go out of that houſe, till ſuch time as we were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>old. We ſtaid there ſeven days, expecting till ſome <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſlaves, who were taken before us, were ſold. In the mean time, that Chriſtian Maſter-Traytor, of whom I make mention in my IX. Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, came to viſit and comfort us; but we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice before-hand that he was a Rogue. The General <hi>Alli Pegelin,</hi> and ſome of the chiefeſt <hi>Turks</hi> came to ſee us, in order to the buying of us. They ask'd us, whether we had wherewith to pay our ranſome, and told us, that they would buy us, and find us good paſſage? We unanimouſly anſwered that we had no mony, but that we were in hope that ſome good people in our Country would endeavour to aſſiſt us with their Alms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:56140:13"/>The ſlaves before-mentioned being ſold the 12. of <hi>September,</hi> we were brought to the Market. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain old man with a ſtaff in his hand took me by the arm, and led me ſeveral times about the Market-place, and thoſe who were deſirous to buy me, ask'd me my Country, name, and profeſſion; whereto I made anſwer, that I was born in the Country of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> (inſtead of ſaying <hi>Flanders</hi>) of the City of <hi>Damm,</hi> and by profeſſion a ſouldier. They took me by the hand, to ſee if it were hard and brawny by working, and they caus'd me to open my mouth, to ſee whether my teeth were able to overcome Bisket in the Gallies. Then they caus'd us all to ſit down, and the old man took the firſt in order, and led him three or four times about the Market, crying, <hi>Arrache, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rache,</hi> that is, <hi>Who offers moſt?</hi> The firſt being ſold, he was ſet on the other ſide of the Market, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſerv'd after the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>While the firſt among us were under ſale, I ſate between my Companions <hi>Monſieur Caloën,</hi> and <hi>Renier Saldens,</hi> who notwithſtanding that tragical action, ſaid, fetching a deep ſigh, <hi>This is a ſolemn day at my village in</hi> Flanders, <hi>if we were there, we would drink a glaſs of good wine, and be merry among our friends.</hi> I reply'd, <hi>Me-thinks this a ſolemn day with us.</hi> Which I had no ſooner ſaid, but the old man taking me by the arm caus'd me to march as he had done the others, crying, <hi>Arrache, Arrache.</hi> I heard ſeveral perſons proffering mony, yet underſtood not what they ſaid. I ask'd an old ſlave how much they proffered for me? He told me, one offers 190. Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacoons, and another 200. and at laſt, the bargain was concluded at 200. Pattacoons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56140:14"/>He who bought me was a Renegado, named <hi>Sab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But notwithſtanding the quality he attributed to us, we were carry'd to the Stables belonging to his Palace, where we found two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty other ſlaves for the ſupply of his own Galley. We continu'd in the Stables one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days, where our daily allowance was two loaves of Bread.</p>
            <p>It was now neer the end of <hi>September,</hi> about which time the Gallies make their laſt courſe abroad. The ſlaves who were with us made what proviſions they could in order to their going to Sea.

The day the ſlaves were to go aboard, there came into our Stables five or ſix young Lads<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apprentices to Barbers, who began to ſhave their heads and beards, who were to row in the Gallies. When they were all ſhaven and fitted, the Captain of the Galley and the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Steward came into the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Which the Captain obſerving ſaid to the Steward, as he paſs'd by us, <hi>Let us leave theſe wretched Raskals <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aſhoar, they are yet Savages</hi>; which expreſſion we thought no injury at that time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Galley went out the ſame day, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd by three other Gallies. In the mean time, we continu'd in the Stable with the ſick ſlaves, and ſuch as were incapable of ſervice and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Of the cloath I had receiv'd; I made a ſhift to cut out a ſhirt, and to make it up, but the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers I knew not how to begin. Which a <hi>Portuguez</hi> Gentleman who was alſo a ſlave, obſerving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid to me, <hi>Friend, I perceive you are no Taylor by your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi>; whereupon he gave three or four <hi>aſpers</hi> (a ſmall piece of money in that Country) to another ſlave, who cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> coming afterwards to be inform'd that we were not perſons of quality, nor rich, as it had been reported, to wit, we three, <hi>Caloën, Saldens,</hi> and my ſelf, he caus'd us to be brought into the Hall of Audience, where there was preſent the General <hi>Alli Pegelin,</hi> who ſaid to us, <hi>Chriſtians, I have bought you of the Baſſa, but at a very great rate.</hi> He ſent us thence to his own houſe, where there were twenty Women <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56140:15"/>
durſt not truſt to go out of the houſe, for fear of being debauch'd by the <hi>Turks</hi>; for <hi>Alli Pelegin</hi> himſelf, our Patron, had the reputation of being a hater of that abhominable ſin. And for thoſe Boys, he kept them onely out of oſtentation, as great Lords in Chriſtendome keep Pages, Lacqueys, and Halbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>We were ſent thence to the Bath of our new Maſter, which is the place appointed for the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Aboad of ſuch Slaves as are intended to ſerve in the Galleys. This Bath was a ſtreet of his Houſe, of the quality and ſcituation whereof I ſhall give a ſhort deſcription. In the firſt place, it had a very narrow entrance, which led into a ſpacious Vault, and that receiv'd its Light, ſuch as it was, through a certain Grate that was above, but ſo little, that at mid-day, in ſome Taverns of the ſaid Bath, there was a neceſſity of ſetting up Lamps. The Taverners, or Keepers of thoſe Taverns are Chriſtian Slaves of the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aths, and thoſe who come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Drink are Pirats, and Turkiſh Souldiers, who ſpend their time therein drinking, and committing abhominations. Above the Bath there is a ſquare place, about which there are Galleries of two Stories, and between thoſe Galleries there were alſo Taverns, and a Church for the Chriſtians, ſpacious enough to contain three hundred Perſons, who might there conveniently hear Maſs. The roof is flat, with a Terrace, after the Spaniſh mode<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We were there five hundred and fifty Chriſtian Slaves, all belonging to our Patron <hi>Alli Pelegin</hi>; yet did he not allow any one of this great number ought towards his ſuſtenance.

            <p>Reſerving therefore the ſaid account to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Relation, I ſhall here only declare what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to me the firſt Night after my diſpoſal into that new Lodging. I knew not where to take up my Quarters, and being not acquainted with any one there, I went in the Evening, with a Coverlet, which I had receiv'd in the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Lodgings, up to the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race of the Bath. That place ſeem'd to me the moſt convenient to avoid being troubleſome to any other; for I was a perfect Novice among them.</p>
            <p>Being ready to go to my Loging, a certain ſlave of the Bath, a Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> and his Companion, a <hi>French-man,</hi> began to ask me what news there was in Chriſtendom. While I was telling them what I knew, I heard below in the Quadrangle one of the Guardians (who are thoſe that have the overſight of the Chriſtians, and what they do) crying out aloud, that the next morning ſuch a number of ſlaves, were to go to work at the break of day, and with that the Guardian went his wayes, locking up the Bath. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as the door was lock'd, I could ſee an old Fox, a ſlave, an <hi>Italian,</hi> bringing in a great burthen of Woollen and Linnen cloaths, Shirts, Braſs-pots, and other pieces of houſhold-ſtuff, who began to cry, <hi>Arrache, Arrache.</hi> I ask'd the Knight what it meant?

out of compaſſion, partly out of kindneſs, ask'd me whether I would take part of this little Chamber, where I might be a little warmer, for in the other place I lay in the open Air. I heartily accepted of their proffer, and afterwards I lay in their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or to ſay better, Kennel. And there I erected me a Bed made of Cords upon four ſticks, which ſerved for Pillars, much like a Hamock.</p>
            <p>After we had made the Ropes, we were taught a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Trade, but much more painful to thoſe who were not accuſtom'd to hard labor, to wit, the pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wheat in a Stone-mortar. That work was extreamly painful to me, yet with little advance, by reaſon of my want of ſtrength, which the Guardian obſerving, ſaid to me, <hi>What a dog art thou?

The Wheat being put into the bags, he gave every one a load to carry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I had hardly gone four or five ſteps ſo loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ere the bag, for want of ſtrength, began to ſlide down from my head, ſo that the Guardian was forc'd to be ſo kind as to help it up again, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital for his aſſiſtance, he gave me three or four blows over the face with his fiſt, ſo that the blood came out of my Mouth and Noſe, which forc'd me, notwithſtanding the impoſſibility, to go forward with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56140:17"/>
my load. But as ill luck will have it, ere I had got ſome few pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es further, the ſtring which ty'd up my breeches broke, ſo that it fell down, together with the bag of Wheat. Finding my ſelf reduc'd to that extremity, I made a ſhift to get up my breeches, and by the aſſiſtance of ſome good people that paſs'd by, I got up the bag on my head again, and march'd on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the houſe of <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi> our Patron, where being come I fell down once more, being ſo weary, that I was hardly able to ſtir.</p>
            <p>But what remedy was there? The greateſt work of all was now but beginning, becauſe we were to carry up thoſe bags forty ſteps high into a Granary, which it would have been abſolutely impoſſible for me to do. But God of his goodneſs knowing the ſtrength of men, it was his pleaſure, that my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion <hi>Renier Saldens,</hi> who was much ſtronger then I, having emptied his bag, and coming down the Stairs, found me at the bottom in a ſad condition, to wit, groveling on the ground, all bloody, ſweaty and duſty, and in a word, almoſt dead, and the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian ſtanding over me, and threatning to diſpatch me. Whereupon <hi>Saldens</hi> being a daring and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perſon, ſaid to the Guardian, <hi>What do you not perceive that this ſlave is ſick?</hi> And with thoſe words he took up my bag, and carried it up for me. It may be eaſily imagin'd how kindly I took that act of friendſhip and compaſſion.</p>
            <p>That days work being over, I return'd in a very ſad plight to the Bath, with <hi>Renier Saldens,</hi> who to comfort me carried me into one of the Taverns with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bath: for <hi>Saldens,</hi> when we were taken, had made a ſhift to hide five or ſix pieces of Gold. He
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56140:17"/>
call'd for a pot of Wine, and ſomething was brought us to eat, which coſt nothing, for, paying for the Wine, all is ſatisfy'd, whether a meat or not. As we were eating and drinking, to recruit our ſpent forces, my other Companion M. <hi>Caloën</hi> came in. He had been all that day imploy'd in leading a Mule loaden with Bisket from our Patron's houſe to the water-ſide; and whereas in <hi>Algiers</hi> the Streets are very narrow and dirty, and that the cuſtome is, that when one leads a Mule or Camel loaden, he ever and anon cries <hi>Belec,</hi> that is, <hi>Take heed there</hi>; it happen'd that our new Mule-driver, not knowing the cuſtom, overthrew a <hi>Turk</hi> in the dirty Streets. The <hi>Turk</hi> getting up again, and being extreamly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd, drew his Knife (for the <hi>Turks</hi> in the Cities wear a kind of long Knives, as people do Swords in theſe parts) but as good fortune would have it, there came in ſome <hi>Turks,</hi> who ſpoke on the behalf of M. <hi>Caloën,</hi> ſaying to the <hi>Turk</hi> who fell down, <hi>What would you do, do you not ſee that this Chriſtian is yet a Savage, and that he does not know the cuſtome?</hi> They call'd him a <hi>Savage,</hi> becauſe he was then in his Chriſtian habit, after the <hi>Spaniſh mode</hi>; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that habit is inconvenient for a ſlave, in regard it is thence inferr'd that he is of no long ſtanding there.</p>
            <p>We ſpent that Evening in mutual relations of what adventures had happen'd to us the day before. And finding that we were to work every day, yet not have a piece of bread from the Patron, and that we had not confidence and ſubtilty enough to ſteal, for that profeſſion requires practiſe, eſpecially in a place where there are ſo many Thieves, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56140:18"/>
people are the more diſtruſtful, the Knight <hi>de Cherf,</hi> whom the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had ſold to our Patron, Monſieur <hi>Caloën, R. Saldens,</hi> and I reſolv'd to go to an <hi>Italian</hi> Merchant, named <hi>Franciſco Capati,</hi> Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at <hi>Algiers,</hi> and to receive of him 75. Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coons, conditionally that he ſhould be paid a hundred at <hi>Anwerp.</hi> The next day we put our reſolution in execution, and the Merchant was content we ſhould have the money, on condition that we were all joyntly and ſeverally bound for the whole ſum.</p>
            <p>The next day we were to go to delve in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard belonging to a Country-houſe of our Patron's, which was a very hard work. As we were returning to the City, I fell into diſcourſe with the Guardian, and told him I was a ſickly perſon, and not very ſtrong, and that if he would thence forward put me to ſome eaſier work, I would give him in requital of his kindneſs, four Ryals a month, which he granted, conditionally I would give him a months advance, which I gladly did. Whereupon he ſaid to me, hence-forwards you ſhall onely carry four great pots of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Lodgings of the Baſſa-Guardian, that is, the chiefeſt of the Guardians. For, there being five hundred and fifty ſlaves of us belonging all to the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me Maſter, there were five or ſix Guardians or Overſeers to look after us. I was extreamly well pleas'd with that new employment. The Baſſa-Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian's Wife was a Negro, but a very good-natur'd woman. Sometimes ſhe gave me a piece of Bread, or a Meſs of Pottage; but that was onely when ſhe was to Bath her ſelf, or when I carried the Bread to the Oven; ſo that it was a kind of reward for my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56140:18"/>
ſervices. I continu'd in this employment ſome days, to my great ſatisfaction. But in regard it is a hard matter for Youth to fare well and enjoy lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure without danger of being debauch'd, it happen'd one day as I was carrying my ordinary pot, pouring it into the <hi>Tinaga</hi> (which is a great earthen pot or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern, wherein the proviſion of water for the houſe is kept) there entred into the houſe a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, attended by a Chriſtian ſlave, an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I ask'd her whether ſhe would drink a Glaſs of Sack. I know not whether the Guardian's wife per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, or heard it, but the next day I was forc'd to turn over a new leaf, and from thence forwards I was oblig'd to work with the reſt of the Slaves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom my work was to ſerve the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>I came by little and little to brook that kind of life. This was in the moneth of <hi>December,</hi> about which time the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pirates cruze up and down along the Coaſts of <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> knowing that the wines and fruits are then tranſported in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hamborough</hi> Veſſels. It happen'd about this time that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pirates had taken a Frigot made at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> called the <hi>Pearl,</hi> coming from <hi>Malaga.</hi> I durſt not go to the water-ſide, becauſe I had been at <hi>Malaga,</hi> and at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> for fear of being known by any one. The ſame night that the ſaid prize was brought in, a Slave of <hi>Anwerp</hi> came to me, who knew me by my own name, as having been aboard our Ship when we were taken, and he told me, that in that laſt prize, there was come a Gentleman, who had ask'd him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether he knew not two <hi>Flemiſh</hi> ſlaves, one call'd Monſieur <hi>Caloën,</hi> the other

Some Forms and Tables that ſtood before the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, and ſome Ladders which they alſo met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, they converted into Armes, Swords, Pikes and Muskets, defending themſelves generouſly.

At laſt a Prieſt of one of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Orders, who liv'd in the Bath, and was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon generally well-belov'd, came up to the place of the engagement with a Wax Candle in his hand, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring all he could to appeaſe and ſeparate them, telling them they were all Chriſtians, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difference of Religions, and if ever the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron came to know how they had demean'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56140:21"/>
they ſhould not want good cudgelling. This remonſtrance put a period to that engagement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Surgeons were immediately call'd up, for there were five or ſix in the Bath, who belong'd to the Patron, who preſently fell a dreſſing the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It was imagin'd all this would have paſs'd without the Patron's knowledge; but in regard the fight had laſted a good while, and the noiſe had been great, the Patron having heard it from his Lodgings, came immediately to the Bath with Creſſet-lights and Lanthorns attended by four or five Guardians well furniſh'd with Cudgels and Bulls-pizzles. He began to enquire what had paſs'd, but thoſe who had fought like Lyons ſlunk away, and hid themſelves like Foxes. Notwithſtanding that, the Patron, by his exact enquiry, made a ſhift to ſurprize one of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> party, and ordering him to be ſtripp'd ſtark naked, he caus'd him to be held by four Slaves by the hands and feet, with his belly on the ground, and a hundred blows with a Cudgel to be given him over the Back and the Buttocks; which execution per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, our Patron was appeas'd. The reſt of the Combatants hid themſelves, fearing the like treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>By this time we had been ſix months at <hi>Algiers,</hi> a ſufficient terme to have receiv'd anſwers from <hi>Flanders.</hi> We went together, M. <hi>Caloën, Saldens,</hi> and I, to our Patron's Lodgings, we kiſs'd his Robe, or the Sleeve of his inner Garment (a Turkiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence) and I told him that we had been ſo long at <hi>Algiers,</hi> preſuming that he was ſufficiently inform'd of our poverty, and that we underſtood that he had agreed with ſome of his Slaves about their Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56140:21"/>
conditionally that they ſhould go in a Ship which lay ready to ſet ſail for <hi>Legorn</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and that they continu'd there in priſon till their ranſomes were paid (for the Great Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome ſuch thing) we ask'd him how much he would have from us. <hi>What are you willing to give,</hi> replyed he? <hi>We expect your excellency ſhould make your demand,</hi> anſwer'd I, <hi>For it may be you will ſet ſuch a rate on us that there will be no likelihood of any agreement.</hi> After he had a little conſider'd, he ſaid, <hi>You ſhall pay two thouſand Patacoons at</hi> Legorn, <hi>or fifteen hundred here. That's abſolutely impoſſible for me,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>for I am a poor ſouldier, and therefore I had rather continue a ſlave at</hi> Algiers, <hi>then dye in priſon at</hi> Legorn. <hi>The moſt I ſhall be able to give will be five hundred Patacoons at</hi> Legorn. Whereto he made anſwer, <hi>You offer too little, I am now going out of the City for certain days</hi> (which was true, for his Horſe ſtood ready for him) <hi>we will talk further of it at my return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe words gave me much comfort, for I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd our Patron thought my proffer not much out of the way. With this anſwer we return'd to the Bath. And our Patron went away with the Slaves of the <hi>Caravan,</hi> to fell Timber for the building of a new Frigot, againſt the year following. In the mean time we were at work about a houſe our Patron had a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the upper part of the City; for it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the City of <hi>Algiers</hi> is built on the aſcent of a high mountain, and the place where that houſe was built, was ſo ſteepy to get up to, that a Mule could not go up it with any load. So that all the materials were to be carried up on mens backs, or in their arms. This
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56140:22"/>
was about the middle of <hi>February.</hi> The Guardian conducted us to the work, as he was wont, but at our going from the Bath, we ordered the Knight <hi>de Cherf</hi> to get ſome kind of pottage ready for us againſt our return. This Knight was exempted from working, beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>While we were at work, two Turks came to the Bath, and ask'd for three <hi>Dunkirk</hi>-ſlaves, named <hi>John-Baptist Caloën, Emanuel d' Aranda,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier Saldens</hi>; but there was not any body knew thoſe ſlaves.

He read the Atteſtation, and though we had chang'd our names, yet by the marks of the time, and the Ship wherein we were taken, he immediately concluded that we muſt be the three Chriſtian ſlaves whom the <hi>Turks</hi> enquir'd for. Whereupon he made them anſwer that he knew us very well, and that we were Slaves in that very Bath, but that we were then abroad at work.</p>
            <p>Now Monſieur <hi>Caloën</hi> and <hi>Renier Saldens</hi> not

They both imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ran down, where they found the two <hi>Turks,</hi> who gave them a letter, which was from Monſieur <hi>Caloën</hi>'s father. He was very joyful, and the <hi>Turks</hi> alſo, becauſe they had found us all at <hi>Algiers</hi>; for the contract which thoſe <hi>Turks</hi> had made with our Friends requir'd, that they ſhould deliver us, wherever we were in <hi>Barbary.</hi> They thereupon conducted Monſieur <hi>Caloën</hi> and <hi>R. Saldens</hi> to the houſe of the Turk <hi>Barber Aſſan,</hi> father-in-law to <hi>Muſtapha Ingles,</hi> who was in priſon at <hi>Bruges,</hi> with four o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to be exchang'd for us three. The Mother and Grand-mother of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> were extreamly glad to hear that he was alive, and that he might ere long return into his Country.</p>
            <p>I knew nothing of all this, for I continu'd at work till the Guardian gave every one permiſſion to go and get ſomething towards his ſubſiſtance. I had a good ſtomach, for it was afternoon, ſo that hoping to meet with ſome pottage of the Knight's providing, as we had appointed, I run from my work ſtreight to the Bath, and as I was going in I met with the <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> who ſaid to me, <hi>James, I have good news for you, which is, that you are no longer a Slave. For there are two Turks come from</hi> Dunkirk, <hi>and M.</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loën <hi>and</hi> Saldens <hi>are gone out along with them.</hi> This ſo good and ſo unexpected news over-joy'd me ſo that I had almoſt fallen into a ſwound, ſo far was I then
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56140:23"/>
from thinking of hunger. I went immediately to find out my two Companions with the <hi>Turks,</hi> whom I met with all four in the Street. Aſſoon as M. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loën</hi> perceiv'd me, he ſaid to the <hi>Turk, This is our third Companion</hi> Emanuel d' Aranda. I ask'd the <hi>Turks</hi> how my Friends did; they told me that my Mother knew nothing of my misfortune, and that my Brother was well. They came along with us to the Bath, and ſpoke to the Guardian not to put us to work any more; in regard we were free.</p>
            <p>We ſpent the remainder of the day very merrily, drinking with our friends upon this good news; but we minded not much the old ſaying; Joy may be within the houſe, and grief and ſadneſs at the door. The next day we reſolv'd to ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next day, we writ a letter to <hi>Mustapha</hi>'s Grand-mother, in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> (for ſhe was a <hi>Moor</hi> forc'd thence with the <hi>Moors</hi> in the time of King <hi>Philip</hi> the third) by which letter we gave her to underſtand at large what hall paſs'd in that new priſon, and that ſhe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that her Grand-child was in the power of our Friends, and that the injuries were done us would be reveng'd upon him.

            <p>
               <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi> was not yet return'd, and in the mean time, we were kept up in the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Palace; ſo as that none from without were permitted to come to us, which yet was ſometimes ſecretly done. Our daily allowance was two little loaves; but we had this happineſs, that the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Caterer was a <hi>French</hi>-man, a Renagado, who had been Lacquey to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Chamois,</hi> that is, the Knight of <hi>Malta</hi> before-mentioned. And in regard the Caterer knew that I was familiarly acquainted with that Monſieur <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mois,</hi> at <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi>'s Bath, and that we had lain for ſome moneths in the ſame room, he gave us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing every day, as Oyl, Figgs, Tobacco, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to eat. Yet here it was that we endur'd the greateſt miſery of all our Slavery; for as I ſaid before, we lay in a very little room; with ten or twelve Boys who were full of vermine, and though we ſpent moſt part of the day in louſing our ſelves, yet within an hour after, we were as well furniſh'd as before.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Steward walk'd always with a cudgel in his hand, becauſe there was a neceſſity that ſome body ſhould be beaten, though it were onely for his divertiſement. All the ſatisfaction we had, was, that all the Slaves the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had for his eight part came the firſt night to lye among us, before they were ſent to the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Bath; and being there were ſome taken
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56140:24"/>
every day, and conſequently new Slaves came in, by that means we came to know all that paſs'd in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom.</p>
            <p>Having continu'd in this miſery eighteen days, our Patron <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi> return'd to the City. The two <hi>Turks</hi> who were come to ſet us at liberty went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to ſalute him, and to acquaint him that there were ſeven <hi>Turks</hi> to be exchang'd for us three <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> telling him that they would reimburſe what we had coſt him. <hi>Pegelin</hi> made them this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>I have bought my Slaves to make ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by them, and not to exchange them for Turks.</hi> Whereto they reply'd, <hi>We are poor Souldiers. Beſides you know our priviledge, conformably to the Laws, we therefore intreat you to grant our request. Alli Pege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> hearkening to their reaſons, ſaid to them, <hi>I know very well what your priviledges, and what the Laws are; but one of you is a perſon of great wealth, and he ought to have no advantage of that Priviledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is no Turk, but onely a Moor, and born in</hi> Algiers. <hi>And he who was born in the City of</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, <hi>at the time aforeſaid, cannot be a Souldier. For you are to know, that the</hi> Turks <hi>take the Citizens of</hi> Algiers <hi>for Subjects, having ſubdu'd them by force of Arms, becauſe they would have revolted. Upon that account is it that they are not admitted to be Souldiers, and conſequently they are incapable of making any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the priviledge. But if you will follow my advice, you may have the three Chriſtians, and yet it ſhall not coſt you much, and I ſhall nevertheleſs have ſatisfaction.</hi> This advice was lik'd by the two <hi>Turks.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi> found out this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that theſe two <hi>Turks</hi> on the behalf of their four
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56140:25"/>
companions Priſoners in <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſhould go and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Mother and Grand-mother of <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha Ingles</hi> (who was the <hi>Moor</hi> born at <hi>Algiers,</hi> and could make no advantage of the priviledge) that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them ſix they would buy two of the Chriſtian ſlaves, to wit, <hi>Emanuel d' Aranda,</hi> and <hi>Renier Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> and that the Mother and Grand-mother of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha</hi> ſhould buy <hi>John Baptiſt Caloën.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two <hi>Turks</hi> lik'd the propoſal, and put it in execution. They went to <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Grand-mother, and told her they were all poor, yet had reſolv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them ſix to buy the two Chriſtians, and that it was requiſite ſhe, being very rich, ſhould oblige her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to buy the third, to wit, M. <hi>Caloën.</hi> The old woman accepted the condition, and a contract was drawn to that purpoſe, according to the Turkiſh way. They went to acquaint <hi>Alli Pegelin,</hi> that they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, and ask'd him what he would have for <hi>d'Aranda</hi> and <hi>Saldens.</hi> They agreed at five hundred Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coons for both. <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Grand-mother went the ſame day to <hi>Pegelin,</hi> and acquainted him with the misfortune of her Grand-ſon who was in Slavery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Chriſtians, and that there was no way to recover his liberty, but by delivering a <hi>Dunkirk</hi>-ſlave he had, whom ſhe would pay well for. <hi>Pege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> reply'd, <hi>If you would have a Dunkirk-ſlave, to do you a kindneſs, I will beſtow one on you. Nay,</hi> reply'd ſhe, <hi>I am content to pay for him, but it muſt be one, whoſe name is</hi> John Baptiſt Caloen. <hi>Pegelin</hi> pretending a little aſtoniſhment, anſwer'd, How! <hi>John Caloën, he is a neer kinſman of the King of Dunkirk's, and therefore he will coſt you ſix thouſand Patacoons.</hi> The old woman hearing this anſwer was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56140:25"/>
aſtoniſh'd, and without making any reply return'd to her houſe, ſending us word, that <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſix thouſand Patacoons, that ſhe had not ſo much money, and conſequently that ſhe ſaw no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for the recovery of our liberty, if we would not contribute to the making up of that ſum. Whereto we return'd anſwer, by the ſame Meſſenger, that we would not contribute a peny, and that if ſhe would not redeem us, ſhe might let us periſh, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber withall that her Grand-ſon would alſo dye in <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſince he was in the power of our Friends.</p>
            <p>While this affair was under accommodation, there ſlip'd away nine weeks and three days, during which time, we continu'd in the Baſſa's Palace, in great miſery, fear, and diſquiet. At <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Mustapha's</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agreed with <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi> for the redemption of Monſieur <hi>Caloën</hi> at fourteen hundred Patacoons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally that the ſaid ſum were paid before <hi>Caloën</hi> went from <hi>Algiers.</hi> Upon this agreement we got out of the Baſſa's Palace. VVhen I could walk the Streets, I thought my ſelf at liberty, after ſo much trouble, ſo much fear of being ill-treated, and ſo much miſery.</p>
            <p>The firſt night Monſieur <hi>Caloën</hi> took up his lodging at <hi>Muſtapha's</hi> Grand-mothers, and <hi>R.

Every ſouldier had a little room to himſelf kept very
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56140:26"/>
neatly by the Boys, for every ſouldier almoſt had a little Boy, or a Chriſtian or a Renagado ſlave to wait on him. Our new Patron <hi>Cataborn Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> treated us very well, conſidering his ability, and made his excuſes to us, that he was not the cauſe of our ſo long aboad in the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Palace. The next day <hi>R. Saldens</hi> took his Quarters at the houſe of a rich <hi>Turk</hi> named <hi>Mahomet Celibi Oiga,</hi> Uncle to one of the five <hi>Turks</hi> who were to be exchang'd for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Mother and Grand-mother were much troubled about the money they had paid for M. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loën,</hi> giving him very reproachful words, ſo to force him to pay one moiety of the fourteen hundred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacoons. On the other ſide we were earneſt with the <hi>Turks,</hi> to have our liberty, according to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Flanders.</hi> In anſwer thereto they ſaid (and not without reaſon) that it were to hazard the loſs of their money and the return of their companions; for the contract made in <hi>Flanders</hi> with our Friends was to this effect, that the <hi>Turks</hi> were to ſend us with the ſooneſt into ſome part of Chriſtendom, after they had found us. So that we were forc'd to make a new agreement with them, that one of us three ſhould be ſet at liberty, who ſhould be oblig'd to bring the five <hi>Turks</hi> remaining in <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>Ceuta, Ora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> Cities belonging to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the two others ſhould remain behind as Hoſtages.</p>
            <p>This concluded, it was reſolv'd I ſhould go for <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that I ſhould be ſent with ſome of the Pyrat Ships of <hi>Algiers,</hi> who were to ſet me aſhore on the Coaſt of <hi>Spain.</hi> But as my ill-fortune would
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56140:26"/>
have it, a Barbarian King named <hi>Bennali,</hi> a Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to the Kingdom of <hi>Algiers</hi> revolted, and that Civil War was the cauſe that the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> to defend the Country, ſtood in need of the Gallies, ſo that they could not that Summer go out towards the Coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> as they were wont. About the ſame time there was a Ship of <hi>Legorn</hi> homeward bound, ready to ſet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ail, and our Companion <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> who was as deſirous of his liberty, as I was of mine, prevail'd ſo with the <hi>Turks,</hi> as alſo with M. <hi>Caloën,</hi> that he was pitch'd upon to go for the Low-Countries, and ſo went aboard that Ship of <hi>Legorn.</hi> I was extreamly ſad at his departure, conſidering with my ſelf, that I was to ſtay behind; but the great promiſes he made, that he would return aſſoon as he could, and bring along with him the five <hi>Turks</hi> gave me ſome comfort.</p>
            <p>I continu'd ſtill with my new Patron <hi>Cataborn Muſtapha.</hi> And though he were but a poor Souldier, ye I liv'd well enough with him: for he would often ſay to me, <hi>Emanuel, be not ſo melancholy, imagine that you were my Patron, and I your Slave.</hi> I did eat with him out of the ſame diſh, ſitting down with him, croſs-legg'd, after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> way. He made me the beſt cheer he could, and often ſaid to me, <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel, have I not reaſon to make much of my ſelf, for I have neither wife nor children, and when I dye, the</hi> Baſſa <hi>will be my heir, according to the cuſtom of this Country.</hi> I told him, <hi>True, you do prudently, and you have reaſon to live as much as may be at your eaſe.</hi> I could ſay no leſs becauſe I did eat and drink with him. But theſe words did not pleaſe a Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-boy who waited on him, kept his money, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56140:27"/>
waſh'd his linnen; in a word, that Boy did the work of a woman in the family, and was perpetually grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and ſaying, You make away with all you have, and there are yet ſo many days ere any more pay comes in; you ſhould be aſham'd to be drunk eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, this is not the life of a right Turk. But my Patron liv'd nevertheleſs at the ſame rate.</p>
            <p>One day being drunk, as he was wont, he fell out with a <hi>Bulcebas</hi> (that is a Captain of Foot) and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other injurious words, he call'd him a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> The Captain complain'd, and my Patron was caſt into priſon, and at the firſt aſſembly of the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> that is, the Councel, my Patron was condemn'd to receive a hundred blows with a Cudgel on the Buttocks, and beſides that to go and ſerve in the field againſt King <hi>Bennali</hi> for the ſpace of ſix moneths. I was much troubled at the misfortune of my Patron, who at parting ſaid to me, <hi>You muſt henceforwards go and live at</hi> Mahomet Celibi Oiga's <hi>houſe; I hope in God you will be at liberty before my return. If I had any money, it ſhould be divided between us.</hi> I made anſwer, <hi>Patron, I am ſufficiently ſenſible of your good inclinations and your poverty, I give you thanks for the kind entertainment I have receiv'd in your houſe. When you come into</hi> Flanders, ſaid he, <hi>preſent my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to your Friends, particularly to your Couſin at</hi> Dunkirk, <hi>for he often made me drink ſtrong Beer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the departure of my Patron, I went to <hi>Mahomet Celibi Oiga,</hi> and ſaid to him, <hi>Cataborn Muſtapha is gone to the Army, and hath ſent me to lodge at your houſe.</hi> Whereto <hi>Mohomet</hi> reply'd, <hi>You ſhould with all my heart; but I have no conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56140:27"/>
for it in my houſe.</hi> This he ſaid, becauſe my Companion <hi>Saldens,</hi> while he lodg'd there, had ſpoken too familiarly to his wife, a clear argument that he was jealous of him. I earneſtly intreated him, telling him, that I knew not whither to go. At laſt he condeſcended, and ſhew'd me a little room a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Stable, which was at a little diſtance from the houſe.</p>
            <p>Some days after my reception there, I was much aſtoniſh'd, that my Patroneſs ſpoke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For ſhe underſtood the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and ſpoke alſo <hi>Lingua Franca,</hi> and the women of that Country will take any occaſion to fall into diſcourſe with the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. I dreſs'd my Patron's horſe, and I went eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day for water to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>upply the houſe, though I were not commanded to do either, and by degrees I got into the favour of my Patroneſs. In the morning, I went along with my Patron to the Shambles, thence he ſent me home with what meat he had bought. On the other ſide, my Patroneſs ſent me to buy fru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts and herbs for the houſe. At length my Patroneſs's mouth began to open, and ſhe fell into diſcourſe with me ſo often, that I was afraid it might breed M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ggots in my Patron's brains. One time among the reſt ſhe ſaid to me, <hi>Chriſtian, God ſend you your liberty, pray tell me, are you poor in your own Country? I am a poor ſoldier,</hi> reply'd I, <hi>You may ſay what you pleaſe,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>yet you are not like our Gregorio.</hi> This <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorio</hi> was another ſlave of the houſe, a Native of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and in his Country a Fiſher-man; but there he was a Gardener, at a Garden of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Patron's without the City. This ſlave had a body well made for hard labour, otherwiſe he had
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56140:28"/>
been well brought up, conſidering his quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>This good woman put many curious queſtions to me every day. She was of high Statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, had a comely face, and inclining to fatneſs, wherein the beauty of a woman conſiſts, according to the opinion of the <hi>Africans.</hi> Every morning after I had dreſs'd the horſe, fetch'd water, been in the Market and done ſome other things, I ask'd my Patroneſs leave to go to Maſs at <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi>'s Bath, which ſhe never deny'd me. <hi>Mahomet Celibi Oiga</hi> was a graceful perſon as to his body, well brought up, and very temperate in his meat and drink, for he drunk only wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He was alſo very devout in his Religion. He was curious in enquiring news of remote Countries. He ask'd me how the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Flemings</hi> liv'd, and whether the <hi>Flemings</hi> were <hi>Papiſts Chriſtians,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by that word <hi>Catholicks,</hi> becauſe the Catholicks have a dependance on the Pope. He underſtood ſomewhat of Coſmography. He ask'd me why the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> being ſo powerful as he is, could not with the forces of the Kingdom of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> that is, with the Provinces of the Low-Countries, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the <hi>Flemings</hi>; by <hi>Flemings</hi> he went the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</hi> I told him that heretofore thoſe Countries had belong'd to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> but that they were revolted.</p>
            <p>My Companion <hi>Caloën</hi> was at <hi>Muſtapha's</hi> Grand-mothers, where he was unworthily treated. For in the houſe, he was confin'd to a Chamber with four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore pound weight of Iron at his legge; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he was ſent to a Country-houſe, three leagues out of the City, where he had not half as much victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56140:28"/>
as he could have eaten. <hi>Muſtapha's</hi> Friends, who had given ſo much money for M. <hi>Caloën,</hi> beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n to grumble that they heard no news from <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and thence took occaſion to ſay, that the King of <hi>France</hi> had taken the Kingdom of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and threatned to make him pay his ranſom, in caſe they heard not from him within four months. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Sea-affairs are ſubject to many misfortunes, and that my Companion <hi>Saldens</hi> ſhould have been on his way with the five <hi>Turks,</hi> I was afraid all might not be well.</p>
            <p>But God, who looks on the afflicted, gave me comfort when I was moſt caſt down; for my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſs gave me all the kind words I could expect. I had been ſix months in that houſe when I receiv'd the firſt news from my Companion <hi>Saldens</hi> by a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his dated at <hi>Ceuta,</hi> whereby he gave me an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his being there with the five <hi>Turks,</hi> and that we ſhould make all the haſt we could to the City of <hi>Tituan,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Fez,</hi> to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, according to the agreement made at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers</hi> with the two <hi>Turks.</hi> He writ to me alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſeven hundred P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tacoons which <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha's</hi> friends expected from M. <hi>Caloën,</hi> which rather then pay his Father ſaid he ſhould periſh in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. But in the Margin he had written in Latine <hi>haec propter bene ſtare,</hi> which words we blotted out, and gave the Letter to <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Mother, that ſhe might get it read and interpreted by ſome <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Slaves, which ſhe did. And whereas the Letter onely made mention of the five <hi>Turks,</hi> not ſpecify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their names, the Woman began to quarrel, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Son was not at <hi>Ceuta,</hi> and that M. <hi>Caloën</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:56140:29"/>
ſhould deliver up her Son, or ſhe would have him burnt, if he paid not his ranſom of ſix thouſand Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacoons. But the ſame day ſhe receiv'd a Letter from <hi>Ceuta</hi> written by her Son, wherewith ſhe was appeas'd, and we very glad, hoping ſhe would be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfy'd.</p>
            <p>But as ſome trouble is many times the ſhadow of ſatisfaction, aſſoon as ſhe had read over the Letter, ſhe order'd a hundred weight of Iron to be faſten'd to M. <hi>Caloën's</hi> leggs, alledging it was his fault that his Father would not pay the ſeven hundred Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coons. But we continued courageous notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this unexpected traverſe of fortune, till we heard of a Ship bound for <hi>Tituan,</hi> the place appointed for the exchange with the five Turks, who were at <hi>Ceuta.</hi> Yet were we ſtill in ſome fear, leaſt, in caſe that Ship ſhould be gone without us, we might ſtay there four or five moneths longer, ere we met with ſuch another opportunity.</p>
            <p>In this extremity we thought it our beſt courſe to take the advice of a Renagado, a Field-officer named <hi>Saban Gallan Aga,</hi> a perſon much reſpected among both <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> for his honeſty, integrity, and prudence, as being a Man full of Moral virtues, as may be ſeen more at large in my XIV. Relation. I went, and made this diſcourſe to him; <hi>The fame of your Virtues as well among the</hi> Turks <hi>as the</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Slaves hath encourag'd me to come hither, to deſire your advice in my miſery.</hi> He ask'd me who I was? <hi>I am Emanuel d' Aranda,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>born in</hi> Flanders, <hi>one of thoſe three</hi> Chriſtians <hi>who are to be exchang'd for the five</hi> Turks <hi>taken in the Caravel of</hi> Barbar Aſſan, <hi>and in purſuance of a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56140:29"/>
we made ſix months ſince, at</hi> Algiers, <hi>one of our Companions is gone for</hi> Flanders, <hi>and now he is come back as far at</hi> Ceuta, <hi>where he expects us with the five</hi> Turks, <hi>and according to that contract we are to be deliver'd at</hi> Tituan <hi>to compleat the exchange. But they do the contrary; for after we have been at vaſt charges in ſending our third Companion, through</hi> Italy <hi>and</hi> France, <hi>and now that he hath brought the five</hi> Turks <hi>by the way of</hi> England <hi>into</hi> Spain, <hi>and that they are at the preſent come to</hi> Ceuta, <hi>as I told you before, inſtead of ſending us thither, the Grand-mother of</hi> Muſtapha Ingles <hi>hath put my Companion</hi> John Baptiſt Caloën <hi>into Irons, and demands of him</hi> 700. <hi>Patacoons. Beſides ſhe would have the five</hi> Turks <hi>brought to</hi> Algiers, <hi>which is directly contrary to our contract. Saban Gallan</hi> repli'd, <hi>I will inform my ſelf of your buſineſs, come to morrow about this time, and I will give you my anſwer and advice.</hi> The next day, at the hour appointed I went to him, and asked him whether he had been mindful of me. He anſwer'd, <hi>I have inform'd my ſelf of your affair, and you are to know, that the Mother and Grand-mother of</hi> Muſtapha, <hi>do this only to ſee if they can get any money from</hi> J. B. Caloen. <hi>Take heed therefore that you do not promiſe any thing, and you are ſafe enough. You ſhall infallibly go with this Ship which is now ready, and though</hi> Muſtapha<hi>'s Grand-mother threatens you, yet will it come to nothing. For ſhe durſt not for all the World detain either you or M.</hi> Caloën, <hi>in regard the two</hi> Turks <hi>that are here, and the friends of the other</hi> Turks <hi>would complain thereof to the</hi> Baſſa. I thank'd him for his advice, and gave him a Bill under my hand, whereby I oblig'd my ſelf to pay
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56140:30"/>
him 25. Patacoons as ſoon as I were come to <hi>Tituan,</hi> which I perform'd accordingly.</p>
            <p>I gave M. <hi>Caloën</hi> an account of what I had done. He was put into a little Cellar, with a chain at his Legg, and hearing we ſhould go along with the Ship which lay ready in the Port, as alſo that we ſhould not pay any thing, he was much comforted. While I was ſpeaking to M. <hi>Caloën,</hi> the old Woman came and ask'd him, whether he would give the 700 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacoons; but M. <hi>Caloën</hi> laugh'd at her. Which made her imagine, that I had given him ſome advice, which made her angry with me. The next day ſhe came to my Patroneſs, and ſaid to her, <hi>Why do you not put your</hi> Dunkirk-<hi>Slave into Irons, that he may not come to give ill advice to his Companion?</hi> My Patroneſs repli'd, <hi>Why ſhould I do ſo? My</hi> Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirker <hi>ſerves me faithfully, and therefore I have no reaſon to put him into Irons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame afternoon, going for ſome Provender for the Horſe, my Patron not being at home, my Patroneſs had the leaſure to tell me, what had paſs'd between her and <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Grand-mother. The next day I went to viſit M. <hi>Caloën,</hi> and as I was tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him what <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Grand-mother had ſaid to my Patroneſs, the old Woman came in and ſaid to me, <hi>When I was laſt at your Patron's, I ſpoke to your Patroneſs, who had it not been for me, had put a hundred weight of Iron about your Leggs.</hi> I thank'd her for her kindneſs; telling her, I knew well enough what good offices ſhe had done me there. That anſwer vex'd her, inſomuch that ſoon after ſhe ſent a <hi>Turk</hi> to my Patron's, to make a complaint to him, that I hindred my Companion from giving the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56140:30"/>
ſeven hundred Patacoons, which ſhe expected from him, and to deſire him to put me into Irons, or ſend me to her houſe, to be put into the ſame chain with my Companion. Which was accordingly done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of my Patroneſs; for I was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Streets, and carried to <hi>Mustapha</hi>'s Grand-mother's, where they chain'd me with M. <hi>Caloën,</hi> to a chain of a hundred pound weight, and conducted me to a little Cellar; where we know not what would be the iſſue of all this; for we were afraid, that with beating they would force us to promiſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>Having been in that place three or four hours, a Chriſtian Slave, named <hi>Gregorio</hi> came to viſit us, who being ſent by my Patroneſs, told me, that ſhe was extreamly troubled, and knew nothing of what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to me, and that if I wanted ſomewhat to eat, ſhe would ſend it me, and that I ſhould take heart, for no hurt ſhould be done me; that all this was done by <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Grand-mother, to get our mony. This Meſſage of <hi>Gregorio</hi> comforted us much, and we ſent him with a note to a Tavern in <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi>'s Bath, where we had credit, for a pot of wine, and a diſh of meat. Now <hi>Gregorio</hi> coming from my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſs, the old Woman durſt not deny him entrance to us.</p>
            <p>At night, the old Woman came to ſee us with the Keys of the Cellar, and ſaid to us, <hi>Have a care, have a care what you do, this is the last night, to morrow the Ship goes away for</hi> Tituan, <hi>therefore if you love your liberty, give the ſeven hundred Patacoons, otherwiſe you ſhall dye here like Dogs.</hi> M. <hi>Caloën</hi> reply'd, <hi>Since my Father will not give any thing, and that you have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56140:31"/>
ſeen the Letter, for my part, you know I have not ought to give, and therefore hang me up, if you think good, but remember that your</hi> Muſtapha <hi>is in the hands of my Companion; you know him, and that he is not one who will ſuffer ſuch an injury to be done to his Friends and Companions.</hi> The wrinkled Hag hearing this grew almoſt diſtracted, and ſo uſing her accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed menaces, ſhe went away locking the Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar-door after her.</p>
            <p>The next day, (being St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s) ſhe came to us before day, ſaying, The Wind is Eaſt, and the Ship will be gone this day, therefore reſolve whether you will be ſet at liberty or not. We anſwer'd, <hi>If you have a mind to ſee your</hi> Muſtapha, <hi>ſend us away, if not, we will continue Slaves.</hi> About noon, two or three Chriſtian Slaves, who were to go in that Ship, came to ſee us (we had ſet them on work) and to take their leave of us. They deſir'd to ſpeak with the old woman, and ſaid to her, <hi>Madam, we hear by our Country-men theſe two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> the 8. the wind was fair for us, and we went aboard, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e we found ſome Chriſtian Slaves bound for <hi>Tituan,</hi> there to treat about their liberty with ſome Merchants, Jews and Moors. Being all aboard, a Gun was diſcharg'd, as a ſignal for the Farmers of the Cuſtomes to come and ſearch the Ship, and eſpecially to ſee whether the Chriſtians who were redeem'd had paid the duty; for though the Patron be ſatisfy'd, yet before a Chriſtian can be diſmiſs'd, he is to pay a certain proportion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ranſom. Having viſited the Ship they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the City, whence they gave the ſignal that the Ship might be gone, inaſmuch as they cannot get into the City, untill the Ship be at Sea. And this is done, to prevent the ſtealing of Slaves.</p>
            <p>The wind continu'd right for us, till we came to the unhappy place <hi>Cabo de Tenes,</hi> three leagues from <hi>Algiers.</hi> I call it <hi>unhappy,</hi> becauſe the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. in the year 1541. <hi>Oct.</hi> 17. loſt there by tempeſt the beſt part of his Gallies and Ships, when the enterprize upon <hi>Algiers</hi> fail'd. Here the wind turn'd quite contrary to us, which oblig'd us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the place from whence we came, and the next day we got to <hi>Algiers.</hi> I went to my Patron <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>'s, where I ſtaid till the wind turn'd, which was after ſome few days, and then we went aboard again. The wind was ſo good, that, in three days, we paſs'd the Iſlands of <hi>Frumentera</hi> and <hi>Yvica,</hi> and we were got
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56140:33"/>
in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight of the coaſt of <hi>Valentia.</hi> But all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for after eight dayes being at Sea, we were glad to put in again at <hi>Algiers,</hi> whether we got <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of the City ſeeing the Ship return'd thought ſhe had finiſh'd her Voyage, but they were miſtaken. I was extreamly diſorder'd, for we were ſixteen Chriſtians who had been ſhut up eight days and as many nights in a room towards the Prow, which was but nine foot in length and ſeven in breadth. And among thoſe ſixteen Chriſtians there were ſome ſick, who were very troubleſome to the others. And all conſider'd, I wonder we were not all ſick, for the tempeſt laſted eight days without any intermiſſion. So that not one of us during all that time went out on the Deck to clear himſelf of Vermine or to waſh, but continu'd in our little room like ſo many Dogs in a Kennel.</p>
            <p>Aſſoon as they had caſt anchor, I went aſhore, and to my Patron's who was aſtoniſh'd to ſee me. I acquainted him what miſery we had been in for the ſpace of eight days. I was troubl'd that we could not advance our Voyage; but the refreſhments aſhore rais'd my ſpirits. Beſides, I was glad to ſee the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities us'd by the Turks, when they celebrate their Eaſter, which they call the Eaſter of <hi>Ramadan,</hi> for they have ſeveral Eaſters. And though I had been at <hi>Algiers</hi> the year before, yet had I not ſeen any of thoſe ſolemnities, for at the time of Eaſter I was ſhut up in the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Palace. This Feſtival laſts eight days, and is celebrated with great pomp and much rejoycing; there being every day without the City Cavalcades, and certain recreations on Horſe-back,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56140:34"/>
which in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> language are called <hi>Juego de Caguas.</hi> And the Turks children are drawn in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle triumphal Chariots, and Chriſtian ſlaves ſerve for Horſes, and they know what is to be given them for their pains. Some in thoſe eight days make a ſhift to get fifteen or ſixteen Patacoons. The other Chriſtian Slaves ſold the children ſome toys or other, as they do at the <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rmeſſes</hi> in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Others had inſtruments for ſome childiſh plaies, and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo made a ſhift to get money out of the children, and every day there was wreſtling, at which exerciſe ſome Moors were very expert; but the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable celebration of the Eaſter conſiſted in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (though it be directly contrary to the command of the <hi>Alcoran</hi>) Wine and Brandy, and making good cheer, which they muſt eat with a very good appetite. For they faſt a whole month before their Eaſter, whereto they are oblig'd onely in the day time. This Lent, or to ſay better Faſt, is ſo rigorouſly obſerv'd, that if it were known any one had eaten a bit in the day time, they would pour melted Lead into his mouth, according to their Laws; but in the night they are permitted to eat. And to give people no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that they may eat, Drums are beaten all night up and down the ſtreets. This Eaſter is alſo advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Chriſtians, for as in theſe parts on New-years day they give New-yeers-gifts, or ſomething to the Men and Maids, ſo the Turks do the like at the Eaſter of <hi>Ramadan</hi>; and the three or four firſt days, no ſlave is put to any work.</p>
            <p>Having ſeen all theſe ſolemnities, the wind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd ſtill contrary till the 14 of <hi>January</hi> 1642. and then we embark'd the third time. Aſſoon as we
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56140:34"/>
were got out of the Port, the wind turn'd. But in regard we had return'd twice, and that ſome Turks had abus'd our Maſter, ſaying he underſtood not his profeſſion, he incens'd at that reproach ſwore that he would not return any more to <hi>Algiers,</hi> till he had finiſh'd his voyage, nay that he would rather ſink. The wind was abſolutely contrary, ſo that we could onely Laveer, hoping it would turn. The eighth day we got before <hi>Oran,</hi> that is, about fourty leagues from <hi>Algiers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame night, the Turks who were upon the Guard in the Ship diſcover'd at Sea two other Ships, which continually followed ours. Our Maſter and his people were afraid they might be Chriſtians. But the next day they perceiv'd they were two Pirates of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers</hi>; one was the Admiral, named <hi>Amet Arrais,</hi> born at <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> Our Maſter ask'd them whether they had ſeen any Chriſtian Ships, whereto having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd that they had not, we purſu'd our courſe. Four days after we caſt anchor before <hi>Tremeſen,</hi> where we unloaded ſome commodities. Several Merchants went aſhore, and ſtaid there, to wit, ſome Jews and Moors, who came along with us. <hi>Tremeſen</hi> was heretofore a powerful Kingdom, and the King of <hi>Algiers</hi> was a Tributary thereto. But now <hi>Tremeſen</hi> is Tributary to <hi>Algiers,</hi> and the Baſſa of <hi>Algiers</hi> hath at <hi>Tremeſen</hi> his <hi>Caja,</hi> that is, his Lieutenant. This Kingdom lies at the utmoſt part of the Grand Seignor's territories; for at that place begins the Kingdom of <hi>Morrocco</hi> and <hi>Fez.</hi> The Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is in confederacy with thoſe Kings; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that confederacy, the Kings of <hi>Morrocco</hi> and <hi>Fez</hi> are many times in war with thoſe of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:56140:35"/>
without any violation of the confederacy, as thoſe of <hi>Algiers</hi> are alſo many times in war againſt thoſe of <hi>Tunis,</hi> yet ſo as that the Grand Seignor concerns not himſelf in what the Baſſa's do. And yet theſe two Kingdoms are his. They do not think it making war, when they do not take places of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
            <p>Having continu'd three days at Anchor before <hi>Tremeſen,</hi> the Wind came Eaſt, and ſo was right for us. We proſecuted our Voyage; and whereas di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Marchants, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> ſtay'd aſhore at <hi>Tremeſen,</hi> we were almoſt as many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Ship, as there were <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Turks.</hi> 'Tis true there were three and twenty <hi>Jews,</hi> beſides the <hi>Turks.</hi> Now we Slaves had engag'd our ſelves in a deſign at <hi>Algiers,</hi> before we went aboard the third time, to render our ſelves Maſters of the Ship, and to Kill all the <hi>Turks,</hi> if an opportunity preſented it ſelf, and to that end, having been twice aboard, we had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd all conveniences. We had alſo made ſome preparations in order to the compaſſing of what we intended. The firſt propoſer of the Deſign was a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who lay all night on the Deck, with ſeven other Chriſtian ſlaves, and we ſixteen lay below in the little room towards the Prow; as I ſaid before. But though we were ſhut in, yet with the aſſiſtance of our Companions who were upon the Deck, we could ſecretly open the Hatch, ſo as the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould not perceive it. But the ſame night that we thought to put our Enterpriſe in execution, the chief Agent in it, who ſhould have given the Signal, either neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected it, or had not the courage to proceed. So the enterpriſe prov'd ineffectual, as may be ſeen more
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56140:35"/>
at large in my three and thirty Relation. After that night we had no opportunity; for the nearer we came to the Coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> the more were the <hi>Turks</hi> in fear of loſing the Ship, and the more careful in keeping their Guards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 9. 1642. We came to the Altitude of <hi>Malaga.</hi> The next day about ſeven, we perceiv'd two Ships making all the Sail they could towards us; which much frightned our Maſter and the <hi>Turks,</hi> for we could not avoid coming within their Shot. Our Maſt was cleft, ſo that we could not make a full Sail to get further into the Sea. They came ſo near us, that we could ſee their Dutch flaggs. Our Maſter commanded all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> under Deck. Then he made ready the Boat, that he might forſake the Ship, and get away with the chiefeſt of the <hi>Turks</hi> towards the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> as I was afterwards told by the <hi>Turk</hi> who was to look to Monſieur <hi>Caloën</hi> and my ſelf. But theſe two Ships being Marchant-men, as we underſtood two days afterwards, had no mind to Fight without any occaſion. Our Maſter was glad to ſee them paſs by without medling with him. The next day, about the ſame hour we met with a Pirat of <hi>Salley,</hi> who ask'd us whether we had any tidings of ſome Chriſtian Ships, telling us that the two Dutch Ships we had ſeen the day before were Marchant-men, that traded on the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The wind continu'd ſtill fair, ſo that <hi>Febr.</hi> 12. in the Evening, we caſt Anchor in a Bay within a League and a half of <hi>Tituan.</hi> In that place there is a River falls into the Sea, the mouth whereof ſerv'd heretofore for a Port to the Ships which came to load

               </gap>ſs of <hi>Santa Cruz</hi>'s Grand-father, being Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Galleys, made that River uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, by ſinking in it ſome old <hi>Indian</hi> Gallions, loaden with ſtones and earth. This was done to hinder the Pyrats who extremely infeſted the Ports and Coaſts of <hi>Spain.</hi> Being here at Anchor, we thought we had eſcap'd all the dangers Fortune might prepare for us, and we were in hopes that night to lodge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore. But this was reckoning without our Hoſt. For the Sea being extremely rough by reaſon of the Eaſt-wind, which forces the Mediterranean into the Ocean, our Maſter would not ſuffer the Boat to be put out for fear of ſome misfortune, that place being as it were between two Seas, which caus'd a great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Sea.</p>
            <p>We were therefore forc'd to caſt two Anchors more, and the worſt of it was that we could not make out to Sea, by reaſon the Wind was ſo high, and that the Bay is as it were a half-moon of Land, and that the Wind blowing from Sea was very violent. Add to this, that the Storm increaſed ſtill, inſomuch that the next day it was abſolutely impoſſible for us to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embark. The Maſter and the <hi>Turks</hi> were extremely at a loſs; and perceiving the Tempeſt ſtill increas'd, they knew not what to do, fearing the Cables might break, and that the Ship would run againſt a Rock, and fall to pieces, without any hope of ſaving any one of all thoſe who were aboard.</p>
            <p>The Maſter being thus puzled, and expecting to be Wrack'd, call'd up a Chriſtian Slave, born at <hi>Norway,</hi> named <hi>Hans Maurus,</hi> a Man very expert in Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. He ask'd whether he knew any remedy in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56140:36"/>
that imminent danger. The Slave repli'd, <hi>If you will take my advice, with the help of God, I yet ſee one way to ſave the Lives of all that are here, but the Ship will be broken to pieces.</hi> What is to be done to ſave our Lives, ſays the Maſter? <hi>We muſt,</hi> repli'd he, <hi>make ready the Bow-ſprit Sail, to the end it may be in a moment ſet before the VVind, and we muſt turn the Ship that ſhe may run upon the Sands,</hi> (ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place to which he would have her directed, about a Musket-ſhot from us) <hi>otherwiſe the wind will force us upon that Rock, and will break the Ship into a thouſand pieces.</hi> This advice was approv'd, and the Sail was prepar'd, as he had ordered.</p>
            <p>This was done about noon, the Tempeſt ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing. Which the ſuperſtitious <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving, they ſaid their <hi>Sala</hi> with the accuſtomed Ceremonies, making vows to beſtow Alms as ſoon as they came aſhore. But no miracle appearing, they reſolv'd to offer a Sacrifice to their Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which is the laſt refuge of the <hi>Turks,</hi> when they are in danger at Sea: And is done thus. They take alive Sheep, (for which reaſon they always have ſome aboard to be us'd upon ſuch occaſions) and if there chance to be any one among them who hath been at <hi>Meca,</hi> to viſit the place where the Body of their Prophet is, he with many Prayers and ridiculous Ceremonies cuts the Sheep alive into four quarters, and caſts them over-board on the four ſides of the Ship.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56140:37"/>
was to ſee us ſafely Lodg'd, ſhut us up as he was wont. We deſir'd him, that in caſe the Ship ſhould run a-ground, he would let us out, that every one might ſhift for himſelf, and ſave his Life if he could; which he promis'd to do. Accordingly at mid-night, the Moon being juſt in the full, the Cable of our great Anchor broke, and the two others had loſt their hold, in regard they had not above fifteen fathom of Cable, and were dragg'd after the Ship. We all that were in the Prow prepar'd our ſelves for Death; but the <hi>Turk</hi> kept his promiſe, and opening the Hatch, ſaid to us, <hi>Chriſtians, come all up, that we may all Dye together.</hi> We could not come out otherwiſe than one after another, which caus'd a great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for every one endeavour'd to get out firſt.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I was got up on the Deck, me-thought I ſaw a repreſentation of the laſt judgement.

Nay, I may ſay, the moſt wicked perſon among us ſeem'd then to be very devout. We continu'd in this perplexity and confuſion a good ſpace.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56140:37"/>
with the Prow towards the Land with an incredible force and ſwiftneſs. <hi>Hans Maurus</hi> cried out in Dutch, <hi>Take heed of the Maſt, I fear me it will fall.</hi> But nothing fell, ſave only ten or twelve <hi>Turks,</hi> who tumbled off the Deck into the Sea. But the wind forcing the Sea with ſo much violence to the Shore, thoſe who fell into the water, were by its means im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately forc'd to the Land. All this happen'd in leſs time than a Man could have ſaid a <hi>Miſerere,</hi> and the Ship running a-ground burſt, and moſt of thoſe who were in it leap'd into the Sea, fearing the Ship might cleave aſunder. For my part, perceiving that the Ship leaned on one ſide towards the Shore, that is, the ſide on which all leap'd into the Sea, I was afraid it might fall by reaſon of its continual agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo thought it not ſafe to ſtay any longer on the Deck. And whereas the Ship was built after the <hi>Italian</hi> way, like the Veſſels called <hi>Pollaces,</hi> which have little Rooms jetting out, as the Galleys have, I went into one of thoſe, and thence leap'd into the Sea, where it happen'd to be ſo ſhallow that I had ground, but could not continue long in the ſame place, by reaſon of the agitation of the Sea; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>rom <hi>Algiers.</hi> I found him among a company of Chriſtian-Slaves, Turks, and Jews, who ſtood as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56140:38"/>
cloſe as they could one to another, to get themſelves a heat. For being wet, we were almoſt ſtarv'd to death. Thoſe who had eſcap'd were numbred, and there were above twenty wanting; but by degrees they came together to the main body, all but two, to wit, a young Lad, a Jew, who was drunk, and a Turk, who was half-diſtracted. We were now out of all Sea-danger, but not out of that of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who were very numerous all along that Coaſt. Nay, if they had had any tidings of our misfortune, and that the Ship would have run-a-ground, they would have been there in great numbers, to make a prey of all they could meet with, and to kill us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mercy; but our Maſter immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd away two Turks, who knew the way to <hi>Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> about a league and a half thence, and they gave notice to the Governor of our misfortune, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd his aſſiſtance againſt the Barbarians.</p>
            <p>We continu'd all this time in the cold; but one of the Turks, who took Tobacco having a little Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-box about him, we made a ſhift, with ſticks, Barrel-ſtaves and ſuch things as the Sea had caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, to make a fire. We paſs'd away the night the beſt we could; and at the break of day the Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſtood at a diſtance to ſee whether there were any thing to be ſtollen; but we being about 70. perſons, they durſt not come neer us. Beſides it was not long ere they came from <hi>Tituan</hi> a party of horſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the goods we had ſav'd to the City. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor came alſo in perſon attended by twenty horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men arm'd after the <hi>African</hi> mode, with long Lances.</p>
            <p>The Turk who was to conduct us hir'd a horſe for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56140:38"/>
himſelf and his baggage, that is, what he could make a ſhift to ſave. For the Tempeſt beginning to abate about the break of day, what belong'd to the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers was taken out of the Ship; and moſt of the goods were ſav'd, but wet and ſpoil'd. When they went in the morning into the Ship, to get out the goods, they found the Turk <hi>Alli,</hi> whom we gave over for drown'd. He was got into the Cabin at the Stern, where he had met with the Maſter's bottle of Brandy, and had made himſelf drunk, and ſo knew nothing of the paſt danger.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Caloën</hi> and I hir'd a horſe for us both, and we got about noon to <hi>Tituan.</hi> The Jew who was with us got us a lodging, for our money, in the Quarter where the Jews inhabited. After we had been two days at <hi>Tituan,</hi> there went thence a <hi>Cafila</hi> (that is, a great number of perſons travelling together) to <hi>Centa,</hi> along with whom there went alſo two Moors, perſons of quality, who were going to <hi>Ceuta,</hi> to remain there as Hoſtages, that the Fathers employ'd about the redemption of Captives (who were then come to <hi>Ceuta</hi>) might remove thence the more ſafely to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan,</hi> to treat with the Governor about the ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of certain Chriſtian Slaves. We were glad of that opportunity to write to our Companion <hi>Saldens,</hi> who ſhould be, as we thought, at <hi>Ceuta</hi> with the five Turks. For it happens ſometimes that when there is any difference between the Governors of thoſe two places, there is no correſpondence between them for two or three months together.</p>
            <p>With this <hi>Cafila,</hi> we writ to <hi>Ceuta,</hi> thinking <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> had been there becauſe he had written thence to us, and two days after the <hi>Cafila</hi> return'd with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56140:39"/>
two Fathers of the Order of the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity.</hi> Their arrival caus'd great rejoycing, as well among the Chriſtian Slaves as the Citizens; for the former were in hopes of obtaining their liberty, the latter of receiving money. We went immediately to ſalute the Fathers, who deliver'd us a Letter written from <hi>Ceuta,</hi> by a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentleman named <hi>Dom Martin de Pegnaloſa.</hi> The Letter was to this effect,
<q>Your Companion <hi>Renier Saldens,</hi> weary of ſtaying here, is gone to <hi>Gibraltar</hi> to recreate himſelf, but hath left me order to ſupply you with all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and whereas I find by your Letter, that you would have two hundred Patacoons return'd to you, I give order to a Mooriſh Merchant named <hi>Alli Tigarino,</hi> to furniſh you with the ſaid ſum, and the ſame Merchant will be engag'd for you, that you may remain in the City, and not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to go into the <hi>Maſmora,</hi> (the <hi>Maſmora</hi> is a priſon under ground) and I will immediately write to <hi>Renier Saldens,</hi> that he may return hither, to compleat the exchange of the five Turks, (who thanks be to God are all well) for you two.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This news extreamly ſatisfy'd us; but we had already forgotten, that there is no great diſtance between mirth and ſorrow. The five Turks walk'd the Streets of <hi>Ceuta</hi> upon the engagement of the two Merchants, Moors, whoſe ordinary reſidence was at <hi>Ceuta.</hi> In the mean time, though our Companion <hi>Saldens</hi> was gone but to <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> yet <hi>Mustapha Ingles</hi> imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was return'd into <hi>Flanders,</hi> or gone to ſome part of <hi>Spain</hi> far thence, writ a Letter to <hi>Tituan</hi> to the Turk who kept us, that <hi>Renier Saldens</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56140:39"/>
at his being in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to contribute ſeven hundred Patacoons, towards the ranſom which his Relations had paid for M. <hi>Caloën,</hi> and that he ſhould put us into the <hi>Maſmora,</hi> till ſuch time as we had promis'd to pay that ſum. The contriver of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was <hi>Hibraim Arrais,</hi> one of the five Turks, who gave out at <hi>Ceuta,</hi> that M. <hi>Caloën</hi> and I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd the ſeven hundred Patacoons before our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Algiers.</hi> The Turk who kept us ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving receiv'd this letter communicated it to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents of <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s friends, who thought it fit that we ſhould be put into the <hi>Maſmora,</hi> as well to ſee whether they might get the ſeven hundred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacoons, as to ſhew their readineſs to ſerve <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi>'s friends. The Turk came and gave us an account what had been reſolv'd, telling us it was no fault of his. And thereupon he conducted us to the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Maſmora</hi> is a Vault thirty foot under ground divided into three partitions. The greateſt of the three is about twenty eight foot in length, and twenty four in breadth; the two others are leſs. And there were commonly detain'd there an hundred and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Chriſtian Slaves. This priſon hath no other light than that of three gates which are above in the mid'ſt of the Street, and at each of theſe grates there is a hook faſten'd to a Line; and when in the day time any Chriſtians paſs by, they charitably bring water to the poor Slaves; or if they have money, they buy ſomewhat for them; and the hook and line ſerve to let down what they would give them. The Jaylor or Keeper of this priſon ſuffers not any body to come in without giving him ſomething. There is no Privy in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56140:40"/>
it, but the priſoners and Slaves uſe pots as they do in <hi>Spain,</hi> and thoſe pots are hung about the Walls, and ſo ſerve both for Tapiſtry and perfume. Beſides they are not to be empty'd till night, and then an Officer opens one of the grates, and they are drawn up by the hook. And for every pot that is empty'd, there muſt be paid a <hi>Bobe,</hi> that is about half a farthing, which methinks is a great cruelty, and yet all thoſe who are put into that miſerable priſon, are forc'd to lye on the ground, unleſs they are permitted to hang up Hammocks made of Cords againſt the Walls, as they do in Ships. But there are ſo many people, and the place is ſo ſtreight, that the poor Slaves are forc'd to crow'd together, and lye like ſo many Herrings. Thence it comes that in the Summer time eſpecially, there is ſuch abundance of Vermine, and ſo much other naſtineſs, that it is as troubleſome being there as rowing in the Gallies. It was our fortune to be there in Winter. But what troubled us moſt was, that in the night time, when all were laid in their places, ſome lewd Boys, Moors, to vex the poor Chriſtians, would caſt in filth, ſtones, water, and other things through the grates. This happen'd ſome nights three or four times, and that alarm oblig'd all who lay neer the grates to riſe; for all lying on the ground, he who roſe not preſently was in danger of being trampled under-foot by his companions, the floor being all cover'd with bodies.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Caloën</hi> and I lay in a hole, ſo that we were not oblig'd to riſe at that alarm. That favour was done us by a Knight of St. <hi>James</hi>'s, a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> named <hi>Dom Geronimo de Figuroa,</hi> born at <hi>Corduba,</hi> and a Slave, who was very kind to us. He told us that he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56140:40"/>
took his diet in the <hi>Maſmora,</hi> with four other Slaves, at ten (ſimple) Ryals a month; whereupon M. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loën</hi> and I deſir'd to be admitted among them at the ſame rate, and I muſt confeſs we were well treated, as Slaves, having as much meat as Nature requir'd, and a cloath laid on our table. Our Hoſt was a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who had been thirteen years in that priſon, getting his livelihood by that way, and yet, among the one hundred and ſeventy Slaves, there were but five, who could be treated at that rate.</p>
            <p>While we were in this miſery, our Companion <hi>Saldens</hi> returns to <hi>Ceuta,</hi> where he receiv'd one of my Letters, wherein I gave him an account of all that paſs'd, and that we were in the <hi>Maſmora,</hi> upon order from the five Turks at <hi>Ceuta</hi> to the Turk who kept us, to put us there, till we promis'd to give the ſeven hundred Patacoons, which he had promis'd in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as the ſame Turks affirmed. And to ſhew that M. <hi>Caloën</hi> and I had promis'd nothing as to that ſum, as they gave out at <hi>Ceuta,</hi> I ſent him alſo a Letter written in the Turkiſh language, by the Turk who kept us, wherein he acknowledg'd, that we had promis'd him onely twenty five Patacoons for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to pay for our paſſage from <hi>Algiers</hi> to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan.</hi> The Turk gave me the Letter unſeal'd, and I writ a Poſt-ſcript to <hi>Saldens,</hi> that he ſhould cauſe the five Turks to be chain'd and put into the <hi>Maſmora</hi> at <hi>Ceuta,</hi> which is a more inconvenient place then that of <hi>Tituan,</hi> as being under an Oven, which cauſes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable heat.</p>
            <p>The Fathers employ'd about the redemption of Captives, whom I ſpoke of before, return'd to <hi>Ceuta,</hi> without redeeming ſo much as one Chriſtian.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56140:41"/>
The reaſon was, that they could not agree with the Governor of <hi>Tituan</hi>; for the ordinary way of agreeing is, to pay a third part in money, and the other two thirds in commodities, whereof there are patterns ſhewn. The difference was, that the Governor would not take the commodities at the rate ſet upon them by the Fathers. Beſides he would have oblig'd the Fathers in the firſt place to redeem thirty Slaves belonging to himſelf, at the rate of two hundred Duckets a piece. Which the Fathers would by no means condeſcend unto, in regard that all thoſe Slaves were either <hi>Portuguez</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſaid, not without reaſon, <hi>As long as there are any</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Slaves, we cannot redeem thoſe of other Nations; inſomuch as the Alms we bring were given in</hi> Spain <hi>for the redemption of</hi> Spaniards, <hi>and it is but reaſon that they ſhould be preferr'd before others.</hi> Hence it came that the Fathers return'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any thing.</p>
            <p>I gave my Letter to a free Chriſtian who went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the Fathers to <hi>Ceuta,</hi> deſiring him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it to <hi>Saldens</hi> himſelf; which he did, telling him, he had left us the day before in the <hi>Maſmora</hi> at <hi>Tituan,</hi> whereat <hi>Saldens</hi> was extreamly incens'd. He immediately order'd the five Turks to be brought to the <hi>Maſmora</hi> at <hi>Ceuta,</hi> and being at the entrance of it, he ſaid to the Captain <hi>Hibraim Arrais,</hi> who was one of the five, <hi>Pilla Baſſo,</hi> that is in <hi>Lingua Franca, Lay him down on the ground, and let four hold his arms and leggs, that he may be cudgell'd over the back and buttocks:</hi> For <hi>Saldens</hi> had a cudgel ready in his hand; having learnt that kind of juſtice when he was with us at <hi>Algiers. Hibraim Arrais</hi> began to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56140:41"/>
put off his cloaths, weeping, and giving all the fair words he could, and the other four Turks ſhook like an Aſpen leaf, fearing the ſame Treatment. All that paſs'd by (for this was done in the Streets) made a halt to ſee the end of the Tragedy. Among other ſpectators, two Turkiſh Merchants, who chanc'd to be at <hi>Ceuta</hi> about their commerce, paſſing by the place, ſaid to <hi>Saldens, What would you do with theſe Slaves, are they not unfortunate enough to be Slaves, but they muſt alſo be beaten? Salden</hi> being extreamly incens'd, made anſwer, <hi>I will cudgel two or three of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Traytors to death, I have ſuffered them to walk freely up and down the City, and yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that kindneſs, they have caus'd my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be put into the</hi> Maſmora <hi>at</hi> Tituan, (<hi>though they had given good ſecurity) where they are at this preſent in miſery, and theſe Dogs walk up and down the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty where they pleaſe, and they have written a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand lyes to</hi> Tituan, <hi>to Trapan us out of our money by their malicious inventions, contrary to all right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon that the two Merchants ſpoke to the five Turks in their own language, and after their diſcourſe was ended, they ſaid to <hi>Saldens, Forbear beating theſe Slaves, and we will put in ſecurity here that your Companions ſhall come out of the</hi> Maſmora, <hi>and be brought hither with the firſt</hi> Cafila. <hi>We will write to morrow for their delivery out of the</hi> Maſmora. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> ſeem'd to be ſatisfy'd with what was propos'd, yet would fain have given them a beating. But upon the intreaties of ſome Captain's of the Garriſon, he was perſwaded to go along with the two Merchants to the Governor, who then was the Marqueſſe of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa,</hi> and <hi>Saldens</hi> and the two Turkes alledged
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56140:42"/>
their reaſons. After he had heard both parties, and brought them to an agreement, he write a Letter to this effect to the Governor of <hi>Tituan.</hi>
               <q>Send me along with the firſt <hi>Cafila</hi> two Chriſtians, named <hi>John Baptiſt Caloën,</hi> and <hi>Emanuel d' Aranda,</hi> and I promiſe you upon the word and faith of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and Knight, that aſſoon as thoſe Chriſtians ſhall come to the gate of <hi>Ceuta,</hi> I will ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the five Turks, named <hi>Muſtapha Ingles, Hibraim Arrais, Alli Tagarino, Rhodes Muſtapha,</hi> and <hi>Muſtapha Oiga.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There liv'd at <hi>Ceuta</hi> a Jew, a man of great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for his wealth, who undertook to accommodate (or rather over-reach both ſides) the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fathers before-mentioned and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Tituan,</hi> whether he was to go the next day. The Marqueſſe's Letter was given to him, with order to deliver it to the Governor of <hi>Tituan</hi> himſelf, which he did the next day. In the evening, we were let out of the <hi>Maſmora,</hi> with permiſſion to walk within and without the City, as we pleas'd our ſelves. We went immediately to our Chamber in the Jews Quarter, which had been kept during our abſence by the Turk who had the over-ſight of us. What happen'd in the <hi>Maſmora,</hi> during the time of our being confin'd there may be ſeen in the VII. and XIII. of the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Relations.</p>
            <p>We walk'd up and down with the <hi>Turk</hi> who kept us, in expectation of the <hi>Cafila</hi> from <hi>Ceuta,</hi> having bought us each a white Cloak, ſuch as in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Country are called <hi>Albornos,</hi> and a red Cap, garments befitting <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who had newly recover'd their Liberty. Moſt of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slaves
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56140:42"/>
gave us Letters to be ſent to their Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The <hi>Jew</hi> who mediated between the Fathers for the Redemption of Captives, and the Governour of <hi>Tituan</hi> having compos'd the difference, (or to ſay better over-reach both) was to return the next day, which was the 23 of <hi>March,</hi> 1642. We took two hackney Horſes of a <hi>Moor</hi> who was to go with the ſame <hi>Cafila</hi> to <hi>Ceuta:</hi> And got a couple of Pullets made ready, and a large bottle of Wine, to refreſh our ſelves by the way.</p>
            <p>We left <hi>Tituan,</hi> accompani'd by the Knight <hi>Philip de Cherf,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slaves our friends to a place within a quarter of a league to the City, where all who went along with the <hi>Cafila</hi> were to meet. We took leave of ſuch as came along with us, who were much dejected that they were ſtill to continue in that miſerable ſtate of Slavery. We got that evening about two Leagues, all along a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion Country, which from that place to <hi>Ceuta</hi> is neither cultivated nor inhabited, but abſolutely deſert, though the ſoil be fertile enough. We alighted in the open fields, and having unloaden the Mules, three or four Turks with their Cutlaſſes cut down good ſtore of Wood, and made a fire. For the nights in that Country, as well as in <hi>Spain</hi> are very cold in <hi>March.</hi> All ſetled themſelves about the fire, and eat what they brought with them. We intreated ſome of the chiefeſt Turks to participate of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, but they would have excus'd themſelves, ſaying that the Pullets had been kill'd by ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and that therefore they could not eat thereof. I was fain to ſwear that a Turk had kill'd them; which was true, for we had brought the Pullets purpoſely
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56140:43"/>
to treat them by the way. Had they been Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of <hi>Algiers,</hi> they would not have been ſo ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous. Having ſupp'd well, we lay down by the fire to ſleep.</p>
            <p>The next day an hour before Sun-riſing we took our way towards <hi>Ceuta,</hi> and from the place where we had quarter'd the night before to <hi>Ceuta,</hi> we met not with any perſon, nor any ſign that men had ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited that way, ſave onely the ruines of a houſe. In our way, a Turk, who was on Horſe-back, having a fire-lock kill'd a wild Boar; but in regard the Turks are not permitted to eat thereof, M. <hi>Caloën</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd them two Patacoons if they would bring him to the City for us; which they did, cutting it him into quarters, and putting them on the Mules. When the <hi>Cafila</hi> comes within a league of <hi>Ceuta,</hi> it muſt take a certain way that it may be diſcover'd by the Sentinels of the City; and the very coming that way ſignifies friends. When we were got within two Musket-ſhots of the City, a Moor ſaid to M. <hi>Caloën</hi> and me, <hi>Chriſtians, ſtay here, I have order to keep you here, till the five Turks are come hither alſo.</hi> There was no reply to be made; I gave my Prayer-Book to a Jew, who was going to the City, to ſerve for a ſignal to <hi>Saldens,</hi> that he might know we were there, expecting admiſſion into the City. This was about nine in the morning, and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd there till three in the afternoon, there being no perſon with us but the Moor who guarded us, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly expecting the five Turks. We could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what might be the reaſon of their ſtay. But between three and four we ſaw the gate opened, and the Draw-bridge let down; and there came out ſome
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56140:43"/>
thirty Horſe-men arm'd with Lances and Bucklers of Leather, which in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> are called <hi>Adargas,</hi> and one of the party better mounted than the reſt, rode a good way into the Country, as it were to make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. Then he put up his Bonnet on the top of the Lance, as a ſignal that there were no Ambuſcadoes. Thoſe of the party having ſeen that ſignal divided themſelves into divers leſſer parties, and planted themſelves upon ſome of the avenues. The Leader of that Party wiſh'd us happineſs with our Liberty, and told us, that our Companion was talking with the Governor concerning our entrance into the City. While I was ſpeaking with the Captain, I ſaw coming out of the City a Company of Foot, about one hundred and fifty men in number, which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany drew up into a little Batallion, between the Horſe and the City. After that I ſaw coming out about a hundred Slaves, Turks, and Moors, every one loaden with two heavy Iron Chains, with a great Pot on his Back, and they came between the Body of Foot and the City to fetch Spring-water in their Pots. And this was done twice or thrice a week with the ſame vigilance, as well out of a fear of being ſurpris'd by the Barbarians, as of looſing their Slaves.</p>
            <p>Having obſerv'd all that paſs'd, we wondred much that <hi>Saldens</hi> ſtaid ſo long. The reaſon was, that the Governor of <hi>Ceuta</hi> by his letter before-mentioned had promis'd the Governour of <hi>Tituan,</hi> to ſet the five Turks at liberty as ſoon as we were come to the Gates of <hi>Ceuta,</hi> which he durſt not do at that time, in regard it was publickly known at <hi>Ceuta,</hi> that a Ship was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected there from <hi>Tangiers.</hi> And if thoſe five Turks
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56140:44"/>
had then been permitted to go for <hi>Tituan,</hi> no doubt they would have given notice of it to the Pyrats of that City, and ſo the Ship might run the hazard of being taken. On the other ſide, we were in great hazard and danger, either to be forc'd to return to <hi>Tituan,</hi> or remain without the City to be a prey to the Barbarians, who many times come within reach of the Canon of the City. But our Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Saldens</hi> manag'd the buſineſs ſo well with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of <hi>Dom Martin de Pegnaloſa,</hi> that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor having ſent for the five Turks, ſaid to them. <hi>'Tis true, I have engag'd my word to the Governor of</hi> Tituan, <hi>that I would ſet you five at liberty aſſoon as the two Christians ſhould come to the gates of this City; and now that they are come, I neither can nor dare ſet you at liberty according to my promiſe, becauſe you know there is expected here a Ship richly loaden from</hi> Tangiers. <hi>But to ſhew you that I am a perſon tender of my word, the two Chriſtians ſhall return back again to</hi> Tituan, <hi>or they ſhall remain without the City, till the ſaid Ship be come in. But if you are content that the two Chriſtians ſhall come into the City, I promiſe you upon the word of a Knight, that aſſoon as this Ship ſhall come in, I will permit you to depart, and in the mean time I declare you from this preſent free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Turkes accepted of this condition, confiding in the promiſes of the Governor, yet thought they fit to draw up a little writing of it. Whereupon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four in the afternoon <hi>Saldens</hi> ſent us word that he would come and meet us, but that he was firſt to ſpeak to the Governor. About half an hour after he came, accompany'd by <hi>Dom Martin de Pegnaloſa,</hi> who kindly aſſiſted him in all his affairs. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56140:44"/>
to expreſs the joy and ſatisfaction of his meeting with our Companion after whom we had languiſh'd ſo long. After mutual embraces, all preſent wiſh'd us happineſs with our liberty. VVe made our entrance together into <hi>Ceuta,</hi> more content then the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors when they return'd in triumph to the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> We went to kiſs the Governor's hand, preſenting him with the head of the wild Boar which had been kill'd by the way; and as we came out of his Palace, the five Turks came to welcome us: They went along with us to our Inn, where we treated them, and we mutually related to each other our paſt adventures. Then was it that there paſs'd among us three, the greateſt ſatisfaction and enjoyments, that ever we had, or ever ſhall have in our lives.</p>
            <p>But, as I ſaid ſeveral times before, an exceſſive mirth will ſoon meet with ſome check or other; our Companion <hi>Saldens</hi> began to relate unto us, how that one of the five Turks being in priſon at <hi>Bruges</hi> had embrac'd the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion. We fell into a conſultation what we ſhould do upon that conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. For if we diſcover'd that he was become a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> the Governor could not permit him to depart. And whereas he had engag'd his word to the Governor of <hi>Tituan,</hi> that he would ſet them all at liberty, no doubt he would have ſent us back thither. For he was a perſon underſtood himſelf very well, as to what he was oblig'd to, when he had paſs'd his word to a <hi>Mahometane</hi> Governor; and he laugh'd at thoſe, who taught, that a man is not oblig'd to keep his word with people of another Religion or Sect. To ſuffer him to go, knowing he was a Chriſtian, went againſt our Conſcience. We advis'd with an old
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56140:45"/>
Cavalier, who was better acquainted with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Turks, then he, who, out of zeal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prudence, had converted that Turk. His advice was, that <hi>Saldens</hi> ſhould ſpeak alone to the Turk, and that his diſcourſe ſhould be to this purpoſe. <hi>Alli</hi> (ſo was his Name) <hi>you know that you embrac'd the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion in</hi> Flanders, <hi>what is now your intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> In caſe he reply, <hi>I am a Chriſtian, and I will continue in the Chriſtian Apoſtolick and Roman Faith</hi>: Then <hi>Saldens</hi> ſhall ſay to him, <hi>Go to the Governor, and tell him that you are a Chriſtian, and that you will ſtay here; and go and ſay the ſame thing to your four Companions.</hi> Then the Governor, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Companions, will ask him, whether he will return into his Country. If he anſwers, that he will not, and if he ſay that he is a Chriſtian, he ſhall ſtay, and the Governor ſhall be diſcharg'd. <hi>Saldens</hi> put this advice in execution, but <hi>Alli</hi> made anſwer that he would return into his Country. Whereupon we engag'd our ſelves no further in the buſineſs.</p>

            <p>The day after our arrival we went all three to the great Church at <hi>Ceuta,</hi> to do our devotions. This Church is called, <hi>Our Lady's Church of Africk,</hi> and it is the Metropolitane Church. We kiſs'd the Biſhop's hand, who was a devout old Man, and all his train conſiſted of one <hi>Negro</hi>-Slave. He ask'd us whether we were <hi>Christians</hi> (he meant <hi>Catholicks</hi>) We anſwer'd that we were <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and ſubjects of his Majeſty of <hi>Spain.</hi> Upon this anſwer the good Biſhop gave us his benediction. We ſtaid at <hi>Ceuta</hi> eight days, intending to go to <hi>Gibraltar</hi> with a Brigantine well arm'd; for that paſſage is very dangerous. This Brigantine had fifteen banks, and on every bank two Souldiers to Row, who had their Arms lying ready by them. In four hours, we paſs'd from <hi>Africk</hi> to <hi>Europe,</hi> not without great fear of being once more taken by the Turks, for I knew thoſe Souldiers were as good Sea-men, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:56140:46"/>
Maſter, when we were taken, ſhew'd himſelf a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Souldier.</p>
            <p>We came to <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and ſtay'd there three days, and went to do our devotions at a Chappel a quarter of a league without the City, and directly where the diſtance is leaſt between <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> called <hi>Our Lady's Chappel of Europe,</hi> a place much frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all thoſe who have friends and Relations in Slavery. VVe went from <hi>Gibraltar</hi> on Horſe-back for <hi>Cadiz,</hi> which is two days journey. M. <hi>Caloën</hi> and I were in our white cloaks and red caps; whence it came that in our way, and at all the Villages where we alighted, all thoſe who had any friends in Slavery came to ſee us, to know whether we had any Letters or news from them. Being at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> we got us cloaths made us after the Chriſtian mode, and thence we went to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where we ſtaid two months all three together.</p>
            <p>Some days after, <hi>Saldens</hi> went away with his old Maſter, the Marqueſs of <hi>Solero,</hi> for the Army of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and M. <hi>Caloën</hi> and I came to St. <hi>Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s in <hi>Biſcay,</hi> and travell'd without any Paſs through all <hi>France,</hi> truſting to an Atteſtation we had from the Fathers employ'd about the Redemption of Captives, certifying that we came out of Slavery. But where we had no occaſion to ſhew the Atteſtation, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Being come to <hi>Paris,</hi> we were inform'd that at <hi>Dieppe,</hi> as alſo at <hi>Callice,</hi> the Governors very ſtrictly examin'd Strangers, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as would croſs over into <hi>England.</hi> To avoid this examination we took Shipping at <hi>Rovën</hi> in a <hi>Hamburgher,</hi> bound for <hi>Scotland.</hi> Being at Sea, we told the Maſter that we would gladly ſee <hi>England,</hi> and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56140:46"/>
that if he would ſet us aſhoar neer <hi>Dover,</hi> we would give the Boats-crue ſomewhat to drink. VVe were accordingly landed within half a league of <hi>Dover,</hi> whither we went afoot. And the next day we paſs'd over with the Packet-boat to <hi>Dunkirk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, after divers traverſes of fortune and ſtrange adventures, I came to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> reflecting on the hardſhip, the dangers, the vain hopes, the happineſſes, the misfortunes, and a thouſand other accidents which I had run through, during the time of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy travels, wherein I was much troubled in body, but much more afflicted in mind. I leave it to the Reader, to imagine what ſatisfaction it was to me, to ſee the Steeples and other Structures of my dear Country, where I had wiſh'd my ſelf a thouſand and a thouſand times, repreſenting to my ſelf the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful interview of my dear friends, and particularly my indulgent Mother, from whom, my Brothers and Siſters, for important reaſons, had till that time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd my Captivity, and other misfortunes, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her ſometimes that I was ſick, ſometimes that other accidents, yet ſuch as were probable, had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to me. Amidſt theſe reflections, on the 20. day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1642. I came to the City of <hi>Bruges,</hi> rendring moſt humble thanks to God, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me, through ſo many dangers by Sea and Land, to the gates of the City where I drew my firſt breath, and gave me the time and convenience to praiſe his glorious Mother the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom all Chriſtians ought to invocate as the <hi>Comforter of the afflicted.</hi> But for my part, I ſhall, for many reaſons, acknowledge all the days of my life, that I am parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly oblig'd to honor her, to ſerve her, and to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56140:47"/>
render her all poſſible thanks, as a Chriſtian ought to do to the common Mother of all Chriſtians. And in the next place, according to the commandment of God, to honour my natural Mother, whom I found in health with my Brothers and Siſters. The content and joy we had at our meeting, I omit as being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expreſſion. But what I have ſaid elſewhere, to wit, that mourning and ſorrow are the neer atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of joy and ſatisfaction, may be further ſeen here alſo; for ſome few days after my return, my Brother-in-law, and dear Mother ended their days, to whom I wiſh eternal reſt; laying aſide my Pen, to acknowledge the pains the Reader hath taken in peruſing my Adventures.</p>

            <head>A SHORT ACCOUNT Of the ANTIQUITY Of the City of ALGIERS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He City of <hi>Algiers</hi> is ſcituated in a Province of <hi>Africk,</hi> anciently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Mauritania Caeſarienſis,</hi> on the ſide of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea. Its elevation is at 37. degrees. It is not known who were the Founders of this City, for what is conjecturable ſeems fabulous. But whta's moſt certain, is, that <hi>Strabo,</hi> a creditable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, ſpeaking of <hi>Mauritania Caeſarienſis,</hi> ſays, that on the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> there was a City called <hi>Jol,</hi> which was rebuilt by <hi>Juba,</hi> the Father of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:56140:48"/>
who chang'd the name of <hi>Jol</hi> into <hi>Jol-Caeſaria</hi>; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming further, that the ſaid City had a little Iſland before the Port, at the 37. degree of Elevation. Whence it may be inferr'd, that he ſpeaks of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers</hi>; inaſmuch as there is no City on the Coaſt of <hi>Africk</hi> at the 37. degree, which hath a little Iſland before the Port, but this.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerv'd, that we ſpeak here of young <hi>Juba,</hi> Son of King <hi>Juba</hi> the firſt of that name, and Nephew or Grand-child to that great <hi>Boncho</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> This <hi>Juba,</hi> of whom I ſpeak, was taken in the Battel, wherein the forces of <hi>Pompey,</hi> being retreated out of <hi>Africk,</hi> were defeated by the <hi>Caeſarian</hi> Party.

            <p>Whence it may eaſily be conjectur'd, that this City
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56140:48"/>
was in that time a place of great account, ſince <hi>Juba</hi> made choice of it among all thoſe of his Kingdome, to eterniſe the name of that glorious Prince <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar,</hi> ſince he Re-built it, and kept his Court there, as <hi>Pliny</hi> affirms, lib. 5. ch. 2. After <hi>Juba</hi>'s Death, <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> his Son, ſucceeded him in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Kingdome: But the Emperour <hi>Caligula</hi> caus'd him to be Kill'd, and by that means, became Maſter of all thoſe Kingdoms, dividing them into two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, calling the one <hi>Mauritania Tingitenſis,</hi> from the name of the City <hi>Tingis,</hi> now called <hi>Tangiers,</hi> according to <hi>Suetonius,</hi> lib. 2. making that City the Metropolis of <hi>Mauritania Tingitenſis</hi>; and calling the other part <hi>Mauritania Caeſariana,</hi> taking that name from <hi>Jol-Caeſaria,</hi> inaſmuch as that City was the Metropolis of that great Province. In that met the Aſſembly which the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Conventus Provinciarum,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Governours kept their Reſidence there. The Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Caligula</hi> inrich'd that City with <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies, with the ſame freedome and priviledges as the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> then had.</p>

For the Sea ſtrikes againſt the Walls of it, and a little Iſland, diſtant from the City about a Bow-ſhot, ſerves for a Port to it. The Fortifications
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56140:49"/>
in that time were very good, and the Soil very fertil, by reaſon of a great many Springs which water the Gardens. Whence it came, that this City never wanted Citizens. The change of the name of <hi>Jol-Caeſaria</hi> was caus'd by the <hi>Alarbes,</hi> who conquer'd <hi>Africk</hi>; for they call'd it, as indeed they do at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>Algezir,</hi> which ſignifies an <hi>Iſland,</hi> inaſmuch as there is a little Iſland before the City, as if they meant by <hi>Algezir,</hi> the City of the Iſland. But in regard Foreiners cannot well pronounce the word <hi>Algezir,</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> call it <hi>Argil,</hi> the <hi>French Alger,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> commonly <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Alarbes</hi> were abſolute Maſters of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi> and had made a diviſion of all the Provinces, <hi>Mauritania Caeſarienſis</hi> fell to the King of <hi>Tremeſen,</hi> to whom thoſe of <hi>Algiers</hi> paid tribute a long time, till one <hi>Albuferiz</hi> a very powerful King of <hi>Tunis</hi> became Maſter of the City of <hi>Bugy,</hi> forcing even the King of <hi>Tremeſen</hi> to be his Tributary.

               <p>The City of <hi>Oran</hi> being reduc'd in the year 1509. as we ſaid before, King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſent a powerful Fleet to deſtroy the City of <hi>Algiers,</hi> with all Pyrats belonging to it, and to clear the Sea of that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nation.

As long as that great Monarch liv'd, thoſe of <hi>Algiers</hi> paid their Tribute, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently endur'd the inconvenience of that Fort, not preſuming ſo much as to Mutter, till the Death of that King, which happen'd in the year 1516.</p>
               <p>Upon his Death, they reſolv'd to rid their hands of their Neighbours the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as alſo of the Fort, that they might pay no more Tribute to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> In order to the execution of their deſign, they ſent to <hi>Aruch Barberoſſa,</hi> who was then at <hi>Higir,</hi> a place ſeated on the ſide of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, diſtant from <hi>Algiers,</hi> Eaſt-ward, an hundred and eighty <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> miles, intreating him, as a valiant Souldier (for he was famous at that time for his Victories) to make all the haſte he could to <hi>Algiers,</hi> with his <hi>Turks</hi> and Galleys, to deliver them out of the hands of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who much incommodated them by that Fort, promiſing to recompence him nobly for his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To compaſs this deſign without any popular tumult, one day about noon, as <hi>Selim Eutemi</hi> was going into the Bath of his Palace, to waſh, before the ſaying of the <hi>Sala,</hi> or mid-day prayer (as the Turks and Moors, according to the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> are wont to do) <hi>Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſa,</hi> who was lodg'd in the ſame Palace, entred ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly into the Bath, attended by ſome of his people; and finding the Prince alone, naked, and without any Arms, he ſtrangled him, and retiring ſecretly out of the Bath, left the body on the place. A quarter of an hour after, returning publickly to the Bath, and ſeeming aſtoniſh'd to ſee the Corps of his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer, he call'd his Servants, and told them their Maſter had dy'd in a Swound. This was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divulg'd; but the Citizens having already had ſome experience of the cruel diſpoſition of <hi>Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſa,</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:56140:52"/>
imagining him to be the Author of their Lord's death, went every one to his own houſe, fearing ſome tumult or maſſacre. On the other ſide, the Turks having already had notice of what had paſs'd, appear'd armed in the Streets, and with the aſſiſtance of ſome Moors conducted <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> on Horſe-back through the principal Streets of the City, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd him King of <hi>Algiers,</hi> without any oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selim Eutemi</hi>'s Son, fearing <hi>Barberoſſa</hi>'s tyranny, aſſiſted by his Menial Servants, retir'd to <hi>Oran,</hi> where he was receiv'd by the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The Tyrant being thus proclaim'd King by his Soldiers, ſummon'd the wealthieſt Citizens to appear before him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd them great priviledges, if they would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him abſolute King. Which they did, rather forc'd thereto, then otherwiſe. He immediately began to Coin mony, to fortifie the <hi>Alcazar</hi> (one of the Fortreſſe's of the City) where he put good ſtore of Artillery, and Garrizon'd it with a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of Turks. Some days after, the Turks, finding themſelves abſolute Maſters of <hi>Algiers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ill-intreat the Citizens, at firſt by injurious ſpeeches, and afterwards by publick plundering, ſo that now they clearly perceiv'd it had been much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be tributaries to the Chriſtians then ſubjects to the Turks. The Government of the new King was ſo heavy, that the Citizens began ſecretly to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a correſpondence with the Governor of the Iſland-Fort, declaring that their intention was to maſſacre all the Turks, and to renew the payment of their tribute to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Captain promis'd them aſſiſtance.

               <p>The diſorders of this Pyrate caus'd a confederacy between the <hi>Algerians,</hi> the Moors of <hi>Mutiia</hi> (the Country of <hi>Selim</hi>) and the <hi>Christians</hi> of the Fort. The deſign was laid, to wit, that a great number of thoſe Moors ſhould, on a day appointed, come into the City, with armes hid under their garments, under pretence of buying ſome Commodities, and that they ſhould fire twenty two Galliots which lay a-ground on both ſides of the City. And when the Turks went out to quench the fire, the Citizens ſhould ſhut to the Gates of the City, and then the Chriſtians of the Fort, ſhould come in little Boats to the City, to aſſiſt the Citizens. But the deſign was diſcover'd by the great vigilance of <hi>Barberoſſa,</hi> who craftily diſſembled what he knew of it. And thereupon, he doubled his Guards, as well in the Galliots as at the City-gates, ſo that the Moors were ſo far from firing the Galliots, that they had not the confidence to come neer them.</p>
               <p>On a certain day of their <hi>Juma,</hi> (that is the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, which is as it were the Sunday of the Turks) this new King came as he was wont to the great Moskey to ſay the <hi>Sala</hi>; and ſome of the wealthieſt <hi>Algeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> being alſo come in, the doors were ſhut of a ſudden upon them, and a great number of <hi>Turks</hi> ſtood about the Moſquey, ſo that the <hi>Algerians</hi> were beſieg'd, and made priſoners. Then <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56140:53"/>
to diſcover what he knew of their deſign, and commanded them to be bound hand and foot. That done, he caus'd the heads of twenty Citizens to be immediately chopp'd off, as thoſe whom he conceiv'd moſt guilty, and order'd the bodies and heads to be caſt into the Streets, where after they had remain'd a certain time for a ſpectacle, they were buried in a dung-hill. All this happen'd in the year 1517. And from that time to this preſent, the <hi>Algerians</hi> have ſuffer'd the Government of the <hi>Turks,</hi> either by force or fair means, without any contradiction, and conſequently they are ſubject to the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame year 1517. <hi>Selim Eutemi</hi>'s Son, (who, as was ſaid, retir'd to <hi>Oran</hi>) upon the intreaty of the Marqueſs of <hi>Comares,</hi> General of <hi>Oran,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of the Cardinal <hi>Franciſco Ximenes,</hi> and all the Councels of <hi>Spain,</hi> obtain'd a Naval Army of ten thouſand men, to drive <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> and the Turks out of <hi>Algiers.</hi> For the Councels of <hi>Spain</hi> thought it not rational that that Arch-Pyrat <hi>Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſa</hi> ſhould make <hi>Algiers</hi> a refuge for the Picaroons and Pyrats, who infeſted the neighbouring King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. This Army under the conduct of a Knight named <hi>Dom Franciſco de la Vexa,</hi> and <hi>Selim</hi>'s Son, got neer the City of <hi>Algiers,</hi> but it met with a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, as there did afterwards to the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. in the year 1541. for a great Tempeſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd them ſo, that ſome of the Ships fell foul one upon another, and the reſt run a-ground. So that the greateſt part of that Army was ſwallow'd in the Sea, and the Souldiers drown'd. Thoſe who had eſcap'd the dangers at Sea, were either kill'd by the <hi>Turks,</hi> or made Slaves, and very few return'd into <hi>Spain.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:56140:53"/>This misfortune of the Chriſtians much heighten'd the courage of <hi>Barberoſſa,</hi> and made him more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then before; for by that diſaſter, the forces of <hi>Salim Eutemi</hi>'s Son, the right heir of the Kingdom of <hi>Algiers</hi> were loſt, he out of all hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration, and the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> forces very much weakened. All theſe ſucceſſes, on the other ſide, made <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> ſo proud, ſo inſolent, and ſo inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, that the <hi>Alarbes,</hi> who liv'd in the flat Country, under the juriſdiction of that Kingdom, finding themſelves ſo cruelly treated by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Turk,</hi> reſolv'd to take for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector the King of <hi>Tunis</hi> (a Country diſtant from <hi>Algiers,</hi> about thirty miles Weſtward) and ſent Ambaſſadors to treat with him about it. This King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Hamidalabde,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> grew daily more and more powerful, and fearing that troubleſome neighbour, promis'd the <hi>Alarbes</hi> aſſiſtance, conditionally they would engage in a joynt war againſt that Pyrate; and in caſe they might get him out of <hi>Algiers,</hi> that the Moors ſhould beſtow that Kingdom on him and his ſucceſſors. This condition was accepted by the <hi>Moors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Hamidalabde</hi> got together ten thouſand Horſe, as well his own Subjects, as from his friends and Allyes, and march'd with that Army towards <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> in the year 1517. The <hi>Alarbes,</hi> who liv'd under the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi> ſeeing that Army, openly declar'd themſelves enemies to the Tyrant. Whereupon the Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd daily in both Horſe and Foot. <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intelligence of what paſs'd between <hi>Hamida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labde</hi>

and the <hi>Alarbes</hi> prepar'd for War, not onely for the defenſive, but alſo for the offenſive. All his confidence was in the Valour of his <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Arque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers, which his enemies wanted. He left the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Algiers</hi> to his Brother <hi>Cheredin,</hi> with a ſmall Garriſon. And to ſecure the City, he took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him twenty of the richeſt Citizens. He began his march towards his enemies with a thouſand Arquebuſiers, <hi>Turks,</hi> and five hundred <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Granada</hi> and <hi>Valentia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> having march'd twelve leagues Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward met with the enemy's Army, and the firſt charge was very deſperate. The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> being well skill'd, with the excellent conduct of their chief Commander gave their enemies a defeat. The King of <hi>Tunis</hi> ſeeing the confuſion, retreated faſter then he came thither, and <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> purſu'd his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, following him as far as <hi>Tunis,</hi> where the King durſt not ſtay, for fear of being beſieg'd. He went thence towards Mount <hi>Atlas,</hi> and <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> without any reſiſtance took the City of <hi>Tunis,</hi> plundering all that unfortunate King had left in his Palace, and the Souldiers doing the like with the Citizens houſes. <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> ſtaid ſome days to refreſh himſelf at <hi>Tunis,</hi> and within a ſhort time after was proclaim'd King of <hi>Tunis</hi> by the Citizens that were left behind. The fame of this victory ſpread over all <hi>Africk</hi>; and it happening at that time, that the <hi>Moors</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Tremeſen</hi> (which is fifty leagues from <hi>Tunis</hi> Weſtward) had ſome difference with their King, they ſent word to <hi>Barberoſſa,</hi> that if he would come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his <hi>Turks,</hi> they would make him Maſter of the City, and the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> having heard this propoſal, thought he ſhould not let ſlip ſo fair an opportunity. He writ a letter to his Brother at <hi>Algiers,</hi> to ſend him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by Sea ten little Guns, with all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for them; which his Brother did, ſending him five Galliots loaden with Artillery, Powder, and other Ammunition. <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> having receiv'd them, took a good quantity of proviſions, which he put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Horſes, and began his march towards <hi>Tremeſen.</hi> Several Nations of <hi>Moors,</hi> through whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries he paſs'd ſubmitted to him, and ſome follow'd him, in hopes of good booty.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Aruch Barberoſſa</hi> finding himſelf got ſo far into the Country was afraid the King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> who was driven out of his Kingdom, might return with ſome <hi>Moors</hi> to recover it, and prevent his retreat, or that the General of <hi>Oran</hi> might come out with his forces, and hinder his return. All this hindred not his marching into the Country, commanding his third Brother <hi>Iſaac Beniioub</hi> to keep the City of <hi>Tunis,</hi> with two hundred Musketters, <hi>Turks,</hi> and ſome Moors, He march'd four leagues beyond <hi>Oran,</hi> where he met with <hi>Abuziien</hi> King of <hi>Tremeſen,</hi> who knew nothing of the infidelity of his Subjects; but hearing of <hi>Barberoſſa</hi>'s advance, he thought it fitter to meet him in the field with his forces then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him, and ſuffer himſelf to be ſhut up in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as not being over-confident of the Citizens of <hi>Tremeſen.</hi> His Army conſiſted of ſix thouſand Horſe, and three thouſand Foot.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as both Armies were in ſight, they were ſet in order for an engagement. The place was very fit, for it was in the ſpacious Campagne about <hi>Aganel.</hi>

The fight began very furiouſly on both ſides; but <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> ſoon had the advantage, by reaſon of the great number he had of ſmall Shot, and his ſmall Guns; ſo that the King's beſt Troops were defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and himſelf forc'd to retreat to <hi>Tremeſen,</hi> where the Citizens, his Subjects, took him Priſoner, and cut off his Head, before <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> got thither, to whom they ſent the Head by their Deputies with the Keys of the City, promiſing him, as they had done before, ſubmiſſion. Two days after, he made his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn entrance into <hi>Tremeſen,</hi> confiſcating the Goods of the deceas'd King, as well to pay his Souldiers, as to make ſome Fortifications about the City; for he conceiv'd his Neighbour-hood would not be well lik'd by thoſe of <hi>Oran,</hi> and to ſecure himſelf, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately entred into a confederacy with <hi>Muley-hamet,</hi> King of <hi>Fez,</hi> promiſing him aſſiſtance againſt the King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Muley-hamet</hi> was in open War, conditionally that <hi>Muley-hamet</hi> would defend the Kingdom of <hi>Tremeſen</hi> againſt their common enemies the <hi>Chriſtians.

               </p>
               <p>But it was the pleaſure of Divine Juſtice, at length, to give a check to theſe great Succeſſes, for <hi>Barberoſſa</hi>'s third Brother <hi>Iſaac Benijoub,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the new Conqueſts at <hi>Tunis,</hi> and other places, through his extraordinary Exactions and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies, become ſo odious to the <hi>Moors</hi> of the Country, that they revolted, and kill'd him with all his <hi>Turks,</hi> except forty, who, thinking to make an
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56140:55"/>
eſcape, were all cut to pieces. <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely troubled at the Death of his Brother, but deſert'd his revenge to a fitter opportunity. In <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> in the year 1517. came into <hi>Spain,</hi> King <hi>Charls,</hi> who afterwards was Emperour, with a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Naval Army. The Marqueſs of <hi>Comares,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis'd of his Arrival, went in Perſon to wait on him, and give him an account of what had paſs'd in <hi>Africk.</hi> And the Pyrat <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> growing daily more and more dreadful, he advis'd his Majeſty to quench that ſpreading fire. And to animate his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty the more, he carried along with him <hi>Abuchen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> King of <hi>Tremeſen,</hi> who had taken refuge at <hi>Oran,</hi> and got of his Majeſty ten thouſand Souldiers, to engage againſt <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> and the <hi>Turks.</hi> Which the Pyrat hearing of, ſent for aſſiſtance to the King of <hi>Fez,</hi> according to their mutual confederacy. But ſeeing that the relief came not with the expedition he expected, and that the Marqueſs of <hi>Comares</hi> was already got to <hi>Oran,</hi> and marching with his Forces towards him, he thought it his beſt courſe, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the relief from <hi>Fez,</hi> to come out of <hi>Tremeſen</hi> with fifteen hundred <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Andalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Arquebuſiers,</hi> and five thouſand <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Horſe.</p>
               <p>But conſidering that the ſaid number of fifteen hundred <hi>Arquebuſiers</hi> were not able to oppoſe ten thouſand <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> (for he had no great confidence of his <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Horſe) he reſolv'd to continue at <hi>Tremeſen,</hi> expecting from day to day the relief from the King of <hi>Fez.</hi> But when the Marqueſs was come in ſight of <hi>Tremeſen, Barberoſſa</hi> obſerv'd that the Citizens began to flinch from him; whereupon he
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56140:56"/>
took a third reſolution, which was, to get away with his <hi>Turks</hi> in the night time, without giving any notice thereof to the Citizens, and to make all the haſte he could towards <hi>Algiers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This reſolution was proſecuted; but, at the firſt halt he made, the Marqueſs having intelligence of it, ſo ſpeedily purſu'd him with ſome Fire-locks, that he overtook him about eight Leagues from <hi>Tremeſen,</hi> at the paſſage of a River named <hi>Huexda. Barberoſſa</hi> finding himſelf purſu'd ſo cloſely, and his <hi>Turks</hi> kill'd, made uſe of this Stratagem, to gain time to croſs the River. He caus'd to be ſtrew'd along the High-way great quantities of Money, Plate, and other things of great Value, thinking by that means to amuſe the <hi>Christians,</hi> while he got over the River. But that valiant Marqueſs encourag'd his Souldiers with ſo many urgent reaſons, that they ſlighted all thoſe rich Baits, to take <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> alive, who, as I ſaid, was at the River-ſide, ready to croſs it, when the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> furiouſly charg'd the retreating <hi>Turks.</hi> Which <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beroſſa</hi> perceiving, fac'd his Enemies, reſolving to Dye generouſly in Fight. The fifteen hundred <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> among them defended themſelves like Lions; but in a ſhort time they were all Kill'd, and <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>Thus ended all the great deſigns of <hi>Barberoſſa,</hi> who firſt brought the <hi>Turks</hi> into <hi>Barbary,</hi> and taught them the way to get Wealth out of the Weſtern parts of the World, laying the Foundations of what the <hi>Turks</hi> are to this Day poſſeſs'd of in <hi>Barbary.</hi> The Marqueſs of <hi>Comares</hi> ſatisfi'd with this Victory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Tremeſen,</hi> with the Head of the Tyrant on a Pike for a Trophey, and without any oppoſition of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56140:56"/>
the people, put the King <hi>Abuchen-men</hi> in poſſeſſion of his Kingdome. Fourteen days after this defeat, the King of <hi>Fez Abdeda</hi> came neer <hi>Milta</hi> with twenty thouſand <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Horſe, to aſſiſt <hi>Barberoſſa.</hi> But hearing of the defeat of his Army, and his Death, fearing the like misfortune, he return'd the ſame way he came; and the Marqueſs leaving the King of <hi>Tremeſen</hi> re-eſtabliſh'd in his Kingdome, return'd to <hi>Oran.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus dy'd <hi>Aruch Barberoſſa,</hi> after he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd fourteen years in <hi>Barbary,</hi> committing incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible out-rages on the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by Sea, and doing the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Barbary</hi> much greater miſchiefs by Land: For he was the firſt who reduc'd them into that condition, wherein they now are, of being Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and as it were half Slaves to the <hi>Turks.</hi> The news of <hi>Barberoſſa</hi>'s death was ſoon carried to his younger Brother <hi>Cheredin Barberoſſa,</hi> who Govern'd at <hi>Algiers.</hi> It troubled him very much upon a double account, both out of a conſideration of the loſs of his Brother, and a fear that the victorious Marqueſs might come and beſiege him in the City of <hi>Algiers.</hi> Whereupon he was neer reſolving to leave the place, and to retire with twenty two Galliots towards the Levant. But ſome Pyrats advis'd him to expect a while, to ſee which way the victorious <hi>Christians</hi> would take their march. And finding that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs being return'd to <hi>Oran,</hi> ſent his Men aboard in order to their Tranſportion into <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Souldiers with the Pyrats choſe <hi>Cheredin</hi> for their King, and Captain-General of the Kingdome of <hi>Algiers.</hi> And indeed he was a Perſon deſerv'd to ſucceed his Brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:56140:57"/>Being poſſeſs'd of that Kingdom, the firſt thing he did, was to ſend a Galley with ſome Letters to the Grand-Seignor, acquainting him with his Brother's death, and deſiring his protection and aſſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> promiſing either to pay Tribute, or put the Kingdom into his hands, together withall he was poſſeſs'd of in <hi>Barbary.</hi> The Grand Seignor hearing this news, not onely return'd a favourable anſwer, but alſo ſent him an aſſiſtance of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Turks,</hi> accepting of the proffer he made him, that the City of <hi>Algiers</hi> with its Territories ſhould be put into his hands. All theſe tranſactions hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd about the beginning of the year 1519.</p>
               <p>The Reader may here ſee how and when the City of <hi>Algiers</hi> came into the hands of the <hi>Turks.</hi> I thought it not beſides my purpoſe to bring in this ſhort Hiſtory, to undeceive thoſe who imagin'd that <hi>Aruch Barberoſſa</hi> had made theſe acqueſts in <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> as a General of the Grand Seignor's. For what he did was upon his own account, without any other title then that of a Pyrat by Sea, and a Tyrant by Land.</p>
               <p>In the year 1530. <hi>Cheredin</hi> finding himſelf incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated by reaſon of the Fort which the Chriſtians kept in the Iſland before the Port, reſolv'd to beat it down with Cannon-ſhot, and afterwards to make a Port from the City to the Iſland, which very deſign <hi>Aruch Barberoſſa</hi> had in the year 1516. For by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that Fort, the Ships were oblig'd to ſecure themſelves on one ſide of the City neer the Gate called <hi>Babazon,</hi> where they lay in great danger to be caſt away upon the leaſt tempeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:56140:57"/>
                  <hi>Cheredin Barberoſſa</hi> began his enterpriſe upon the Fort, with this ſtratagem. Two young Lads, <hi>Moors,</hi> by his ſecret order, went and delivered themſelves to thoſe of the Fort, ſaying they would embrace the Chriſtian Religion. They were kindly entertain'd, and the Captain, who commanded the Fort, named <hi>Martin de Vargas,</hi> took them into the houſe, and caus'd them to be Catechiz'd, that they might receive the holy Sacrament of Baptiſm. On <hi>Eaſter</hi>-day, when the Governor and all his Souldiers were at Church, theſe two Youths went up to the top of a little Tower, whence they gave the ſignal to thoſe of the City by a Flagg; which being obſerv'd by a Servant-maid of the Governors, ſhe immediately went and acquainted her Maſter with the treachery, who came preſently out of the Church with all his Souldiers, and fearing the enemies, he put theſe two youths in priſon, and a while after caus'd them to be both hang'd up in an eminent place, whence thoſe of the City might ſee the ſpectacle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cheredin</hi> had ſoon notice of it, and was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incens'd thereat, as if it had been done in deriſion of the Mahumetane Religion. He ſent a Boat to the Fort with a Renagado, named <hi>Alcade Huali,</hi> to tell the Governor that if he would deliver up the place, he and his people ſhould have good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, otherwiſe they were to expect no mercy. The Governor made anſwer, that he was aſtoniſh'd, that <hi>Cheredin Barberoſſa,</hi> a perſon ſo highly eſteem'd for his experience in military affairs, did not conſider that he had to do with <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who value their honour above all things, and laugh at the menaces of their enemies; That he was further to know, that he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56140:58"/>
was of the Houſe of <hi>Vargas</hi>; that he glory'd not ſo much in the Nobility, as his endeavors to imitate the Heroick vertues of his Anceſtors, and that therefore he would expect the utmoſt attempts of <hi>Cheredin Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beroſſa,</hi> and do all he could to ſhew himſelf faithful to his God and his Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cheredin</hi> having receiv'd this anſwer, took ſome great Guns out of a <hi>French</hi> Galion, which chanc'd to lye before <hi>Algiers,</hi> and ſome other pieces which had been caſt there ſome months before for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>May</hi> 6. 1530. he rais'd a Battery, which plaid fifteen days and nights without any intermiſſion, and the diſtance being but two hundred paces or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, the Muskettiers alſo ſhot continually; ſo that the ſixteenth of <hi>May,</hi> the Walls were almoſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, and a great number of the beſieg'd kill'd or wounded. <hi>Cheredin</hi> took one thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Musketteers and Archers, Turks, in fourteen Galliots, and being come to the Fort, they landed without any obſtacle. For the Governor was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with fifty three of the Soldiers, and the reſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly tyr'd out, as may be eaſily conjectur'd, having been ſixteen days in continual alarmes.</p>
               <p>The Captain <hi>Martin de Vargas</hi> yeelded up the place on certain conditions, and after three months impriſonment, he was without any reaſon, baſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do'd to death, in the preſence of <hi>Cheredin.</hi> Thus dy'd that valiant Captain, carrying along with him to heaven the crown of Martyrdom, and leaving to his Succeſſors an example of valour and fidelity; which vertues are ſo deeply rooted in that illuſtrious family, that there are to this day in the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Knights, who are not onely heirs of that Noble
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56140:58"/>
Houſe, but alſo imitators of the Vertues of their Anceſtors, and ſuch as are look'd upon all over the world, as examples of Valour and Fidelity. After the maſſacre of this brave Captain, he employ'd the Chriſtian Slaves to make a Moal from the City to the Fortreſs, which was finiſh'd in two years.</p>

Since the year 1650. part of the Garriſon is lodg'd in five great publick houſes, built ſquare, with a ſpacious Court in the midſt, which may ſerve for an Armoury.

The Caſtle called <hi>Alcazabar,</hi> is onely that part of the City which lies Southward, divided by a Wall, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at the Rampart on the Eaſt-ſide, and reaches to that on the Weſt. About three hundred paces from the City, there is, in the Sea, a little Iſland, which in the year 1530. was joyn'd to the City by a Moale, made for the ſafety of Ships and Gallies, which about the beginning of the year 1662. was carryed away by a Tempeſt with the loſs of many Veſſels and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. There are alſo ſome inconſiderable Fortreſſes without the City, whereof the chiefeſt is that built by <hi>Aſan Baſſa</hi> in the year 1545. about one thouſand and ſeven hundred paces from the City, on a Hill, at the ſame place, where the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. had
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56140:59"/>
ſet up his Tent in the year 1541. Neer that place is the ſource of the Spring which ſupplies the City with freſh water, which it does ſo plentifully, that they need no other beſides that and the rain water, which is preſerv'd in Ceſterns. It is convey'd by Arches and Pipes under ground, which fill the Reſervato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in divers places, as well in the upper as lower part of the City, even to the Gate at the water-ſide, where all the branches fall into one great Channel, which conveyes the reſt of the water into the Sea, and there the Gallies and other Veſſels take in their proviſions of water. At every Reſervatory or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit there is a Cock, with a diſh ſtanding by, for the convenience of thoſe who would drink. Thoſe who come to theſe Conduits for water, take it in their Turns, ſave onely the Jews, who are to give way to every Slave who comes after them, and to be ſerv'd laſt of all. The water which falls to the ground is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into holes neer thoſe Conduits, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd into Common-Shores under ground, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away the filth of the Privyes about the City, all whith fall into theſe Shores, and meet together in one neer the three Gates of the Store-houſes, where all falls into the Sea. The hundred thouſand Souls which inhabit this City are divided into twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souldiers, <hi>Turks,</hi> belonging to the ordinary Garrizon, thirty or fourty thouſand Slaves, of all Nations, and the reſt Citizens of <hi>Algiers, Moors, Moriſcoes,</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſome <hi>Chriſtian</hi>-Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. The chief Governour of all theſe is the <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> who takes it not unkindly to be flatter'd with the title of <hi>Sultan.</hi> He acknowledges a kind of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Grand-Seignor, in words, but makes

little account of his orders, Paſs-ports, or the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he hath concluded with other Soveraign Princes, if he hath not agreed to them himſelf. The Soldie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is more dreadful to him then the Grand-Seignor. Accordingly his greateſt work is to ſee them punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pay'd at every new Moon, for if he delay it three hours after it is due, he is in danger of being Maſſacred, or at leaſt impriſon'd. This is done out of the Tributes, which the <hi>Alarbes,</hi> and ſome pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Princes, <hi>Moors,</hi> about <hi>Algiers,</hi> pay him, as alſo out of the contributions of the people, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Prizes. The Baſſa is alſo to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that he take no more then his due, for fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſing the Soldiery, which prognoſticates certain death to him, as it did in the year 1661. in the month of <hi>September</hi> to <hi>Ramadan Baſſa,</hi> whoſe throat, with twenty eight perſons of his Councel, were cut by the Soldiers, and their bodyes caſt to the Dogs in the Streets, for having caus'd to be adjudg'd to himſelf a greater proportion of a prize of Wheat, then was due to him. The reſt of the Councel being forc'd to the water-ſide, got into a Fiſher-boat, and put off from land, to avoid the fury of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous Soldiery, but they were taken by the <hi>Malteſes.</hi> After this exploit, the ſoldiers took out of priſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Baſſa</hi> whom they had impriſon'd ſome years before, becauſe they were not punctually paid, and re-advanc'd him to the Government, exhorting him to do righteous things, which yet he forgot within three days after, thinking of nothing ſo much as to be reveng'd of an <hi>Aga,</hi> who had proſecuted his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer impriſonment; and to execute his deſign, he promis'd ten thouſand Patacoons to two ſoldiers to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56140:60"/>
kill his enemy; which they undertook, and went with that reſolution to the <hi>Aga</hi>'s, and deſir'd to ſpeak with him. The Chriſtian Slave, who ſpoke to them, judging by their countenances, and the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitars they had, contrary to the cuſtome of Soldiers, who wear onely long Skeenes, when they walk about the City, that they were engag'd upon ſome lewd at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, made anſwer that his Patron was gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, though he were not, and went preſently and gave his Maſter an account of all, who having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Baſſa's deſign, made his complaints to the Souldiers, who mutiny'd, ſeiz'd his perſon, and ſhut him up between four walls without any covering, where he had onely room enough to ſit down, with a hole to put him in ſome meat. The <hi>Aga</hi> thank'd the ſoldiers for the ſpeedy juſtice they had done, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himſelf to be their Baſſa, with a promiſe to augment their pay by a Double a month, which they accepted. The neceſſity of this punctual payment obliges the Baſſa to endeavour the getting of mony above all things, by hook or by crook, by breach of Treaties, or a wrong interpretation thereof. This laſt reaſon was the cauſe that his Majeſty of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1661. ſent his Admiral the Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi> with eighteen Men of War to lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Algiers,</hi> to demand reparation, for that the Pyrates had taken out of the Veſſels of his Subjects ſome perſons who were not <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with their Merchandize, contrary to the peace made with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The Admiral came before the City <hi>August</hi> 22. 1661. ſending aſhore his Lieutenant with Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Letters, to make his complaints to the Baſſa and the <hi>Duana</hi>; but the Admiral had no other ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56140:61"/>
then that he got the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul out of the City, and batter'd ſome of the houſes with his great ſhot. This Baſſa does many time deceive his Confederates, and takes their Merchandiſe, forcing the Maſters of Ships, by Cudgelling, to confeſs that the goods belong to other Nations; or if he forbea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that rigor, there is a ſtoppage ſet on the goods, and while they pretend to verifie the fact, all is ſold, and under ſome ill pretence, the prize is declared good. And to ſay truth, it is very hard for the Baſſa to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve peace with any Nation whatſoever, if he will be belov'd by his Souldiers, in as much as his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the prizes is the greateſt part of his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue; which it would not be, if he exactly obſerv'd peace with any other Nations, which would have all the Trading, were there a freedom of Navigation, and conſequently there would be but few prizes, and his Revenue ariſing from his proportion thereof, would come to little or nothing. The twelve thouſand ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which make the ordinary Forces of the Baſſa, are moſt of them Renegadoes, diſſolute perſons, without Religion or Conſcience, fugitives out of Chriſtendom and Turkey for the enormity of their crimes. This place is a refuge to all ſuch perſons, nay, to ſuch as have offended the Grand Seignor himſelf, as it happen'd in the year 1640. upon my arrival at <hi>Algiers,</hi> when ſome ſhew'd me <hi>Sigala,</hi> Son of that famous <hi>Admiral,</hi> a Renegado of <hi>Genua,</hi> of the ſame name, who had taken refuge in this City to avoid being ſtrangled, as their cuſtome is, upon this ſcore, that in the year 1636. being command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Grand Seignor to convey with a Squadron of Gallies, the Ships which brought home the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56140:61"/>
tribute of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and other wealth, that had joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them, he had left his Gallies, and came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoar to ſpend away his time among women, and in entertainments, inſomuch that during his abſence, the <hi>Maltezes</hi> had an opportunity, to carry away that Ship which had the Tribute and the precious commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in it. And this it was that had forc'd <hi>Sigala</hi> to get away with his Galley to <hi>Algiers,</hi> where he liv'd by what he got by Piracy, till the death of <hi>Sultan Amurat,</hi> ſoon after which he obtain'd his pardon of <hi>Sultan Hibraim,</hi> his Brother and Succeſſor. The ſoldiers obſerve the Baſſa's orders, if they approve of them, and they oblige him to change them, if they like them not, and ſo they rather command the Baſſa, then are commanded by him.</p>
               <p>In the year 1642. a tributary King of <hi>Algiers</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to pay his Tribute, and came with an Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the field, whereupon the Baſſa <hi>Iſouf</hi> being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to go out againſt him, would have been excus'd upon his indiſpoſition. But his excuſe was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, there was a neceſſity of his going, if he would preſerve his life and charge; only the Soldiers were ſo kind as to permit him to go as far as he could in a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley; but imagining the Baſſa might take ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to leave them, they accompany'd him with another Galley better furniſh'd with both Rowers and Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with order, to force the Baſſa to land at the place appointed, which he quietly did.</p>
               <p>There are Renegado's of all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nations, and in my time, I found there above three thouſand <hi>French.</hi> Heretofore, the Renegadoes could not ſerve for Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers among the <hi>Turks</hi> and Janizaries, and the <hi>Turks</hi> and Janizaries could not go upon the account of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy?
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56140:62"/>
But <hi>Mahomet</hi> Baſſa, to prevent the jealouſies and quarrels happening thereby, reconcil'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negadoes with the <hi>Turks,</hi> allowing, in the year 1568. to both the priviledge of being Soldiers or Pyrates, without any difference. The <hi>Moors,</hi> the <hi>Moriſos,</hi> the <hi>Algerians,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Turks</hi> born at <hi>Algiers,</hi> Renegado Jews, are not admitted into the Soldiery; but the Jews who would ſerve, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The pay of the Souldiery is eight <hi>Moriſco Doubles</hi> a month, every Double is worth twelve <hi>Patars,</hi> (that is ſomewhat better then twelve pence <hi>Sterling</hi>) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the number of the years they have been in ſervice, the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In like manner, if there be a Son born to the Grand-Seignor by the Sultaneſs, a Double; if any Soldier hath kill'd his enemy in a Skirmiſh, or hand to hand, and hath brought away his head, a Double; if they have had any remarkable engagement againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious. <hi>Alarbes,</hi> the Baſſa promiſes them an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of a Double in the month; but all the monthly augmentations of Doubles are not to exceed the number of fourty.</p>
               <p>The Batchelor-Soldiers have greater priviledges then thoſe who are married; the latter have no daily allowance of bread, the former have four loaves. The pay is to be exact and punctual, as I ſaid before. 'Tis not out of any fear of the Chriſtians, that the Baſſa maintains ſo great a number of Souldiers, but
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56140:62"/>
that he might be the more dreaded by thoſe of <hi>Algiers,</hi> the <hi>Alarbes,</hi> and the petty Princes, who pay him tribute, againſt whom they are ſent, if they come not ſoon enough to prevent them. The ſoldiers keep little or no guard within the City, but a Watch, which they call <hi>Meſuart,</hi> walks round about it with twenty five perſons. At the Gates there are but two or three men. In the Summer, <hi>Algiers</hi> is in a manner diſtitute of a Garriſon, for ſome of the ſoldiers are diſpers'd to <hi>Tremeſen, Bugy, Sargel,</hi> and other places under the juriſdiction of <hi>Algiers.</hi> They often change the Garriſons, and ſend that of one place to another. Another part of the ſoldiery is ſent away by Bodies of five or ſix hundred, thirty or fourty leagues into the Country, to quarter on the <hi>Alarbes,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Tribute; and the greateſt part is employ'd at Sea in the Galleys.</p>
               <p>I obſerv'd in the Summer 1641. that the ſixty five Pyrates Ships and the four Gallies, which were then at Sea, every one for what could be gotten, were moſt of them mann'd by ſoldiers of the Garriſon. The remainder, who are neither employ'd at Sea, nor ſent to the Poſts before-mentioned, live at eaſe, and divert themſelves at their Country-houſes, two or three leagues out of the City. The Citizens, and the originary Inhabitants of the Country are irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable enemies of the Garriſon.</p>
               <p>There is but one Councel, called the <hi>Duana,</hi> which with the Baſſa reſolves all matters of State, and what relate to the adminiſtration of Juſtice. This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel meets commonly thrice a week, in a Gallery of the Baſſa's Palace. It conſiſts of fourty perſons. The Baſſa ſits, as Taylers do, croſs-legg'd, on a Table a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56140:63"/>
two foot high, at a little diſtance from the Wall, cover'd with a ſhaggy-Carpet, and ſo long, that twelve of the chiefeſt may ſit as the Baſſa does, ſix on the right hand, and as many on the left; the reſt of the Councel ſtand at both ends of the Table, croſs the Gallery, making, with the Arch, a kind of circle. This Baſſa hath commonly a Fan of Feathers in his hand; he pronounces ſentence, and the plurality of voices carries it, but they have this particulary remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that they begin to gather the voices, while ſome one is alledging new reaſons for or againſt the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under deliberation. All cauſes, wherein the ſoldiers are concern'd are try'd before this Councel; but differences between Citizens are determin'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Caya,</hi> who is as it were the Baſſa's Lieutenant. Every man is to proſecute and plead his own cauſe in perſon, without the aſſiſtance, of any Advocate, Lawyer, or Atturney. Great Robbes, Murtherers, and other eminent Criminals are put to death, if they be Moors or Jews; but the ſouldiers are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by their <hi>Agas,</hi> who ever find excuſes to get them off, unleſs the offence be againſt another ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. An accuſation prov'd by two witneſſes, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in order to condemnation. He who hath the worſt in any cauſe, receives a certain number of blows with a cudgel, beſides what he is oblig'd to do by the Sentence. If the accuſation be found malicious, the Accuſer is to ſuffer a puniſhment ſuitable to the crime impos'd. The ſin of abhomination is not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd among them. As to the grimaces of their Religion, they are the ſame with thoſe us'd in moſt parts of <hi>Turkey.</hi> This is a ſhort account of the State and Government of <hi>Algiers,</hi> where the miſeries of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56140:63"/>
Slavery have conſum'd the lives of ſix hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Chriſtians, ſince the year 1536. at which time <hi>Cheredin Barberoſsa</hi> brought it under his own power. 'Tis hard to imagine a reaſon, why its Government being ſo ill adminiſtred, could endure ſo long, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that hole dreadful to all <hi>Europe,</hi> ſince its ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſtrength, and Fortreſſes are no way conſiderable. I muſt confeſs <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes will ever have cauſe to remember the enterpriſe of that great Monarch <hi>Charles</hi> V. made on this City in the year 1541. with an unfortunate iſſue; but I hope that will not divert their generous thoughts from promoting the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Chriſtendom. There was a concurrence of many accidents in the attempt of that great Emperor, which may be avoided, or are particular to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition: The ſeaſon for the taking of <hi>Algiers</hi> was Autumne, at which time the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea is no leſs rough then the other Seas, by reaſon of ſtorms and tempeſts, which hindred the coming in of proviſions to that Army, and occaſion'd the loſs of the Baggage and Artillery. The Garriſon was then return'd, ſome from Sea, others from their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions againſt the <hi>Alarbes</hi> and the Tributaries. The diſſention among the Emperor's Commanders contributed alſo ſomewhat thereto; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe traverſes, <hi>Aſan Baſſa,</hi> a generous Captain, a Renegado, born in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> brought up by <hi>Cheredin Barberoſſa,</hi> and all the people of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers</hi> were in diſtreſs for freſh water, the ſource whereof had been diverted another way. Nay, they never durſt attribute their deliverance to their valour, but their opinion ſtill is, that a <hi>Marabout,</hi> or <hi>Santon</hi> (that is a Saint) who then liv'd
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56140:64"/>
neer the City, wrought a miracle, beating the Sea with his ſtaff, which caus'd that dreadful tempeſt. They have accordingly erected to the memory of this <hi>Marabout</hi> a Chappel without <hi>Babaloët</hi>-gate, on the left hand, where he is interr'd, for which place the Turks have a reverence, as ſome Chriſtians have for places of devotion, affirming, that if the Chriſtian Army ever return thither, they will raiſe the greateſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt that ever was, by caſting into the Sea the bones of that <hi>Marabout.</hi> In this perſwaſion conſiſts the force they have to defend themſelves againſt the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>I conceiv'd my ſelf oblig'd to give this ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the antiquity and ſcituation of <hi>Algiers,</hi> to remedy the deficiencies of other Chronologers, who confound the years, the names, and the Nations, taking the <hi>Turks</hi> for the <hi>Moors.</hi> As concerning a more ample deſcription of the City and its Fortreſſes, the diſpoſitions of the Inhabitants, the Pirates, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Tradeſmen, their Cloathing, the <hi>Marabouts</hi> or <hi>Santons,</hi> the Ceremonies, the exerciſes of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, their ſeveral <hi>Eaſters,</hi> their Vices and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and what was done there in the laſt Age, I thought them beſides my deſign, and ſuperfluous, as being common things related by diverſe Hiſtorians, who ſpeak of the <hi>Turks</hi> in general.

               <p>Upon theſe Overtures, <hi>Domingo</hi> embarks in the year 1639. and after they had been ſome hours at Sea, his Wife fell in Labour, and was deliver'd of a ſecond Son, to whom the Captain of the Veſſel (whom I know) was God-father. Some days after, they came in ſight of ſome <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pyrats, and after a ſhort engagement, the Ship was taken, and brought to <hi>Algiers,</hi> where the Priſoners were ſold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Domingo,</hi> to avoid the miſeries of Slavery, goes to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and tells them that he was a <hi>Jew,</hi> intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to redeem him, his Wife and Children. The <hi>Jews,</hi> who are commonly more ſubject to avarice then prodigality, began to examine him; he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately anſwer'd their queſtions in the Hebrew

tongue; ſo that they believ'd what he ſaid. In fine, they told him he ſhould be redeem'd if he could tell them what Tribe he was of, and in what Regiſter were written the names of his Parents and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. He repli'd with a wonderful confidence, In the Regiſter of the Synagogue of <hi>Venice,</hi> where ſuch a Rabbi (naming him) will give an atteſtation of all I have ſaid. The <hi>Jews</hi> immediately writ to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> where, having examin'd all the Regiſters, there was nothing found concerning <hi>Domingo.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Algiers</hi> having receiv'd that anſwer from thoſe of <hi>Venice,</hi> were very much aſtoniſh'd, and look'd upon him as an Impoſtor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Domingo</hi> being out of all hopes of obtaining his Liberty by that means, bethought himſelf of another expedient. He made his applications to two of the Fathers employ'd about the Redemption of Captives, who were come from <hi>Valentia</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd his buſineſs ſo well, that they redeem'd his Wife and two Children, and carried them away with the other Slaves, whoſe ranſom they had paid.

               </p>
               <p>After the departure of his Wife and Children, he fell in love with an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Slave, a very handſome Woman, in his Patron's houſe; but the Miſtreſs was ſo watchful, that he could not have his deſires of her. Yet ſo great was the affection he had for her, that he found out a way to deceive both his Miſtreſs and the <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Slave. He told the <hi>Engliſh</hi>-woman, that his Wife was dead, and in caſe ſhe would marry him, he would redeem her, and that there was an order
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56140:66"/>
come for him to receive three thouſand Duckets, which ſum would ſuffice for the ranſoming of both. The <hi>Engliſh</hi>-woman, whether ſhe were in love with him or not, accepts the proffer. Whereupon <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo,</hi> to compaſs his deſign, went to an old Woman a <hi>Moor,</hi> one very well known for her Wealth and Covetouſneſs, and ſays to her, <hi>Madam, the hope I have of receiving a good reward caus'd me to come hither, to give you notice of a Commodity, by which you may gain at leaſt two thouſand Ducats.</hi> The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Woman immediately ask'd him what kind of Commodity it was, promiſing him a great recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. <hi>There is,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>at my Maſter's houſe an</hi> Engliſh-<hi>woman Slave, well deſcended, which my Maſter knows nothing of; and beſides, there is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret order come to the City for her Redemption, though ſhe ſhould coſt three thouſand Ducats. If you can keep your own counſel, you may buy her of my Maſter for four or five hundred Ducats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This propoſal pleas'd the covetous old Woman ſo well, that ſhe went immediately to be further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd concerning the <hi>Engliſh</hi>-ſlave. She went to <hi>Saban Gallan</hi>'s wife, and ask'd her, whether ſhe would ſell her <hi>Engliſh</hi>-ſlave; whereto <hi>Saban</hi>'s wife making anſwer that ſhe wanted not money, the old One repli'd, ſet what rate you pleaſe on her, I would fain have her.

               <head>RELATION II. Of the Gallantry of a Dutch Captain, who with one Ship engag'd against five <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Galleys and two Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantines, and worſted them.</head>
               <p>IN <hi>September</hi> 1641. the <hi>Caja</hi> (or Lieutenant) of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Tripoli</hi> came to <hi>Algiers</hi> with a Galley ſet out with Standards, Flaggs, and Streamers of Silk, embroider'd with <hi>Ottoman</hi> Creſcents, ſome Trumpets, and other Naval Muſick. The Souldiers were all <hi>Turks,</hi> cull'd Men, or Renegadoes, well clad, and better arm'd, according to their mode. The Slaves, who Row'd in the ſaid Galley were moſt of them <hi>Ruſſians</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who ſeem natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be deſign'd for labour.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caja</hi>'s buſineſs at <hi>Algiers</hi> was to buy two hundred and fifty Slaves all <hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Italians,</hi> whom the Vice-roy of <hi>Tripoli</hi> would ſend as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Grand-Seignor at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> This Galley had lain ſome days before <hi>Algiers,</hi> during which, <hi>Alli Pegelin,</hi> Captain General of the Galleys, was preparing four to make their laſt Salley for that year. The <hi>Caja,</hi> commanding this Wedding Galley, (I call it ſo, becauſe it was fitter for the Waftage of a Bride, than to engage with an Enemy) told <hi>Pegelin</hi> he would go with him, and participate of his fortune, in hopes of ſome good booty. He goes away from <hi>Algiers</hi> along with <hi>Pegelin,</hi> and having been four
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56140:68"/>
days abroad, they met with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship of forty Guns. <hi>Pegelin,</hi> as General, propos'd it to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the other Gallies, that they ſhould engage that Ship, but the Captains thought it not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, partly out of a fear of looſing the Slaves that row'd, and partly out of a conſideration of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of Victory. In the mean time, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, while they were in conſultation got away, ſo that, night coming on, the Turks loſt ſight of her.</p>
               <p>Having miſs'd that booty, the five Gallies with the two Brigantines which accompany'd them began to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelin</hi> perceiving the booty was of little importance began to jeer the other Captains, ſaying to them, <hi>You ſhould have engag'd the Engliſh Ship.</hi> The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains vex'd to find themſelves laugh'd at, reſolv'd to ſet upon the firſt Ship they met with, whatever ſhe were. This reſolution pleas'd <hi>Pegelin,</hi> and two days after they diſcover'd a <hi>Dutch</hi> Bottom of twenty eight Guns, and forty men. The weather was very calm, ſo that the <hi>Dutch-man</hi> could make no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of her ſails. <hi>Pegelin</hi> order'd the Gallies to draw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56140:68"/>
which he hath ſworn by the Grand Seignor's head that he will do. Therefore I adviſe you to accept of the proffer I make you from him, while it is time, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I fear me you will repent it too late.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi>-man weary to hear ſuch propoſals, very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently reply'd, <hi>I know</hi> Alli Pegelin <hi>very well,</hi> (for he had been a Slave) <hi>the Ship belongs to thoſe who were at the charge of ſetting it out, and the goods to the Merchants, and therefore I cannot give what is not my own. But if he be deſirous to have the Ship, as he ſeems to be, let him come aboard, and he ſhall ſee whether we can ſatisfie him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Renegado immediately return'd with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Whereupon <hi>Pegelin</hi> being extreamly impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and incens'd to hear the bravadoes of the <hi>Dutch</hi>-man, order'd his Gallies to draw up in the form of a Half-moon, and in that order to make towards the Poop of the Ship, and to diſcharge all together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it were by a c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By that motion he put the enemies into a confuſion, and broke their deſign; for the five Gallies making all the ſail they could, and ſtrength of Oars upon the Ship, inſtead of continuing in the form of a Half moon, at the Poop of the Ship, as they had reſolv'd, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56140:69"/>
their hands, beginning to cut the Ropes, and caſt in Granadoes to fire the Ship. But the <hi>Dutch</hi> Captain, who had all his men within, diſcharg'd ſome pieces loaden with Musket Bullet from the Poop and the Prow, which made a great ſlaughter among the <hi>Turks.</hi> In the mean time the Galley which was come up cloſe to the Ship, durſt not ſtay there any longer, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Ship being heavy loaden, the Guns lay ſo low, that they were even with the edge of the Galley. Which <hi>Pegelin</hi> obſerving (for fear began to ſeize him) immediately commanded the Gallies to retreat. The Turks who at the beginning of the engagement were got into the Ship, were much aſtoniſh'd to ſee that the Gallies had forſaken them, leaving them at the mercy of their enemies. They began to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd; thoſe who could ſwim caſt themſelves into the Sea, the wounded, and thoſe who could not ſwim, remain'd on the Deck of the Ship, as ſpectators of the engagement. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Captain commanded a Broad-ſide to be given on that ſide where the Guns were loaden with Nails, Musket-bullets, and pieces of Iron which directed at the Gallies, there were kill'd in leſs then a quarter of an hour above two hundred men, Turks, Renegadoes, and Chriſtian Slaves. But what made the buſineſs the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable, the Gallies having receiv'd this treatment without ſeeing any enemies (for the <hi>Dutch</hi>-man, as I ſaid fought within Decks, and could not be ſeen) drew off as faſt as they could. The Captain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Gallies were got out of the reach of his Guns, commanded the Turks that were left behind in the Ship to be kill'd. They finding it too hot ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Deck, were got up into the Shrowds; but
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56140:69"/>
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Captain and his people coming on the Deck ſhot at them as they hung in the Shrowds and about the Maſt, as if they had been ſo many Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This was a recreation to the <hi>Dutch</hi>; but a ſad Tragedy for the five Gallies, wherein there were two Captains kill'd, and the <hi>Caja</hi> of <hi>Tripoli</hi> had loſt an arm, and was wounded in the belly. Theſe Gallies which went out ſo gallantly ſome few days before, and ſeem'd to frighten all the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean</hi> were perceiv'd at a great diſtance as they were returning to the Port.</p>
               <p>There was a general curioſity to know what news they brought, and the water-ſide was immediately as full as it could throng with people, among whom I alſo chanc'd to be. As the Gallies came neerer and neerer to the Port, it was obſerv'd that there were two of them without Flaggs, and it was conjectur'd they were two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gallies that had been taken; but ſoon after they were of another opinion, when they ſaw they were <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallies, and that their being without Flaggs, was becauſe their Captains were kill'd.</p>
               <p>All the rejoycing and great hopes were turn'd into mourning and ſadneſs; the Gallies came in ſlowly, for want of Rowers. All the wounded were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately brought aſhoar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and among the reſt the <hi>Caja</hi> of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> who had for his Surgeon a Chriſtian Slave, born at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> one very expert in his profeſſion; but the wound in his belly was incurable, and paſt remedy. He promis'd his Surgeon, if he cur'd him, his liberty, and a hundred Patacoons; but finding there was no likelihood of it, he caus'd his Will to be made. By the firſt article, he order'd that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56140:70"/>
all the Slaves who had agreed with him about their ranſom, ſhould be ſet at liberty, at the ſeveral ſums ſpecifi'd in his Will. Secondly, that all his Renegado Slaves ſhould be free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thirdly, that the Chriſtian Slave his Surgeon ſhould be ſet at liberty after his death.</p>
               <p>Some time after the <hi>Caja</hi> died, his funeral was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ceremonies, the dead body being carried with a covering of Silk over it on one ſide of the Church, and it was left there during the mid-day <hi>Sala</hi> (a prayer of theirs) and afterwards it was carried to be buried. Before it march'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negado-Slaves, who had obtain'd their liberty. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it follow'd the Chriſtian Surgeon, who had in his hand a cleft Cane, with a Letter in the cleft, which contain'd an atteſtation of his liberty obtain'd with the good-will of his deceas'd Patron.

               <p>IN the year 1640. a Pyrate of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> took ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Algiers</hi> with about a hundred <hi>Turks</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board him. M. <hi>Caloën</hi>'s Friends and mine prevail'd ſo far with his moſt Serene Highneſs the Prince Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, that he gave ſeven Turkiſh-Slaves to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd for us three Chriſtians. The Turkes, who were in <hi>Spain,</hi> were ſent to row in the Gallies, and every time that ſome Ships were bound for <hi>Spain,</hi> there were five or ſix Turks ſent along with them. Which number being ſo inconſiderable, they were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to work with the other Sea-men up and down the Ship, there being no danger that five Turks ſhould make an eſcape from among a hundred and fifty men. In the year 1641. five of thoſe Turks were ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in a Ship of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and one night, as the Ship was paſſing through the ſtreight of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> it ran foul upon a Turkiſh Galley. The <hi>Dunkirkers</hi> thought the Galley had been but a Brigantine, and the Turks took the other for a Merchant-man, ſo that they immediately fir'd one upon another, with ſuch a noiſe that thunder would not have been heard. But after a ſhort engagement, thoſe of the Galley and thoſe of the Ship, conſidering there was no booty to be gotten, parted one from the other, and kept on their courſe. During the confuſion of the fight, the

five Turks who were aboard the Ship made a ſhift to get into the Galley; how they did it, I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and ſhould never have believ'd it, had I not been an eye-witneſs hereof. When the Galley came home, the report was all over <hi>Algiers,</hi> that five Turks who had been ſlaves at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> had made their eſcape into that Galley. I was extreamly troubled that the five Turks who had eſcap'd were not thoſe five whom my Companion <hi>Saldens</hi> had under his charge to be exchang'd for us. I went to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſide, and by chance met with one of the five eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap'd Turks. I ask'd him whether he were one of thoſe who were to be chang'd for us three <hi>Dunkirkers.</hi> He anſwered, not, but that thoſe five Turks were in the cuſtody of my Companion <hi>Saldens,</hi> and that he thought they would ſoon be in <hi>Spain.</hi> Thoſe five Turks made an excellent advantage of the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the Ship and the Galley.</p>

               <p>Having lodg'd them there, he went to give the Jew an account of what the Chriſtian ſlaves had ſaid to him, and when they came to be ſold in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, ſome Turk, who was in league with the Jew, bought them, and then the Traitor went again to them, ſaying, <hi>Thanks be to God, you have got a good Patron, he is a great friend of the Jew's with whom I live; if you are deſirous to make ſome agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning your Ranſome, it is in my power to do you a kindneſs.</hi> Theſe new ſlaves were very glad that they had met ſuch a friend, as they thought him, but the Jew had moſt reaſon to think him ſuch, for he was grown ſo expert in circumventing, that many times, the Jew with two or three thouſand Patacoons got a thouſand and more, inſomuch that he was thought to be worth a hundred thouſand Patacoons, and yet all the goods in his houſe were not worth fifty ſhillings. When this treacherous Chriſtian had compaſs'd ſome enterpriſe with ſucceſs, he receiv'd a conſiderable recompence. But it was God's pleaſure that his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures ſhould be diſcover'd, and he was ſo cry'd down among the ſlaves, that not one would treat with him; and the new ſlaves were ſoon advertiz'd that they ſhould beware that Traitor.</p>
               <p>When we were brought in, he addreſs'd himſelf to us, for upon our arrival he made his accuſtomed complements to us; but we had receiv'd a character

of him before hand, as I have ſaid elſewhere. When a man is by misfortune fallen into ſlavery, if he be over-earneſt in the proſecution of his liberty, the iſſue of it proves ſomewhat like that of ignorant Swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, who being fallen into the water, out of a fear of being drown'd, ſtrive ſo much with their armes, that they are preſently tyr'd, and ſo their exceſſive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence occaſions their miſcarriage.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN the year 1641. at <hi>Nantz</hi> in <hi>Britany</hi> there was a Maſter of a Ship, who ſtay'd there onely for a fair wind to ſet ſail for <hi>Canada.</hi> While he ſtay'd for the wind, he fell in love with a rich Merchant's daughter, whoſe Father perceiving that ſhe as much affected him as he her, would by no means conſent to their marriage, conſidering the firſt fair wind would carry him away, and with him the love he had for his daughter. But the Maſter ſeeing on the other-ſide, that it would be a greater advantage to him, to marry his Miſtreſs, then he could expect from his going to Sea as long as he liv'd, carry'd his buſineſs on ſo ſucceſsfully, that they were ſecretly married, and before her friends had any notice of it, he was gone with his ſpouſe towards <hi>Canada,</hi> hoping that before his return all things would be accommodated, by the mediation of his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

diſpoſe otherwiſe of them; for ere he had been four and twenty hours at Sea, he was taken by a Pyrate of <hi>Algiers.</hi> The amorous Maſter minding more the careſſes of his Miſtreſs, then the exerciſes of <hi>Mars,</hi> deliver'd up his Ship, without any reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Some days after, the <hi>French</hi> Gentlewoman with her Husband, and the other ſlaves were brought to the Market at <hi>Algiers,</hi> where the Chriſtians are wont to be ſold. The <hi>Turks, Moors, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who were not wont to ſee the faſhions of the <hi>French</hi>-woman, with their hair powder'd, and their heads neatly dreſs'd, look'd on her with much admiration. She ſaid to ſome Chriſtians who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd with her, and comforted her, <hi>My onely fear is, that they will make me renounce my Religion.</hi> It ſeems God was pleas'd with the fear of that woman; for the <hi>French</hi> Conſul prevail'd ſo far with the Baſſa, that the ſelling of her was ſuſpended, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſome league with the <hi>French.</hi> But the true cauſe proceeded from the avarice of the Baſſa (as will be ſeen anon) who made no account of the peace; but in regard the <hi>French</hi>-Maſter had made no oppoſition, the Conſul alledg'd that the Ship was no lawful prize.</p>
               <p>This in my judgement was an invention of the Baſſa's, who agreed well enough with the Conſul, to declare the Ship free, and ſo to defraud the Pyrate and the ſoldiers, and thereupon it was concluded, that the Maſter and his wife ſhould have their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, leaving the Ship and its loading to be diſpos'd of to the advantage of the Baſſa.

               <head>RELATION XI. Of the ingratitude of a <hi>Portuguez</hi> Slave.</head>
               <p>I Knew at <hi>Algiers</hi> a famous Pyrat named the <hi>Grand Moro,</hi> by country a <hi>Moſabi,</hi> which is a Nation of poor <hi>Alarbes,</hi> of little account, upon this ſcore, that they love the Kitchin much better than the Camp. They commonly deal in Tripes, and are very deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their countenances; for they are neither Blacks nor White, but look as if their faces were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually Oyl'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grand Moro</hi> came to <hi>Algiers,</hi> being about twelve years of Age, and growing weary of the Tripe-trade, he ſtruck in among the Pyrats, in the quality of a Boy belonging to one of the Captains; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual being abroad at Sea, and in divers engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he came to be an able Sea-man, and a good Souldier, and ſo got into ſuch repute, that they who put out the Galleys made him Captain of a ſmall Ship, afterwards of a greater of thirty Guns, till at laſt he came to be Captain of a Galley.</p>
               <p>This ſame <hi>Grand Moro</hi> was a terrour to all the <hi>Christian</hi> Ships, which came into the Mediterranean, and was by all the <hi>Turks</hi> accounted a ſecond, God <hi>Mars.</hi> I believe that if the Grand Seignor had given
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56140:80"/>
him the abſolute command of the Sea, as <hi>Sultan Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> gave it to the Arch-pyrat <hi>Barberoſſa</hi> in the laſt Age, his. Victories would have ſurpaſs'd thoſe of all the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Generals. For he was a Lyon in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and a Lamb in his victories, treating his ſubdu'd Enemies with extraordinary mildneſs.</p>
               <p>Among many other Slaves which the <hi>Grand Moro</hi> had, there was one <hi>Portuguez,</hi> who, when he was aſhore waited on him in his Chamber, and at Sea as a Secretary. This <hi>Portuguez</hi> had ſerv'd his Patron very faithfully for ſome years, both at Sea and Aſhore. One day the <hi>Grand Moro</hi> was cruſing with his Ship neer the Coaſt of <hi>Portugal</hi>; he call'd his Slave, and ſaid to him, <hi>You have ſerv'd me faithfully ſo many years, I now ſet you at Liberty.</hi> Whereupon he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Shallop to be made ready to ſet him Aſhore. While the Ship was Sailing towards the Land, he went ſecretly to the ſtern of the Ship, and opened his Patron's cheſt (for he had the Keys) and took out ſome Shirts, and for fear of being diſcover'd, put them about him under his cloaths: The Shallop was let down, and the <hi>Portuguez</hi> delivering up the Keys of the Cheſt, took his laſt leave of his Patron. He was ſet Aſhore, the Shallop return'd, and the Ship kept on her courſe. Some days after, the <hi>Grand Moro</hi> would change his Linnen; but he was diſappointed, for it was carri'd away by that ungrateful Slave. He fell into ſuch a paſſion, that he ſaid, <hi>I ſwear by the Grand Seignor's life, that if that ungrateful Chriſtian ever come into my hands again, he ſhall be chain'd to the Oar as long as he lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much about the ſame time there happen'd a very remarkable accident. The General <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:56140:81"/>
having loſt a Diamond of great Value, order'd his Slaves to look every where for it, and among others, one of them, a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> found it. He preſented the Diamond to <hi>Pegelin,</hi> who gladly receiving it gave the Slave for his reward half a Patacoon, ſaying to him, <hi>Here take this, brute Beaſt without judgement, and buy a Halter to hang thy ſelf withall; thou hadſt gotten thy Liberty, and thou couldſt not keep it. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelin</hi> was as ungrateful towards his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Slave, as the <hi>Portuguez</hi> had been towards the <hi>Grand Moro.</hi>

This <hi>Bulcebas</hi> was a Renegado, and had been a Slave of my Patron <hi>Mahomet Celibi Oiga</hi>'s, and liv'd in the ſame ſtreet with <hi>Mahomet Celibi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the news of the death of this <hi>Bulcebas,</hi> my Patroneſs accompani'd by two Women-Negroes, her Slaves, and with all the Women in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, went into the Widdow's houſe, and as ſoon as they were got in, they began to weep, lament, cry out, and torment themſelves as people out of their wits, and one of her Women was employ'd in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſtriking with an Iron bar upon a Table, which
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56140:81"/>
made ſuch a horrid noiſe, that a Man would have ſaid the ſtreet was full of diſtracted people. I knew well enough it was the manner of bewailing the Dead in <hi>Africk.</hi> But when my Patroneſs came home, I made as if I knew not the reaſon of all thoſe Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ask'd her why ſhe had wept, and how her face came to be all ſcratch'd and bloody. She repli'd, it was the cuſtom of the Country, and that they ſo bewail'd the Death of Friends and Relations. <hi>It does very well, as for your part,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Deceas'd perſon, but why ſhould your Woman-ſlave here be ſcratch'd and bloody as you are, ſhe, who had no acquaintance with him, for ſhe is new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to you, and is yet Savage?</hi> My Patroneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd, <hi>ſhe did as ſhe ſaw others do, without any other reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the word <hi>Savage,</hi> it is to be obſerv'd, that the Kingdom of <hi>Algiers</hi> hath many little Tributary Kings belonging to it, and ſome of them, for want of Money, pay their annual Tribute in Men. Theſe men are either <hi>Arabian</hi> Priſoners, commonly called <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Arabians</hi>; or for want of Priſoners they pay in their own Subjects.

               <p>WHile I was in the <hi>Maſmora</hi> at <hi>Tituan,</hi> a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Pyrat came thither with an Image of our Lady's, carv'd in Wood, which he had taken out of ſome <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Ship, and proffer'd it to ſell. All the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Slaves got about him, and proffer'd a Chequine of Gold for it, that the Image might not be expos'd to contempt, or receive any injury. The <hi>Moor</hi> obſerving the zeal of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> told them they muſt give four times as much for it, or if they would not give it, he would burn the Image.</p>
               <p>The devout <hi>Spaniards</hi> were extreamly troubled at the threats of the <hi>Moor,</hi> and were upon reſolving to give what he demanded. And to make up the ſum, moſt of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would contribute all they had; for in the <hi>Maſmora,</hi> he who can ſpend a Patacoon a moneth is not to be accounted poor.</p>
               <p>I look'd on what paſs'd without ſaying a word; at laſt I concern'd my ſelf in the buſineſs, and ſaid to the <hi>Spaniards; Gentlemen, this Image is not worth ſo much.</hi> They immediately anſwer'd, <hi>We do not buy the Image for its value, but that it may not receive any injury.</hi> I told them, <hi>Your zeal is to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but do you not conſider, that if this</hi> Moor <hi>ſhould carry hence four Chequines of Gold for an Image, which is not worth four Ryalls, he will go and report it all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had given four Chequines for it, they had loſt their money, the <hi>Moor</hi> would have laugh'd at them, and the Catholick Religion would have been ſlighted and derided: But the prudent Zeal of that Religious man ſav'd the money of thoſe poor Slaves, frightned the Barbarous <hi>Moor,</hi> and ſatisfi'd the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> that the honour which Catholicks render to Images conſiſts not in the materials whereof they are made, as <hi>Pagans, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and ignorant perſons do imagine.</p>

               <p>We march'd one after another, every one with a diſh cover'd, wherein the preſents were. <hi>Amet</hi> brought the ſlaves to his Miſtreſſe's door, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, he ſtaid in the ſtreet, and the ſlaves went into the houſe, which was built after the <hi>Italian</hi> way of Architecture, with a Quadrangle and Galleries all about it. The future Bride ſate on a cuſhion of red Velvet wrought all over with Silver-lace, at the entrance of a low room. Every one of the ſlaves ſet down his diſh on a place prepar'd for the receiving of it, making a low reverence to the future Bride.</p>
               <p>The other ſlaves had taught M. <hi>Caloën</hi> and me theſe words, <hi>Ey la a, Ey la a,</hi> which we were to pronounce as loud as ere we could, after we had ſet all the diſhes on the ground; which was done. And preſently after the ſlaves belonging to the Houſe, both men and women, anſwer'd in the ſame Muſick. That done, we all made a low reverence, and went out of the houſe.</p>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56140:85"/>
they think the women beautiful, when they are ſomewhat inclin'd to fatneſs. That news pleas'd <hi>Amet</hi> well, for he had never ſeen his Miſtreſſe's face, in regard it is the cuſtome of the Country, that the women, when they go along the ſtreets, ſhould have two veils over their faces, one which covers the fore-head to the eyes, the other coming down over the noſe. When they are at home, they are not ſo ſhy of the Chriſtian ſlaves; for they ſay the Chriſtians are blind; but if a Mahometane ſhould ſee their faces uncover'd, 'twere a great ſin; and it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that a young man ſhould ſpeak with a Maid who ſtands upon her honeſty, in her Father's or other Relations houſes.</p>
               <p>Me-thinks this kind of demeanour ſeems very ſtrange; but it is requiſite in that Country, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the lewd inclinations of the Women. For notwithſtanding all the caution of the Men to keep their Daughter's and Wives at home, they find out a hundred inventions to get abroad, ſometimes upon viſits, ſometimes to Bath themſelves, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under pretence of devotion (an invention ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known alſo in <hi>Europe</hi>) to go to ſuch a <hi>Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi> or <hi>Santon</hi>; and ſo they proſtitute themſelves, if they have any convenience, to all they meet, though they be common Rogues, Sodomites, and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſort of people.</p>

               <p>WHen I liv'd at <hi>Alli Pegelin's</hi> Bath, we were five hundred and fifty Chriſtian ſlaves, who were to get our daily bread by our induſtry. 'Tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a thing worthy admiration, to conſider how every one made his advantage of his induſtry in that neceſſity. The moſt common exerciſe of that School was Theft. There was in the Bath an <hi>Italian</hi> Slave, whoſe military name was <hi>Fontimama</hi>; he preſum'd ſo much on his Art of Stealing, that he would often invite ſome of his companions to dine with him at noon, on what he ſhould get between that time and the hour appointed to ſet their Jaw-bones a-grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>One day about ten in the morning, he invited my Companion <hi>R. Saldens</hi> to dine with him, condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he would take a turn with him about the City. <hi>Fontimama</hi> carry'd <hi>Saldens</hi> among ſome Jews, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of money, whereof there are many at <hi>Algiers,</hi> taking up their ſtandings in the Streets with a little Table, where they change Patacoons, and half-Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coons into <hi>Aſpers,</hi> making ſome ſmall gain by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. <hi>Fontimama</hi> ask'd for <hi>Aſpers</hi> for a half-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacoon, ſhewing a piece which was good; he help'd the Jew to tell them, and after they had done he proffer'd the Jew a counterfeit piece. The Jew,

who knew money well enough, would have his <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From him they went to another Jew, and ſo to another, till at laſt he had done his work ſo well, that about noon <hi>Fonti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mama</hi> return'd to the Bath with a couple of Pullets, and money enough to procure their skins full of Wine.</p>
               <p>Another time being in our Patron's Galley on the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> before a place called <hi>Terrevec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, Fontimama</hi> with ſome other ſlaves were ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore to take in freſh water for the Galley. The <hi>Alarbes,</hi> Inhabitants of the Country, came preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the Slaves, asking them whether they had any Iron to ſell (for it is very dear about that place) and the ſlaves ſometimes ſold them Nails and ſuch pieces of old Iron. <hi>Fontimama</hi>'s Companions ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſold all they had, the buyers told their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that they had bought Iron of the ſlaves of the Galley.</p>

                  </gap> hundred weight at his leggs, that he might not ſtir thence; which was done, to haſten the payment of his ranſom. This man was a kind of Secretary to the ſlaves of the <hi>Low-Countries, Dunkirk,</hi> and <hi>Hamborough,</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways employ'd in writing of Letters for them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other reward, ſave that he would accept of a diſh of drink. And whereas he was, by reaſon of his Letters always accompany'd by <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>-men, who came to him, and made him drink for his pains, when he had done, he made a ſhift to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56140:87"/>
ſubſiſt by that means. For the Taverner, at whoſe Lodge he wrote, found him meat all that day, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital of the advantage he made by ſelling his Wine to thoſe who employ'd him.</p>
               <p>There was alſo a <hi>French</hi> Cavalier, who had been ſix years in ſlavery, yet had not receiv'd a peny out of his Country. He was always well clad, for a ſlave; did eat and drink of the beſt; and many times invited his Companions to dine with him. He had great acquaintances among the <hi>French</hi>-Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, who lent him money at intereſt, he being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to repay it at a certain time: But to pay ſome, he took up mony of others upon the ſame termes. Now all the Renegadoes being ſoldiers, and always abroad in the wars by Sea and Land, it happen'd that ſome of his Creditors died every year; and they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Relations, Wives, or Children, the Debt was paid at their deaths. And though there were ſome obligation in writing, it ſignify'd nothing, for the Cavalier being a ſlave, the obligation was of no force.</p>
               <p>I knew a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whom I ſhall here call <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigo,</hi> a perſon, who though far from being valiant, yet liv'd by the reputation of his ſword, that is, a kind of a Hector. Theſe people in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> are called <hi>Vendevuidas.</hi> This <hi>Rodrigo</hi> got his livelihood by compoſing differences between the Slaves, bringing them to drink together after they were reconciled, and making good cheer among them. But it was his main buſineſs to ſet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> together by the ears, and afterwards to mediate between them, and take his ſhare of the drink at their argee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:56140:88"/>
                  <hi>Rodrigo</hi> would be always haunting the Taverns of the Bath, where he thought the greateſt Drunkards reſorted; for commonly, when the reckoning came to be paid, there was ſome diſpute between the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Turks, and the Chriſtian Taverner. <hi>Rodrigo</hi> compos'd thoſe differences with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> gravity, ſaying, <hi>Gentlemen, it is ſufficient, that a perſon of my rank and quality ſays it.</hi> And when the Turks would not pay the Taverner, <hi>Rodrigo</hi> gave notice of it to the Guardian, who preſently lock'd up the Bath; and when the drunken Turks drew their Knives, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigo</hi> came behind them with a Ladder, and getting the Turks head between the rounds, laid him all along (which he might do to part them, for a Chriſtian is not to ſtrike a Turk upon pain of death) and then the Guardian came in, and caus'd the Turk to pay, or made him leave ſomething in pawn. For ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices as theſe was <hi>Rodrigo</hi> much eſteem'd among the Taverners of the Bath, having for his reward a good ſupper.</p>
               <p>There was a <hi>Muſcovite</hi> among us, about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years of age, not able to do any thing of hard labour, as having been bruis'd. He made clean the neceſſary houſe of the Bath, and every week went a begging of alms of the Slaves for his pains. With what was given him he made a ſhift to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</p>
               <p>There was alſo a young Lad, a <hi>Hamburgher,</hi> who at his being taken had loſt an arm, and ſo could not do much for his livelihood, and yet the Patron allow'd him nothing. But a Country-man of his having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him half a Patacoon, he bought with it a pair of Nine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pins, and Pidgeon-holes. He went out of the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56140:88"/>
City, neer the gate, hir'd out his Pins, and the Holes to the children who were playing there, and ſo made a ſhift to live pretty well. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who could keep Taverns liv'd like Princes among the ſlaves, and in a ſhort time got as much as paid their ranſom. For thoſe who can get in a Pipe of wine in <hi>September,</hi> which coſts them ſixteen Patacoons, will, by retail, make forty or fifty of it.</p>
               <p>There were alſo among us ſix Surgeons, who got much mony, for they were ſent for by the Citizens. But whereas ſome men are ordinarily loſt by mony and good cheer, theſe came to their deſtruction by Women and Wine.</p>
               <p>There were ſome employ'd themſelves in footing ſtockings, and others got their livelihood by ſome kind of Games. But the profeſſion moſt us'd was ſtealing. Every night there was publikely ſold what ever had been ſtollen the day before, as I have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more at large in the diſcourſe of my Captivity. The Prieſts liv'd on the alms of the Chriſtian ſlaves.</p>
               <p>In fine, all of all Nations made ſome ſhift to live, ſave onely the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who it ſeems are not ſo ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as others, and it ſeems alſo they have no great kindneſs one for another. The Winter I was in the Bath, I obſerv'd there died above twenty of them out of pure want. Nor are they therefore much eſteem'd by the <hi>Turks</hi>; for an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man is ſold at ſixty or ſeventy Patacoons, when a <hi>Spaniard</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> is valued at one hundred and fifty, or two hundred.

               <p>IN the year 1641. there was at <hi>Algiers</hi> a <hi>Diſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceate Carmelite,</hi> in whoſe converſation it might be clearly ſeen, that a good life and prudence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd his doctrine. This reverend man was known by the name of Father <hi>Angeli,</hi> by Country a <hi>Genoueſe.</hi> He had made his reſidence ſome years in <hi>Perſia,</hi> by order from his Superior, as he often told me himſelf. Intending to return to <hi>Italy</hi> through <hi>Turkey</hi> with a Paſs-port from the Grand Seignor, he and his Companion, a <hi>Portuguez,</hi> were taken by the Pyrates. Theſe two Religious men being brought before the Baſſa, ſhew'd their Paſs-port, but to no purpoſe, for the Baſſa ſaid to them, <hi>Write to</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, <hi>and make your complaints of me, if you think good; if you are unjustly dealt with, you must bear it patiently.</hi> Being to be ſold, <hi>Pegelin</hi> bought them, and ſent them to the Bath with the other ſlaves.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Angeli</hi> ſaid Maſs every day, and perform'd all other Eccleſiaſtical Functions, and in a ſhort time, I know not by what ſecret inclination people had for his Vertues, he was belov'd of all, not onely <hi>Catholicks,</hi> but alſo <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, Schiſmaticks,</hi> and <hi>Nicolaitans</hi>; for the Bath

If there happen'd any difference among the ſlaves, what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoever they were of, he perſwaded them to a reconciliation: Which endeavors of his brought down a bleſſing on all his other actions. If any ſlave were ſick, Father <hi>Angeli</hi> took care to get ſome good thing made for him; and if any ſlave who came to Confeſſion, made any diſcovery of his wants, Father <hi>Angeli</hi> gave him an alms, and he was never without mony, by the means of ſome devout ſlaves, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted him with the diſtribution of their Almes; ſo that the vertues of this Religious man gain'd him the reputation of a Saint even among the <hi>Turks.</hi>

Pegelin</hi> ask'd him, Why? The Religious man anſwer'd, <hi>In the firſt place you are a perſon of no Religion, and all your thoughts are bent on the robbing and ruining of the Chriſtians.

               <p>By this ſtory it is apparent, that truth may be told to great Perſons, though tranſcendently impious, without any danger, when Prudence hath made choice of a convenient time to do it.</p>

               <p>THe Poiſoning of people is a crime very common in <hi>Africk.</hi> While I was at <hi>Algiers</hi> the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates took a Frigot which had been made at <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> The building of it pleas'd all the Captains of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, inſomuch that there was a certain emulation who ſhould have her. But the Baſſa's proportion of the ſlaves being one of every eight, and of every Ship the one half, the Baſſa's Brother, who was Captain of a Pirateer, had the Frigot. The <hi>Grand Moro,</hi> a famous Captain, was ſo much troubled at it, that he ſaid publickly he had been injur'd, the Frigot had been deny'd at the rate he had proffer'd for it, and that the Baſſa's Brother was good onely to divide the booty, after himſelf had taken the pains to get it.</p>
               <p>That diſcourſe was related to the Baſſa's Brother,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56140:91"/>
who was much incens'd thereat, and bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf how he ſhould be reveng'd. He could not ſend him a Challenge, becauſe it was not the cuſtom, and beſides, he was no match for ſuch an enemy as the <hi>Grand Moro.</hi> He therefore diſſembled his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſome daies after, invited the <hi>Grand Moro</hi> with ſome other Captains to dine with him, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them after the beſt manner he could, the better to cloak his malicious deſign.</p>

This ſlow operation of the poiſon cauſes many <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> to renounce the Chriſtian Faith. The reaſon is, that many Turks are addicted to the abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſin, and the women are eaſily debauch'd by their ſlaves. Whence it comes, that having continu'd in their lewdneſs ſometime, the women ſay to them, <hi>If you will renounce your Religion, I will marry you, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of a poor ſlave, make you Maſter of this houſe and all I have.</hi> Theſe promiſes are tempting, and moſt of

the ſlaves, being ordinary Sea-men, and poor in their own Country, and conſequently oblig'd to get their livelihood by hard labor, they are inveigled by theſe taking appearances of liberty and wealth, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſollicitations of a handſome woman, and ſo prefer the temporal before eternal happineſs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus agreed, the women give their husbands a ſlow poiſon, ſo that the husband dying ſome months after, the widdow marries the Renegado ſlave. There is no great inquiſition made into theſe crimes by the Magiſtrate; inſomuch that there are many who boaſt of their excellence in that Art.</p>
               <p>It comes into my mind, that I once over-heard two <hi>French</hi> Renegadoes diſcourſing to this purpoſe.

               <p>Having been five months his ſlave, I went to ſpeak with him concerning my ranſome; and to move him to compaſſion, I kiſs'd the ſleeve of his Garment which hung down to the ground (an <hi>African</hi> comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) and ſaid to him, <hi>May it pleaſe your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I have been five months your ſlave; I queſtion not but your excellency is by this time ſufficiently inform'd what I am, to wit, a poor ſoldier, and not a perſon of wealth and quality, as your Excellency ſaid you knew well enough when you bought me.</hi> (For the Turks are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry liberal in giving titles to the new ſlaves, calling one a Cavalier, another, a Count's Son, and ſaying the others are very rich, by that means to get a greater ranſom out of them.) <hi>Pegelin</hi> made anſwer, <hi>I know not yet who you are, but if I agree with you about your ranſom, though I ſhould afterwards come to know that you are much richer then I took you to be, I ſhall keep my word, as I have done with ſeveral other perſons,</hi> naming to me among others a Merchant of <hi>Genua,</hi> called <hi>Marco Antonio Falconi.</hi> But as I have ſaid

They told me that they had been Eye-witneſſes of it againſt their wills; for they then row'd in the Galley; and they told me the whole ſtory, to this effect.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Genua</hi>-Merchant, who had reſided long at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> where he had carryed on a great Trade, being grown very rich, and having but one child, a Daughter, thought it time to give over trading, and return into his Country.

They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept in ſight of land, for fear of meeting with the Turkiſh Pyrates. Being on the coaſt of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia, Pegelin,</hi> whoſe Gallies were thereabouts, diſcovers the Brigantine at a great diſtance, and gave order for the chaſing of her. Thoſe of the Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, endeavour'd all they could with the help of Sails and Oars to get to land; but the Gallies, by reaſon of their abundance of Rowers, being come within Musket-ſhot of the Brigantine, the <hi>Genua</hi> Merchant and the Marriners caſt themſelves into the Sea, and made a ſhift to ſwim a ſhore; and the young Girle was onely left in the Brigantine. Some Turks by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelin</hi>'s order went into the Brigantine, to bring it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>The Merchant being got aſhore, and ſeeing his Daughter in the hands of the Turks, went as far as he

The Turks were aſtoniſh'd to ſee ſuch a thing, and <hi>Pegelin</hi> himſelf, who ſent out the Boat for him. The Voluntary-priſoner was brought before the General <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi>; who, jeering him, ask'd, why, having ſo fortunately eſcap'd, he would of his own accord come into ſlavery, which makes the moſt confident to tremble.</p>
               <p>The Merchant, perceiving that he who ſpoke to him was the General, began this ſpeech in the <hi>Italian</hi> Language, which <hi>Pegelin</hi> underſtood very well. <hi>Your Excellency is aſtoniſh'd to ſee me voluntarily render my ſelf up a ſlave, a condition, which men, by a natural inſtinct, have all the reaſon in the world to fear.

               <p>A Gentleman of one of the moſt illuſtrious fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of <hi>Portugal,</hi> whom we ſhall here call <hi>Dom Oenophilo,</hi> had been engag'd in many Duels and differences. But every one being blind in his own paſſion, he muſt needs have committed many great miſcarriages; for notwithſtanding his great quality, he had been twice ſentenc'd to death at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and yet by the interceſſion of that powerful Advocate Mr. <hi>Mony,</hi> which ſometimes interprets the Laws as he pleaſes; and with the aſſiſtance of his Friends, <hi>D. Oenophilo</hi> was twice pardon'd. In the year 1637. he was further accus'd of ſome Murther, and to avoid the rigor of the Law, he embark'd in the nigh-time with his wife to go for the <hi>Indies,</hi> the common San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of the <hi>Portuguez</hi> Malefactors. Having been ſome days at Sea, the Ship was taken by the <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:56140:94"/>
Pyrats; and <hi>Dom Oenophilo</hi> and his Wife were ſold to a Moor named <hi>Cagarino.</hi> This new ſlave agreed with his Patron for the ranſoming of himſelf and his wife, conditionally that he ſhould remain as a Hoſtage, and that his wife ſhould return home at liberty to ſend over the ranſom. His wife was ſent away, and he devoutly expected the mony; and being not oblig'd to work as the other ſlaves were, Idleneſs found him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to do; for he fell in love with his Patroneſs, and not daring at firſt to diſcover his affection, he ſate down in hopes of a convenient time to do it. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd that he made acquaintance with two Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> who were <hi>French</hi>-men, and ſlaves. Theſe obſerving in <hi>Dom Oenophilo</hi> a great judgement, noble education, and an extraordinary natural eloquence, it ſo far heightned their friendſhip, that the two Knights invited <hi>Dom Oenophilo</hi> to drink a glaſs of wine, and preſs'd him to take a greater doſe of it, then he was wont to do in <hi>Portugal.</hi> Having his head full of wine, and his mind of Love, he return'd home, and began to court his Patroneſs. His Patron coming in, and ſurpriſing him at it fell upon the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, and gave him two or three good cuffes oth' ear. <hi>Dom Oenophilo,</hi> who was no more circumſpect in his ſlavery then he had been when he was at liberty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd the blows in the ſame coin, together with the intereſt. His Patron incens'd upon a double account, as well for the blows he had receiv'd, as for what had paſs'd between him and his wife, being mad to be reveng'd for that double affront, ran ſtreight to the Baſſa's Palace, and made his complaints, requiring, that, according to the Turkiſh Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſhould be burnt alive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Order was given to the <hi>Sauſes</hi> (who are the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56140:95"/>
Officers of Juſtice) to bring the Criminal before the Tribunal to anſwer for himſelf. <hi>Dom Oenophilo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought before the Baſſa, he ſaid to him; <hi>You are accus'd for having beaten a Turk, and which is worſe, your Patron, and according to the Laws of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, you are either to renounce the Chriſtian Religion, or to be burnt alive. Dom Oenophilo</hi> deny'd the fact, alledging that he had onely defended himſelf from the blows, and he brought in a Turk for a witneſs, who ſpoke on his behalf. But the Baſſa would not admit of his excuſes, accounting the Patron's accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation a ſufficient proof. He pronounc'd the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence without any further ſolemnity, that <hi>Oenophilo</hi> ſhould take his choice, either to renounce, or be burnt alive. The unfortunate man finding himſelf ſo put to it, anſwer'd, as a good Chriſtian, and reſolute Knight, that he would not renounce. Whereupon the ſentence was pronounc'd, that <hi>Dom Oenophilo</hi> ſhould be burnt alive. All things were prepar'd, and the <hi>Sauſes</hi> conducted the Criminal to his puniſhment; but the Baſſa commanded the execution to be ſuſpended till further order. The Baſſa minding his own concerns above all things, found a way to make his advantage of that offence, and propos'd this reaſon to thoſe of his Councel, who had given their voices for the ſentence. <hi>If this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>had kill'd another ſlave, his Patron would have been oblig'd to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the dead ſlave, or to reſign the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to be diſpos'd of to the advantage of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd Slave's Patron.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56140:95"/>
we have condemn'd him to death, by which condemnation, his Patron hath loſt the propriety he had in him, and it is devolv'd to me, as repreſenting the perſon of the Grand Seignor. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the power to pardon ſuch as are condemn'd, I give that ſlave his life, and ſo it is conſequent that he belongs to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This reaſon was approv'd by all the <hi>Agas,</hi> who are of his Councel. <hi>Dom Oenophilo</hi> is declar'd the Baſſa's ſlave by the Councel of the <hi>Agas.</hi> And the Patron having loſt the propriety of his ſlave, and receiv'd blowes, got alſo the reputation of being Cuckolded by him. <hi>Dom Oenophilo</hi> was ſent among the ſlaves of the Baſſa, having at each legge a Garter of a hundred weight of Iron. When I came to <hi>Algiers,</hi> he liv'd in the Baſſa's Stables, where I was intimately acquainted with him, and found him a perſon full of Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.

               <p>IN the year 1639. there was at <hi>Algiers</hi> a Turkiſh Soldier, who had been engag'd in many courſes at Sea as a private Soldier, and with much thrift ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got together the ſum of two hundred Patacoons, he thought himſelf rich enough to have the command of a little Veſſel. He bought ſuch a one as his ſtock could purchace, that is an open one, without any Deck, and ſet up a flagg as a ſignal for ſuch as would venture to Sea along with him, that they ſhould come aboard. Having got together ſixteen ſoldiers, Turks and Renegadoes, they began to cruze up and down towards the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> between <hi>Santaluz</hi> and <hi>Cadiz.</hi> Some Merchants of <hi>Cadiz</hi> had a deſign to ſend aboard an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, which lay in the Port of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taluz,</hi> ſixty barrs of Silver. To avoid diſcovery (for to ſend ſilver out of the Country without the King's permiſſion was a capital crime) the Merchants had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with a certain perſon, who gave in ſecurity for the delivery of the ſixty barres of Silver into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship. According to their contract, he came in the night time to the place where the Silver was, accompany'd by eighteen Adventurers, arm'd with Swords, little Bucklers, and four Muskets, Arms ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent to defend themſelves againſt the Officers of Juſtice.

               <p>IN the diſcourſe of my unfortunate voyage, I rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, how that ſailing from S. <hi>Sebaſtians</hi> in <hi>Biſcay</hi> towards <hi>England,</hi> our Ship with its loading, and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Paſſengers were taken by the Turkiſh Pyrates. Among theſe ſixteen, there were two young men, <hi>Biſcayans,</hi> one named <hi>Turineo,</hi> the other <hi>John,</hi> who came aboard us with a deſign to go to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> to their Uncle <hi>Dom Turineo de Fuſtamente, Pagador</hi> of the naval <hi>Armado</hi> of <hi>Flanders.</hi> Theſe two young men, by our common misfortune, fell into ſlavery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Turks. They had never been out of their Country before, and that new courſe of life, amidſt ſo many inconveniences and miſeries, went extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the hair with them. But there being many <hi>Biſcayans</hi> among <hi>Pegelin</hi>'s ſlaves, and they (as I often obſerv'd) very ready to aſſiſt their Country-men, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Turineo</hi> receiv'd ſome relief of them, and ſo made a ſhift to rub out pretty well. They had not been there long ere I obſerv'd, that a Renegado, a <hi>Biſcayan,</hi> under pretence of being their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, came every day to the Bath, to diſcourſe with the two young men. And whereas that place is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for young perſons brought up in a Country, where the abhominable ſin of Sodomy is unknown, I was afraid the Renegado's kindneſs proceeded from
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56140:101"/>
ſome deſign he had to debauch them, and ſo gave them notice that they ſhould take heed of him. They thank'd me for my care of them, telling me, that the Renegado gave them ſhirts, ſhoos, and ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that he did it onely upon the account of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards them, as Country-men, and that he never ſpoke to them of renouncing their Religion, nor of any debauchedneſs, and that they were in hopes by the aſſiſtance they receiv'd from him, to drive on ſome little trade as many other ſlaves did. Which I found afterwards that they did; for with the mony they had of the Renegado, they now and then bought a bottle of Brandy, which they ſold by retail, and within the ſpace of three months, they made ſuch gains, that they were partners with others in a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern of the Bath; ſo that they liv'd very well for ſlaves. I left them driving on the ſame trade in <hi>January</hi> 1642. when I return'd for Chriſtendom. I brought a letter from them to their Uncle, <hi>Dom Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineo de Fuſtamente,</hi> whom I acquainted in what condition I had left his Nephews, and ſhew'd him the eaſieſt way for their redemption.</p>
               <p>About a year after <hi>Dom Turineo</hi> ſent to me to <hi>Bruges,</hi> the place of my reſidence, an Officer of his named <hi>Juan Baptista Terris,</hi> to tell me, that I ſhould do him a great kindneſs, if I would come over to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> to enquire among ſome Turkiſh Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners taken by the Pyrates, whether there were any fit to be exchang'd for his Nephews. Being come to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> I went, upon <hi>D.

And after I had examin'd that Captain, and other Turks whom I knew, and among others an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Renegado, who had been a Gunner in one of the Pyrates who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us, and finding no likelihood of making an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, (for they were all poor) I was juſt come to the door to be gone, when one of them ſaid to me, <hi>What, do you not know me?</hi> I anſwer'd, <hi>No, Friend, I do not.</hi> Whereupon the other reply'd, <hi>When I ſaw you last, you were a poor ſlave, as you ſee me now.

my Religion is to be attributed to the cruelty of my Patron, and here is a man</hi> (pointing to me) <hi>who can teſtifie how I behav'd my ſelf towards the Chriſtian ſlaves.</hi> The words of the Renegado were ſo preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, that Madam <hi>Malquarto</hi> (who was the Miſtreſs of the houſe, for <hi>Dom Turineo</hi> tabled with her) roſe up, and gave the Renegado a ſhirt, and a good piece of mony. The next day <hi>D. Turineo</hi> had him recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to the Catholick Church, by a Jeſuit, named Father <hi>Carion,</hi> and afterwards got him ſet at liberty. They bought him Sea-man's cloaths and put him into the Armado, and ſo he eſcap'd rowing all his life in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gallies, as his other Renegado-compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were forc'd to do.</p>
               <p>This happen'd in the year 1643. and three years after, walking on the <hi>Burgh,</hi> at <hi>Bruges</hi> with ſome Friends, we ſaw coming out at the great Gate two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captains, marching very fiercely with their Canes in their hands, upon which we were ſaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelves, <hi>Thoſe Gentlemen are not a little proud of their Captain-ſhips.</hi> Coming neerer us, I knew one of them to be the fore-mentioned <hi>John,</hi> to whom I ſaid, <hi>Pray Sir, is not your name Don John?</hi> whereto he anſwering it was; <hi>And were you not a ſlave at Algiers?

I intreated him to dine with me, but he being on a haſty march, we onely took a glaſs of wine together. I told him the ſtory of the Renegado, which he was glad to hear; and he told me, how he had row'd in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and ſuffer'd much; but that then his friends had

               <head>RELATION XXIX. Of the fidelity of a husband, and the unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his wife.</head>
               <p>IN the year 1638. the Gallies of <hi>Algiers</hi> landed ſome Turks on Chriſtian land, who being condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by a treacherous Renegado, a Native of the Country, took many Chriſtians, who were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſold at <hi>Algiers.</hi> Among theſe ſlaves, there was a man whom we will call <hi>Joſeph,</hi> with his wife, named <hi>Vipra,</hi> both bought by <hi>Mahomet Celibi Oiga; Joſeph's</hi> work was to dreſs the Horſes and the Mules, and <hi>Vipra</hi> waited on <hi>Mahomet's</hi> wife. In the year 1639. <hi>Mahomet Celibi</hi> ſaid one night to <hi>Joſeph, To morrow morning at break of day, take the Mule, and go to Babazon-Gate, and there you will find ſome Chriſtian ſlaves with Horſes and Mules going two leagues hence for coals, go along with them, and bring a load.</hi> The next day, <hi>Joſeph</hi> goes to the Gate, but finding no body there, he goes forwards, thinking the other ſlaves had been before. Having gone about an hours riding, all along the Sea-ſide, he ſees a Bark, goes as neer it as he could, to diſcover the men, and perceives they were Chriſtians; whereupon he turns the Mule looſe, and runs to the Bark. The Marriners receiv'd him, and told him they came from <hi>Majorca,</hi> with order to carry away ſome ſlaves of that Country, and whereas the ſlaves came not, thoſe of the Bark were afraid they had not receiv'd
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56140:104"/>
the letter, whereby notice was ſent them, and that themſelves might be diſcover'd, in regard it was day. They proffer'd <hi>Joſeph</hi> a hundred Patacoons, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to carry him along with them, if he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the City, and give notice to thoſe ſlaves of <hi>Majorca.</hi> But <hi>Joſeph</hi> would not leave a certainty for an uncertainty, and ſaid, I <hi>am now confident of my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, whereas if</hi> I <hi>return to the City, it may be your deſign will be diſcover'd, and</hi> I <hi>ſhall be made more a ſlave then ever, and if it ever come to be known, that</hi> I <hi>have had any hand in the buſineſs, three hundred blows with a cudgel will hardly excuſe me. Joſeph</hi> had hardly made an end of excuſing himſelf, ere ſome Turks paſs'd by that way, who ſeeing that thoſe of the Bark were habited after the Chriſtian mode, (wherein I conceive thoſe undertakers had miſtaken themſelves, that they had not been habited like <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>) began to raiſe an alarm. Thoſe of the Bark fearing they might be ſurpriz'd by ſome Brigantine, made all the haſt they could to Sea, having <hi>Joſeph</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them. The Bark ſoon got out of ſight, and the alarm ceas'd. The Chriſtian ſlaves whom <hi>Joſeph</hi> thought to be before him, were but come thither when the alarm ceas'd, ſo that finding the Mule, they ſaid among themſelves, <hi>This is</hi> Mahomet Celibi's <hi>Mule, let us take her home with us; his ſlave hath either been kill'd or taken by the Alarbes.</hi> The Mule was brought home, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> given over for a dead man by his Patron, and lamented by his wife <hi>Vipra.</hi> But in a ſhort time, her ſorrow ceas'd, for ſhe fell in love with a Renegado, named <hi>Aſſan,</hi> who had been a ſlave of the ſame Patron <hi>Mahomet's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Joſeph</hi> got to <hi>Majorca,</hi> and

<q>Sir, by the great mercy of God, I recover'd my liberty the day you ſent me for coals, by means of a Bark of <hi>Majorca.</hi> I cannot imagine you will charge me with any unfaithfulneſs for doing what I have done, for every man endeavors the retrival of his Liberty. While I was your ſlave, you demanded of me five hundred Patacoons for the ranſom of my wife and my ſelf, I ſend herewith order for the payment of the ſaid ſum, accounting my ſelf ſtill a ſlave, as long as my wife ſhall continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her liberty. I have ſuch a confidence of your kindneſs, that I preſume this proffer will not be unacceptable to you.</q>
This Letter was ſhewn to <hi>Vipra,</hi> who was not well pleaſed at it, for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhe bore the Renegado <hi>Aſſan</hi> had ſmother'd all the conjugal love ſhe ſhould have had for her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; ſo that ſhe ſaid publickly that ſhe would not return into her Country. That reſolution of hers troubled the good man <hi>Mahomet Celibi,</hi> for he would rather have receiv'd the five hundred Patacoons, and ſet <hi>Vipra</hi> at liberty. But his wife told him, <hi>Vipra is deſirous to embrace the Mahumetane Religion, and will you for five hundred Patacoons hinder a work ſo
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56140:105"/>
acceptable to our Prophet? Beſides, all the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood knows her deſign, and if you ſend her away, you will be look'd upon as a favourer of the Chriſtians.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe repreſentations of his wife, he thought fit to leave the buſineſs in ſuſpence.</p>
               <p>About that time I came to be ſlave to the ſame Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and having heard the ſtory of <hi>Vipra</hi> and her husband, I ſtood one day at the door with her, who ſaid to me, <hi>Why are you ſo melancholy?</hi> I anſwer'd, <hi>Becauſe I am not ſo happy as you are.</hi> She ask'd me why? I reply'd, <hi>Becauſe you may be ſet at liberty when you pleaſe, for I hear your Husband hath ſent five hundred Patacoons for your ranſom, and I wonder to find you ſo unwilling to return into your Country, to your Husband who is ſo kind, and ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to you, as alſo to exerciſe the Catholick Religion among your friends and Relations.</hi> She roundly made anſwer, <hi>A Turkiſh Garment will become me as well as a Spaniſh Petticoat.</hi> And with thoſe words ſhe left me and went into the houſe; whence it might eaſily be inferr'd, that the love ſhe had for her Gallant, was greater then what ſhe had for her Religion, Country, Husband, and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

               <head>RELATION XXX. A Scuffle between the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Portuguez</hi> Slaves.</head>
               <p>IN one of my former Relations I made mention of a Chriſtian Church at <hi>Algiers,</hi> which is in the Bath of the <hi>Duana,</hi> and that ſome <hi>Portuguez</hi> ſlaves had the keeping of the Altar in it. <hi>Aug.</hi> 15. 1641. being the Feaſt of the Aſſumption of our Bleſſed Lady, the Altar was richly dreſs'd, and among other Ornaments, there was upon the Altar the Armes of <hi>Portugal,</hi> with theſe words, <hi>Exaltat humiles, &amp; deponit ſuperbos.</hi> Service being ended, and moſt of the Chriſtians gone out, two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſlaves came into the Church, either to pray, or out of curioſity, to ſee the Ornaments, and coming up to the Altar, one of them, who underſtood two or three words of Latine begin to read what was written on the Arms of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ſaid to his Companion, who ask'd him what it meant; <hi>This ſignifies, God exalts the humble and pulls down the proud; this is ſpoken in contempt of our the Spaniſh Nation,</hi> for that year the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> had revolted. Whereupon, without any more ado, one of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> tears the Armes with the Inſcription, and caſt the pieces all about the place. This was no ſooner perceiv'd by a <hi>Portuguez</hi> ſlave, but the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had three or four good blows over the face ere he could get to the Church-door. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> defending themſelves
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56140:106"/>
made a ſhift to get out of the Church, through a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain part of the Bath, and though the place was full of <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> yet having made their way into the Street, all that were thereabouts at firſt made a ring about the Combatants. Afterwards, thoſe who were affected to the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reliev'd the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>; yet wanted there not great numbers of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguezes,</hi> who came in to the aſſiſtance of their Country-men; ſo that in leſs then half an hours time they ſeem'd to be two Armies of Chriſtian ſlaves engag'd, but having no other weapons, then their fiſts, ſome ſtones, and ſtaves. The Turks ſeeing this tumult of the ſlaves, enquir'd what the reaſon of it might be; which having underſtood, they ſaid to the ſlaves, <hi>You deſpicable crue of Dogs and Savages, in the firſt place get your liberty, and you may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at leaſure diſpute the differences of your Kings, in the Field, and not here.</hi> Whereupon, with ropes-ends, Bulls-pizzles, and cudgels, they parted the Combatants, and ſent them every one to his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

               <head>RELATION XXXI. A Slave ought to be diſtruſtful of the great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Patron.</head>
               <p>IN the year 1641. the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> coming to be King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſent Envoys to all the Governors of Iſlands and Garrizons to draw them to his party, before the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had taken or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56140:107"/>
for the contrary. Among other Envoys, there was one a Religious man, who ere he was got far from <hi>Lisborn,</hi> was taken by the Turkiſh Pyrates, and brought to <hi>Algiers.</hi> I happen'd to be at the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſide, and the good Father coming aſhore I ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in Latine, telling him I was troubled at his misfortune, and that he was the firſt Religious man of his Order that I had ſeen in that Country. He gravely anſwer'd without looking on me, <hi>Pray God I may be the laſt.</hi> Two days after, he was ſold in the Market with ſome other ſlaves. My Maſter <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi> bought him at twelve thouſand Patacoons, and from the Market-place, before he came to the Bath, (the ordinary Quarters of the ſlaves) he went to his new Patron's, to make him a proffer of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. <hi>Alli Pegelin,</hi> who was extreamly ſubtle in diſcovering the humors and quality of his ſlaves, that he might make his advantage thereof when they came to treat about their ranſome, entertain'd the Religious man very kindly, and ſaid to him, being bare-headed, <hi>Be cover'd I pray, I ſee you are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable perſon, and will not be able to brook the miſeries of the Sea. 'Tis very true,</hi> replies the Fryar, <hi>and the Soldiers have taken away all I had.</hi> Whereto <hi>Pegelin</hi> made anſwer, <hi>Thoſe Soldiers were ill-bred Raskals, not to have a reſpect for perſons of your worth, and if you want cloaths, or linnen, or mony, I will order you what ſhall be requiſite.</hi> The Religious man anſwer'd, that he ſtood in need of all thoſe things. Whereupon <hi>Pegelin</hi> gave order to a Jew who ſtood by, to deliver him ſo much cloath as would ſerve him, ſix ſhirts, and fifteen Patacoons, and ſo ſent the Religious man to the Bath where we were.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56140:107"/>
That night the Father came and walk'd upon the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race of the Bath; ſome of us ask'd him what news from Chriſtendom, and what he thought of our common Patron <hi>Alli Pegelin.</hi> He told us that our Patron was a very courteous and reaſonable man. <hi>He would needs have me to be cover'd,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and hath comforted me very much, and what is more, hath given me ſhirts, cloath, and mony. Believe me, there are not many Princes in Chriſtendom, who would ſhew ſo much kindneſs to a ſlave, and not know him.</hi> We made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Aſſure your ſelf, theſe kindneſſes and reſpects will coſt you very dear one time or other.</hi> But he laugh'd at us. He ſaid Maſs every day in the Church of our Bath, and all the <hi>Portuguez</hi> came to hear it, and that ended, they conducted the Religious man to the door of the Bath, he coming laſt of all; and then with many <hi>Baiſo las manos,</hi> every one went his ways. This life was well enough for a ſlave; but after he had continu'd there ſome years, <hi>Pegelin</hi> demanding twelve thouſand Patacoons for his ranſome, he was ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd thereat, that he fell into a grief, and dy'd within a few days after.

               <head>RELATION XXXII. Of a Religious Man, a Slave at <hi>Algiers,</hi> who out of weakneſs renounc'd the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and afterwards repenting ſuffer'd Martyrdom.</head>
               <p>FAther <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a Dominican Frier, having liv'd ſome years in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and returning to his Country (<hi>Valentia</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi>) was taken by the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of <hi>Algiers,</hi> where being ſold, his Patron told him, that if he would pay a good ranſom, he would ſet him at liberty. Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> being a perſon of a cheerful humor, and a pleaſing diſpoſition, (as ſhall be ſeen anon) made anſwer that he would, conditionally that he ſhould be kindly treated, fare well, ly on a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and not work; upon which terms he would pay ſix thouſand Ducats for his ranſom. The Patron, thinking he had the 6000. Ducats already in his Cheſt, treated Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> according to the agreement. Having thus far'd well, and had all things requiſite for the ſpace of a year, the Patron ſeeing there was no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of receiving the Ranſom-mony, commanded another ſlave of his, a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to beſtow a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred blows with a cudgel (an ordinary puniſhment in <hi>Barbary</hi>) on the ſoles of Father <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s feet. The poor man was faſten'd in an Inſtrument fit for that purpoſe, which in the Turkiſh language is call'd <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca.</hi> Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Spaniard</hi> coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, ſaid to him, <hi>Have a care Chriſtian, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56140:108"/>
what you do; you know that I am a Prieſt, and if you touch me, you will be excommunicated.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the honeſt <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſaid to his Patron, <hi>I am a Chriſtian, and your ſlave, beat me as much as you pleaſe, I will not be excommunicated.</hi> The Patron call'd out another of his ſlaves, a <hi>Portuguez,</hi> who was glad to execute ſuch a Commiſſion upon a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> laughing at the excommunication. When Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> had recover'd of thoſe blows, and came abroad into the Streets, ſome other ſlaves his friends taking occaſion to bewail his misfortune, he would ſay to them laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Is there any one among you who would not endure a hundred bangs with a cudgel, to fare well a whole year, and to deceive a dogg of a Turk?</hi> His Patron deſpairing of his ranſome, ſold him very much to his loſs; for he was look'd upon as a cheat. His new Patron ſent him to quarter at the Bath of the <hi>Duana,</hi> where there is one of the four Chriſtian Churches which are at <hi>Algiers.</hi> Moſt of the Prieſts live at the Baths where the Chriſtian Churches are, and are maintain'd by the Alms they receive from the ſlaves. And ſo paying their Patron's ordinarily three Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coons a month, they are exempted from working. In the year 1640. I found him in that Bath of the <hi>Dua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>; but moſt of the ſlaves there being <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> there always happen'd ſome difference between them and Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was a <hi>Spaniard</hi>; inſomuch that his Patron was forc'd to permit him to come and live at <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi>'s Bath, where I came to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with him. Every Sunday, when I was exempted from working, I heard his Sermons, which were full of learning and eloquence. He was a lover of good cheer, and had a great veneration for
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56140:109"/>
the Patriarch <hi>Noah,</hi> for his excellent invention of Planting the Vine. One day we took him to the Tavern, where, for want of Wine-glaſſes, we made uſe of a Church-Lamp, which was of Glaſs, and Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> thinking the wine ſo much the better out of that, took off three Lamps of it, each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a quart or better, and ſo loaden, went his way very much our friend. Shortly after I was ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> continu'd there till the year 1645. ſo that ſeeing no likelihood of recovering his liberty, or haply drawn in by the licentious life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> he forgot himſelf ſo far as to renounce the Chriſtian Faith, turning a Mahumetane, with extraordinary acclamations of the Moors and Turks, who ſet him on horſe-back with a Dart in his hand, and ſo conducted him through all the Streets of the City, as it were in triumph. And abuſing the Chriſtians, they ſaid to them as he went along, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold your great Papas,</hi> (ſo the Turks call the Chriſtian Prieſts) <hi>whom you eſteem'd ſo highly.</hi> This accident extreamly troubled the Chriſtians, both Catholicks and Proteſtants. It happen'd through God's permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that at that time there were at <hi>Algiers</hi> two Fathers, one a Jeſuit, the other a Diſcalceate Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melite, a <hi>Genoeſe</hi> named <hi>Frater Angeli,</hi> a man of exemplary vertue. Theſe two Fathers were extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled at the miſcarriage of Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the ſcandal which the Chriſtians had receiv'd thereby, and reſolv'd to remonſtrate unto him, how highly he had ſcandaliz'd ſo many Chriſtian ſlaves, who had endur'd a thouſand times more miſery then he had, and yet perſever'd with ſo much conſtancy and patience in the Chriſtian Faith. By theſe and the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56140:109"/>
like remonſtrances, Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> (who was now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Iſouf</hi>) was ſo ſtirr'd, that he promis'd the two Fathers that he would forſake the pernicious Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metane Religion, and be reconcil'd to the holy Church, and to that end he deſir'd to make his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and to receive the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar. Which he did the ſame night very ſecretly, for if the Turks had known that thoſe two Fathers had concern'd themſelves in the converſion of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negado, they would hardly have eſcap'd being burnt alive. The next day <hi>Iſouf</hi> appears in the Streets, cloath'd as a Chriſtian, whereat the whole City was aſtoniſh'd. He was taken, and carried before the <hi>Duana,</hi> that is, the Tribunal. They ask'd him why he had chang'd the habit of his Religion? He reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer'd that he was a Chriſtian, a Prieſt, and of a Religious Order, and that he would dye a Chriſtian. And as to what had paſs'd, that he had done it by the ſuggeſtion of the Devil. Upon this anſwer, the Judges thought fit to order him to be cudgell'd on the ſoles of the feet, to drive thoſe ſcruples out of his mind.</p>
               <p>That ſentence was executed, but to no purpoſe, for he preſever'd, and ſaid he would dye a Chriſtian. They threatned him with death, and ſeeing at laſt, that all their menaces prevail'd nought upon him, they condemn'd him to be burnt alive with a gentle fire. The <hi>Sauſes</hi> (the Officers of Juſtice) let him out of the <hi>Baboloet</hi>-Gate, and got an Anchor, and having ſet it with the teeth into the ground, ty'd Father <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> to it. He made the beſt advantage he could of the ſhort remainder of his life; for he begg'd pardon of God, and the Chriſtians, who were preſent in great
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56140:110"/>
numbers, exhorting them to continue conſtant in the Chriſtian Faith. In the mean time Wood was brought, which was ſet at five foot diſtance all about him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet on fire, the flame augmented the courage of that holy Martyr, who louder and louder begg'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of God for the ſcandal he had given to the Chriſtians, exhorting them to perſeverance in the Chriſtian Religion. At laſt, ſmother'd by the ſmoke, he fell down, leaving to all the Chriſtian ſlaves an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a true Religious man, and a moſt penitent Chriſtian.</p>

We had alſo obſerv'd, that there was a Box full of half-pikes in the Pilot's Cabin, at the Stern,

Going aboard the third time, the Undertaker hid a Dagger, two great Turkiſh Knives, and two pound of powder in a bag of Bisket, which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Prow, where the Chriſtians lay, for the Bisket was for them. The wind having brought us in a few hours, a good diſtance from the Coaſt of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi> we began to conſult, how, and when our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe ſhould be put in execution, and every one gave his advice. The reſult was, that we who lay at the Prow, ſhould have the two Knives and the Dagger, and that we ſhould make uſe of a Cramp-Iron, and twelve Shovels, wherewith they took in and caſt out the Ballaſt. The other eight Chriſtian ſlaves lay on the Deck, for day and night, they were to have a care of the ſails; for the Turks have Chriſtian ſlaves for their Sea-men; thoſe had for their Arms each of them two great Bullets of ſix pound weight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56140:111"/>
they undertook to kill the Maſter and his Mate, in their Cabin, and to caſt down the half-pikes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned. At the ſame time the twelve o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were to kill three or four Turks who kept a guard at the Stern, and to enter into the room where the reſt of the Turks lay with their arms engag'd, as I ſaid, and to diſpatch them. And that the four Turks who guarded at the Stern might not obſerve when the ſixteen Chriſtians who lay in the Prow, came out, the eight Chriſtians who lay on the deck, came four or five nights one after another, to take Tobacco be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Hatch, under which we were, that at the hour of the enterprize they might be all together on the Deck, without any notice taken by the guard. And in caſe the Turks at the Stern ſhould make too great reſiſtance, the order was, that we ſhould retreat to the Prow, where we were to leave four of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who were Gunners, and they ſhould have turn'd two Guns from the Prow towards the Poop, charging them with a little bag like a Cartridge, full of ſmall ſtones; thoſe two Guns, which were ready, being enough to clear the Stern of the Turks, and ſend them into the other world. As for the Jews, there was no fear of them, for they lay all below in the Hold, whence they could not get out but one by one, ſo that one Chriſtian with an Iron-bar was enough to ſecure them all. The day appointed was the laſt of <hi>January,</hi> an hour before day. We were at the Prow all night, with hope, fear, and ſilence, expecting the ſignal, which was three knocks with the hand on the Hatch, which we with the aſſiſtance of our Companions above could make a ſhift to open. We had alſo an Hour-Glaſs, that when the time
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56140:111"/>
were come every one ſhould be ready; but there was no ſignal given, and after Sun-riſing, the Hatch being opened by the Maſter's order, the Undertaker came into our room, and made this excuſe, that the Turks had kept too ſtrong a watch that night; but I think, he ſhould rather have ſaid, that his heart had fail'd him in the proſecution of his enterpriſe.</p>

               <head>RELATION XXXIV. Curioſity is ſatisfy'd by Time and Patience.</head>
               <p>IN the year 1639. being bound from <hi>England</hi> to St. <hi>Lucars</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and having been thirteen days at Sea, and not ſeen land, our Maſter took the height of the Sun with his Aſtrolabe, and found that we were at the altitude of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that before night we ſhould ſee two Iſlands called <hi>Las illas Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingas.</hi> Coming accordingly neer the ſaid Iſlands, we perceiv'd two Ships cruſing up and down. Our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, named <hi>Vincent Arris,</hi> a man of great experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Sea-affairs, imagin'd that the two Ships were Turkiſh Pyrats, whereupon he commanded the Guns to be unloaden, and, inſtead of Bullets, to be charg'd with bars of Irons, ſaying, that if thoſe two Ships had any deſign to engage us, they would come on in the night, and that being neer, the bars would do them more miſchief then the bullets. Night came on, and the two Ships were out of ſight. We Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers were afraid, we ſhould be forc'd to engage in the night; but the Maſter ſaid he was not of that opinion; whereupon we took each of us a draught of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56140:112"/>
Sack, and with that went to bed. The Maſter ſet the accuſtomed Watch, but ſailing with a forewind, the Sentinel at the Prow could not ſee before him. It happen'd that e're we had ſlept much above an hour, a Boy who was with the Watch on the Prow perceiv'd two Ships, and began to cry out Alarm. Thoſe two Ships were then got ſo neer, that no body durſt ſtay on the Deck, to put the long boat over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board; for when the boat is on the Deck, the Ship cannot without inconvenience be ſo well defended, nor the enemy be kept from boarding. All the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were about ſixty in number, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in a poſture of fighting, every man in his Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and three at every Gun. The Maſter comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all the Port-holes to be ſhut, the lights to be kept cloſe, and that all ſhould be ſilent. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order'd the Gunners on one ſide of the Ship, that when he ſtamp'd thrice with his foot, they ſhould take it for a ſignal, to open the Port-holes, put out the Guns, and give fire. He had alſo order'd eight Trumpetters to ſound with the diſcharging of the Guns. In the mean time, the two Pyrates were got ſo neer, that there wanted onely their coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board our Ship with their ſwords drawn. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Maſter gave the ſignal, and his orders were ſo punctually obſerv'd, that in a moment, the Port-holes were opened, and the Guns fir'd. At the ſame time the Trumpets began to ſound, and ſilence was converted into noiſe, and the two Ships being very neer us, we clearly heard the Iron-bars ſhot out of our pieces, making their way through their Ships, and the crys of thoſe who were in them. After diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging, the Guns were drawn in, and the Trumpets
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56140:112"/>
continu'd the alarm. This dreadful din made in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ight-time, might well put the moſt confident among us into a little fright. The two Ships having found, and what is more, felt, notwithſtanding the ſilence, that we were not aſleep, paſs'd by without making any return. Our Maſter perceiving it, came on the Deck, caus'd the Boat to be put over-board, furl'd up the main-ſail, and uncover'd the Hatches. Which laſt was indeed the moſt neceſſary; for all the windows being ſhut, and the Hatches of the Deck cover'd, the ſmoak of the powder caus'd a thick obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>All things being put into a poſture of defence, the Maſter doubled the Watches, and gave order that every one ſhould be ready againſt the break of day. The next morning before Sun-riſing we diſcover'd the two Ships which came ſtraight towards ours. The Maſter commanded all his people to come upon the Deck, encouraging them in few words, ſhewing the Colours of the two Ships, which were Turks, and telling them that the onely way to avoid ſlavery was to fight valiantly. That done, he order'd ſome pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be ſaid, according to their way, and we Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, who were Catholicks, pray'd in ours. Every man had two glaſſes of wine, and the main ſail was furl'd up, as a ſignal, that we had no mind to run away. The Targuet-fences were hung all about the Ship, and the red Flag ſet up at the ſtern. In this poſture we expected about an hour; but the two Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates obſerving the bulk of our Ship, ſo many people on the Deck, and thoſe reſolv'd to fight, durſt not come too neer us. Which our Maſter perceiving, order'd a Gun to be diſcharg'd as it were to defie
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56140:113"/>
them, and finding they had no ſtomach to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we proſecuted our voyage. I was extreamly deſirous to know what had paſs'd in the two Turkiſh Ships after we had fir'd upon them, in regard the men in them had cry'd out extreamly; and having ſeen the Turkiſh Flaggs I would have known from what Port in <hi>Barbary</hi> they came, and what number of men and Guns they had, and the reaſon was, that being ſo neer our Ships, and ſeeing none on the Deck to defend it, they had not caſt out the Cramp-Irons, and made ſome return to our ſhot.</p>
               <p>In the year 1641. while I liv'd with <hi>Cataborn Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha,</hi> (as I have related elſewhere) I often'd diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſome other Chriſtian ſlaves of ſeveral Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who were alſo lodg'd in the ſame <hi>Fonduca.</hi> One night they were talking of accidents at Sea, and tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how that many times, through the conduct of the Commander, a Ship might eſcape great dangers, and that when there is any diſſention between the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, his Officers, and Soldiers, they never do any thing to purpoſe, eſpecially in Pyrates. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>French</hi>-ſlave related how that ſome two years before being with a Pyrate of <hi>Algiers</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> one night, two Pyrateers thought to ſet on an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, and that by reaſon of ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that happen'd between the Captain and his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers, the <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man was not engag'd as they had intended. I told him that I was then aboard the <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Ship, and deſir'd him to tell me how it came to paſs that being ſo neer us as they were, when we diſcharg'd our Guns, they did not board us, and why they did not ſo much as fire a Gun at us? He made this anſwer, <hi>They thought they had not been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56140:113"/>
and it happening that the greater of the two Ships, in which I was, ere there had been any noiſe heard, receiv'd of a ſudden ſame Iron-bars through her ſides, and with that we heard ſo many Trumpets, there was ſuch an aſtoniſhment, fear, and confuſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that the Officers and Soldiers told the Captain plainly, they would not fight but by day. And the next morning when the Turks ſaw the bigneſs of your Ship, and obſerv'd the courage of your Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they had no maw to fight.</hi> I underſtood after a ſtrange manner what I was ſo deſirous to know; and it had been better for me I had never known it that way I came to know it.</p>

The Knight and I had ſign'd the Bill, but the Jew would have M. <hi>Caloën</hi> to ſign alſo, and the Ship it was to be ſent with, was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſet ſail; and beſides, within two days after the Eaſter of the Jews was to be celebrated, during which Feaſt they do not tell out any mony. To ſend the Bill to M. <hi>Caloën</hi> to be ſign'd we thought it not fit; for if it had been known that we had any credit, it would have prejudic'd us much, and retarded our liberty.

And whereas Avarice is the ſoul of a Turk, while they were at Sea, the Captain of the Ship had order'd <hi>Morin</hi> to receive fifty blows with a cudgel on the belly, to make him confeſs the name and quality of his Maſter, and his Companions. <hi>Morin</hi> had made anſwer that he knew not the name of his Maſter, not yet of the others, and that he never heard his Maſter and his Companions uſe any other appellation one towards the other, then that of <hi>Sir.</hi> This conſtancy of the young lad pleas'd his Maſter very much, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the others who had been taken in the Ship, among whom there was one, whom we ſhall here call <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> deſcended of wealthy friends, who ſaid to <hi>Morin, Continue faithful and conſtant, and aſſoon as I ſhall recover my liberty, I will redeem thee.</hi> Soon after, <hi>Tiberius</hi> got his liberty, with one of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and being return'd into his Country, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted his friends with the conſtancy and fidelity of <hi>Morin</hi>; which they conſidering declar'd <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s promiſe to redeem him, obligatory; ſo that they gave order to ſome Merchants of <hi>Legorn</hi> for his Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that he ſhould be ſent away with the firſt Ships bound for <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Holland.

               <p>After we fell into the hands of the Turks, the Pyrate-ſhips, which brought us to ſlavery, caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor before the City of <hi>Algiers,</hi> diſcharging their Guns to give notice of their arrival. The news of the rich prize was preſently ſpread abroad, as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56140:117"/>
the Turks of the Garriſon, as the people; and as it commonly happens, that news encreaſes by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from mouth to mouth, ſo it was reported, that, beſides thirty thouſand Patacoons, which were found in the prizes, there was among the ſlaves a Lord of great Quality, meaning the fore-ſaid Knight. Some ſaid he was a General; others, an Ambaſſadour, and all imagin'd that the reſt were his Servants, which was no ſmall happineſs for us, and that the money which they gave out was found, belong'd to him. This news was partly forg'd by the Pyrates themſelves, as they are wont to invent new ſtratagems to enhance the price of ſlaves newly brought in, loading them with titles and wealth, to draw in the Buyers to make greater proffers, in hopes of a better ranſom. The Baſſa hearing this news took the Knight for his proportion, which is of eight one, at his own choice, as I have ſaid elſewhere. The Knight was conducted to a Stable of the Baſſa's, where he found other ſlaves, and among thoſe ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captains and Officers, whom he durſt not frequent, nor ſo much as ſpeak to in the day time, leaſt there ſhould be notice taken of his demeanour among thoſe Officers-ſlaves, with whom he would not be familiar, to take off the ſuſpicion of his being a perſon of high quality, which had been augmented by the leaſt converſation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd by mutual expreſſions of reſpect, the conſequences of acquaintance. And to beat it out of the Baſſa's head, that he was neither General, nor Ambaſſador, he kept ſeven or eight days all alone, and had nought to eat but a cruſt of dry bread; which being obſerv'd by the Baſſa's Cook, he order'd him the remainder of ſome Rice, which is the ordinary
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56140:117"/>
food of the Turks: nay, finding him ſo ſubmiſſive and ſerviceable, he ſuffer'd him to creep into the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, to help the Skullions, in bringing in Wood, Coals, turning the Spit, and the like Offices, which he could not do, but onely with his right arm, having loſt the uſe of the left by a Musket-ſhot he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in his Catholick Majeſty's ſervice in the year 1639. at the ſiege of <hi>Salſes.</hi> In requital of the good ſervices which the Knight did in the Kitchin, the Cook ſuffer'd him to eat with the Skullions, who were Moors, and took it ill that a Chriſtian ſhould put his fingers into the ſame diſh with them. No doubt the Knight thought himſelf at an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Hell with the Pages of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> whoſe Livery and meen thoſe boys had, being about fifteen or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of age, having their cloaths all black with greaſe and naſtineſs, and ſo ſuiting excellently well with their dark hue. And yet the Knight endeavor'd all he could to put himſelf into the ſame poſture, that he might be thought the fitter for that company and employment. Three months paſs'd away in that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable courſe of life, whereof the Knight made this advantage, that he made the Baſſa quit the opinion he had of his being a General or Ambaſſador, and conſequently the hope of getting much mony out of him; which put him upon a reſolution to ſell his ſlave, as he did, to the General of the Gallies <hi>Alli Pegelin.</hi> He acted his part well enough ſo far; but the new Maſter, who had obſerv'd what was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted concerning his ſlave, began to be very round with him, asking him in the Language commonly ſpoken between the Turks and the ſlaves, who he was, and of what Country? The Knight being oblig'd to make
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56140:118"/>
anſwer, ſaid he was a poor Youth, born at <hi>Oſtend,</hi> the Son of a mean <hi>Iriſh</hi>-Officer, giving himſelf out to be of that Nation, as well becauſe he had the looks of one of it, as for that the ſaid Nation is little known and not much eſteem'd at <hi>Algiers,</hi> thoſe of it yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ordinary ranſomes. The Knight was in hopes by this invention to come off the eaſier, when he came to treat about his ranſom: But <hi>Alli Pegelin,</hi> who was a perſon not ſo eaſily over-reach'd, having heard his anſwer, ſaid jeeringly to him, <hi>A man may indeed ſee by your looks that your Father was a Cobler; you have acted your part very well in the Baſſa's Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, but I ſhall make my advantage of it. I know you are an Ambaſſador, and one of the King of</hi> Spain's <hi>Generals, and what is more, that you are a Knight.</hi> This laſt title he gave him, to make the matter worſe then it was, inaſmuch as the Turks know, that the Knights of the Military Orders in <hi>Spain,</hi> have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manderies and Penſions conditionally to wage war againſt the Turks and Moors. Afterwards, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſending away his ſlave, ſaid to him, <hi>Go, go, write home, that they may ſell your Lands, and ſend me Patacoons, and you ſhall return to your Country.</hi> This firſt propoſal of his new Maſter, was very unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Knight, as being again oblig'd to ſtrive againſt a falſe and Chimerical opinion, which was enough to defeat him of all hopes of ever breathing the air of his Native ſoil. The General had a houſe at a little diſtance from his own, wherein, during the time of my being there, he lodg'd five hundred and fifty ſlaves, which place was called <hi>Banno,</hi> or the <hi>Bath,</hi> and it might well be taken for a repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or an epitome of Hell. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56140:118"/>
Nations, the confuſion of Languages, the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and inconveniences endur'd, and all the ſeveral kinds of crimes that are committed there, would force the lewdeſt perſon in the world to paſs that judgement of it.</p>
               <p>To this place was our Knight-ſlave brought, where he was receiv'd by M. <hi>Caloën, Saldens,</hi> and my ſelf, having onely this to congratulate, that we were all together; and whereas the Knight was lame of one arm, and ſo was not oblig'd to go to work out of the Bath, we made him our Caterer, to provide our meat for us, and to dreſs it, which employment he continu'd in, to our great convenience, for the ſpace of ſix months, at the end whereof, the General thinking he might have receiv'd an anſwer from his Country, ſent for him to come to ſome agreement about his ranſom. The Knight proffer'd five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Patacoons, whereat the General being incens'd, as looking on the proffer extreamly below what he expected, order'd the Knight to have a chain of ſixty pound weight faſten'd to his legge, to induce him to come ſomewhat neer the ſum of thirty thouſand Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacoons, at which he had ſet the Knight's ranſom. Nine months together he had the chain at his legge, and for the ſpace of fifteen days was forc'd to dragg it after him to ſome place neer the Sea-ſide, to work, where he was to help ſome Sawyers of Marble, which the General had brought away with his Gallies from the City of <hi>Bona,</hi> anciently called <hi>Hippona,</hi> ſeated on the Mediterranean, and ſufficiently known by this, that it had been the Metropolis of <hi>Africk</hi> in Saint <hi>Auſtin's</hi> time, where thoſe ſtones had ſerv'd for the Tombs of Chriſtians. The Knight's work was
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56140:119"/>
to mingle the ſand and water to be us'd in the ſawing of the Marble. While he was at his work, the General would come ſometimes to ſee what he did, proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſend him to <hi>Legorn</hi> with a Veſſel then ready to ſet ſail, if he would agree with him at thrity thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Patacoons, which he had demanded of him for his ranſome. Whereto the Knight made anſwer that he had no mony. The General having made ſuch proffers ſeveral times to him, without prevailing any thing with him, was ſo vex'd, that he ſaid to him in <hi>Lingua-Franca, La Cane ty far garziva, ty tener fantaſia, à fè de Dio my congar bueno por ti.</hi> That is, <hi>Go you Dog, you think your ſelf cunning, and ſhew your ſelf humour ſome, but by the faith of God I will take another courſe with you.</hi> The General <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi> was then accompany'd by ſome Jews, who in all likelihood had a ſhare in that ſlave, yet conceal'd their intereſt under the name of <hi>Alli Pegelin,</hi> as they are wont, that they may not offend againſt the prohibitions made them to buy Chriſtian ſlaves. This ſuſpition was afterwards confirm'd, in that the Knight was ſome time after ſent for to the General's houſe, at the requeſt of thoſe very Jews, where <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelin,</hi> accompany'd by them and ſome Captains of his Gallies, ask'd him once more whether he would promiſe thirty thouſand Patacoons for his liberty? To which demand the Knight making anſwer that he had nothing to ſay, the General immediately reply'd, <hi>Pila baſo cane, porta Falaca.</hi> Which is commonly ſaid, when they would puniſh any one, and ſignifies, <hi>Ly down on the ground, you Dog, and bring hither the Falaca,</hi> which is a piece of wood about four or five foot in length, having a hole in the middle, through
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56140:119"/>
which by a ſmall cord the feet are faſten'd to it. The patient lies down on his back, having the ſoles of his feet rais'd up towards the sky; two men hold up both ends of the piece of wood, two others hold down his arms, to prevent all agitations of his body, and a fifth begins the exerciſe, laying on the foals of his feet as hard as he can, with a Bulls-pizzle four or five foot long, round at the end by which he holds it, but widening by degrees towards the other end where it is neer half a foot in breadth. Inſtead of a pizzle, the ſometimes make uſe of a ropes-end. The <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca</hi> was preſently brought, and the Knight receiv'd two hundred blows in the poſture you ſee repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Figure. In the midſt of that cruel puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the General commanded the executioner to hold his hand, and ask'd the Knight, whether he had any deſire to change his Religion, and to embrace the Mahumetane, which if he would, he promis'd to make him Captain of a Galley, to go out againſt the Chriſtians. Whereto the Knight reply'd, that he was not as yet reſolv'd to do ſo, and that he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye a Chriſtian, but that he would pay a thouſand Patacoons for his ranſome. Upon that anſwer, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral commanded the Executioner to give him a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred blows more; which was done. This propoſal of <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi>'s, would make ſome believe that he was a perſon who endeavour'd the propogation of his Religion; but thoſe who are acquainted with the avarice of the Turks, will eaſily comprehend, that <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi> had no deſign to advance Mahumetiſme, but onely made his advantage of that pretence, to get more mony out of the ſoles of the Knight's feet. Thoſe blows being given, the Knight was taken off
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56140:120"/>
the Inſtrument, with his feet all black by reaſon of the blows, and being threatned by the General that he ſhould have as much more aſſoon as he were reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd of that, or that he would ſend him to the Grand Seignor, to be employ'd in the Seraglio, where he muſt firſt have been made an Eunuch. The blows had not troubled him ſo much as thoſe menaces did, after which the Knight was carried by the ſlaves to his quarter in the Bath, for it was impoſſible for him, I will not ſay to go, but ſo much as to touch the ground with his feet. His Friends among the ſlaves endeavour'd all they could to give him eaſe; ſome brought wine to waſh his feet, another, who was a Surgeon, opened the dead fleſh, and dreſs'd him, but what was moſt remarkable was the charitable action of a Diſcalceate Carmelite Frier, a ſlave, named Father <hi>Angeli,</hi> a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> who with his mouth ſuck'd the corrupt blood to get it out of his feet. He was ſix weeks in his recovery, at the end whereof, a Jew coming to treat with him about his ranſom, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny menaces told him, that <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi> had ſworn by the Grand Seignor's head (an inviolable oath) that the Knight ſhould never have his liberty unleſs he gave fifteen hundred Patacoons. He was perſwaded to promiſe the ſaid ſum, and thereupon his chain was taken off, and he had the freedom to walk up and down the City, as they commonly do who have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with their Patrones, till ſuch time as they have a convenience to tranſport themſelves. We had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been treated after the ſame manner, had not <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi> been fully perſwaded, that the ſaid Knight was ſome publick Miniſter of the King of <hi>Spain's,</hi> and that we were his Servants, and ſo there was no
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56140:120"/>
great account made of us, which prov'd our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. All things being agreed upon, it was propos'd, that the Knight ſhould take ſhipping for <hi>Legorn</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> to be there kept in priſon till the ranſom were paid, which was to be made to ſome Jews there, who held a correſpondence with <hi>Alli Pegelin.</hi> But the Knight excus'd himſelf, deſiring that he might be ſent over into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he might take Duplicates of the Grants and Rewards which his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had made him, in regard the Originals were caſt over-board when we were taken. Theſe excuſes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd the Knight's not being deliver'd without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ranſom, which had been done, had he follow'd the Patron's reſolution. For the Veſſel bound for <hi>Legorn,</hi> aſſoon as it was got to Sea, met with a Tempeſt, which ran it a-ground on the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> where the Ship was taken, and all the ſlaves had their liberty without paying any thing, by means of that happy tempeſt eſcaping impriſonment at <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorn,</hi> where they were to have continu'd till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of their ranſoms. This is punctually obſerv'd there, but not by other Chriſtian Princes, who holding not ſo ſtrict a correſpondence with thoſe of <hi>Algiers,</hi> ſet at liberty the ſlaves aſſoon as they come within their juriſdiction, not regarding whether they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd or not. According therefore to the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of returning by the way of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Knight <hi>de Cherf,</hi> took ſhipping with us and the other Chriſtian ſlaves for <hi>Tituan,</hi> whether we got, with the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences before-related, and were all put into the Maſmora, (a priſon under ground) expecting the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our ranſom, ſave onely the Knight, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of that cuſtom, had caus'd it to be inſerted
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56140:121"/>
into the agreement, that he ſhould not be put in there, which was obſerv'd. In the diſcourſe of my Captivity, I gave an account of the three Tempeſts we weather'd through, the deſign we had to kill the Turks, and become Maſters of the Ship, and how we got to <hi>Tituan,</hi> after being wrack'd, and went thence to <hi>Ceuta,</hi> leaving the Knight behind us at <hi>Tituan,</hi> expecting the return of his mony from <hi>Legorn</hi> to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz,</hi> and thence to <hi>Ceuta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the time of this expectation the Knight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf of ſome means to get off without mony, viſits the places about the City, and flatters himſelf with hopes of making an eſcape; but whereas that could not be done without aſſiſtance, it was neceſſary he ſhould have the help of thoſe of <hi>Ceuta.</hi> He ſeeks out and finds the means of making a correſpondence by letters with a Captain of the Garriſon of <hi>Ceuta,</hi> (a City in <hi>Africk</hi> under the Juriſdiction of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>) with whom he had been a ſlave at <hi>Algiers.</hi> He carefully ſent his Letters by the <hi>Caſilas,</hi> (which conſiſt of Merchants travelling every week from <hi>Ceuta</hi> to <hi>Tituan,</hi> and ſo back, with the permiſſion, and Paſs-port of the two Governors) and agrees with that Captain to make him a preſent of a thouſand Patacoons for the Sea-men, who ſhould come with a boat to a certain place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two thouſand and ſix hundred paces of <hi>Tituan,</hi> there to take in the Knight and three of his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who had agreed with <hi>Alli Pegelin,</hi> upon the ſame termes as the ſaid <hi>de Cherf,</hi> and had afterwards been lodg'd together in a remote quarter of the City, expecting alſo the return of their mony. Theſe were engag'd in the ſaid deſign, and contributed towards
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56140:121"/>
the charge. The time appointed for the execution of the deſign was the 25. of <hi>July,</hi> in the year 1643. at midnight, and the Knight prepar'd for each of them two or three pieces of Canes, inclos'd one within the other like fiſhing-rods, to be taken aſunder, and hid under their cloaths, ſo as that being ſet at length, and a knif faſten'd at the top, they might be taken for pikes. They got without any trouble about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a league out of <hi>Tituan,</hi> and took up their quarters in a dry ditch fenc'd on both ſides with reeds and thornes, expecting night for the compleating of their enterpriſe. Having continu'd a while in the Ditch, the Knight thought it time for them to go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea-ſide; but one of the three Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, named <hi>Hans Maurus,</hi> a perſon accounted well experienc'd in Sea-matters, (as may be ſeen in the deſcription of our wrack on the 11. of <hi>Feburary</hi> 1642.) maintain'd it was not late enough, adding that if they were oblig'd to ſtay, there would be ſome danger of being ſurpriz'd, and treated with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca,</hi> putting the Knight in mind of his chaſtiſement at <hi>Algiers.</hi> This apprehenſion of beating occaſion'd the miſtake of <hi>Hans Maurus</hi>; yet after a little ſtay, they went forwards, fitting their pieces of Canes one upon another, with a knife at the top, making a kind of half-pike, to defend themſelves againſt the <hi>Alarbes,</hi> who live by robbing, and in the Summer time ly abroad in the fields. As they went along, the Knight took a Croſs out of his pocket, that of the Order of Saint <hi>James,</hi> which he had ſav'd when he was made a ſlave, and preſented it to be kiſs'd by his Companions, ſaying that he was in hopes <hi>JESUS</hi> crucify'd would give them their liberty, and that they
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56140:122"/>
ſhould have for their Interceſſor the Apoſtle Saint <hi>James,</hi> whoſe Feaſt it then was. But <hi>Hans Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> being a <hi>Lutheran</hi> refus'd to do it. Being come to the Sea-ſide, they perceiv'd a boat hard by the ſhore, out of which ſome call'd, <hi>Ho, ho, for Tituan</hi>; and it was the ſame which had been ſent to receive them. <hi>Hans Maurus,</hi> notwithſtanding all his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and skill in Sea-matters, was ſeiz'd by a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick fear, and ſaid to his Companions, <hi>Ly down on the ground, they are Fiſher-men of Tituan, we ſhall be ſecur'd and beaten.</hi> In the mean time the boat had croſs'd two or three times by the place appointed, and reiterated the aforeſaid cry, ſtriking on a Steel, the ſignal agreed upon between them, whereto thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore were to anſwer with the like noiſe. But thoſe in the boat ſeeing no body appear, and conſidering that it was within an hour of day, as alſo that the watch on the Coaſt of <hi>Tituan</hi> had perceiv'd them, and given the ſignal to the City by a fire, reſolv'd to be gone. The going away of the boat, ſatisfy'd the Knight and <hi>Hans Maurus,</hi> that thoſe of <hi>Ceuta</hi> had made the appointed ſignal, whereupon they began to ſtrike with the Steel, and to call upon them, but all to no purpoſe, and too late, ſo that perceiving their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was diſcover'd, they made their retreat without any noiſe towards <hi>Tituan,</hi> getting into the City at ſeveral Gates, where they underſtood that that night there had been an alarm in the City, and that a party of horſe had been commanded out into the Country, by reaſon of a fire which had been made by the watch on the Sea-ſide. This body of Horſe conſiſts of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, who, to enjoy ſome priviledges, and the title of imaginary ſoldiers, oblige themſelves upon any
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56140:122"/>
alarm to ride out into the Country, and engage any enemy they meet with. All this had paſs'd, yet ſo as that thoſe of <hi>Tituan</hi> knew nothing of the occaſion of it, nor did they much enquire after it, in regard the alarms are very frequent there, by reaſon they are ſo near neighbours to the City of <hi>Ceuta.</hi> Yet were the Undertakers ſtill in ſome fear of being diſcover'd, and could not forbear quarrelling at <hi>Hans Maurus,</hi> who had occaſion'd the miſcarriadge of their deſign, whereat he was ſo troubled, and became ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, to think that, by his miſtake, himſelf and his Companions had miſs'd ſo fair an opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering their liberty, that he fell ſick. Yet did his Companions aſſiſt him all they could, and concern'd themſelves as much as might be in the recovery of his health; but perceiving he grew every day worſe and worſe, and that whatſoever was adminiſtred to him did little good, they bethought themſelves of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the welfare of his ſoul. To that end, the Knight, who knew that <hi>Hans Maurus</hi> had led a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good life, and that he feared God, made it his buſineſs to exhort him to renounce <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> and to embrace the <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholick Religion, diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with him concerning the difference of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, as he had done ſeveral times before. <hi>Hans Maurus</hi> being a perſon not much acquainted with Letters, and the Knight no great Divine, he took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to remonſtrate to him, that being born in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> he had follow'd the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Religion, without any enquiry into the <hi>Romane</hi>-Catholick; that the former was a new, and the other the ancient way, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the inventions of <hi>Luther</hi> by fifteen ages, and that the latter had been follow'd by his Anceſtors,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56140:123"/>
whom it would be impious for him to believe damn'd for that, and that they were rather wiſer then he, that he had often ſaid while he was in health, that he would do better, if he knew what were better, that it now concern'd him to think ſeriouſly of his conſcience, and that to that end he would bring him a Prieſt, who would tell him more, and that more effectually. This diſcourſe made to him in the extremity of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wrought this effect on <hi>Hans Maurus,</hi> that he acknowledg'd to the Knight that it was true he had been exhorted to follow the ſteps of his Anceſtors, but that he thought there was ſo little difference between both Religions, that he conceiv'd he might ſafely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough perſevere in his own; but ſince he was now in treated by his friends, whom he knew to be real &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, to conſider ſeriouſly of it, he deſir'd that a Prieſt might come to him, to give him ſatisfaction in ſome doubts. The Knight immediately ſent for a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dominican, a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and a ſlave, who ſatisfy'd the doubts of <hi>Hans Maurus,</hi> and undeceiv'd him, ſo that he became a <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholick, made his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and communicated with great fervency, to the great ſatisfaction of the Chriſtian ſlaves who were preſent, and the ſecond day after his converſion he dy'd. In this converſion may be ſeen the goodneſs of God, who gave <hi>Maurus</hi> the grace to profeſs the Catholick Faith, in recompence of his moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and good life, by a ſtrange accident, whereby he was depriz'd of his experience and skill, on Saint <hi>James</hi>'s day, which made him looſe his corporal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to give him the incomparable liberty of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the ſight of God. Eight days after <hi>Maurus</hi>'s death, the Knight paid his ranſom, and went to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56140:123"/>
                  <hi>Ceuta,</hi> and thence by the way of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> where having receiv'd rewards from his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty, he went thence to the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> having ſuffer'd greater miſeries then any of us, though we had been made ſlaves at the ſame time. And he who ſhall attentively conſider all our Knight did, will find, that humane Prudence is ſubject to ſtrange o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſights, and miſcarriages, and that God onely is the diſpoſer and director of all human actions.</p>

               <head>RELATION XXXIX. What happen'd between my Companion in ſlavery M. <hi>Caloen,</hi> and his old Patroneſs.</head>
               <p>THe condition of ſlaves implies in it ſelf a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their ſuffering of ſomewhat from the hands of their Patrons, but, on the contrary M. <hi>Caloën</hi> made his Patroneſs endure many inconveniences. I have ſaid elſewhere that an old Mooriſh Dame had bought him at fourteen hundred Patacoons, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd for her Grand-ſon <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> who was in the power of <hi>Caloën</hi>'s friends. The payment of that ſum troubled the old woman, as if it had been ſo many drops of blood got out of her dry'd carkaſs, never conſidering that it was for the redemption of one ſo neerly related to her. The coverous woman thought to eaſe her ſelf of ſome part of the grief by finding out ſome invention to make M. <hi>Caloën</hi> to pay ſeven hundred Patacoons, beſides the exchange of her Grand-ſon; and this buſied her brains day and night. One while ſhe reſolv'd to uſe violence, but fearing
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56140:124"/>
her <hi>Muſtapha</hi> might receive the ſame treatment, ſhe forbore it; another, ſhe imagin'd, that to repreſent to him how much he had coſt her, would be a more likely way to compaſs her deſign, ſince that it was indeed done as much for M. <hi>Caloën</hi>'s liberty as for her <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s, ſo that it was but juſt he ſhould pay his proportion; but the fear of being laugh'd at, and making him more obſtinate, after ſhe ſhould acquaint him with her intention, made her reſolve rather to be ſilent. While ſhe was troubled with this diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reſolutions, an Edict was publiſh'd, that all the Chriſtian ſlaves who went about the ſtreets ſhould have Irons at their feet, inſtead of the ordinary Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, or Hand-fetters, and that upon this occaſion, that the King of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Upon this, the old Woman caus'd to be faſten'd to M. <hi>Caloën</hi>'s legg a chain of fifty pound weight, imagining it might induce him to proffer ſome hundreds of Patacoons; but he ſuſpecting her deſign, complain'd of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done him, in loading him with fourty pound weight more then the other ſlaves, threatning her <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſhould have the ſame treatment. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he made a ſhift to go abroad every afternoon, and came home at night, ſo well freighted with the juice of the Grape, that his Patroneſs was afraid he would come to ſome miſchief, and ſo ſhe ſhould looſe all her fourteen hundred Patacoons. To prevent that, ſhe forbad him to go abroad, and leaſt he might forget that prohibition, he was furniſh'd with more chain then he was able to carry, ſo that he was forc'd to keep his Chamber, ſitting, or lying on a Mattreſs.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56140:124"/>
I went every day to ſee him, carrying along with me ſome <hi>Dunkirkers</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>-ſlaves, ſuch as I could meet with, to keep him company, and they follow'd me, as the Iron does the Load-ſtone, in hopes of ſomewhat to eat and drink, out of the ſeventy five Patacoons, which a certain Jew had lent us. It may be eaſily imagin'd, that ſuch good company having their Tinder-boxes fix'd, could not forbear Tobacco, and ſinging as Sea-men are wont to do, ſo that the room was full of ſmoak, and the houſe of noiſe. The old Patroneſs could not endure they ſhould drink wine in her houſe, and that the Chriſtian-ſlaves ſhould, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the reſpect they ought her, make ſuch a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid noiſe. This demeanour of theirs made her ſtark mad, yet the more ſhe ſcolded, the leſs they ſeem'd to take notice of any thing ſhe ſaid, or did, which enrag'd her ſo, that ſhe fell a railing at M. <hi>Caloën,</hi> in <hi>Lingua Franca,</hi> intermixt with ſome of the Mooriſh language, or <hi>Arabian,</hi> whereto he reply'd in <hi>Dutch.</hi> She being deſirous to know what he ſaid, <hi>This I ſay,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>get thee gone, old witch, and ſpeak the language of thy mother, and ſhew not thy ſelf a beaſt in the Mooriſh, which thou underſtandest not.

She thought to have kept him within bounds, and diſappointed his Companions, by ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him up in a Cellar, which had no light but what came in at a little hole, about a foot ſquare, from the Court of her houſe, charging her Servants that they ſhould not ſuffer any to ſpeak with him: I came

to ſee him as I was wont to do, and the old woman ſeeing me juſt entring into the Court, cry'd out from one of the upper windows, <hi>Go your ways Chriſtian, your Companion is not here. What a damn'd lying old witch is this?</hi> Replys M. <hi>Caloën,</hi> who heard her, <hi>ſhe hath ſhut me up here in this Cellar, putting out his hand at the hole.</hi> I made as if I went away, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning a while after without being obſerv'd by any, I brought him a little bottle of Brandy, as he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd to drive away melancholy thoughts, whereof he drank ſo much that he was grown in a manner diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, which happen'd by reaſon of the ſweetneſs of that liquor, which in thoſe parts is made of Figges. His dreadful out-cries, and the noiſe he made in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to break open the door, put the old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man into a fright, imagining that he was grown mad, or would have kill'd himſelf, for ſhe never ſuſpected that he had been ſo well drench'd as he was. Upon theſe apprehenſions he was remov'd to his own Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where the Patroneſs coming to him the next day, told him that of all the ſlaves at <hi>Algiers</hi> he was the lewdſt, that he had deſerv'd the Gallies a hundred times, and that ſhe was reſolv'd to make him try how he could brook that kind of life; but if he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe her the reimburſement of the ſeven hundred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacoons, ſhe would forbear; that there was no reaſon ſhe ſhould pay fourteen hundred Patacoons for him, ſince his Friends had paid nothing for her Grand-ſon <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and that notwithſtanding all this he gave his Patroneſs all the trouble he could by his continual inſolencies. <hi>It is then thy greedineſs to get the ſeven hundred Patacoons,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>that cauſes all my miſery?

She thought him not ſafe enough in the company of his Camerades, and much leſs when he was alone; ſo that ſhe thought it her beſt courſe to ſend him into the Country with her Grand-ſon <hi>Amet, Muſtapha</hi>'s Brother, to one of her Country-houſes, three leagues from <hi>Algiers,</hi> ſending along to wait on them a French ſlave named <hi>la Roche,</hi> born at <hi>Diepe.</hi> There they made much of themſelves, and liv'd merrily with the help of a great earthen pot of wine which contain'd neer fifty Gallons, and to compleat their enjoyments, <hi>Amet</hi> ſold his horſe to get mony, and ſent to <hi>Algiers</hi> for a Wench, whoſe throat he would afterwards have cut, had he not been diverted from his purpoſe by <hi>la Roche,</hi> who out of honeſty or gentility perſwaded him to be more merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful towards the poor whore.

The old Woman hears of her Grand-ſon and his Companions houſe-keeping in the Country, and orders them to return to the City, where M. <hi>Caloën</hi> was loaden with a chain of five branches, that he might not ſtir abroad; but that hinder'd him not;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56140:126"/>
for, putting up the chain in a little Basket, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on his back, he went along with me to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Tavern, without giving notice thereof to his Patroneſs.

In that place, a man needs but ſtrike a Turk or Moor, to be burnt alive; and <hi>Amet</hi> was ſo enrag'd, that he could do no leſs then threaten him with it. But he was threatned on the other ſide, that his Brother ſhould in like manner be burnt; and ſo one knife kept the other in the ſheaf. In fine, the old woman perceiving that neither artifice, nor kindneſs, nor cruelty advantag'd her any thing, was forc'd to ſuffer M. <hi>Caloën</hi> to do what he pleas'd himſelf, not concerning her ſelf about him, to the time of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture thence.</p>

               <p>THere are two ways whereby men compaſs their deſigns, to wit, that of the Lyon, and that of the Fox. A <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, for want of the former, very induſtriouſly made uſe of the Latter, as may be ſeen by the enſuing Relation.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> is poſſeſs'd of a place in <hi>Africk,</hi> named <hi>Le Baſtion de France.</hi> That Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was eſtabliſh'd about fifty years ſince on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the Kingdom of <hi>Algiers,</hi> forty leagues from the Metropolis thereof, and not far from <hi>Bona,</hi> for the fiſhing of Coral.

During the time of my ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, there came thither one of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> about
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56140:127"/>
thirty years of age, well cloath'd, and of a goodly preſence, who was to be one of the chiefeſt Miniſters of that Chamber. We ſhall here give him the name of <hi>Caſſidorus.</hi> There was alſo at the ſame time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>French</hi> ſlaves, who row'd in the Gallies, a Gentleman of <hi>Provence,</hi> who ſhall here go under the name of <hi>Pyſander.</hi> Notwithſtanding the condition of a ſlave, whereto he was reduc'd yet upon the account of his birth, his carriage, and induſtry, he was much reſpected by all the Renegadoes of his Nation, who at that time exceeded the number of three thouſand. A Captain of a Ship, a Renegado, having taken a Prize of importance, made a treatment for diverſe Pyrate-Officers, Owners of Privateers, and thoſe of the Chamber of Juſtice, inviting alſo thereto <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> with whom he was intimately acquainted.

After the treatment, the Captain thought fit to enquire of <hi>Caſſidorus</hi> what was the reaſon of his being ſad and out of humour, and whether he had given him any offence. <hi>Onely this,</hi> replyed <hi>Caſſidorus, that you have expreſs'd the little eſteem you had for my perſon, by placing me at the table next to</hi> Pyſander, <hi>who is a ſlave, and hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56140:128"/>
occaſion to make him ſenſible of his reſentment of it, had he not conſider'd, that the inſolent fellow was under the protection of the Baſſa, and conſequently that it had been imprudence, to engage himſelf in a quarrel upon the account of a Chriſtian ſlave. Yet could he not forbear acquainting <hi>Pyſander</hi> with that vanity of <hi>Caſſidorus,</hi> whereat the other being juſtly incens'd, that ſuch a worthleſs perſon had ſlighted him after that manner, <hi>My misfortune,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>hath not brought me ſo low, but I ſhall find out a way to be reveng'd of that impudent fellow. I have bethought my ſelf of an invention, which ſhall prove a greater Torment to him then haply would be the enduring of the Strapado, half a dozen times together, a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I ſhould be likely enough to give him, were I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to my own.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Pyſander,</hi> who was an ingenious and ſubtle perſon, watches all occaſions to compaſs the deſign he had to be reveng'd, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that <hi>Caſſidorus</hi> ſecretly cajoll'd a Turkiſh Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezan, upon whom he had neer ſpent the two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Patacoons, which he had brought from <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi> to carry on ſome ſmall trade. <hi>Pyſander</hi> was patient till he had ſquander'd away all his mony, which once conſum'd, it might be eaſily gueſs'd, that the kindneſs of his Miſtreſs would ſoon be at a period, and that his credit was ſuch as ſhould not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily recover it. Upon this diſcovery <hi>Pyſander</hi> lays his deſign, addreſſing himſelf to a <hi>French</hi> Renegado, a perſon extreamly addicted to women, and well Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd with the diſeaſe of his Nation. He tells him of an extraordinary handſome woman, whom he would have courted, had ſhe been a Chriſtian, and he had had mony to carry on his addreſſes to her. The
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56140:128"/>
vicious inclinations of that Renegado, ſoon made his teeth to water to be acquainted with that unknown Beauty, to whom he got acceſs, by the good inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Pyſander,</hi> and a preſent of ſome Patacoons, which made him look'd upon as a great Favourite. The Renegado continues his viſits to the new Miſtreſs for the ſpace of three weeks or a month, at the end whereof he leaves her, having ſpent his diſeaſe as well as his money upon her. This happen'd according to the expectation of <hi>Pyſander,</hi> who knowing that ſuch venereal embraces are contagious, thinks it time to contrive a renewing of the correſpondence between <hi>Caſſidorus</hi> and his old Miſtriſs. To do that, he goes to a Renegado of the ſame Country with <hi>Caſſidorus,</hi> telling him that his Friend <hi>Caſſidorus</hi> was in great want, and that it would be a ſingular favour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him with fifty Patacoons, till he receiv'd a Bill of Exchange, which he daily expected, and that for his further ſecurity, he would be bound for the repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſaid ſum. The Renegado not miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, believ'd <hi>Pyſander,</hi> and thereupon go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Caſſidorus</hi> told him that he underſtood his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, proffering him fifty Patacoons, provided he would be oblig'd to return them with the firſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, which upon that condition were receiv'd by <hi>Caſſidorus.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Pyſander</hi> ſent notice of it to the Wench, who ſent a Love-ſummons to <hi>Caſſidorus,</hi> and ſoon renewing their old acquaintance, ſhe charm'd him ſo home, that he needed the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cization of a good P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>LIbertiniſm makes ſome perſons indifferent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſerve God or the Divel, provided they gain either advantage or eſteem thereby. Of this number was a certain Engineer, a <hi>French</hi>-man, whom the States of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> ſent with their aids to the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> declar'd King of <hi>Portugal</hi> in the year 1641. This man being taken by the Pyrates of <hi>Algiers</hi> was diſcover'd by the Captain to be a Maſter-Engineer, employ'd about fire-works, and particularly that he was excellent at the compoſition of that kind of wild-fire, which is ſo much us'd in engagements at Sea. The Captain conceiving that <hi>French</hi>-man would do him great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice buys him in the Market-place, where the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners are ſold. The brags which this Engineer
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56140:129"/>
made of his skill in firing of Ships and burning ſails and rackling, gain'd him the favour of his Patron, who intending to Sea, gives him mony to buy what things were neceſſary for his compoſitions, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of great rewards if he were as good as his word, and on the contrary, threats, if he deceiv'd him. The Engineer prepares his inventions, and goes abroad with his Patron, accompany'd by other Pyrate-Ships, and having cruz'd ſome days up and down the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean, they diſcover'd two Ships of <hi>Malaga,</hi> ſufficiently well arm'd, at which they diſcharg'd their Guns, whereto the two Ships anſwer'd in the ſame language. But making no advantage thereby, the Captain order'd them to make up to the Chriſtian Ships, and to faſten the grappling Irons. They did ſo, but the Turks being afraid to board, the <hi>French</hi>-Engineer was call'd to make tryal of his skill. He made ready his fire-works, and having caſt ſome on the Poop of the Chriſtian Ship, it prov'd ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that the Chriſtians were reduc'd to a neceſſity of either yeelding themſelves, or burning alive. This victory was attributed to the dexterity of the Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer-ſlave, who conceiv'd ſuch a pride thereat, that he complain'd he was not recompens'd according to his deſerts. Thoſe who had been at the charge of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the Pyrate-ſhips came to underſtand, that the Engineer was diſcontented, and imagin'd that he would do greater miracles, if he were permitted to renounce his Religion, and had his liberty given him. Upon theſe preſumptions they went to the Captain, the Engineer's Patron, and promis'd to give him the value of his ſlave, on condition he would ſuffer him to renounce, as he was deſirous to do. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:56140:130"/>
was content to gratifie his Maſters, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer embrac'd the Turkiſh Religion, out of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther motive then vain-glory and inconſtancy, as not being forc'd to that Apoſtacy by any harſh treatment, or deſpair of redemption. About two months after his firſt entrance into ſlavery, he put on the Turkiſh habit, and would not ſo much as look on the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, even thoſe of his own Nation. Which a ſlave of his acquaintance obſerving, took the freedom to tell him, that he wonder'd to ſee him in that equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page. <hi>Come, come, I know what you would be at,</hi> ſays the Engineer to him, interrupting his diſcourſe, <hi>you know me, I have ſerv'd the King of</hi> France <hi>my natural Prince, the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>the States of the</hi> United Provinces, <hi>as long as they paid me well, I ſhall do the like here, and then I will go and ſeek my fortune elſewhere</hi>; and with thoſe words turns his back on his Country-man. Some days after, the Captain, who had been his Patron, went to Sea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, with his Engineer, and not meeting with any thing on the Mediterranean, they paſs'd the Streight, and came into the Ocean, where they gave chace to an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Ship, which they found ſufficiently well provided to deal with them, and ſo they thought it their ſafeſt courſe to engage her at a diſtance. In the mean time, the Captain conſults with his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and the Engineer, how they might engage the enemy at a neerer diſtance, he propos'd to them that his invention would be the moſt likely means to take the prize. <hi>The veſſel,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>which we are to engage againſt is very high, both at the ſtern and the Prow, and their Guns are greater then ours, and conſequently, there is ſome danger of being ſunk, if we make

But the Engineers thoughts ran upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, much different from what the Captain imagin'd; for being come ſomewhat neer the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, he perſwaded the four Turks, that he ſtood in need of the two Chriſtian ſlaves, to aſſiſt him, and ſo buſied the Turks in rowing, and went to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the boat behind their backs, making as if he prepar'd his fire-works.

               <head>RELATION XLII. The Diſappointment.</head>
               <p>IN the year 1639. a young man about eighteen years of age born at <hi>Ceuta</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> named <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Mendez,</hi> having been a Page to <hi>Dom Franciſco de Villegas,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi>-Knight, who liv'd at <hi>Gibral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> and was his Godfather, was put into the King's ſervice by his Maſter in a Company of Recruits, for the reinforcing of the Garrizon at <hi>Naples,</hi> with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular recommendations to the Captain. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits were put aboard a <hi>Hamborough</hi> Veſſel, preſs'd for the tranſportation of them, for want of other, as it is ordinary in <hi>Spain,</hi> when the Kings ſervice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it. They ſet ſail at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and went into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> through the ſtreight of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> where being oppoſite to <hi>Majorca,</hi> the wind turn'd contrary which occaſion'd the Captain and ſome others to go aſhore, with a deſign to return to the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56140:131"/>
Ship, aſſoon as the wind ſhould ſit right for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of their voyage. In the mean time, the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who were forc'd to ſerve, and in number, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Volunteers, perſwaded the latter to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, upon occaſion that their Officers enjoy'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves aſhore, while they endur'd the hardſhips of the Sea. They plotted together to render themſelves maſters of the Ship, and to return for <hi>Spain.</hi> The Seamen, who were <hi>Hamburghers,</hi> knowing nothing of their deſign were of a ſudden ſecur'd in the hold, with a guard ſet upon them, and as if they had taken a conſiderable prize, they rifled all in the ſtern, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to govern the Veſſel two ſoldiers, who, having been in the <hi>Indies,</hi> thought themſelves the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert among them, and conſequently fit to undertake that employment. All went very well, while they had no adverſary; but having ſaild ſome hours, they diſcover'd a Ship with green colours on the top-maſt. There was not any ſo ignorant among them but knew it to be a Pyrate of <hi>Algiers,</hi> ſo that perceiving it made ſtreight towards them, they put themſelves into a poſture of defence, diſpoſing eighty men on the Decks arm'd with Muskets and Half-pikes, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt under Decks to manage the Guns. The ſubtle Pyrat gets the wind of them, and gives them a volley of ſixteen Guns, which kill'd two or three men, and ſomewhat prejudic'd the ſails and tackling. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> who were between Decks anſwer'd him with twelve, but to no effect, for they knew not how to take their aim, and which was worſe, having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd, they knew not how to charge them again, and to faſten them, ſo that the carriadges and the Guns
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:56140:132"/>
roll'd-up and down with the motion of the Ship. The two Commanders were buſie at the ſtern, whence they gave order what was to be done, but their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not underſtanding the Sea-terms, did many times contrary to what was commanded. The Pyrate ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many people on the Deck, thought it not ſafe to board, but obſerving that the enemy made no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe of their Guns, imagin'd it was for want of Powder, and ſo hoping to get the better of them, he fir'd at them as faſt as he could. Then the Freſh-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-men began to ſee that they had undertaken the government of the Veſſel, as <hi>Phaeton</hi> did that of the Suns Chariot, and thereupon minding their ſafety, they reſolv'd to deliver the Seamen out of their Irons, and to employ them about the Guns, while they made good the Deck, and ſo ſent an Ambaſſador, who made this ſpeech to them; <hi>Gentlemen Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, the Veſſel is ſet upon by the Turks, you have your liberty granted you, on condition that you aſſiſt us againſt the Common enemy.</hi> He thought this news would have been acceptable to the Priſoners, and that they would have been glad of that favour, but he was much aſtoniſh'd to hear them bluntly making an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>That they ſhould make an end of what they had begun, and that they were reſolv'd to be ſlaves to their enemies, to be reveng'd of the affront done them by thoſe pretended Friends, by whom they had been trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like beaſts.</hi> The Ambaſſador makes a report of his Negotiation to his Companions, who were at ſuch a loſs, that they knew not what to do or ſay.

The Pyrate took their ignorance for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and drew neer to give them a double charge; but perceiving they laid down their arms, and made ſigns with their handkerchers faſten'd to their hats, he ſent the boat to them with fifteen Turks in it, who getting on the Deck, underſtood what poſture the Veſſel was in, pillag'd it, and out of compaſſion ſent for the Turkiſh Surgeon to dreſs the wounded, caſting into the Sea the dead and ſuch as they though irrecoverable, and making the reſt ſlaves. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> were chain'd in the Pyrates Veſſel, and the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> continu'd where they were, with ſix Turks to guard them. The Pyrate return'd to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi> where thoſe ſlaves were ſold, among whom was <hi>Franciſco Mendez,</hi> who ſent an account of his misfortune to his Mother, a poor widdow living at <hi>Ceuta,</hi> who, paſſing up and down <hi>Spain</hi> to gather what almes ſhe could, got together two hundred and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56140:133"/>
fifty Patacoons, and writ to her Son, that his Patron ſhould ſend him to <hi>Tituan,</hi> where ſhe would pay his ranſom. Having receiv'd this news <hi>Franciſco</hi> was embark'd with us, tranſported with joy for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his liberty, which he deſpair'd of, by reaſon of the poverty of his Mother, and the little likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood there was to get mony otherwiſe.

Theſe tidings tranſported <hi>Franciſco</hi> with joy, but it laſted not long; for while we were talking concerning his liberty, we hear'd a voice cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the grate above, for <hi>Franciſco Mendez,</hi> who lifting up his eyes ſees his Mother, who had been made a ſlave that day, being taken in the Brigantine, which ordinarily goes from <hi>Ceuta</hi> to <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> the <hi>Portuguez</hi> Soldiers having neglected their duty through drunkenneſs.

               <p>THough the Inhabitants of <hi>Iſeland</hi> thought they had had no other enemies then Poverty and Ice, the one whereof lyes perpetually, the other, for eight months of the year very heavy upon them; yet <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier,</hi> through a deteſtable avarice, envy'd them, that which no other Nation did, the onely happineſs they had, liberty. At my departure from <hi>Algiers,</hi> in the year 1642. a young man in Turkiſh habit came to me, having heard that I was a <hi>Dunkirk</hi>-ſlave, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to paſs through <hi>Madrid,</hi> and gave me a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition handſomely write in <hi>Latine,</hi> deſiring me to preſent it to the Ambaſſador of <hi>Denmark,</hi> then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident with the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> I wondred much at that conjunction of circumſtances, that a <hi>Turk</hi> ſhould deſire ſomething in <hi>Latine,</hi> of a perſon of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Nation, and could not imagine by the language wherein he ſpoke to me, which was <hi>Lingua Franca,</hi> that he was ſuch as I afterwards underſtood him to be. <hi>It is in your power,</hi> ſays the young man to me, <hi>to do the greateſt act of charity that ever one Chriſtian did to another.</hi> So proceeding in his diſcourſe, he rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me all the accidents of his life, to aſſure me of the juſtice of his pretenſions. <hi>It had happen'd ſome years ſince,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that an</hi> Iſeland-<hi>Renegado having
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56140:134"/>
been a long time abroad with the Pyrate of this City, without taking any prize, propos'd to the Captain, vex'd that nothing fell in his way, to make towards</hi> Iſeland, <hi>and landing there, to take</hi> Iſelanders, <hi>who ſuſpected not that there were ſuch barbarous people in the world. The propoſal was lik'd by the Captain, and the management of the enterprize was committed to that perfidious</hi> Iſelander. <hi>Soon after, the</hi> Turks <hi>came to a ſecure place known by the Undertaker, neer that Iſland, and ſent fifty ſouldiers aſhore, who brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way about eight hundred men, women, and children, and afterwards ſold them in this City for ſlaves, the manner whereof you know. Many dy'd by the change of air, others, out of a deſpair of being redeem'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd their Religion, and ſome few of them do ſtill patiently endure the heavy yoak of ſlavery, hoping that</hi> Chriſtian IV. <hi>King of</hi> Denmark, <hi>whoſe ſubjects they are, will have compaſsion on them, whereto they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he will be mov'd upon the mediation of his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador at</hi> Madrid. <hi>And as to what concerns me, wonder not that I concern my ſelf ſo much in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; know that though you ſee me in Turkiſh habit, I was born in</hi> Iſeland, <hi>and brought away thence with my Mother, and thoſe I told you off before. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving continu'd two years a ſlave, my Patron dies, and gives me my liberty, on condition I ſhould renounce, which I did, to procure the liberty of my Mother, who ſuffer'd extreamly, by being put to painful work, and unmercifully beaten. Being free I entred into the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa's pay, and went out to Sea, and having got together about a hundred Patacoons, I was in hopes to redeem my Mother, of a Moor, whoſe ſlave ſhe was; but the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56140:134"/>
Dog, having ſeen my proffer, treated her worſe then before, to make me give two hundred Patacoons, and I could not rest till I had made a ſhift for the other hundred Patacoons, which an honeſt Turk lent me, on condition he ſhould have my Mother for the ſecurity of his reimburſement. She is tolerably well treated where ſhe is now, but if I ſhould dye, ſhe would be reduc'd to the ſame condition ſhe was in before, and would never recover her liberty while ſhe liv'd.</hi> This diſcourſe having mov'd me to compaſſion, I gave the young man all the aſſurances I could of my readineſs to ſerve him in the delivery of his Petition. Being afterwards come to <hi>Madrid,</hi> I went to the Ambaſſador of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> the Sieur <hi>Hilarius Ulefelt,</hi> a Knight of noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, to whom I gave an account of what was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Petition, which I had loſt when we were caſt away.

               <p>THoſe who engage themſelves in great enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes are eſteem'd according to the good or bad ſucceſs thereof; if fortune prove favourable, they get the reputation of courageous and prudent; if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, their misfortune is accounted a puniſhment of their temerity and extravagance. Some, of Pyrates and Robbers, have come to be Generals at Sea, and powerful Monarchs, and gain'd honour by thoſe courſes, which brought others to the Gallies and the Gibet. Four younger Brothers, <hi>French</hi>-men, ſhall confirm this aſſertion, not that I mean they were Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates or Robbers, but Free-booters upon a double Commiſſion. Their birth had not furniſh'd them with any great conveniences, and therefore what was wanting that way was to be ſupply'd by their courage. In the year 1636. they reſolv'd upon a way, which was to ſeek their fortunes at Sea, getting together about fifteen thouſand Livers, wherewith they equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a Frigot of ten Guns. Two among them, who were Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> got a Commiſſion from that Order, againſt the common enemy of the Chriſtians; the others, one from the King of <hi>France.</hi> The noiſe of this expedition, the preparations whereof were carried on at <hi>Rochel,</hi> brought together fourſcore youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brothers, who, with their Officers, a good Maſter,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:56140:135"/>
and thirty ſix Seamen, were able and likely to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt great matters. All things being ready, they hoiſe ſail, deſigning to cruze up and down the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>-Sea between <hi>Cadiz</hi> and Saint <hi>Lucars,</hi> and ſo ſet a man aſhore there, habited like a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who underſtood the language of the Country, to ſee what Ships were bound thence, and to put up the Colours of <hi>France,</hi> as the moſt likely to do their work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. The Colours of <hi>France,</hi> as the moſt likely to do their work thereabouts. The Colours of the Order of <hi>Malta</hi> was to ſerve againſt the <hi>Creſcent,</hi> and particularly againſt thoſe of <hi>Algiers</hi> and <hi>Tunis,</hi> between which places and <hi>France</hi> there was a Peace, though ill obſerv'd on both ſides. The ſixth day after their departure, they ſet a man aſhore in the night time neer <hi>Cadiz,</hi> who return'd the night following, bringing intelligence that a Ship loaden with wine was ready to ſet ſail. Being come out, they gave it chace, and two days after having taken it, they rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the trouble of the Priſoners, ſetting them all aſhore. This prize of wine heighten'd the courage of our young Blades, and rais'd them to a higher conceit of their valour. The third day after this good fortune, they diſcover'd two Pyrates of <hi>Algiers,</hi> to whom they gave chace under the Colours of the Order of <hi>Malta.</hi> The Pyrates relying on their own ſtrength, and imagining that of our Younger-Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not to be extraordinary expect them with their ſails furl'd up. In the mean time the Adventurers conſult about the Attack, and reſolv'd to board the greater of the two Pyrates, and to abandon their own Frigot, which could not have the advantage of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56140:136"/>
the Pyrate furniſh'd with twenty four Braſs Guns. Order was given, according to the reſolution taken; but the Pyrate, who was well skill'd in his profeſſion, perceiv'd their deſign by the animoſity of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and ſeeing them come up neer enough to him, let down his ſails, to avoid grappling. This unexpected diſappointment, put the attempters into a little diſtraction, yet not ſo much, but that as they paſs'd by they gave the enemy a volley with their ten Guns, brought all of one ſide, receiving the like ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute from the Turk. They ſeveral times attempted to board, as being the onely way to gain the victory, but the Pyrates avoided it, and ſo the great Guns plaid on both ſides, till by misfortune at laſt a Bullet of ſix pound weight took the Maſt of the Frigot, which made them furle up their ſail, leaſt the wind might break the Maſt, which had been cleft by that unhappy ſhot. They ſtill courageouſly ſtood upon the defenſive, and they had defeated the Mahumetans, if the noiſe of their ſhot had not brought thither five o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pyrates of <hi>Algiers,</hi> which with the two already engag'd made a ſquadron of ſeven diſpos'd into the form of a half-moon, by which that unhappy Frigot was pepper'd of all ſides. Yet did not the courage of our Younger-Brothers fail them, for they gallantly made their party good for the ſpace of nine hours, during which they fir'd ſix hundred ſhot with their ten Guns. But as the number of the dogs occaſion the death of the Hare; ſo at laſt the Frigot ſhatter'd of all ſides, above and below, the water began to come in at the bottom, unhappily depriving thoſe gallant Gentlemen of the means rather then of the earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

The ſeven Pyrates ſent their Boats to ſave thoſe unfortunate perſons, moſt of whom were forc'd to betake themſelves to ſwimming, to avoid ſinking with the Veſſel, and ſo yeelded themſelves. They were divided among the ſeven Pyrates, who having alſo receiv'd ſome prejudice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Algiers,</hi> where theſe new ſlaves had been ſold at a low rate, upon this account, that they had the repute of being poor and diſcontented, if a perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Chriſtian, an Officer belonging to the Chamber of the <hi>French</hi> Trade, to ingratiate himſelf with the Baſſa, and General <hi>Pegelin,</hi> had not betray'd them, ſharing ſecretly with them in the buying of the four principal Adventurers, who were at the charge of the whole Expedition, and maliciouſly adviſing, that they ſhould be beaten, and threatned with the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and that they ſhould not be redeem'd on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other; which was done after ſeven years ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and extraordinary hardſhip, at the end of the year 1642. for rhe ſum of ſix thouſand Ducats, they having acquired no reputation by their generous reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and courageous conduct, becauſe the iſſue of their enterpriſe prov'd unfortunate.</p>

               <p>General <hi>Pegelin</hi> cruzing up and down the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean in the year 1641. notice was given him that the Gallies wanted freſh water, and being neer <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſen,</hi> he order'd them to touch at a place between that City and that of <hi>Oran,</hi> where he knew there was a Spring. He ſet aſhore thereabouts a hundred ſlaves, chain'd five and five together, every one with a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let on his back, convey'd by fifty Musketteers, to fetch water from that Spring, which was about a quarter of a league from the Sea-ſide. In the mean time the General, took the air aſhore, walking along the Sea-ſide, whither the <hi>Alarbes</hi> ſoon brought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments to ſell, as they are wont to do. They were follow'd by a Mooriſh Gentleman, who living thereabouts came to kiſs the General's hands, making him a preſent of Grapes, Figs, Lemons, Poultry, and the like refreſhments, which his ſervants brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him. The General thank'd him, and ſo they fell into diſcourſe. The Moor, who had never been out of his own Village, nor convers'd with any but

half-ſavage <hi>Alarbes,</hi> nor ſtudied but with ſome <hi>Cherif</hi> or <hi>Marabout,</hi> who had ſimply explicated the foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to him, was accordingly very ſimple, and wholly addicted to their Religion, which made him complain to <hi>Pegelin</hi> of his fortune, which had indeed ſufficiently ſupply'd him with Camels, Sheep, Oxen, and Servants, but all hindred not his being unhappy in one thing, which concern'd him more then all the reſt.

The General immediately caus'd the chain to be taken off the <hi>Eſpalier,</hi> who is the moſt skilful ſlave of any at the Oar, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the ſtrongeſt; for he begins the work of row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gives the meaſure which is to be obſerv'd by all the reſt. That ſlave was a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and could ſpeak the <hi>Arabian</hi> and <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Language, as having been a ſoldier at <hi>Oran.</hi> The General gave him a ſword, and a dagger, and acquainted him with the diſcourſe that had paſs'd between him and the Moor, ſending him to meet the other behind the hill, with expreſs order, not to do him any hurt, but onely to frighten him. Aſſoon as the Moor perceiv'd the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>-ſlave, thinking he came to have his throat cut, he kneel'd down, beginning to ſay the <hi>Aſſala,</hi> which is their prayer, that his ſacrifice might be the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Prophet, but riſing up he finds ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him a ſturdy fellow, arm'd, contrary to what he expected, which put him into a cold ſweat, yet perceiving he was oblig'd to fight inſtead of ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, he took courage and draws his Cimitar, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelf againſt the ſword and dagger of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, who ſoon made a ſhift to diſarm the Moor, which done, he ſuffer'd him to ſteal away. He comes all in a Fright to <hi>Alli Pegelin,</hi> making his complaint to him, that the Chriſtian, whom he had ſent came arm'd. The General laughing at the ſimplicity of the fellow, ſaid to him, <hi>Thus it is that you are to pleaſe the Prophet, if you will deſerve his favour as I do; for after this manner are Chriſtians to be ſacrific'd, the Prophet thinks it no ſervice to kill a man who is not able to defend himſelf. Mahomet was a generous and

valiant man; go and bid your Cherif</hi> (That is a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Prieſt) <hi>furniſh you with a better explication of the Alcoran.</hi> And ſo he ſhamefully diſmiſs'd the Moor, laughing at his ſuperſtitious piety.</p>

In the yeer 1640. there was but one or two Prieſts at <hi>Algiers,</hi> whereby the ſlaves of General <hi>Pegelin</hi> ſuffer'd much inconvenience in their Church at the Bath.

four hundred Patacoons. I imagin'd then that that habit had ſerv'd under the Caſſock of ſome Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of quality. Some days after, going to the Bath of the <hi>Duana,</hi> (which is that of the City, where the ſlaves are employ'd upon ſome publick works) I found that ſlave, who had exchang'd his Pluſh-coat for the habit of a Prieſt according to the mode of <hi>Algiers,</hi> made after the faſhion of a ſhort Coat, or Caſſock, reaching to the knees, of cloath, of the ſame colour as that worn by the Capucins in ſome Countries, eſpecially in <hi>Flanders,</hi> very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly cut out, and ill-fitted to the body, the party who wore it having not been trimm'd of a great while, out of ſhoes, in a word, very poorly accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, leaning againſt the Church-door of the ſaid Bath.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:56140:140"/>
into a little room oppoſite to the Stage, where he call'd for ſome Wine and a Collation. The great reſpect which the Chriſtian ſlave, who ſold the Wine, expreſs'd towards the Prieſt, rais'd in me the curioſity to ask him, how they came to be ſo intimately acquainted, ſince he was a Slave of ſmall ſtanding. <hi>He whom you take to be the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is but the Servant, the Slave of</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorca, <hi>whom you know, is the Maſter of this Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place and two others, wherein he keeps three Chriſtian ſlaves, to look to them, who give him an account every week of the Wine and other things he ſends in. I am here under him, and whatever he entruſts me with I give him an account of.</hi> He afterwards told me that the <hi>Majorcan</hi> had been made a Slave ſome years before, and had at the beginning ſuffer'd the miſeries of his condition, but that having afterwards made a ſhift by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to get together the ſum of a Patacoon, he had ſo advantag'd himſelf thereby, that he was able to keep thoſe three Drinking-places, which brought him in great profit. This diſcourſe ſatisfy'd me how it came to paſs that that <hi>Majorcan</hi> walk'd up and down, and was well clad. And finding that the Prieſt was ſo intimately acquainted with the <hi>Majorcan,</hi> I ask'd him what he had done with the Horſe I had ſeen him buy in the Market not long before. <hi>He preſented it to his Patron,</hi> reply'd the Prieſt.

which ſum he had paid to thirty, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely left unſatisfy'd, that he might go under the name of a Slave, and enjoy the protection of his Patrone, who was a perſon of great authority, with whom he liv'd in a good correſpondence, by means of his preſents.

While we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to the Baſſa's Palace, as may be ſeen in the diſcourſe of my Captivity, I took notice of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negado-youth, about twelve or thirteen years of Age, clad in red Silk, having a Turbant very neatly interwoven; I ſaw he had the priviledge to enter into the Baſſa's lodgings, and thoſe of his Wife, when he pleaſed, which is no ſmall favour in that Country. The Eunuchs belonging to the Baſſa's wife reſpected him, and gave him the title of <hi>Celibi,</hi> that is to ſay, Lord. The marks he had about him of a Renegado, and the gracefulneſs of his perſon rais'd in me a curioſity to enquire whence it came, that <hi>Amet</hi> (ſo he was called) had that priviledge above all the other Renegadoes of the houſe. I was acquainted with a <hi>French</hi> Renegado, Caterer to the Baſſa, who gave me an account of the Youth, and his relation acquainted me with a ſtrange effect of an extravagant paſſion. <hi>Wonder not,</hi> ſaid he to me, <hi>that Amet Celibi is in greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

then any of the reſt, his noble Extraction de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it. But imagine not his Friends have been wanting in their endeavours to recover him, they did all they could to have him again, but all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. That young Lad never was a Slave, as all the other Renegadoes were.</hi> And ſo proceeding in his diſcourſe, he told me, that the Lad was a <hi>Spaniard</hi> born, of a houſe well known, and had been ſpirited away from his Friends, and brought to <hi>Algiers,</hi> the manner thus.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath ſeated on the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean, and the Ocean, ſome places of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> which ſerve for a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to ſome, and ſanctuary to others. For that Prince being oblig'd to keep Garrizons there, he is ſo favourable towards ſome Delinquents as onely to condemn them to ſerve there, whereas other Criminels are ſent to the Gallies. Such as are Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> or of more then ordinary quality, to expiate their crimes, are baniſh'd into thoſe places, with obligation to maintain on their own charge ſuch a number of Horſe, according to the exigency of the caſe, and the ability of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. To one of thoſe Fortreſſes were ſent two Brothers, of a conſiderable houſe in <hi>Spain,</hi> who upon ſome occaſion or other had ſome difference. The elder thinking himſelf injured in point of honor, inſulted over his younger Brother, who on the other ſide being not able to ſmother his reſentments of the affront, fell to ſtudy how he might be reveng'd, but all his attempts were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ineffectual by the Governour of the place,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56140:142"/>
who was a very prudent Gentleman. Whereupon finding that he would not be permitted to fight his Brother, and having reſolv'd to proſecute his revenge, whatever it coſt him, he bethought himſelf of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which brought him to his own irrecoverable ruine.</p>
               <p>One day having obſerv'd that his Brother's one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son was gone out into the plain, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the City, to play, he gets on Horſe-back, and making as if he intended to take the air, he kindly calls his Nephew to him, and takes him up before him, and ſo riding on gently, till he got out of ſight, he put ſpurs to his Horſe, ſo that he ſoon got into the Country of the Turks, where having call'd for a Guide, he came in a few days to <hi>Algiers,</hi> deſiring audience of the Baſſa, whom he told, that he was come to preſent his ſervice to his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, with a deſign to renounce his Religion, and that as aſſurance of his fidelity, he preſented him with a lovely Child, who was his Nephew. The Baſſa accepted of the proffer, and order'd his Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs to cauſe him to renounce, and to bring him up in the Mahumetane Religion, giving him the name of <hi>Amet.</hi> The younger Brother alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd the Chriſtian Religion, and embrac'd the Turkiſh, and came afterwards to a wretched end.

The woman, having had notice of it, came to meet him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with a lovely childe about two years of age, whom ſhe had born him.

Though <hi>Alli Pegelin</hi> was a man of great wealth, yet was he a little ſtartled at the ſudden and bold reſolution of his Wife, and had ſome thoughts to ſend back thoſe pleaſant Ambaſſadors with as round an anſwer, but reflecting on the hundred thouſand Ducats, his ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice made him change his deſign, ſo that immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ere he came aſhore, he beſtow'd his ſecond wife on one of the Captains of his Gallies, yet kept the childe, who was brought up by the former Wife, and ſhe had ſo great a kindneſs for him, that ſhe gave him all her wealth, by which means he afterwards came to great charges and employments, though all his Fathers eſtate had been confiſcated for ſome Rebellion wherein he was engag'd.

And this intention lies ſo deep in the heart, that it is the hardeſt thing in the world to dive into it, before the effect come to light.
