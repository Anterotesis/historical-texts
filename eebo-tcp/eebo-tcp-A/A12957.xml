            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>One dish so curious, as may please each tast:</l>
               <l>Yet if this Host hath such a carefull minde,</l>
               <l>As that he will, for each mans stomacke, finde</l>

               <l>If thank-lesse Inuitants the same disproue?</l>
               <l>Some (peraduenture) doth one dish there see,</l>
               <l>Which with his nature doth not well agree:</l>
               <l>Some other may perchance dislike the feast,</l>
               <l>Because it is not all what he likes best.</l>

               <l>Pitty their weaknes then, seeing thou dost tell,</l>
               <l>Nothing to poyson humor, but expell.</l>
               <l>What if some others will thy feast abuse,</l>

The best loue therfore that can be bestowed vpon the people, or the best friendship that you can receiue from them, is to suffer them in thinges indifferent, or not to shew a currish seuerity: For (like the <hi>Hungarian Heyducks</hi>) their wrath is prone to mischief, &amp; their amity is worth nothing in a time of peace: so that indeed to flatter with them &amp; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them, is a sound propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:

The same may be inferred concerning all degenerate kinsfolke, though in a lesse degree. But for the first I haue obserued it generally; that

hee who was apt for Disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, hath been a man alwayes of as many affections, as there be faces: And as prompt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse any, as to receiue any, if hee might saue by the bargain.

                  <hi>If thou wouldst beate a Dog heere is a staffe.</hi> So that although churlish Parents pretend iust <hi>causes</hi> of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inheritance, yet <hi>these</hi> are quickly found, soone allowed, and as soone amplyfied. From whence you may gather, that no sparke of naturall affection but onely a compulsiue maintenance, keeps the reference betwixt such Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and such children. For louing nature and affection be tractable, of long forbearance, much pitty, manifest care; and keep an establisht forme of affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, with which friendes or kinsfolk be vnacquainted: This prouokes an eminent reflexe of loue; whereas rough carriage begets <hi>loue</hi> in Curres, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptible <hi>scorne</hi> in Noble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. In a milk-white table, one
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18403:59"/>
blot is more visible, then forty in a browne paper: And in a continued louing vsage, one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe is more preuaileable then fifty in a vsuall crabbednes. For common noyses go not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our eares; but a sudden clamor startles the whole man. It is therefore more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to follow the extreame of vertue <hi>abounding,</hi> then <hi>defectiue:</hi> The first partakes with medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie in the nature: but the last is altogether opposite. We may then more safely allow indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, then austerity: because it approcheth neerer to true loue. For though indulgence hath made children lofty in behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our towardes others, yet (I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue) it breeds a true and vndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorced affection towards the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall cause. It is therefore an excellent rule, for children, to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18403:60"/>
bee any way restrain'd without the Parents knowledge, or at least their taking notice: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Nature ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not grudge against Nature, nor yet want reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion For howsoeuer <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> said well: That hee had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be vnrewarded for doing wel, then vnpunished for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Yet we haue naturally a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret spleene against the Iudge, though wee account him righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and impartiall. It must be expected then, that children doe knowe a difference betwixt Fathers and Maisters; which makes them the more implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when they see Nature im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall. From hence <hi>Sertorius,</hi> a politicke Captaine, would not himselfe represse the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his Souldiers; least, howsoeuer they deserued ill, yet his correction might take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18403:60"/>
their louing duty: Which respect made him suffer the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes incursions, rather to scourge their insolence, whilst they, out of a hare-brained lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie desire battaile. And thus the sacred decree of Correction may bee kept vnuiolate, and the loue of children vnblemished. For I am vnanswerably perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that Parents wrath dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth the childes loue, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him seruile or else refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the doctrine of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues &amp; others; because they cannot vndertake with delight, so long as <hi>frownes</hi> and <hi>feare</hi> be crept into their fancy. But affable Parents beget truely affectionate Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who may endure another mans reproofe to mittigate the name of <hi>Cockney,</hi> and yet louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adore the Father because hee was alwayes louing. So then
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18403:61"/>
the Fathers diligent loue, and a Tutors modest instruction, may make a seldome-seene Heire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his Fathers life without hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, and proue a venerable wise man. Without which loue apparant, or oftentimes indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, I see an eldest sonne, in stead of the Fathers blessing, render backe sweating curses.

The diuorce of mariage is a weighty case, much forbidden, much controuerted; because mariage it selfe is made a strict vnion; so farre, as Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands seeme incorporate with their Wiues, being both to bee taken as one flesh. But this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on admits many exceptions; neither may any thinke their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made <hi>one,</hi> extends further, then the rhetoricall aggrauati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vnitie; to insinuate how difficult a thing Diuorce will be betwixt two, so narrowly vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but children haue a more exquisite property of indiuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; because they really partake with parents by existence: deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a particular &amp; true strength of body from the parents body. And therfore it seemes the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of disinheritance is a thing so odious, as (being held impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18403:62"/>
to be acted among the Iewes, or any Nation) no Law of Scripture contradicts it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed rebellious sonnes are by the verdict of Diuine iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to suffer death, if they shall strike the parents, or rise vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: But for the matter of Disinheritance (which farre transcends the punishment of death) I haue read no sillable that may giue the tolleration of Diuinity. Death indeed, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely respected, may be thoght the best wages of a rebellious son: for the act includes his full sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; because to smite his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, is to seek the destruction of his efficient cause: which act keeps within it so much ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as heauenly Iustice can do no lesse then remoue him who seeks to remoue his begetter; it being an inseperable part of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18403:63"/>
to pay offenders with their own coyne. But disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance so much exceeds death, as it approches to a continued tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Death is so far from mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where men expiate offences, as it affoords felicity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because it giues a present satisfaction, and a present hope to enioy a good portion; if penitence, and a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorie minde be compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But disinheritance, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, doth not onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force death, but makes the circumstance tyrannicall.</p>
               <p>A violent death is but an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of nature; but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inheritance doth often bring a violent death, and enlarge the wickednesse of nature. I see no difference betwixt them in the conclusion: for death is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly of disinheritance; but no death more excludes all

humanitie. the case is palpable. I giue directions to a traueller: he arrogantly contemnes my counsell; which doth so much prouoke me, as (to amend the matter) I draw him by compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to an apparant ambush; in which, after many sustained a buses, horrible vexations, and desperate encounters, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his life with infamie; or perhaps blasphemy. So, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and cruell parents, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inheritance deale euery way answerable to this similitude. The horror of which Athisme is the more amplified, by so much as naturall affinitie claimes a more humane pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident then strangers. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment or abiuration is tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: for it takes originall by publicke decree, superior coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and authority of those, from
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18403:64"/>
whom I can chalenge nothing but iustice: whereas disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, a Nationall banishment (transcending forraine exile in the <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi>) proceeds from priuate occurrences, that cannot reach so high an affliction; because the nature of it is equall to, nay aboue, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke iustice.

For if we take a view of those impulsiue causes which breed occasion; we shall perceiue how accessary Parents be to all their childrens vices; and by the consequent, how culpable they are to punish that so strictly, of which themselues be Authors. Shall the best man liuing suppose himselfe an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of things simply good, though in the strength of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, religion and thoughts, rectified, he doth performe them?

Is it not therefore a strict dealing when parents will not recompence an iniury, by a forgiuenes of that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which they themselues imparted? Setting aside the position which makes Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren participate with Parents in vices liable to constitution, we may (without these) demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18403:66"/>
how guilty they are of each notorious crime in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, through a pouertye of rectified education. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>This being concluded, we may well inferre, concerning disinheritance, that parents cur|'ses bee the onely causes which prouoke it (seeing they might sometimes, but doe not, and doe not sometimes because

Or how shall wee condemn, if they bee suddenly ouerthrowne by

the full necessity of destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Seeing their destitute fortune inuites them to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace each glistering temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to shake handes with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity. I cannot (for mine own part) comprehend all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remembrance and pitty of such Parents rnines; seeing they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not discharge all, before chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue incurred destruction without them.

cast off meere Humanity, and goe beneath a brutish goodnes of Nature, not onely to forsake, but to abhorre their issue; and leaue them destitute, before they bee any way enabled to su staine nature.

nothing about him, vnlesse you approach neere, and nothing in him worth himselfe, vnlesse you doe proceed.

His life ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a continuall haruest: his countenance and conuersation promise hope; they both smile vpon their obiect: Neither doth the end faile his purpose: for his expectation was indifferent and equall, according to the meanes.

When Gods determinations doe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore disappoint; he neither mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes, nor mis-interprets.

An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Reuenge be two turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent passions: In him (therefore) the first shewes only that he can apprehend: the last, that he can iustly preuent further mischefe.

So he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues nature as the motiue, not the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or structure of his worthinesse. His workes doe every way pronounce both nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, delight, and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the readers soule: which makes him neither rough, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, nor windy: for by a sweet contemperature of Tune and Ditty, hee entices others to goodnesse; and shewes himselfe perfect in the lesson. Hee neuer writes vpon a full stomacke, and an empty head; or a full head,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18403:105"/>
and an emptie stomacke. For he cannot make so Diuine a recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, stoope to the fordid folly of gal or enuy, without strength: or strength of braine stoop, and debase it selfe with hunting out the bodies succour. He is not so impartiall as to condemne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery new fashion, or taxe idle circumstance; nor so easie as to allow vices, and account them generous humours. So he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seekes to enlarge his credit of bitternesse, by a snarling seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; nor to augment his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance by insinuating courtship. He hath more debtors in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge among the present Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then Creditors among the ancient Poets. Hee is possessed with an innocent liberty, which excludes him from the slauish labour and meanes of setting a glosse vpon fraile commodities.

The dangerous name and the contempt of Poets, sprung from their multitude of corruptions, proues no disaduantage or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to him: for such be his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes that hee can walke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, euen through the worst infection.

then the cure growes desperate. If his humour be heriditary, hee is more familiar with it, and makes it the principall vertue of his family: If imitation breeds a habite, he makes it the pledge of sworne brother-hood, or at least the fauour of new acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: hee neuer is infected sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, or with one humour onely; for either he is now admitted to the seuerall orders; or hee is prompt enough to subscribe generally when occasion peeps.

which his vanity will not auerre to be ponderous, decent, &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall. Neither will hee abhor to iustifie them by his owne practise, against all opposers.

breaks his braine about the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of reason or inuention: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his humor is the priuiledge of both: It is therfore sufficient for him to bee extreame melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, and most ignorant of the cause or obiect; and sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee vnmeasurably frollick without prouocation: whilst he is onely beholding to a brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse temperature in discharge of his credit.

Hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours commonly for opinion where hee is so well known that opinion woulde persecute him, without labour: he thinkes reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion deceiues most vnsuspected and therefore hee first seemes to bee a zealous Christian. The Church is a principall parte of his deuotion; and to be a freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Auditor, or outwardly attentiue is a sure defence (hee thinkes) a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:18403:122"/>
gainst Capitall errour. Hee is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly kinde-hearted; cries <hi>God forbid. Amen, Christ be his comfort.</hi> But rather then he will seeme <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Puritune,</hi> with indifferent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, hee can breake an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scene Iest, be wanton, sociable or any thing till hee conuerse with a Presitian by whome hee hopes to saue: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his eyes roule vpward, his hands are eleuated, commiserating tearmes be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplid, with sighes innumerable: then hee rayles against the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, whome a little before hee heartily saluted. And after some paraphrase vppon the verse of such an Euangelist, Apostle, or Prophet, hee dismisses the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan, that he may laugh heartily. He is therefore much like a bookesellers shoppe on <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew day</hi> at <hi>London;</hi> the stalls of which are so adornd with bibles
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18403:122"/>
and prayer-bookes, that almost nothing is left within, but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then knowledge. His minde and memorie put on the same vizard of greatnesse, which makes him so much incline to the posture of weighty labors, that he giues no attention to things openly recited, though they actually possesse him. To bee imployed therefore for a Noble-man, is (to him) an infinite trouble, and begets imployment with all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance to discouer it: so the bare meanes to make men think hee is much entertained, costs a time equall to his occurrents. Being to bee visited (though by sure Clients) he hath the roome of attendance, the Art of delay, and a visage that seems pittiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interrupted. If he rides to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, the horses be early sadled and brought into the foreside,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18403:123"/>
that neighbours may obserue, when after fiue or six houres ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, hee comes like one that was detained by vrgent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunacies. if the company be pleased to laugh at his inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent folly; he doth by and by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you; <hi>giue mee a sudden iest or nothing; some vse your printed iest, I cannot endure it.</hi> His best mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials to worke vpon, bee Time, and Place; which if they affoord circumstance to let yon vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his new purchase, his new buildings, the great marriage of his Children, or entertainment of high personages, or bountie towards an Hospitall, it comes freely and fitly, if openly. When occasions trouble him a little, he loues to trouble himselfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly; and thinkes it a poynt of reaching pollicie, to reproue or amend that formally, which
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18403:123"/>
hath beene allowed by singular good iudgments. If hee dares (with priuiledge of the hearers ignorance) disparage worth in any, hee takes leaue of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and his own policie. This he takes in honour of his court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to shew hee can be ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and build on others ruines: But this proclaymes him a star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Cannib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For if you call him friend before he hath wres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the aduantage of an enemy, hee leaues you destitute, but more happy then you beleeue. If hee can seeme to forget your countenance, hee intends that you must thinke him deuoted to thinges aboue you, or that his braine labours: and vppon this ground he walkes when hee neglects your salutations, or takes no notice of your person. Briefly, he is a man of this daies profit; he respects nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out double interest, and that by compulsion.

I dare protest <hi>Doctor Anthony</hi> will not make <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> like a Spend-thrift: The truth is, a spend-thrift can dissolue a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of gold if hee had it.

He wooes credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a faire Semp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres: he will promise much and

mean nothing: for he distributes his words as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly do Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. He dreams of being Lord chiefe Iustice, or at least being eminent, though hee liues disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely; and hath no Saint but Fortune. He is, and euer will be a quarter behind with frugality; in which volume he cannot bee perfect, because the book is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect: for hee still rendes out the beginning of his lesson; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to begin a thrifty course. His Heauen vpon Earth is a faire Mistresse; and though his means be large, yet his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall sorrow is the lacke of maintenance. Hee is scarce any part of a Christian till hee goes to Prison: and then perhaps hee enters into Religion: If he doth not, I am sure hee is dead in law and turnes Cloister-man. The misery of his sence is an old ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:18403:126"/>
and his fathers life troubles him not a little: Almanackes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which foretell the death of Age, bee very acceptable. The hurly burly of his braine is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, &amp; he scarcely knomes what hee may freely make an election of. Hee is most truly like a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken lace, or seame-rent cloake; ready to bee taken hold of, as he walkes along, by euery ctooked naile &amp; tenter-hook. His worst bawd is too good a nature, which makes him incident to false applauses, and carue his soule out among his familiars: hee hath multitudes of deere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but his deerest frends are ready to stabbe him: For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those whom hee accompts so, bee men of fashion; or those who bee indeed so, desire his death, because they see no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. Hee is in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,

Hee scornes to acknowledge his debts, but as things of duty, with which mechanickes are (as he thinkes) bound to vphold high birth and Gentry: but the end proues otherwise. His downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall therfore is not admired, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee was euer falling; and his bare excuse, makes experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the shadowe. Briefly, hee may seem a treacherous friend; for hee deales dishonestly with all that challenge intrest in him; they bee his Creditors: And yet hee deales more louingly with them, then with himselfe; for when he paies them, he punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himselfe: If he cannot pay, hee is punished more then they;

Fortune makes him her most silly States-man: shee holds him by the chinne a while, but ere he can recouer what he onely wishes, he sinkes inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and worthily, for losse and gaine alike encourage him, but neuer satissie. Neither cares he to be thought an insatiable fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: for when he hath in any

mans opinion, fild his belly, his bones, are most busie. If he plaies vpon Ticket, he knowes you are but a simple fellow not able to exact, though hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solues to pay nothing; so he did neuer purchase, if not this way, except he borrowes; and that extends farre enough to make him thy debtor at his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. If he be perished, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is too feminine, thogh not degenerate; for seeing he was ruind vnder the Goddesse Fortune, he may well claime the portion of a rich widdow. If neither shee, nor any shee-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture else be gratious, let him vnpittied proue a Cheater, for he thrust himselfe to exile, &amp; went to willing bondage.</p>

Or take him naturally for a familiar kinde of Spaniell, that may be readily taken vp, and stolne away from himselfe, or his best resolutions. He is euer haunted with a blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weakenesse, and is as willing to embrace any, as not to bee distastfull vnto any: he trusts any mans opinion before his owne, and will commit his life to him that can insinuate: you get acquaintance with him by a bare salutation; drinke to him
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18403:131"/>
with a new complement, and you haue purchased his entire loue, till hee bee cheated. The name of Country-man, or ciuill carriage, vnlockes his Cabinet of intentions, till you extract the very quintessence. Good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes tickle him without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and he findes no reason to moderate his ioy, till he shewes the way for others to disapoint him; and being disapointed he is quiet. He cannot chuse but be exceeding credulous, for he confutes nothing further then his eye-sight, or common sense extends. Draw him to the paradise of taking all in good part; or teach him to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the worst things well, by screwing in a meere conceit of your generosity, &amp; he will thrust the ward-shippe of his credit, Lands, or Body, to your patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18403:132"/>
So you may take reliefe, and tender Marriage though his father held not in Knights ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. If you misdoubt he should perceiue you, or if you thinke it difficult to deceiue him; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his Title with his Index, or both together with his stuffe contained, and you may soone discerne him: For eyther vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly he doth betray himself, or false fire will discharge him: with much a doe, desiring to get a Mistrisse, hee proues some whores Idolater; and he feeles naturally for the haruest of his chin before seede time. Being a little boulstred vp with sweete heresies of subtill language, and Musicall Tauernes, he suddenly beginnes (except some charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hand reclaimes him) to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take Tobacco for a precious hearbe: and oftentimes I thinke

it cures his raw humour, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the price, without the Physicke. You may easilie also driue him to mistake brown paper for <hi>Littletons Tenures;</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uas, and Red Herrings, for his Fathers hopp bagges and Lent prouision. I need not say hee will be valorous; for Parasites &amp; Gony-catchers know, he often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times can see he hath been chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; yet his modesty will not suffer him to inforce satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

If hee bee a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> the best meates will soonest corrupt his carkasse, and his conscience: for

He accounts Cookery a delicate science, and preferres the knowledge of confectionary receipts; to which purpose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing passes through the throat, till he takes particular notice of the ingredients. He is troubled much to thinke, how hee may most readily shorten his life, &amp; not perceiue the reason: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee reuolues continually, what may bee most conuenient for the taste, and hurtfull for the stomacke.

of visitation; though hee comes with a resolued policy: But hee scornes blushing, like a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon smell-feast; &amp; vpon true reason: For modest bloud (being clarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pure) cannot finde way, through inch-deepe fatt, when it is call'd to answere.

Hee is contented to bestow bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken meate among poore folkes, but no money: for he loues not to depart with that, in which himselfe hath been no taster. He is the noted foe of famine, and yet hee is daily imployed about the procreation of a dearth: for the value of nothing is beyond his ability, if hee hath present money, though no more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to discharge the present

You may offend your selfe and him, lesse, if you kill him right out, then if you discourse with him halfe an houre.

in their nightly labor, by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king through the enclosure; or being idle they get liuings too many.

He can seeme no lesse then one in honour, or at least one mounted; for vnto miseries which persecute such, he is most incident.

preuented: Therefore a Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat and he, are at continuall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance: yet he is charitable and mercifull, for if the Pole-cat turns Ferret &amp; obeys him, none agree better: Hee doth <hi>Waiue</hi> much spoyle by his mid-night watches, and yet he owes no Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ship: The truth is, tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, nets, and other trafficke do escheate to him, although the owner be liuing. He verifies the prouerb of plenty: the more he hath, the more he would haue: for though his owne ground be full of breeders, yet he cannot forbeare to haue his hand in priuate Warrens. Hee is much, and most perplexed, because pales and hedges will not keepe his Cattell in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe: if he cannot therefore compound with the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours adiacent, he hath a tricke

to affright those that transgresse their limites, by scattering mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered captiues (as Pole-cats, and Weasels) in their places of refuge: And this is a deepe quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let in the profession: Besides this he hath little knowledge of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, except the science of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Trappes: or circumuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of innocent dogs to feed vermine. The chiefe petition of his prayer, is for blacke frosts, Sunne-shine weather, &amp; calme midnights: vnder protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the last, he walkes feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, with a pike staffe, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the liberty of that season a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other mens backsides: Where he hath many night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels, to the hazard of much Pullen, and indeed all things thieue able; if he doth not play the valiant Foot-man, and take tribute of passengers: Neither

metamorphosed into Trees, Rockes, and Waters: For when he pleases, they shall eccho and distinctly answere; and when he pleases, be extreamely silent.

The spring and he are still at variance: in mockage therfore, and reuenge together of that season, he weares her liuery in Winter.

                     <hi>women.</hi> She is a most intricate female text; and though her workes bee common, yet you may longer and with lesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection study her meaning then the <hi>common law:</hi> For she is ready to giue a new, before you haue learned the olde lesson. Shee hath a multitude of seruants and suffers all to bee before hand in their wages that they may still continue seruiceable. She may be truely said afayre one; for like some <hi>Faire</hi> of a dayes length her beautie spreads at morning and vanishes at night. The truth is I first began to looke vppon her, because shee said shee loued a Poet well, and was in part a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etresse: for which good quality I might haue loued her likewise but she was onely good at long <hi>Hexameters,</hi> or a long and a short euen for varietie-sake; which
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:18403:191"/>
came so full vppon <hi>Ouids</hi> amorous veine, that I despised her meaning. You may well trust her that she will proue fruitfull: for she is a vessell made for bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; and is therefore light in cariage. her affection toward sweete meates haue made her like a sugar chest apt to take fire. She had her education vnder a great Countes; and if she could leaue the Courtship shee learnt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she was a waiter, she might quickly proue a reasonable good woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Her body is (I presume) of Gods making: &amp; yet I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not tell, for many parts therof she made her selfe. Her head is in effect, her whole body and attire: for from thence, and the deuises there ingendred, proceedes her blushing modesty, her innocent white teeth, her gawdy gownes, her powdred hayre, her yellow
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:18403:192"/>
bands, her farthingales, and false Diamonds. All these together, and a quicke fansie commend her function: for Fidlers and Painters bee full of Crotchets. Shee is well acquainted with games, and is so farre confident they be lawfull, that shee makes no more conscience to couzzen you, then to handle a paire of Cards. She is alway loose-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died; conserue of sloes cannot binde her. You need not make the question whether she can sing; for visitation will teach you, that she can scarce leaue singing. And as for dauncing, she wil aske the question of you. She hath the trick of Courtship not to bee spoken with; to take Phisicke, and to let her mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bancke bee the best ingredient. She hath at idle houres handled Phisicke points her selfe: and if
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:18403:192"/>
any man aduentures on her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, hee will hardly scape a scowring. She is better then <hi>Greshams</hi> Almanacke to foretell seasons: When she complaines of head-ach, it signifies faire weather: for then she is medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to deceiue some honest Gull: and when she complaines downewards, of the winde col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, it signifies an vncleane sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. suspecting that a fresh sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath or may bee ill informd of her conditions, she will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test before-hand that she was once troubled with a sixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths timpany. Her wit is <hi>Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> because seldome: and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is wanting in the present delicacie of conceit, she makes good by rehersal of stolne witty answers, euen to the seauenth edition. She purposes to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell shortly: But her meaning
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:18403:193"/>
is to returne with some French commodity; and she will rather fetch it, though she may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at home, because shee loues the cheapest ware, and the out-landish fashion. She doth ambitiously bragge of the respect shee found among my Lords followers; and (so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to perswade by credit of her education) shee giues any man a gentle warning to refuse her. Her generosity extends thus farre; to bestow loue, and looke for neither thankes nor requitall: because a Marmoset and little Dog are ignorant of both. These excepted, she neuer loued truly. Her morall vertues be a subtill thrift, and a thriuing simplicity. But whilst she makes the best construction of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, she would make likewise a thousand pound Ioyncture of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:18403:193"/>
her behauiour only, and Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariage. This bargaine is open for any man, who thinkes not the peny-worth doubtfull. And yet I must confesse freely she hath more goodnes about her little finger, then I haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my whole body: I meane her Diamond. Her best Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to teach a Parret the Lords prayer; but the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements be a new matter: so that Petitions be more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible with her, then Instructions at her owne request therefore I giue this to her looking-glasse.</p>

These labour ioyntly as at an Alchymists furnace, onely to beget vapours: she receiues and sends backe breath with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; that is, her function. Her end is to kindle; <hi>That is,</hi> to warme, or burne: she can do both. And being quiet, or not in contention, she is without her calling; <hi>that is,</hi> her company. Her knowledge is her speech; the motiue, her tongue; and the reason her tongue also: but the subiect of her conference is the neighbours wife, and her husband; or the neighbours wife and husband both. The modesty that I could euer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue in her dealing, is thus much only: she must be twise intreated among strangers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she takes downe a whole glasse. She is the mirth of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and publicke meetings:
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:18403:194"/>
but her naturall season comes in with a minc'd pye, at Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas; when all may attend with leasure. She carries her <hi>bladder</hi> in her braine; <hi>that,</hi> is full; her <hi>braine</hi> in her tongues end; <hi>that</hi> she empties: <hi>It</hi> was washed downe thither with pintes of Muscadine; and being there, she looses it like vrine, to ease her kidneyes: which would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise melt with anger, if she might not speake freely. Being once a seruant, she then learnt to runne, or goe apace; that shee might tarry and take, or giue intelligence by the way. She aemulates a Lawyer in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the circuite, and therefore she keepes a circuit, in, or out of her owne liberties: striuing to be both one of the Iudges, Iury &amp; false witnesses: for she loues, to be vniuersall. She contemplates
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:18403:195"/>
within, that she may practise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and then she spewes vp secrets as if they were mixd with <hi>stibium:</hi> her reasons be <hi>colour;</hi> that she dawbes on euery Fable: Her truth is, to make truths and tales conuertibles: tales be her substance, her conceit, her ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, reconcilements, and discourse. Not one woman in the parish shall commonly be accounted honest without her licence: which must be purchasd by consenting to her motions. She makes euery new inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant pay the tribute of an inuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before she speakes well of him, or calls him neighbor: And by the vertue of a speciall mouth-glew, she cleaues readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all acquaintance. To talke of Cookerie, or cleanlinesse, &amp; to taxe others, is her best and onely commendation. Her

lungs be euerlasting: she cannot be shortwinded: i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> those would perish, she might be recouered. She is a like dangerous with the Poxe, to the towne where she inhabites: and being pledged, or admitted among the females she infects more easily. If she railes against whoredome, it sauours not of deuotion; for she is onely married, to escape the like scandall; from the doore outward. She is more fugitiue then a swallow: there is no hold to be taken of her in her owne house: A venison Pasty will drawe her all ouer the parish: nay her nostrill is so quicke, that she will discouer it though it be Mutton, within a miles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe; and vexe all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors with her impudence if she be not inuited. The buriall of a second husband giues her the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:18403:196"/>
title of experience; but when she hath out-liued three, she takes authority and experience both (as a Souldier that hath passed the pikes of three set bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes) for granted. Her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable antiquitie reaches not aboue fiftie; for growing old, she growes odious to her selfe first: And to preuent the losse of company; (hauing liued vainly) she commences hostesse: that alone preserues her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.

                     <hi>Cleomines</hi> interpreted the fire which brake from <hi>Iunoes</hi> Image, so may we interpret a Pollititians sicknes: If it proceeds from his heads deuises, as when he counterfeits to worke some subtlety, then we may looke that he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile and recouer: but when
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:18403:207"/>
his paines proceed really from the hart, we may then imagine that he can goe no farther. He makes me think of many Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; who play cunningly while they can loose little; but when they hazard a round purchase, they proue arrant bunglers: and so the Pollitician is a most accurate gamester whilst hee doth only hazard some repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fortune, but now he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the maine happines, <hi>life,</hi> he quailes and growes faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted.
