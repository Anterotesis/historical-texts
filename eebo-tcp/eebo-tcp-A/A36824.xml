            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Book, which was written for the
ſatisfaction of a particular perſon hath
been eſteemed worthy of the publick
view; neither had the intention been
good, to have kept it from the ſight of
the world. Theſe who have ſeen it, ſay,
when it ſees the light, it will be well
received. In this conjuncture of affairs, every man talks
of the Peace the Emperor hath made with the Turk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own fantaſie, without enquiring what moved
that great Prince to come to an accommodation with the
Infidells. Many do importunatly deſire to hear the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the late war of Hungary, with all its circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and yet are ignorant of the original of the troubles,
the cauſe of the Hungarians misfortunes, the pretentions
of the Ottomans, the deſigns of the Tranſilvanian, and
the rights the Houſe of Auſtria hath to that Kingdom:
This Book doth exactly clear all thoſe things; It gives us a
ſhort abridgement of the Turks wars with the Hungarians.
It mixeth Policy with Hiſtory: It deſcrives ſuccinctly the
Ottoman exploits in that Countrey, how they have afflicted
<pb facs="tcp:52894:3"/>
it three hundreth years, ſince Bajazet was invited to come
to it: And it gives us a pretty Relation of the late trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
till the Peace was concluded. And upon that Peace
hath a particular Diſcourſe, which ſhowes what moved
the Emperor to imbrace it, and of the intereſt the greateſt
part of the Princes of Europe hath in it. And ſtill the
Author with a poliſhed politick ſtyle, ſpeaks like a faithful
and unintereſſed Hiſtorian. And though he be not a
French-man, yet there is nothing of rudeneſs to be ſeen
in his diſcourſe. His expreſſions are not ſtrained or affected:
And his language on this ſubject, is no other then what
would have becomd a native of France. If you will be at
the trouble, Reader, to peruſe the Book, you will be the
better able to judge of it. And if you reflect upon the
Dialogue of which it is compoſed, you will cry up the dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
of the Author, who aſſumes the more liberty to ſpeak,
becauſe he is to anſwer the demands of a Prince who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates
him.</p>

if their intelligence, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

not ſo exact as that of
this Counſellor of the Duke of Wirtemberg, it is no wonder;
for he might more eaſily draw clearer water then they, as
being nearer the head of the fountain. They do not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the cauſes of the laſt war between the Chriſtian and
Turkiſh Emperors, ſo well as he ſeems to do, neither doth any
of them ſpeak of the Peace, or the motives to it, both which
he doth. If it be ſaid, that the late rupture between the King
of France (of whoſe praiſes, and ſome other French-men,
this Writer is profuſedly liberal) and Spain, doth ſhow
<pb facs="tcp:52894:4"/>
that his conjecture of the continuance of Peace between
them, proved not right; it may be anſwered: Firſt, that he
could but gueſs, with probability, of future contingencies.
And next, if the Emperor did forſee that breach, he had
the more reaſon to accept the Peace was offered him by the
Grand Viſier. A little time, perhaps, will tell us, that the
Author hath not taken up his meaſures right, in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the election of a King of Pole, yet it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
that he hath written very rationally on that ſubject.
And who knowes, but the reſult of the Polonian conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
at this time, may be ſuch, as may make it appear, he
hath not far over-ſhot his mark? For theſe reaſons, I thought
that they who underſtand Engliſh beſt, would not think

There is no good which doth
not arrive, nor evil which is
not accompliſhed. I am of the
contrary opinion; for we enjoy
no ſweets in this life, which are
not mixed with bitterneſs: and we find the end of
one evil to be but the beginning of another. Theſe
perſons whom we account happy, have often more
reaſon to lament then rejoyce: And the misfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
who far exceed the other in number, fall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
from a leſs diſaſter in a greater. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that George Ragotchy, Prince of Tranſilvany,
entered Pole, not long ago, as victorious, and came
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52894:6"/>
out of it with broken wings. At that time you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
with me of the inconſtancy of Fortune, and
ſhew me, that theſe alterations were no new emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,
in regard many have been ſeen led in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,

               <p>What ever I have ſaid to you before, I did
ever believe, and I hold it ſtill for a certain truth,
that moſt part of men have more reaſon to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to God for the good they receive from him, then
to petition him for a deliverance from the evils which
afflict them: And yet we hear more complaints then
praiſes, becauſe we are more ſenſible of pain then
pleaſure. A Prince is not ſo much contented to have
been victorious all his life, as he is afflicted to ſee
Fortune turn her back upon him in one ſingle ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.
A great Man who almoſt found nothing
impoſſible to him, till he was fifty years old, and who
had ſeen his moſt redouted enemies brought under
his power, ſaid, <hi>That Fortune was a woman, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
young men better then old.</hi> And retired himſelf to a
ſolitary life, becauſe he ſaw his ambition limited by
one of the greateſt Empires that ever was. There
are ſome who take a permiſſion, raſhly to hazard on
any enterpriſe that pleaſeth their capricious humor;
and do exceſſively complain, when theſe things
which themſelves began without judgement, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth
to their misfortune. Certain it is, that the
Divine Providence, which the vulgar nick-name For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
often abateth the pride of the moſt ſucceſsful,
to make them acknowledge that what they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
proceded from his Bounty, and not from
their prudence. We ſee many States-men, who ſee,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52894:6"/>
or think they ſee all things, and yet are blind as moles
to theſe calamities; which threaten both their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

George Ragotchy and Janos Remin, to mount Abaffi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on

this rupture hath ſo many circumſtances, preceeding,
accompanying, and following it, that I may with

them; and that theſe who ſhal conſider them after

               <p>I have always looked upon your will as a law
which ſhould over-rule me, yet I am to obey you in
this with ſome reluctancy; becauſe, I fear, I muſt
ſpeak more then perhaps willingly I would: And
becauſe you muſt know from whence the remedies
muſt be taken which are intended for application, I
ſhal endeavor to ſatisfie you; And that you may have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52894:7"/>
reaſon to acquieſce to what I ſay, I will lead you to
the ſource and fountain from whence ſprung our
miſeries; and will briefly repreſent to you, what the
Turk hath done in Hungary ſince Bajazeth came there
to ſupport the rebellion, and foment the diſcord. I
know, that theſe who know no better, ſay, when the
Turk intendeth a war, he hath little regard to juſtice;
&amp; that the ſmal difficulty he proponeth to himſelf to
meet with in the proſecution of his enterpriſes, is the
principal cauſe of his undertakings. For my part. I
profeſs, that little faith ſhould be given to an infidel;
and that the end of the Turks deſigns, is ſeldom
other then his advantage: yet it is not impoſſible, for
all that, but that he may many times find a ſpecious
pretext, wherewith to cover the ugly face of theſe
diſorders, which his ambition procureth in the world.
And therefore I will ſhow you what reaſon the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomans
conceive they have to keep the ſoveraignity
of Tranſilvany, whereby you will alſo learn the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
why we are now calling our forces together, and
begging aſſiſtance of Strangers, to defend it againſt
them. And then I ſhal come to theſe reſolutions that
are now concluded at Ratisbone, by which theſe will
be ſatisfied who deſire to know the manner our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
uſe to contribute for the preſervarion of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
and for the maintenance of the war we are
engaged in, for our defence, againſt ſo mighty an

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52894:7"/>
worth and merite the Commanders of them be; for
theſe who look upon any novelty, deſire to know
the cauſe of all. And this war of ours having had its
riſe from the diſreſpect was given to the Sultan of
Turky by Ragotchy, and the protection which the
Emperor vouchſaved to give to Remin Janos, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
chooſe, but hear with much ſatisfaction the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
why the Grand Seigneur offers to chaſtiſe theſe
Princes of Tranſilvany, who offer to raiſe a war with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p>In the year 1350. or as others write 1383. Lewis
the firſt of that name, reigned peaceably over the
people of Tranſilvania, Moldavia, Valachia, Myſia,
Dalmatia, Sclavonia, which were appartenances of
his Kingdom of Hungary: But his repoſe was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by a miſchief which he could not prevent,
becauſe he could not foreſee it. Joanne Queen of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
a Princeſs extreamly diſſolute, having preferred
in her affection ſome young Neapolitanes to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
King Andrew, put him to a cruel death. The
news whereof, with the letters of thoſe who abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the parricide, did quickly ſtir up a deſire of a juſt
revenge in the ſoul of King Lewis. This generous
Prince finding himſelf oblidged in honor and juſtice,
to take armes, to avenge the death of his brother,
raiſed a puiſſant army, and marched ſtraight to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
His expedition was fortunate, for having chaſed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52894:8"/>
away the Queen and routed her party, he very ſoon
reduced the Rebells to obedience, and then puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
the principal Counſellors of that deteſtable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicide.</p>
               <p>This being done, ſuppoſing Hungary ſtood in
need of his preſence, he bethought him of his return
to his ancient Kingdom, but not till he had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the preſervation of his new acquired one. He
had brought with him, many brave and noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
both for birth and merite; amongſt the reſt Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Vayvod of Tranſilvany, who though young, had
a very hie place in the Kings favor: Him he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Lieutenant, and with him left ſufficient forces
to keep the new conquered Neapolitans within the
limits of their duty. The departure of Lewis encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
Joanne, &amp; the Prince of Tarente her new hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
to make an attempt to remount the throne.
But the prudence, valor, and fidelity of the Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanian,
rendered their endeavors ineffectual, till
Pope Clement the ſixth put an end to the war. The
ſignal ſervices which the Vayvod had done to the
King his Maſter, both in Naples, and to his friend
and Ally, Francis Carcarius, Prince of Padoua, made
him dream of vaſte recompenſes, wherewith his
hopes fed him: But he did but flatter himſelf; for
Lewis not only fruſtrated him of his great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but recalled him alſo from the Government of
Naples jealous of the worth and vertue of ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
a perſon.</p>

               <p>Other great Potentats have done the like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after King Lewis. Narſes and Gonzale have
furniſhed matter enough to the Writers of their times,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52894:8"/>
to lay foul imputations on the Emperor Juſtinian,
and Ferdinand King of Arragon. But how did Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

               <p>This Tranſilvanian, as accompliſhed a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
as he was a Captain, diſſembled his reſſentiment
till ſome favorable opportunity ſhould be offered,
whereby he might with advantage revenge himſelf.
This proffered it ſelf by the death of the King, who
left no other ſucceſſor but a daughter, named Mary,
affianced to Sigiſmond of Luxemburg, King of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.
The non-age of this Princeſs, the unconſtant
humor of the Hungarians, and the practiſes of our
Vayvod, procured ſuch a contempt of Mary, that
many ſaid publickly, They would not be governed
by a Girle. This Cabal knowing the dexterous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
of the Biſhop of Zagabria, who was an Italien,
both by extraction and inclination, ſent him to
Charles the ſecond King of Naples, the ſon of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,
and Couſin-germane of Mary. The Biſhop
did exactly that for which he was ſent. He offers the
Kingdom of Hungary to the King of Naples, and
prays him to come &amp; take poſſeſſion of the Eſtates,
which (as he ſaid) of right belonged to him. Charles
gave a favorable audience to the Biſhop, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his mind perplexed with paſſions of diverſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
required a time to reſolve of a buſineſs of ſo
great importance. He broke the matter to his Queen,
who forgot not to diſſwade him, both with reaſons
and tears, from an entrepriſe dangerous, for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
unconſtancy of the people; and ſhameful, for
the great injuſtice he ſhould commit, in robbing his
near Kinſwoman of her inheritance, without any
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52894:9"/>
color of reaſon. But at length, both Equity, Juſtice
and Reaſon, muſt yeeld to Ambition. Charles equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
a great Navy, and accompanied with an army
ſuitable to ſuch a King, he landeth in Dalmatia, and
in few days came to Zagabria, where he was met
with many of theſe Nobles who favored his entre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.
From thence he marched to Buda: and though
he met with ſome reſiſtence by the reſolution of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas
Gara, and ſome other faithful ſubjects of the
Queen, yet he was eſtabliſhed in the Kingdom by
the favor and aſſiſtance of the Tranſilvanian Vayvod.
Sigiſmund King of Bohemia, and husband of Queen
Mary, ſeeing the loſs of Hungary inevitable, retired
himſelf to his own Kingdom. And then Charles
thought he had ſtruck a nail in the wheel of Fortune.
His joy notwithſtanding was but ſhort, and his uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
no longer lived then other violent actions are.
Sigiſmund is recalled by the enemies of the Uſurper;
and having routed Charles, killed or chaſed all that
offered to reſiſt him, reeſtabliſheth himſelf in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
of Mary his Queen.</p>

               <p>The loſs and defeat of the King of Naples,
made the Vayvod diſpair, and forget all that is dear
and precious to men, Religion, and Countrey. He
trode upon all conſiderations, divine and humane,
and hath his recourſe to Bajazet King of Turks, to
whom he promiſeth his daughter, on condition that
he ſhould aſſiſt him to chaſe Sigiſmond and Mary
out of their Kingdom of Hungary. This was the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52894:9"/>
beginning and original of the miſeries of this (till
then) flowriſhing Kingdom; and of the hopes the
Infidels conceived to make it a part of their Empire.
Bajazet layeth hold on Occaſion, marcheth with a
mighty army towards Hungary, meeteth with King
Sigiſmund near Nicopolis, between whom was
fought a fierce battel, where twenty thouſand Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and three ſcore thouſand Turks, were laid in
the duſt, upon the 18. of September 1396.</p>

               <p>I believe it was there where John Duke of
Burgundy was taken priſoner, with the loſs of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Gentle-men, whom he had carried with him to
that war. But if I be not deceived, the Turk made
no great progreſs in Hungary during the reign of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Theſe Burgundians kept company with the
Hungarians who died at that time. But in Sigiſmund
and his Succeſſor Albert of Auſtrias reigns, the Turk
gained but little ground in Hungary. He reſolved to
go ſoftly, and to be firſt Maſter of Conſtantinople,
before he would fix his thoughts elſe where. But for
all that, he learned the way to give us viſits. Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
the firſt beat the Hungarians at Tautemberg, in
the year 1400. And the Infidels advanced by little
and little immediatly after the death of Albert of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria.
This Prince at his death left his Queen with
child, which occaſioned great diviſions amongſt the
Nobility. Some thought it fit to wait till the Queen
were brought to bed, before any thing ſhould be
done in order to the election of a new King. Others
made difficulty to obey a child, though ſhe ſhould be
delivered of a ſon, and therefore reſolved to chooſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52894:10"/>
a King, capable to govern them. Hungary being thus
divided, a faction of the Great Ones ſent an offer of
the Kingdom to Vladiſlaus, the ſon of Caſimir King
of Polen. Another party preferred Ladiſlaus the ſon
of Albert, though he was yet in his cradle, and in it
they ſet the Crown upon his head.</p>

               <p>Truth it ſelf doth teach us, what danger Eſtates

               <p>This diviſion of affections and forces moved
Amurath the ſecond to take the field: and taking his
advantage of the diſcords of Hungary, pierced to the
heart of the Countrey, and beſiedged Alba Royal.
Yet he got not all done he deſired; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair,
he loſt almoſt all his army, and was forced to
raiſe the ſiedge. This affront did irritate the Tyrant.
who to have his revenge, entered Hungary with new
forces, where he was defeated by John Huniades
Corvin. This action, as it gained much reputation to
Corvin, ſo it enflamed Amurath with ſpite and rage:
and therefore oppoſeth to Huniades, who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
General of King Vladiſlaus his armies, two of
his braveſt Captains, theſe were Iſaac and Mezets,
who entered Hungary and Tranſilvany both at once,
and filled all places where they came with terror,
fire and confuſion. Huniades runneth to the reſcue,
renconntreth them loaden with ſpoil, chargeth them
gallantly, but unfortunatly; for he was beaten back,
and put to flight. Amurath encouraged with this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
thought on nothing but the utter ruine of the
Chriſtian Countreys. Mezets returneth to Hungary,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52894:10"/>
ſpoileth and waſteth many fair Lands: and having
deſtroyed and put to the ſword a world of poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents,
was thinking of his retreat, Huniades
thought he had a fair occaſion offered to repare his
former loſs, meeteth with Mezets, chargeth him, and
defeateth him ſo entirely, that ſcarce one Turk was
left alive to carry the unwelcom news to Sultan
Amurath.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>And ſo they did with much advantage: and
without all doubt, there had been a remarkable
change of the face of affairs between Hungary and
Turky, if the general good had not been ſacrificed to
particular intereſt. King Vladiſlaus had in his Court
Julian the Legat of the Holy See, and George Deſpot
of Myſia, who ſpeaking of nothing elſe but the great
fortune and happineſs of Vladiſlaus, the generoſity
and gallantery of Huniades, and how eaſie it was to
recover what had been formerly loſt to the Turks,
carried on the young King to an high enterpriſe.
Preparations being made, and the troops gathered
together, Huniades is ſent away with the Vanguard.
His expedition was ſo fortunate, that he regained
many places: And if he had not been kept up by the
irreſiſtable cold of a rigorous Winter, it was believed
he had marched into the heart of Thracia, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the Turks Europeans Dominious. In this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
Huniades fought eight conflicts with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rambo,
a valiant Turkiſh Captain; in all which, he
came off with honor and advantage. The rigide vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Seaſon prohibiting him further action,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52894:11"/>
he retireth to Buda, carrying along with him, as a
Trophee of his victory. Carambo, who having fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
in a pit of ſnow, was forced to yeeld himſelf pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.
After theſe atchievements, which tended ſo
much to the glory of Vladiſlaus, and the immortality
of the name of Huniades, the Embaſſadors of the
Conſtantinopolitan Emperor, the Venetians, and the
Genouays, came to complement the Hungarian
King, and exhort him to the continuance of the
war, which he had ſo gloriouſly, and fortunatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.
They aſſured him, that all the forces of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom
would ſecond him. That they ſhould ſend a
Navy to ſtop the Turks paſſage over the Helleſpont:
And that the Grecians ſeeing their deliverance at
hand, would pluck up their hearts, renew their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
courage, and break in pieces the iron bonds of
their ſervitude. The Deſpot of Myſia added to theſe
motives, all ſuch reaſons as his vehement deſire to
recover both his Principality and his children (who
were in the hands of the Turk) could ſuggeſt to him:
So that all things, accidents and emergencies ſeemed
to diſpoſe the King to the proſecution of a War, as
profitable, as honorable for the Chriſtian Common-wealth.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>But it tended to the diſaſter and ruine of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,
and I ſhal tell you how. Amurath the ſecond
King of Turks perceiving all Europe banded againſt
him, and fearing the powers of Aſia, in ſo great an
exigent, had his recourſe to prudence; and by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
dexterity, obtained that peace of Vladiſlaus,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52894:11"/>
which the evil aſpect of his affairs made him ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
deſire. He ſent Embaſſadors, in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to treat concerning the ranſom and liberty of
Carambo; but in effect to conjure that thunder, and
divert that ſtorm which threatned to deſtroy him.
The Turks Miniſters knowing what power the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpot
had in the Kings Counſel, and in the affection of
John Huniades Corvin, caſt up a right account, and
concluded, that if they gained him, they had done
their buſineſs. They caſt up therefore two ſtrong
batteries againſt him, and out of them roared upon
him with the great Ordinance of Affection and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
againſt which few men are proof. They offer
him a full reſtitution of his Eſtates, with the liberty of
his children, if he would obtain of King Vladiſlaus
that Peace which they deſired of him on reaſonable
conditions. The Deſpot was marvellouſly well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with this propoſition of the Infidels: And by his
dexterous adreſs, got Huniades to be of his party.
Theſe two having agreed upon the matter, found no
great difficulty to move the King to an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Peace is concluded, Amurath retireth his
guariſons from all theſe places he kept in Myſia, and
reſtored them faithfully, and kept exactly every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the Peace, not failing in any one of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
But while both parties are buſied about the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the Treaty, cometh letters out of Grecia,
ſhowing that the Greeks, who knew nothing of the
Peace, did expect every minute the beginning of the
war. That in a game wherein they were ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
they intended not to ſit ſtill with croſſed
arms. That the abſence of the Sultan, then in Aſia,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52894:12"/>
gave them a favorable occaſion to advances their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
And that the Italian Navy, which then advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
towards the Helleſpont, with great importunity
demanded the ſame thing. When theſe Letters were
read in the Kings Counſel, there were not any; nay,
even of thoſe who had moſt violently carried on the
Peace, but were extreamly grieved that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.
But no man durſt propone the breach of an
agreement which was confirmed by oath made in
the moſt ſolemn manner. Cardinal Julian, the Popes
Legat, a man powerful enough to perſwade, of great
eloquence and credit, inſtigated by an indiſcreet zeal,
and by an impious piety, endeavored by a ſtout, but
well ordered and learned Diſcourſe, to prove that
the Treaty concluded with the perfidious Turk,
ſhould be broken. He chid the ſcrupulous, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the fearful, and comforted the afflicted, till he
moved the King, and the Great Ones, to a rupture of
the Peace, He ſaid, he had ſufficiently fore-ſeen the
miſchief; but he would not oppoſe the Treaty, leſt he
ſhould ſeem to accuſe John Huniades Corvin of want
of prudence, or be eſteemed mercileſs to the Deſpot
of Servia, who could not get his beloved children out
of the Turks power, but by a Peace. He aſſured his
Audience, that the buſineſs was not paſt the hopes of
a remedy, in regard they might ſafely break Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with the Infidel, who by craft and fraud had
brought them to the breach of the ſacred knot of a
Chriſtian League and Alliance. He repreſented to
them, that the Hungarians could not make Peace
with the Turkiſh King, without the conſent of their
Brethren: and that men could not keep an oath
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52894:12"/>
unjuſtly taken, without a double breach of Juſtice.
He endeavored to prove, that the promiſe made and
ſworn to Amurath, was void, and did not at all bind
their conſciences: and that they ought to give truſt to
him, as to one beſt ſeen and known in affairs of that
nature. And concluded, that they ſhould bring their
forces together, and march to Thracia, there to joyn
with the reſt of the Chriſtians, before the fault they
had committed ſhould be known over all Europe.
Theſe and ſuch like reaſons pronounced with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of a Legat, and by a perſon extreamly elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
prevailed ſo far with the Hungarians, that they
agreed unanimouſly not to diſert their Chriſtian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in this fair occaſion. And for this effect, their
forces are rendevouzed, and Huniades marching
with the Vanguard, is followed by King Vladiſlaus
with the groſs of the army. On his march, Dracula
Vayvod of Valachia, came to him, who told him he
wondered of his confidence, that would with ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
troopes hazard to ſeek and provoke ſo
mighty an enemy, who uſed to go a hunting accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with as great number, as thoſe the King then
had with him, and counſelled him to return. His ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
was rejected, and ſo the Vayvod leaving four
thouſand horſe under the conduct of his own ſon
with the King, retired himſelf. Amurath being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that Hungary armed againſt him, left Aſia, and
came to Europe; drew his forces together, as ſpeedily
as he could, met Vladiſlaus at Varna, a town in Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,
and gave him a total overthrow. The loſs of
this day, ſo diſmal to the Chriſtians, and ſo joyful to
the Infidels, did let us ſee by the death of Vladiſlaus.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52894:13"/>
of Julian the Legat, &amp; a world of brave Gentle-men,
that faith ſhould be punctually kept: &amp; that God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
the perjured, though they cover their perfidy
with cloaks of ſpecoius colors. They ſay that Amurath
ſeeing his men worſted at the beginning of the battel,
pulled out of his boſome the Treaty that was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
between him and the Hungarians, and looking
towards heaven, ſpake theſe words with much zeal
and paſſion: <hi>JESUS CHRIST, Behold the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which the Chriſtians made with me, and ſwore to me
by thy Godhead; and by breaking it, hath mocked thee and
me. Now, O CHRIST, if thou be a God, as they ſay
thou art, revenge the injury they have done to both thee and
me: And make it appear to theſe who yet know not thy
Name, that thou knows how to puniſh ſuch as violate the
Religion of faithful promiſes, confirmed and ſworn by thy
Divinity.</hi> This prayer was ſeconded by the entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
of the Chriſtians. The head of the King was

               <p>It was then the Almighties pleaſure only to
chaſtiſe this unfortunate Kingdom; but not wholly to
ruine it, and ſo preſerved John Huniades Corvin, who
ſeeing all things in a deſperate condition, after the
death of the King, ſaved himſelf by flight. The year
following, the Hungarians who till then had rejected
Ladiſlaus the poſthume ſon of the Emperor Albert
of Auſtria, unanimouſly acknowledged him for King,
though he was but five years old: and becauſe of his
tender age, they committed the management of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
to John Hunniades who two years after increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Amuraths trophies with the loſs of 22000 Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
which he had brought in the field againſt him.
Not long after, Sultan Amurath died at Adrianople,
and left his ſon Mahomet to ſucceed him; who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
all his Predeceſſors in greatneſs of courage, and
ſubtilty of ſpirit. This daring Prince in the third year
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52894:14"/>
his reign beſeegeth Conſtantinople, and taketh it
within the ſpace of fifty days, on the 29. of May 1453.
As this loſs diſcouraged the Chriſtians, ſo it raiſed
Mahomets thoughts to a hie pitch, and furniſhed
him with hopes to add Hungary to his conqueſts of
Greece. To effect which, he laid Myſia waſte, and
laid ſiege with two hundred thouſand men to Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,
which in ancient times was called Alba Graeca.
But the place being notably defended by Hunniades,
who for that purpoſe had caſt himſelf into it, the
proud Turk loſt almoſt his whole army, with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
great pieces of Canon. Hunniades did not long
ſurvive this gallant action, but died the 8. of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
1456. Mahomet carrying his hie deſigns to Perſia
and Italy, gave liberty to Hungary to breath a while,
hoping the ambition of the Nobles, and the non-age
of the King, would raiſe inteſtine troubles in time of
Peace, which would give him ſome fair opportunity
to ſubdue the Kingdom, ſparing it for ſome ſmal
time.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>But it was no ſmal good fortune to King La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaus,
that the Tyrant did not moleſt him in his
younger years after the death of Hunniades. But
tell me, what did he when he came to age?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>The Hiſtory tells us, that when Ladiſlaus was
19. years old, he married Magdelene of France, the
daughter of King Charles the ſeventh, and that he
dyed of poiſon at Prague in the time of the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his marriage, ſo that he had but little time to
make either his vertues, or his vices appear; yet
there paſſed ſome conſiderable contingencies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the death of Hunniades, and that of his Maſter
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52894:14"/>
the King. Hunniades having left two ſons, who were
perfect imitators of the vertue of their noble father,
gave ſome occaſion of jealouſie to Ladiſlaus, and of
an earneſt deſire to his favorites, to be rid of them
both. Theſe being envyous of Hunniades his glory,
wrought the matter ſo with the King, that he cauſed
Ladiſlaus the eldeſt ſons head to be ſtruck off, for
killing the Count of Cilie in a combat, to which the
Count had appealed him. About the ſame time they
clapped Matthias, the ſecond ſon of Huniades in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
and not being able to ſuffer the children of that
famous worthy, who had ſaved the State, they had
aſſuredly made his proceſs, if the death of the King,
and the Almighty Providence, which had ordained
him to wear the Hungarian Crown, had not put a
ſtop to their malice. The Kings death, which fell
out in the year 1457. occaſioned a wonderful altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Matthias Corvin, the ſon of John Hunniades, is
brought out of priſon, where he expected a ſentence
of death, and placed in the throne: And all theſe
who envyed both his fathers glory, and his own,
could not hinder a man but of an indifferent quality,
to be preferred to the whole family of Auſtria, in the
year 1458.</p>

               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Hungary hath had but few Kings like to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias:
He was ignorant of nothing that belonged to
the knowledge of a great Prince, &amp; his reign was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
both in the time of peace and war. Many great
Hungarian Lords oppoſed his election: and after it,
they importuned the Emperor Frederick the third, to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52894:15"/>
ſet the Crown (which he had a keeping) on his own
head; which, ſome ſay, he did. Once certain it is, he
did not reſtore it till ſix years after he got in exchange
of it, three ſcore thouſand dukats at Newſtadt, a town
in Auſtria. A little before its reſtoration, ſome of the
factious offered the Kingdom to Caſimir, the ſon of
another Caſimir King of Polen, who ſent his ſon to
receive it, with a powerful army: but Matthias made
haſte to the frontiers, from which he forced the Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
to return. Theſe inteſtine broils gave both the
courage and the opportunity to the Turk to make
himſelf Maſter of Boſnia, Raſcia, and a part of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via.
But King Matthias after his Coronation, valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
regained all was loſt, and reduced Tranſilvania and
Valachia to their duty. This happy progreſs promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Matthias to undertake an irreconciliable war
with the Grand Seigneur: and without all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he had given him work enough, if his heroical
deſign had not been obſtructed by the Emperor and
the Pope. And this doth evidently appear by the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which he wrote on that ſubject to the Electors of
the Empire, and to the Cardinal of Arragon. To the
firſt he remonſtrats, that when he was on the river of
Savus, going to fight with the Infidels, he received
certain intelligence that in a Dyet at Vienne they had
reſolved to invade him. To the ſecond he wrote, that
the Pope favored the Venetians, who had taken from
him the Ile of Valga, without any occaſion given by
him: and not ſatisfied with that, his Holineſs endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
to take from him the power to confer Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Benefices within his own Kingdom, of purpoſe
to diſgrace him with his own ſubjects.</p>

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>But I think there is little appearance that theſe
two Princes, whom it moſt concerns to chaſe the
Turk out of Europe, ſhould endeavor to keep the
ſwords of thoſe in their ſheaths, who would gladly
draw them againſt that common enemy.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhould alſo be of your opinion, if Peter de
Reva had not told us, that he copied theſe things out
of the original, and adds that which ſeems more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.
In his fifth Century of his Monarchy of
Hungary, he tells us that the Emperor ſeaſed on all
the moneys which the Spiritual and Temporal Lords
of Hungary had contributed for the war which Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias
intended againſt the Turk: and that the Pope
helped to drain the Kingdom of moneys by ordering
Collections to be made for the Knights of the Rhodes.
Yet all theſe blocks that were laid in his way, did not
hinder Matthias by his Generals Paul Caniſi, and Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Battori, to defeat and chaſe Ali Beg out of the
field, with the loſs of threeſcore thouſand Turks: and
thereafter in perſon to regain Jaitſa, and reduce Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
to his obedience. Yet theſe traverſes at home ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
him to make a truce with Mahomet: And
the Tyrant dying in the year 1481. Matthias with all
his force reſolves to renew the war; and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
deſired a Safe-conduct from the Emperor for
his Embaſſadors to come and treat of an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
but could not obtain it. He intreated alſo the
Pope to give him Zemini, the ſon of Mahomet, that
he might make uſe of him againſt his brother Bajazet,
who a little before had taken upon him the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Turkiſh Empire. But this was refuſed
him by his Holineſs, which ſpited Matthias the more,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52894:16"/>
that it was done, not to looſe a piece of money which
was yearly payed to the Pope by Bajazet, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
or, as it was called, the maintenance of his
brother Zemini. Beſides, this Pope by his Spiritual
Authority obliged Matthias to confirm the Truce
with Bajazet, which he had made with his father Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet.
Shortly after, this brave King, looking upon
all the indignities he had received from the Emperor,
as inſupportable for any generous ſoul, declared open
war againſt him: which proved ſo fortunate on his
ſide, as having brought the greateſt part of Auſtria
under his obedience, at length he over-maſters
Vienne and Newſtadt, the two great bulwarks of
that Arch-Dukedom: From thence he marched to
the Kingdom of Bohemia, and made himſelf Maſter
of Sileſia and Moravia. But Caſimir King of Polen,
would have a ſhare of the booty, and therefore ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Sileſia with a mighty army; but by the mediation
of the Princes of the Empire, theſe two Kings agreed,
that both Matthias and Vladiſlaus, the ſon of Caſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir,
ſhould bear the tittle of Kings of Bohemia: but
Vladiſlaus ſhould alone enjoy the Electoral dignity,
and the Kingdom: Matthias keeping in his poſſeſſion
the Provinces of Sileſia, Moravia and Luſatia, redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
after his death for four hundred thouſand
Crowns. While Matthias was buſied in theſe wars,
the Turk breaks the Truce, and ſeaſeth on Killen and
Neſter-Alba, which (at that time) were accounted
ſtrong holds on the river Danube. At length this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
King, having reigned five years at Vienne, and
while there was a Treaty on foot for the reſtoration
of it to the Emperor, he dieth on the tueſday before
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52894:16"/>
Eaſter, in the moneth of March 1490. His corps was
carried to Alba Royal, and interred with his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
the Kings of Hungary.</p>

againſt the common enemy: and I am ſory
that theſe who ſhould have exhorted him to it ſhould
have diverted him from ſo glorious an undertaking.

            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>Matthias Corvin having no lawful iſſue, wiſhed
that his natural ſon John Hunniades, might have been
elected to be his ſucceſſor. But after his death, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of diviſion poſſeſſed the Hungarians. Four Princes
pretended to this divided Kingdom; and the Nobility
being divided in four Cabales, favored him with their
votes whom they conceived moſt worthy of ſo great
an honor. John the ſon of the late King, had the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages
of theſe who reverenced the vertues of his
Grand father, and father, which eminently appeared
in him, and of ſuch alſo who would more gladly obey
a born Hungarian, then a ſtranger. The ſecond party
ſtood for Albert Jagellon, the ſecond ſon of Caſimir
King of Polen, whom his father furniſhed with forces
to fight againſt Vladiſlaus his elder brother, who
made the third party; Caſimir thinking his ſon Vladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaus
might well enough be ſatisfied with the Crown
of Bohemia. The fourth Cabale inclined to elect
Maximilian, ſon of the Emperor Frederick; but he
was excluded, becauſe Vladiſlaus his party prevailed.
During this interraign, the Emperor recovered all that
Matthias had taken from him in Auſtria: and at length
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52894:17"/>
Vladiſlaus, maugre all the Competitors, mounts the
throne. The beginning of his reign was troubleſom;
for his brother Albert, aſſiſted with his Uncles the
brothers of Caſimir King of Polen, beſeegeth Caſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,
the capital City of the higher Hungary, and ſo
gave him work on that ſide. Blaiſe Magger a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of John Corvin, being offended that his Maſter
was rejected, refuſed to deliver the Crown which
was in his keeping, to the new King: upon which, he
was beſeeged at Viſſegrad, which he held bravely
out, and would neither deliver Town nor Crown, till
he had command ſo to do from his Maſter. Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
having recovered his loſſes in Auſtria, advanced
towards Hungary: and being aſſiſted by theſe who
had favored his election in the interreign, made a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
progreſs. Vladiſlaus fainting under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of ſo many troubles, came to an agreement with
Maximilian: the tenor whereof was ſo hateful to the
Hungarians, that the Palatine Emeric Prini, cauſed
proclaim through all the ſtreets of Presburg, that he
neither did, nor ever would conſent to it. But this
generoſity of his laſted not long; for being gained by
preſents, he ſigned the articles of Peace by which the
Crown and Kingdom of Hungary is entailed to the
Houſe of Auſtria, if Vladiſlaus died without iſſue.
You may ſee here a diſeaſe cured by the application
of a remedy odious to the whole Nation. This tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
not yet well allaid, uſhered in another, conjured
up by Albert, another Polonian pretender, whoſe
heart could not brook it, to ſee his brother King of
Hungary: he takes armes, and beſeegeth Caſſovia the
ſecond time. But while he endeavors to take it, he is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52894:17"/>
taken himſelf, and forced to give ſurety to ſuffer Vla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaus
to live in quyet. Shortly after Vladiſlaus mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and within three or four years had a ſon and a
daughter, Anne and Lewis; both of them famous in
the Hungarian Hiſtory. Anne was married to Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
of Auſtria, Grand-child to the Emperor Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian,
who by her had a numerous iſſue, whoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
reigns yet in Germany and Hungary. The acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of the birth, life and death of Lewis were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinare.
He was born without a skin, which made
his ſubjects fear he ſhould be ſpoiled of his Kingdom.
He wore a beard when he was but fifteen years old,
and was gray haird of eighteen; which made moſt
men conclud his life to be ſhort. He died in a mariſh,
at Mohats, when he was but twenty years of age; at
which time, the greateſt part of his Kingdom fell in
the hands of the Mahometans: Which makes us ſee,
that theſe preter-natural accidents proved truly omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
as we ſhal find hereafter. Vladiſlaus making
no more account of what had paſſed between him
&amp; Maximilian of Auſtria, cauſed crown his ſon Lewis
at Alba Royal by the hands of Thomas Cardinal of
Strigonium, in the year 1508. And the year after, he
got him to be crowned King of Bohemia at Prague,
when he was but three years old. The Emperor
Maximilian was hugely disſatisfied with theſe things;
but Vladiſlaus entertaining peace with the Turk on
the one ſide, and ſupported by Polen on the other,
he was forced to diſſemble his reſſentment.</p>

               <p>Towards the end of his life, and after the death
of Bajazeth, a civil war began in Hungary, which was
like to ruine it entirely, upon this occaſion. The King
had a great deſire to invade Selim Emperor of Turky,
who was kept buſie at home diſputing the Crown
with his brother Achmet: which deſign he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
to Pope Julius the firſt. The Pope approves of
it and promiſeth his aſſiſtance; but preve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by death,
left the management of it to his Succeſſors. Mean
while Vladiſlaus bethinks himſelf better, and renews
with Selim the Peace he had made with his father Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet.
This Peace exceedingly diſpleaſed thoſe who
loved war: and a little after, Cardinal Thomas Legat
for the Holy See, came to Hungary with a Croiſade,
to joyn the Nobility and Commons in a vigorus pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of a war againſt the Infidels. The common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who had been ever till then uſed with much rigor,
thinking the time to recover their liberty was now
come, turned their armes againſt the Nobles. Their
numbers made them inſolent: and they elect one
George Sekell, firſt for their General, and then for
their King. He and his rable having co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted a world
of miſchiefs, laid ſiege to Themiſware, where his
army is defeated, and himſelf and brother Lucatius
taken priſoners by John Zapoliha, Vayvod of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvany.
This action put Zapoliha in ſo high credit
with the better ſort, that Vladiſlaus was contemned,
and nothing more ſpoken of then degrading the
King, and mounting the Vayvod in the throne. But
Vladiſlaus prevented the diſgrace by his death, which
fell out in the year 1516.</p>

               <p>By what you tell me, I am perſwaded the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52894:18"/>
Hungarians are hugely loyal and affectionate unto
their King, when they are gallant; and that they are
eaſily moved to change him for another, when he is
not ſo.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>A warlike people deſires ever to ſee their King
a horſe-back when the preſervation of his Eſtate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
him ſo to be. And though experience ofteu
teach us, that the preſervations of the perſons of
Kings preſerves Kingdoms, yet a people is ever deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to ſee their King on the head of their army. But
for all that, the Hungarians have reaſon to be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
opinion: and their Hiſtory will let them ſee,
what a misfortune it is to looſe a King with looſing a
battel. Lewis in his tender years ſucceeding his father
Vladiſlaus, was vilipended by Sultan Soliman, who
knowing his weakneſs, and the diviſions that then
were amongſt Chriſtian Princes, thought this time
convenient to bring Hungary under his ſubjection.
To this effect he makes peace with the Perſian, and
ruſheth upon Lewis with all his forces. This young
King knowing how unable he was alone to grapple
with ſo mighty an enemy, prayed other Chriſtian Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentats
to ſend him ſuccours, and not to permit the
Bulwark of Chriſtendom to fall into the hands of the
common enemy of believers. His prayers prevailed
not, for Chriſtendom then was tearing it ſelf in pieces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſo Lewis was forced to take the field, yea even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
theſe troopes were brought together, of which
his army was to be compoſed. The Turk had already
paſſed the Save and the Drave; and meeting with the
Hungarians, both few in number, and evil provided
of a General, did without any difficulty obtain the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52894:19"/>
victory; and that ſo compleatly, that the King and
the moſt part of theſe that followed him, were loſt,
one way or other, either in battel, or the flight.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard ſay, that two and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Chriſtians died at this fatal field: and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
horſes of ſervice, five thouſand wagons, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
pieces of great canon, and ſix hundred leſſer
ones, with all furniture and amunition neceſſare for

               <p>The loſs of the battel was but a ſmal matter,
in compariſon of that which followed. The Turk
killed and took more then two hundred thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
And did ſo far advance in Hungary, and fixed
himſelf ſo firmly in it, that till this hour he could never
be removed out of it. And no doubt, he hath now
more hopes then ever to aboliſh our Religion in that
unhappy Kingdom: ſo we have reaſon to write the
29. of Auguſt of the year 1526. amongſt the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
days that ever afflicted Chriſtendom, or Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
This King died without children; and his want
of iſſue did much augment the right which the Houſe
of Auſtria pretended to have to the Crown of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.
Yet that illuſtrious family did not find the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians
much inclined to ſubmit themſelves to their
domination. John Zapoliha, Earl of Sebuſia, and
Vayvod of Tranſilvany, who came too late with his
forces to defend the Crown, thought he was come
ſoon enough to ſet it on his own head. He had of a
long time imployed both his means and his pains to
gain the affections of the whole Kingdom. And by
the defeat he had given not long before to George
Sekell, and the peaſants who had made him King, he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52894:19"/>
had opened to himſelf a way to the Royalty. Seeing
himſelf now in a condition to have the greateſt hopes,
he prays, he exhorts the whole Nobility, and every
one of them in particular, not to looſe the right and
priviledge they had to elect a King, and to make their
generous reſolutions in order thereto known at the
next Dyet. He remonſtrats to them that Hungary
had never been happy in ſubjecting it ſelf to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of a ſtrange King. That Sigiſmund of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia
and Vladiſlaus of Pole, the firſt by his defeat at
Nicopolis, the laſt by his overthrow at Colembat and
at Varna, had given ſufficient evidence how misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatly
ſtrangers govern that Kingdom. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
to make them believe, that though a ſtrange
Prince might reign gloriouſly in Hungary, yet it
would be both more profitable and honorable for
them to have a King of their own Nation. That the
beſt governed Common-wealths excluded the femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine
ſexe from the Scepter, for fear it ſhould come in
the hands of ſtrangers. That the Hungarian Nobility
was not ſo degenerated, but there was heads amongſt
them worthy to carry a Crown. And though himſelf
was none of the braveſt, yet he thought not himſelf
incapable to govern a great State, and defend it with
the point of his ſword.</p>

               <p>The great merits and exhortations of Zapoliha
prevailed ſo far with the greateſt part of the Nobility,
that they inveſted him with the Royal dignity, and
cauſed crown him by Paul Deverda, Archbiſhop of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52894:20"/>
Strigonium, on Martinmas day 1526. But to help the
courſe of this miſerable Countrey to its ruine, Stephen
Battori, and ſome other Great Ones, who looked
upon the advancement of Zapoliha with an envyous
eye, ſided with Ferdinand of Auſtria, and ſupported
his intereſts. This Prince fortified with the acceſſion
of his new Kingdom of Boheme, with the victorious
forces of the Emperor Charles the fifth, his brother,
with the marriage of Anne, ſiſter of the late King,
with the pretenſions which Ladiſlaus, ſon of Albert
the firſt, left to the Auſtrian family, and the help of
ſome Hungarian Lords, thought that the Kingdom
could not eſcape him. In effect, Ferdinand aſſiſted
by his right, and his friends, declared himſelf King,
and takes the field with an army: and knowing the
readieſt way to kill a creature is to ſtrike it at the
heart, he marcheth ſtraight to Buda, the capital City
of the Kingdom. King John aſtoniſhed at this blow,
abandons the Town, Ferdinand makes himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of it: and ſhortly after beats his Competitors ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and chaſes him entirely out of the Kingdom. The
courſe of this good fortune was ſtopped by the Turk,
who regains Jaitſa, the chief town of Boſnia, which
Matthias Corvin had taken with extraordinary valor.
This loſs, and the ſafe retreat of Zapoliha, made King
Ferdinand believe, he had not yet done his buſineſs;
but that Soliman and John would cut out more work
for him, then he had reaſon to deſire.</p>

He went to Pole, &amp; adreſſed himſelf to Jerome Laſco,
Vaydod of Siradie, an illuſtrious perſon, both by
birth and vertue. Laſco over-joyed with the preſence
of ſuch a gueſt, offered him all that was in his power:
and having maturely conſidered and reconſidered all
means for his reeſtabliſhment, at length adviſeth him
to have his recourſe to Sultan Soliman. And becauſe
theſe who give counſel ſhould ever be ready to put it
in execution, he undertakes the journey himſelf: and
having obtained a recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datory letter from Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund
King of Pole, he goes ſtraight to Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
This great Man, who had been before Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
at the Port, made it ſoon known how fit a perſon
he was to agent a buſineſs of that importance. He
gained on his ſide by preſents of great value, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
the firſt Vizier, Luſtibey, and Lewis Gritti, who
were in hie favor with the Grand Seigneur. Theſe
being well inſtructed by the dexterous prudence of
Laſco, eaſily perſwaded the Sultan that it would be
both honorable and profitable for him, to take the
exiled King in his protection, and reſtore him to his
Kingdom. Mean while, Ferdinand fearing the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

Embaſſador to the Port, to deſire the friendſhip of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman,
and to demand (a little unſeaſonably) the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of all he had taken in Hungary ſince the death
of Lewis the ſecond. This highly offended the proud
Sultan, who anſwered, That the Ottomans were not
accuſtomed to grant their friendſhip to thoſe who
had offended them. That Ferdinand was in the wrong
to deſire it, after he had invaded an Eſtate to which
he had no juſt pretenſion. That he thought him
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52894:21"/>
unworthy of that he deſired, That he would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged

               <p>Soliman did not all he would; but deſiring to
be a man of his word, he took the field with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
army, and in the Spring advanced to Hungary.
King John went to wait on him at Bellgrade, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with Laſco, and as ſplendide a company of
the Nobility, as was poſſible for him to bring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And in that great Aſſembly he did homage to
the Infidel, and acknowledged him for his Lord. The
Sultan a little moving himſelf in his ſeat, gave him his
hand, and aſſured him that nothing could be ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to him, then to ſupport and reſtore the afflicted
and oppreſſed. He bid him be of good courage, and
told him, He would reſtore to him all he ſhould reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
from his enemy Ferdinand. Theſe promiſes were
confirmed by a moſt ſolemn and pompous oath, after
the faſhion of theſe unbelievers, who in all their
actions will appear beyond that which they are. All
things being ſet in order, Soliman marched to Buda,
which he might eaſily take, in regard it was abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the German guariſon. And then he forced
Thomas Nadaſdy to give over the Caſtle whereof he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52894:21"/>
was Governor. This victory gave opportunity to the
Turk to reeſtabliſh John in the Royal dignity, which
accordingly he did. Then treading over the bellies
of all that durſt offer to reſiſt him, he laid ſiege to
Vienne. He battered it with all imaginable fury and
artifice: but if it was well attaqued, it was as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by Philip the Victorious, Prince Palatine of
the Rhine, and Nicolas Count of Solms, who forced
him to retire with ſhame; and to confeſs, that who

Let it ſuffiſe that I tell you, that being arrived
at Buda, he cauſed bring before him all the Royall
Ornaments, and in preſence of many great perſons,
as well Chriſtians as Mahometans, he ſaid thus to
King John:<hi> Brother, and Friend, Since next to God,
thou had thy recourſe to me in thy calamity, I was pleaſed
to be favourable to thee, and I have handled the matter ſo,
that thou art Master of thy Kingdom: Now I deliver in

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52894:22"/>
whereof I declare thee King.</hi> And turning to the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian
Lords, he proceeded thus: <hi>I command you to

ſpoke ſo, he left Lewis Gritti (ſon to Andrew, ſince
Duke of Venice, by a Graecian concubine) in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary

               <p>I wonder that Soliman having ſuffered ſo

               <p>Soliman did as theſe who break young horſes,
he uſed this gentleneſs to tame the Hungarians: and
he gave that to John, which he was afraid he could
not well keep to himſelf. But then King John fearing
with much reaſon, that the Grand Seigneur would
weary of his ſuccours, and perceiving his affaires to
be in a bad condition, he ſent to Vienne that ſame
Laſco whom he had imployed at the Port. This
active man procured a years truce; in which time, the
edge of their animoſity being ſomewhat blunted,
they came to an agreement; By which John was to
enjoy the Kingdom to his death; after which, Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
or one of his ſons ſhould ſucceed him. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was not impoſſible but John might have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
it was provided, that if he had a ſon, that ſon
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52894:22"/>
ſhould enjoy all theſe Lands and Caſtles which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to John before he was King of Hungary: And
beſides all that, he ſhould be Prince of Tranſilvany.
This treatie was ill obſerved. Ferdinand cauſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
Tranſilvany, by Baltaſar Bamfy: Sclavony, by
John Coatenerus, &amp; the Province of Sebuſe, by Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard
Baron of Velts. But all theſe attempts were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
vain by the prudence of King John, and the
valor of George Martenuſias a Monk, and the Kings
great favorite, commonly called, Frier George. And
ſo they came to another accommodation. The
calm which John enjoyed after he conjured away
the tempeſt, gave him leaſure to think of his marriage:
And for that effect ſends to Sigiſmund King of Pole,
and demanded his daughter Iſabel or Eliſabeth for his
wife. And having obtained her, the nuptials &amp; coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Queen were magnificently ſolemnized.</p>

               <p>I believe King Ferdinand was not well pleaſed
with a marriage from which might proceed an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his troubles, and an oppoſition to his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
neither do I think Soliman could approve of
the tranſaction which John made with Ferdinand,
without his knowledge, or at leaſt without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
in regard a vaſſal can innovate nothing of that
he holds in fee, without the approbation of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.</p>

               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>In this exigent, John was like to him that holds
the wolf by the ears He ſaw well enough that he had
reaſon to fear as much miſchief from Soliman, as from
his Competitor, yet he conceived ſtronger hopes of a
Chriſtian Prince, then of an Infidel: notwithſtanding
whereof, we ſhal preſently ſee that his ſucceſſors
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52894:23"/>
ſubmitted to the Turk, to preſerve a part of their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Not long after King Johns marriage, Stephen
Meylats and ſome others, take arms againſt him in
favor of Ferdinand. John deſirous to quench the fire
before it grew inextinguiſhable, leaves his Queen at
Buda, and marcheth to Tranſilvany, where he eaſily
received theſe in his favor who acknowledged their
fault: which act of grace moved many to return to
their duty. But Meylats ſhuts himſelf up in the ſtrong
Caſtle of of Fogaras, to wait for the ſuccours which
Ferdinand was to ſend him under the conduct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſdy.
The King beſeegeth the Caſtle, and after a
long ſiege, takes it. Mean time comes a Courrier,
who brings him the glad tydings of the birth of a ſon
whom God had given him. Such News uſeth to be
very acceptable to theſe who have no children, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to ſuch who are ſtricken in years: You may
eaſily imagine that John received them with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of joy, which he witneſſed by drinking (after the
Hungarian manner) more then enough. This aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
his ſickneſs, which at Saſſebs ſent him to his
grave a few days after his ſons birth, and in the fifty
and third year of his own age. His death was kept
quyet, as much as poſſibly might be done; but at
length it was publiſhed with the tenor of his teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
by which he declared his ſon the univerſel heir
of all his goods, and George Martenuſias, or Frier
George, Tutor of the pupil Prince. Some days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he died, he exhorted the Nobility to have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the honor of the Hungarian Nation, and to
prefer his ſon to any ſtranger whatſoever, if they
ſhould fall upon the election of a new King; aſſuring
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52894:23"/>
them that the grand Seignior would protect him, if
they had their recourſe to him. The deſire of a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
King, and the jealouſie the Hungarians had of a
ſtrangers domination, moved many of the great ones
to ſet the Crown upon the head of the Infant, the
very day of his Baptiſm, and to ſend to the Port to
beg Solimans protection.</p>

               <p>King Ferdinand having heard of his Competitors
death, ſent Nicolas Count of Salms to the Queen
Douager, to diſpoſe her to the obſervation of the
Treaty which had been made between him and
her husband, and willingly to grant that to reaſon,
which ſhe would be conſtrained to yeeld to force;
That ſhe and her ſon would find it a greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to them to acquieſce to what the late King had
concluded with mature deliberation, then to draw
upon Hungary the miſchiefs and evils of an obſtinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſought for war. That himſelf was ready to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
all he had promiſed, and to uſe her with favor
more then ordinary. The Queens anſwer to the
Earl was, that her ſexe, her age, and her grief, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
her incapable to fall upon any reſolution in a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of ſo great importance, till ſhe had the advice of
the King her Father; and therefore intreated Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand
to allow her ſome few months for that effect.
That the Emperor Charles his Brother and Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
would reap but little honor, to make war on a
woman drowned in tears, and a Child ſwadled in his
Craddle. This anſwer did not at all pleaſe Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,
who immediatly ſent Leonard, Baron of Velts
with an army to bring her to reaſon. The Queen in this
extremity ſends Embaſſadors to the Port, who were
well received by Soliman, and graciouſly diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
They returned with an embroidered ſcarlet robe,
a Mace of Iron, the Pommel of which was of Gold;
a Shable, the ſheath whereof was ſet with precious
ſtones, as tokens of his Amity and Protection. And
at the ſame time, ordered all the Governors of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52894:24"/>
neighbor places, to draw to the field without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
to ſuccour the Queen. While theſe things are a
doing, Laſco who had changed his Maſter and
taken himſelf to Ferdinands ſervice, and was then his
Embaſſador at Conſtantinople, demanded of the
Sultan the Kingdom of Hungary, upon the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
which were granted before to John Zapoliha:
which propoſition did diſpleaſe the Turk ſo much,
that he clapped the Embaſſador in priſon, and ſaid,
he deſerved to die, for offering to mock him. Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
having abſolutely refuſed Ferdinands demands,
and ſending ſtrong ſupplys to Queen Iſabel, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary
became the Theatre of moſt horrible confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and was dyed with the promiſcuous blood of
Germans, Turks and Hungarians. Rogendorff a
new General of Ferdinands, beſeegeth Buda, This
ſiege put Soliman on his way to raiſe it: But he might
have ſaved himſelf the labor, for his forces had done
the work before his arrival. Rogendorff having loſt
twenty thouſand men, ſaved himſelf by flight. The
Turk notwithſtanding keeps on his Journey, and
being come near the City, ſends Preſents to the
young King. But afterward, deſiring to have ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for the great charge and trouble, he and his
forces had been at, he deſired the Queen to ſend
her ſon to him, aſſuring her, he demanded it for no
other reaſon, then to oblige his children to love
the young King more tenderly. At the ſame time
his meſſengers had order to tell her, the cauſe why
the Grand Seigneur did not give her ſelf a viſit, was,
that he would not do any thing that might bring a
blemiſh upon her reputation. The Queen returned
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52894:25"/>
her humble thanks to the Sultan for his civility; but
wavered in her reſolution, whether ſhe would ſend
her ſon to him, or not. George Martinuſias told her,
that ſhe neither might or could refuſe it. Overcome by
invincible neceſſity, ſhe puts him in a craddle, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
ſuch a child, and having commanded his Nurſe,
and ſome other Matrones, and a great many Lords to
accompany him, ſhe ſends him to the Turkiſh
camp. Soliman to do him honor, cauſed meet him
with a gallant troop of horſe, he looked upon him,
embraced him, courted and dandled him, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his children do ſo alſo. And in the mean time
cauſed ſeize one of the ports of the Town, by which
his troops entered, and ſecured all the ſtreets of the
city. Then were the Citizens commanded to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
up all their arms, if they deſired to ſave their lives,
which was inſtantly done without any noiſe, This
being paſt, Soliman ſent back the young King to his
mother, but keeped the Lords who had convoyed
him. The Queen ſeeing her Town and Officers of
State in the Turks power, laments, weeps and prays;
but her lamentations, tears and prayers availed not,
nor did hinder the Infidel to put it to the debate in
his Divan, whether he ſhould keep the Kingdom of
Hungary for himſelf, or reſtore it to the young King?</p>

               <p>It was not ſo here, for all the opinions (which
were ſeveral) were well debated and conſidered;
neither did Soliman fall upon the election of the moſt

opinion, that the Sultan ſhould carry the King to
Conſtantinople, and with him the principal Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians:
That he ſhould place a Governor in Buda, who
uſing the people which loved liberty, with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and ſweetneſs, might bring them piece and piece,
and by degrees, to receive the Ottoman yoak; and in
the mean time, permit them to enjoy their goods.
Ruſtan, Solimans ſon in law, gave a more honorable
advice, perſwading him to keep his promiſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

could not but bring with it the irrecoverable loſs of

to come ſo often and ſo far to relieve a woman

Germans without the forces of his Highneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
his troubles ſhould be endleſs. He deſired
him to remember, that within theſe twenty years,
he had marched into Hungary five ſeveral times, to
his infinite charges and hazard of his perſon. The
firſt time, to reduce Belgrade to his obedience, which
before was a den of thieves. The ſecond, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
an affront done to his Embaſſadors, to which
he ſacrificed King Lewis, and that then he had given
with a prodigious prodigality, the Kingdom to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who was conſiderable for nothing, but for the
miſchief he had done to the Ottoman armies. The
third to ſuccour the ſaid King againſt Ferdinand of
Auſtria, and at the ſaid time he had ſhaken and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
Germany by the ſiege of Vienne; and by his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52894:26"/>
roads and cavalcades, which brought threeſcore
thouſand Chriſtians to chains and fetters. The
fourth, in regard his Highneſs retreat had encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the ſame Ferdinand to attack King John, with
hopes to wreſt his Kingdom from him, he was forced
to return and relieve him. And the fifth time, for
theſe affairs concerning which the preſent queſtion
was. This Baſha who had been preſent at all theſe
expeditions, did exaggerate the evils that his maſter
had endured, the great and vaſt waſte of treaſure, the
great and many perſons he had loſt, and the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
he had laid upon himſelf, to neglect all his
other affairs for this alone. And concluded, that
war being only made to procure the means to live in
peace, the Sultan ſhould reduce into a Province, a
Kingdom which he had ſo often taken and defended.
He ſhould ſend the Queen to her father Sigiſmond
King of Pole. He ſhould carry the child to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople
to be bred in the Mahometan Law. He
ſhould put the whole Nobility to the ſword, and raze
all their forts and ſtrong holds; tranſport a number of
families to Aſia, and keep the reſt in ſubjection with
ſufficient guarriſons.</p>

               <p>Jahaoglis adviſed nothing, but what Soliman
might have done, and what many of his predeceſſors
would have done, in the like occaſion. But he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for all that to uſe greater moderation. He left a
ſtrong guarriſon in Buda, intreating the Queen to be
ſatisfied with what he did, and to retire her ſelf with
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52894:26"/>
her ſon to Lippa, and reign over Tranſilvany, in the
neighborhood of her father the King of Poles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.
And gave her aſſurance of the affection
he would ever keep for her ſon: He ordered ſome
troops of his own guards to convoy her, and cauſed
furniſh her with waggons, chariots and beaſts for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
to tranſport all the moveables ſhe had. The
Queen perceiving the neceſſity of her departure, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored
to ſeem willing to go from a place, where
it was not in her power to ſtay longer. Some noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Countrey followed her joyfully, as if they
had been delivered out of priſon. The Tranſilvani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ſwore fealty to their young Prince, with the
Turks conſent. And remembring, that his father
John had governed them mildly, and with much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
the ſpace of thirty years; they promiſed
to the ſon a perfect obedience, without conſtraint.
The affairs of Hungary being in this condition, King
Ferdinand would gladly have appeaſed the Turk,
whom he much apprehended; and for that purpoſe,
he directed Preſents to him worthy of him who ſent
them, and of him who was to receive them. There
was beſides other things, a great cup of pure gold,
enriched with precious ſtones, and an horologe of
ſilver, of an admirable workmanſhip. It was a globe,
which before had honored the Cabinet of Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Ferdinands grand-father. It ſhew, beſides the
hours, the courſe of the Planetes, with the diſtance of
the Sun and Moon, imitating the fabrick of the
world, as far as art could reach. And the motion of
all did not terminate, till a whole year went about.</p>

               <p>Did theſe Preſents produce any good effects?

               <p>Soliman was extreamly well pleaſed with the
globe, and looked upon it with much delight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as one
who had ſome skill in Aſtronomy, but it did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him to repay any civility. Ferdinands Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
demanded the Kingdom of Hungary, upon
theſe conditions, which were granted formerly to
John Zapoliha. Which being very honorable for
Soliman, and advantageous to his Eſtates, there
were ſtrong appearances he ſhould have granted
them: But the contrare appeared by the anſwer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to them, out of Ruſtan Baſha's own mouth,
which was this; That his Highneſs would grant peace
to their Maſter, upon theſe termes, that he ſhould
deliver up all theſe places which appertained to
Lewis the ſecond: That henceforward, he ſhould
not come near the Frontiers of Hungary. That the
Houſe of Auſtria ſhould be obliged, to pay Soliman
ſuch a tribute, as he ſhould be pleaſed to impoſe, to
preſerve the honor of the Ottoman Majeſty, which
notwithſtanding ſhould be but a ſmall one, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of the great pains and travel the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur
had taken, and the immenſe charges he had been
at in the war. And if theſe conditions ſeemed heavy
to Ferdinand, then Soliman would make uſe of his
power to force him to that accommodation. After
this final anſwer, the Turk returned to Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,
having firſt waſted and ſpoiled ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.
This proud and imperious procedure of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman,
was looked upon at Vienne, as a Declaration
of the war. And therefore, Ferdinand appoints
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52894:27"/>
three Generals, to oppoſe ſo formidable an enemy,
and made application to George Martinuſias, who
refuſed not to ſerve him. This Monk whom King
John had choſen to be Tutor to his ſon, prime Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of Eſtate, and Director of all his revenues, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to tyrannize over his Maſter, and the Queen
his Mother, had conſtantly more ſtrings to his bow,
then one. And whatever he promiſed either to the
Queen, to the Turk, or the King of the Romans, it
was only to ſerve himſelf with the one of them againſt
the other, and in the mean time, by his dexterity, to
keep the abſolute power of the Government to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Such was the ambition of this petty gentleman,
who from a contemptible and underling domeſtick
of John Zapoliha's Mother, came to be a Monk, from
an ignorant Monk, to be King Johns ſervant, and
then Biſhop of Varadine, and firſt Miniſter of Eſtate,
and could now ſuffer no equal. He poſſeſſed the
Queen with fears, that he would do her ſelf a bad
office, and dethrone her ſon. The juſt apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this danger, moved Queen Iſabel to repreſent
to Soliman, that the proud Monk had demanded
aſſiſtance of King Ferdinand, to bring about the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
he had to eſtabliſh himſelf in the Throne, by the
ſuppreſſion, and perhaps the death of her ſon. Marte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſias
on the other hand, repreſents to Ferdinand;
that having had infinite obligations to the late King
John, he could in gratitude do no leſs, then employ
all his power to procure the ſtanding, welfare, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and utility of the ſon of ſo deſerving a father. But
that the quality of a Prelate did oblige him much
more to have an eye to the preſervation of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52894:28"/>
That he had to do with a fearful woman, who
upon the leaſt ſuſpicion, would not miſs to implore
the Turks ſuccours. And if the Government were
not taken out of her hands, then undoubtedly Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvany
would fall in the Turks hands. To obviate
which, he intreated Ferdinand to offer the Queen a
recompence to yeeld up her Eſtates: and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it would be prudently done, to offer to her
ſon, all theſe advantages which were offered to his
father. Ferdinand, who knew Martenuſias well
enough, made no doubt, but that he intended to
cheat him; for all that, he reſolves to make his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the Monks craftineſs. And therefore, making
fair weather with him, he praiſed his Chriſtian zeal,
and conjured him to perſevere in ſo laudable an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſends him ſome Canon, and a thouſand Horſe
payed for four moneths, Things tending thus to a
change, every one of the parties endeavored to make
his advantage of the preſent conjuncture of affairs:
Ferdinand acquaints his brother the Emperor with
all that paſſed, and of the hopes he had to be a gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
if he would be pleaſed to aſſiſt him with his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
and his forces. Charles reliſheth the propoſition,
and ſends to his brother, John Baptiſta Caſtaldo, a
Spaniard, a prudent and valiant gentleman, whom
he might intruſt with the conduct of the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
Queen Iſabel of Iagello, who knew and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the practiſes of Martenuſias, called a convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Eſtates of the Countrey, to gain the
good will of the Nobility; thinking by this mean to
preſerve to her ſelf and her ſon, that rank and dignity
which belonged to them. The Monk fearing the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52894:28"/>
Eſtates ſhould fall upon ſome reſolutions, which
might diminiſh his greatneſs, makes all poſſible haſte
to Agnabet, where the Dyet was aſſembled, breaks
it up, forceth the Queen to retire to Alba Julia, and
commenceth the war againſt his Maſter. While this
is a doing, Caſtaldo arrives at Claudiopolis, which
the Hungarians call Caleſvar, and the Germans,
Clauſemburg: from whence, in order to his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
he intreats Martenuſias to perform what he
had promiſed to King Ferdinand. This Prelate
then knowing the Queens fears, went and payed her
a viſit, ſhew her her eſcapes, and exhorted her to an
accommodation with Ferdinand, to which ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents.
To this effect, the Tranſilvanian Eſtates are
convocated at Claudiopolis, where Don Caſtaldo
lets them ſee the Commiſſion he had to treat with
the Queen. He endeavored to make it appear to
her, that it was purely impoſſible for her and her ſon
to defend Tranſilvany againſt the Turk. That for
the good of Chriſtendom, it would be expedient,
perhaps neceſſare for them both, to make a reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it to the King of the Romans. And in lieu
thereof, he promiſeth to John Sigiſmund, the two
Dutchies of Opeln and Ratibore, the revenue
whereof extended to five and twenty thouſand du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats
a year, and Joanne the daughter of Ferdinand,
with an hundred thouſand crowns of portion, and to
the Queen fifty thouſand crowns, with the payment
of all her debts. This was Caſtaldo's proffer.</p>

               <p>When I conſider Tranſilvany, I think this

thought conſiderable enough, in regard by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52894:29"/>
the Queen and her ſon did fairly rid
themſelves of an inevitable neceſſity to make war,
either with the great Turk, or the Houſe of Auſtria:
and the ſexe of Iſabel, and the non-age of John Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund
rendered them both incapable for that. But
did the Queen accept the proffers?</p>

               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>This couragious and prudent Princeſs being
exceedingly deſirous to free her ſelf from the yoke of
Martenuſias, acquieſced to what Ferdinand had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and inſtantly delivered up all the Royal Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Caſtaldo, and intreated that Spaniſh Lord to
move the King of the Romans to perform without
delay that which was promiſed on his part, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
retired her ſelf to Caſſovia, which was given
her for a retreat, till the entiere execution of the
Treaty. Caſtaldo having now the Hungarian Crown
in his hands, believed they ſhould all acknowledge
his Maſter for King, and therefore deſired the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvanians
to take the oath of fidelity to King Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,
who unanimouſly did it, after George Martenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,
who by the bargain had got the Arch-Biſhoprick
of Strigonium, and a Cardinals hat, procured by the
King of the Romans. The matter having paſſed ſo,
each party prepared for war, the Hungarian well
knowing the Turk would not ſo eaſily ſuffer a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
which had acknowledged his Soveraignty, to
fall in the hands of another without his conſent. The
event made it appear they had made a right conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture:
for he enters Tranſilvany with an army, but
made a ſory progreſs, ſo long as Martenuſias lived, or
that the Queen had any hopes that Ferdinand would
obſerve the agreement ſhe had made with him. As
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52894:29"/>
to Frier George, it was obſerved he deſired to ſerve
the Chriſtians, without giving too much occaſion of
offence to the Turk; for at the ſurrender of Lippa to
Caſtaldo, he ſaved Ulmani Bey, whom they reſolved
to cut in pieces; and protected within his Caſtle of
Vivaria, him who received the tribute which Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vany
payed to Soliman. Theſe actions coſt him his
life; for Caſtaldo having entred in a deep diſtruſt of
him got Mark-Antony Ferrero his Secretary (who
becauſe of his charge had frequent acceſs to him) to
ſtob him with a dagger. Sultan Soliman being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the death of Martenuſias, and of the oath the
Tranſilvanians had made to the King of the Romans,
commanded Stephen Prince of Moldavia, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of Buda, and ſome other neighboring vaſſals
of his, to take arms, and fall upon them. This order
was no ſooner iſſued out of the Port, but it was put in
execution. And Tranſilvany in a ſhort time had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to ſay, that the death of one Tyrant had not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it from ſlavery. Mean time Queen Iſabel ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhe could not obtain the performance of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
were made to her, prayed the Grand Seigneur
once more to have pitty of her ſon. Soliman either
moved with compaſſion of the widow Queen, or tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with his own intereſts, aſſiſts her powerfully,
and reduceth the Tranſilvanians to that neceſſity, that
they implored Ferdinand to permit them to treat with
Soliman in favor of John Sigiſmund. Ferdinand,
though much againſt his will, gave his conſent. And
they obtained for their Prince, that ſame favor that
was granted to John Zapoliha his father, for theſe
ſubmiſſions, duties and tribute that it ſhould pleaſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52894:30"/>
Soliman to impoſe on him. This fell out in the year
1551. The Queen having entred in repoſſeſſion of her
Eſtates, her brother Sigiſmund Auguſt mediated ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
treaty between Ferdinand and her. By it ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
more advantagious conditions then by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
one. Her ſon ſhould eſpouſe Joanne the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Ferdinand, and enjoy for ever in Soveraignty
for himſelf and his heirs, Tranſilvany, the County of
Abavivar, Muran, Huzth, Marmet, and a part of the
revenue of the territories of Ceregh, and of Ugocha.</p>

that a King of the Romans, brother to one of

and father of ſo many children, ſhould put on a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution

               <p>I know that Potentats do not give away wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
that which they have gained. It is notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
true, that Ferdinand gave up that Soveraignty
whereof we ſpeak, and that he permitted John Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund
to do what he pleaſed in Tranſilvany, except
the aſſuming the tittle of King. Yea, the buſineſs was
carried on a greater length, for this Tranſilvanian ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the Turks forces, demanded that the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube
ſhould divide Hungary and Tranſilvany, and
that the Kingdom of Hungary ſhould be entailled to
him and his ſucceſſors, in caſe the maſculine line of
the Auſtrain family ſhould chance to be extinct. This
inſolent demand vexed Ferdinand: he takes armes,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52894:30"/>
and conſtrained the Tranſilvanian Prince to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
that the river Tebiſcus ſhould be the utmoſt
bound of his Eſtates. This agreement diſpleaſed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sigiſmund, or the Great Turk, who prompted
him to act, becauſe he might not enter publickly on
the ſtage himſelf, in regard of a truce he had made
with Ferdinand for eight years. Hereupon John Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund
denounceth war againſt Maximilian the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
who ſucceeded his father Ferdinand, and took
Zackwar, Hudad and Corazzo, and had taken Caſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via
alſo, if the rigor of the Winter ſeaſon had not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
him. But theſe victories were ſhort lived, Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian
grievouſly offended with theſe inſolencies,
takes armes, and attacks him vigorouſly, regains what
he had loſt, and forces his enemy to a Peace Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
being returned from Malta, where fortune had
not favored him, begins a new war in Hungary, where
he dies at the ſiege of Zigeth, which was ſurrendered
to Baſha Muſtafa, his Lieutenant General, the 7 of
September 1566. Selimus who ſucceeded to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
made a truce with the Hungarians for eight
years, and in it comprehended the Tranſilvanian,
who by the recommendation of his Uncle Sigiſmund
Auguſt King of Pole, got an addition to his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of ſome Territories which the Emperor yeelded
to him, and the town of Guila, which he bought from
the Turk, in the year 1568. John Sigiſmund percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the dy of war run favorably for him, offered to
corrupt ſome Hungarians, to carry on his deſigns
with more advantage in that Kingdom. But his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors
and practiſes dyed with himſelf in the year
1570. and in the thirty and third year of his age: And
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52894:31"/>
in him, and with him, ended the race of Zapoliha.
He had choſen Gaſpar Bekez for his ſucceſſor, but he
was rejected by the Grandees, who put in his place
Stephen Battori, on the 14. of May 1571. This Prince
acknowledged the Grand Seigneur for his Soveraign,
as his Predeceſſor had done. And being elected
King of Pole, after the retreat of Henry of Valois,
he made it appear that vertue and fortune are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible
in one and the ſame ſubject. This brave
Gentle-man was within a very few years, a Baron, a
Prince, and a King, and eminently worthy of the
higheſt of theſe degrees. Being choſen King of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
he delivered up Tranſilvany to his brother Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher
Battori; who not finding the Houſe of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria
favorable to him, becauſe his brother Stephen
in the election of Pole, was preferred to Maximilian
the ſecond, was forced to ſeek ſupport at Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.
This was a moſt vertuous Prince, who having
ſuppreſſed the boldneſs of Bekez, who endeavored
to ſupplant him, reigned gloriouſly till his death which
put him in his grave 1581. To him ſucceeded his ſon
Sigiſmund, being yet a child. Stephen Battori his
Uncle, King of Pole, having appointed him three Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
ſowed jealouſie amongſt them, which gave him
ſhortly occaſion to thruſt them all three out, and to
put the perſon and affairs of his Nephew in the hands
of John Geczi, Governor of Varadin. This was a
gallant and an orderly Gentle man, who quickly made
himſelf known to be a man of courage, as well as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
Scarce had he laid his hands on the reins of the
Government of his pupils Eſtate, when King Stephen
dyes in the year 1586. The powerful factions which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52894:31"/>
bandied one againſt another in Pole for the election of
a new King, gave Geczi an opportunity to ſhow what
worth was in him. He joyned his forces with theſe
of Samoisky, who favoured Sigiſmund of Sweden
againſt Maximilian of Auſtria, his Competitor, who
was beaten, taken, and forced to quite his pretenſions
to the Swed. In the mean time, the Turk made a
fierce war in Hungary againſt the Emperor Rodolp
the ſecond. And though the Officers and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of his Imperial Majeſties forces were men of
ſufficient worth, and gallantery, who ſold to the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
all the victories he obtained at a very dear rate,
yet in the year 1595. Sinan Baſha Lieutenant General
to Selimus, reduced to his obedience the admirable
fort of Javarin, at that time deemed impregnable.</p>

               <p>The Emperor had too much courage to ſeek
Peace after ſo conſiderable a loſs: He knew he could
obtain none, but that which would have been excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
diſadvantageous: and for that reaſon he reſolved
to continue the war, and ſo ſought the help of all thoſe
who were able to give it; and got Sigiſmund Battori
Prince of Tranſilvany, to be of his party. This Prince
was eaſily moved to be pertaker of ſo noble a deſign,
becauſe he was a perſon of a great ſpirit and courage;
as alſo, becauſe he thought it a ſhameful thing for a
Chriſtian to joyn with theſe who aimed at nothing ſo
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52894:32"/>
much as the entire ſubverſion of Chriſtianity. He
concluded therefore a Treaty with the Emperor,
whereof theſe were the principal Articles.</p>
               <p>That Sigiſmund taking arms againſt the Turk, it
ſhould not be permitted to the Emperor to make
Peace without him. And if the matter ſhould come
to an accommodation, the Principalities of Valachia,
Moldavia, and Tranſilvania, ſhould be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Treaty. That Sigiſmund ſhould enjoy the
name, the honors and prerogatives of a Prince of the
Empire. That an honorable rank amongſt them
ſhould be aſſigned to him. That the Emperor ſhould
give him a Princeſs of the Houſe of Auſtria, for his
Conſort. That as long as the war laſted, the Emperor
ſhould furniſh him every year one hundred thouſand
florins of the Rhine, which will amount to thirty and
three thouſand pounds ſterlin. And ſhould entertain
to him a good Body of Germane horſe and foot.
That all theſe places that Sigiſmond ſhould take in
the war ſhould remain in propriety to him, and theſe
that ſhould be of his iſſue, of both ſexes. That if the
miſchance ſhould fall out, that the Turk ſhould by
force of arms expell him his Dominions of Tranſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the Emperor ſhould be obliged to aſſign him as
many Lands within the Empire, as ſhould be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to entertain him like a Prince. That there ſhould
a general act of oblivion paſs for him, and all thoſe
who had ſerved under the Turks Banner, againſt his
Imperial Majeſty. That the Prince ſhould enter in
poſſeſſion of all theſe Lands which he enjoyed before
in Illyria and Hungary. That the Emperor ſhould

of war. That the Tranſilvanian ſhould take the field
with fourſcore thouſand fighting men, Valachians,
Moldavians, and Tranſilvanians.</p>
               <p>This agreement was ſealed with the marriage of
Prince Sigiſmund, with Mary Chriſtine daughter of
Charles Arch-Duke of Grats, with the Order of the
Golden Fleece, which Philip the ſecond of Spain ſent
to him. By Pope Clement the eight's preſent of a
Hallowed Hat and ſword, and by a great maſs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
which was ſent to him from ſeveral places of
Chriſtendom. This League did much ſatisfie many
great Potentats; but did ſo diſpleaſe and exaſperate
Sultan Amurath, the Princes of Sigiſmunds own fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the greateſt part of the Tranſilvanians, that
preſently followed terrible invaſions, troubles, and
murthers. Upon which, the Prince called theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to him, who he knew to be affectionate to his
perſon and intereſts; and having all his thoughts taken
up with the meditation of horrible revenges againſt
his kinſmen, and the Great Men of Tranſilvany, he
ſummoned his Eſtates to meet at Claudiopolis. There
it was that he put to death Balthaſar Battori his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and many other Lords, and declared them guilty
of rebellion, and leze Majeſty: and amongſt the firſt,
Stephen and Andro Battori, his couſin germans, the
ſons of Balthaſar. At the ſame time, Sigiſmund thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
he had extinguiſhed the fire of the Rebellion,
cauſed publiſh thorow all his Territories, the League
which he had made with the Emperor againſt the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman
family; and exhorted and commanded all his
ſubjects to take arms, to deliver themſelves from the
tyranny and ſlavery; under which they had ſo long
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52894:33"/>
groaned. A few days after, he brought fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
men in arms; and having provided them with
ſufficient and able Officers, he advanced with them
towards the Danube, to act the firſt part of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.
Now he is in the fields, Fortune ſides with him;
he takes ſeven ſhips loaden with ſilver, and other rich
merchandiſes, which Sinan Baſha was to employ to
corrupt the Officers of Vienne, to betray it to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
the Grand Seigneur. This good luck put Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund
in a capacity to beſeege Themiſwar. But he
had ſcarce begun to attack it, when he receives intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
that the Tartars were waſting and making
havock of his Territories and ſubjects, which called
to him for their defence. Having raiſed his ſiege, he
marcheth againſt them, but finding them lodged in
an inacceſſible place, where valor could not avail him,
he hath recours to policy: he fires theirs quarters, and
having ſmoaked them out, gives them a total over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
without any difficulty, and with no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
loſs on his ſide.</p>

and gallant, and if it were not, that the death of

               <p>I come ſoftly to that ye deſire to know: The
Valachians and Moldavians admiring the Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanians
victories, would gladly ſhare with them: and
therefore, make a conjunction of their forces. Sultan
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52894:33"/>
Amurath ſeeing that his loſſes occaſioned this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt,
endeavored to ſet his affairs in better order, and
to that effect, commands the Baſha of Themiſwar to
attack the rebells, and make them feel the rigor of
fire and ſword. The Baſha takes the field, but is
defeated by Prince Sigiſmund towards the latter end
of the year 1594. This victory of the Prince was
ſeconded by another, which he obtained by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of twenty thouſand Tartars, who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
home loaden with ſpoil and booty. About
that time died Amurath the ſecond, leaving Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
the third to ſucceed him; who coming to the
Crown about thirty years of age, gave great largeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to his Janizaries, and made huge preparations
for the war againſt the Chriſtians. And underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that the Coſſacks and Podolians had entered in
League with the Tranſilvanians; he ſent an Army
of one hundred thouſand Turks, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Sinan, whom he commanded to chaſtiſe
theſe rebels exemplarly. Sinan prepares himſelf to
give a full obedience to the commands of his imperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Maſter; and while he ſtudies to gain friends in
Moldavia, he gathers a formidable Army for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of his deſign. But all his preparations came
to nought by the induſtrious vigilance of Sigiſmund,
who brought up Sinans rear ſo cloſe, that as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
the Danube, the bridge overcharged with
numbers of flying Turks, broke, and Sinan falling
himſelf in the river, was in danger to have born com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with an infinite number of his Army who were
there drowned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This great action joyned to many
more, in all which the prudence, valor, conduct and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52894:34"/>
good fortune of Prince Sigiſmund appeared to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
acquired him the name of Invincible: And
forced Sultan Mahomet to take upon himſelf the
conduct of his Army. You might ſee him then
in the field in perſon with two hundred thouſand
fighting men, and theſe dreadful forces gave him the
confidence to advance as far as Agria. There it was
that the Arch-Duke Maximilian and Prince Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,
by the cuſtom they had gotten to overcome,
contemning the Turks great numbers, gave him bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel;
which had in all appearance bettered the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Chriſtendom, if the infamous deſire of ſpoil
and booty had not made victory, which hovered
over the Chriſtian Army, take wings and fly to the
Infidels. We loſt twenty thouſand men, and the
Turk a great many more: but after that time, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that fortune, which had gone hand in hand with
Prince Sigiſmund, turned her back upon him; for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
his former valor and magnanimity, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to make an exchange of his Tranſilvanian
Principality, with ſome Territories in Sileſia. And
to come the better to his purpoſe, he brought as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his forces together as poſſibly he could, to make
his laſt attempt. He layes ſiege to Themiſwar, and
was forced to raiſe it, as he had done before: Not
long after, Ibrahim Baſha beſeegeth Varadin. Baſta
the Emperors Lieutenant General intreats Sigiſmund
for the relief of it, to joyn his forces with theſe over
which he commanded, which he promiſed to do, but
proved not a man of his word. After that there
was nothing to be ſeen in him, but irreſolution and
unconſtancy. He cauſed proclaim his Couſine Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal

Battori, Prince of Tranſilvany: but not being
able to maintain him in it, he reſigned to the Emperor
Rodolph all his Eſtates, who gave him the Dutchies
of Ratibore and Opeln for his life time, with a yearly
penſion of fifty thouſand Crowns, and a Cardinals
Hat, which the Emperor promiſed to procure to him
from the Pope.</p>

               <p>I told you before, that Sigiſmund Battori,
Prince of Tranſilvany was married to Mary Chriſtine
of Auſtria, but being as great a coward in the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
of Venus, as he was brave in thoſe of Mars,
he declared himſelf to be impotent, and ſo his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was declared null. But I have not yet told you,
that after infinite miſeries, which his change procured
to Tranſilvania, Valachia and Moldavia, reſigned by
him to Rodolph: and after that he had repented
himſelf of that folly, and given ſufficient teſtimonies
of his unconſtancy, he died at Prague the 17. of
March 1603.</p>
               <p>His death did not at all confirm the poſſeſſion of his
Eſtates to the Emperor, for the Turk never wanted
theſe who practiſed for him in the Countrey; and
the people believing, that their liberty was infringed
by the agreement made between the Emperor Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolp,
and their late Prince, there was not any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with his preſent condition: George Baſta, the
Emperors Lieutenant General tyrannized over the
Countrey. The Turks, the Tartars the Polonians
had made Tranſilvany the theatre of a long and
bloody tragedy; ſo that the people longed and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52894:35"/>
breathed for nothing ſo much, as for their former
condition. In end, Stephen Boskay, having chaced
away the Decemvirate which the Emperor had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
with the Government, eſtabliſhed himſelf into
it more by the good will of the people, and by theſe
faults and diſorders which the Emperors Generals
committed, then by his own proper forces. The
commonalities complained grievouſly of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of the inſolence of ſtrangers, and of the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their ancient priviledges and immunities.
Boskay fomented the diſcontents, and by aggravating
the faults of the Government, he took a powerful
and deep footing in the poſſeſſion of the Principality.
For this cauſe Gabriel Bethlem (to whom the Turk
had given hopes of the province) ſeing it was not
time for him to have ſuch thoughts, ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to Boskay. But in the mean time, joyning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with Bechtes, Baſha of Themiſwar, endeavored
to ſurpriſe Lippa, but was near ſurpriſed himſelf, and
forced to fly in his ſhirt; fear made him forget his
breeches behind him, and in them the treaty of his
conſpiracy. This paper coming to the hands of
Count Belljoyoſo, put a flea in his ear, and ſeeking
for a remedy for this diſeaſe, he found it to be incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
In fine, Boskay loſt no time; he beats Beljoyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
and reduceth him to a great extreamity; and puts
himſelf in poſſeſſiou of many places: And having
the favor of the Nobility, the Towns and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
he found himſelf in a condition to ſpeak like
a Maſter. But fortune, who delights to make her
ſelf to be admired, turned ſuddenly on Baſta's ſide,
who having obtained ſome victories, exhorted Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kay
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52894:35"/>
to lay down Arms, and ſubmit himſelf to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
yoak. But he who pretended to no leſs then
the whole Principality, made anſwer. That if they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him not to enjoy Tranſilvany; if they did not
place Hungarians to be Governors of the Provinces
and Towns, if they did not ſend their militia of
ſtrangers ſume where elſe, if they did not permit the
free exerciſe of his Religion: He was reſolved to
prefer war to peace. Fortune who is frequently a
friend to raſhneſs, takes Boskays part, and made him
ſurmount all the difficulties he rencountered with in
this war. Baſta, who moſt oppoſed him, ſaw his
victories followed with an intire diſobedience: his
ſojors mutines, and tells him, he payed them with
nothing but words. They ſet upon him in his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and theſe who were appointed to be a guard to
nine and twenty waggons loaden with money, cloath
and other things robbed them, and went away;
ſome to Pole, and others to the Enemy: Tranſilvany
being delivered of the fear of Baſtas Army, many
of the hundred towns of it were taken by Boskays
friends, the reſt rendered themſelves to him before
they were ſummoned. This progreſs of Boskay for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Emperor to ſend Demetrius Nabradi Biſhop
of Veſprin, and Sigiſmund Forgas to treat with him.
Theſe Deputies found that proſperity had made him
inſolent; all the anſwer they got from him was, That
if they had come from the Nobility of Hungary, they
ſhould have been very welcome; but if they came
from the Emperor, they might return, for he was ſo
far advanced, that he could not retire. This lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
was ſo well underſtood by the Emperors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52894:36"/>
that they knew they had no more to do there,
and that Tranſilvany had changed its Maſter. And
in effect, the Eſtates of the Province being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at Kerene, Boskay was confirmed in the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
he made of the Principality: upon condition,
that he granted a tolleration of the exerciſe of the
Roman, Lutheran and Swiſſe Religions. Then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, Sigiſmund Ragoski was made Governor of
the Countrey, and Valentin Homanay General of the
troops. The Grand Seigneur who had keeped a
watchful eye upon all theſe commotions, ſent a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux
to Boskay, who preſented him with a Mace, a
Shable, and a Cloath of State, to confirm him in the
poſſeſſion of his new Principality. In acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of which favor, Boskay ſent to the Port Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen
Corlat, and George Kikedi, to aſſure the Turk
of his fidelity, and to preſent him with the marks of
his homage and obedience.</p>

ſaith, <hi>That men can hardly become perfectly &amp; entirely
wicked.</hi> But Boskay gave him the ly; for having endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
to take, and taken theſe places which gave
lawful obedience to the Emperor, his wickedneſs and
fellony went a greater length: for though he, and his
party, did mask their Rebellion with the pretext of
Religion, yet they made it no ſcruple of conſcience
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52894:36"/>
to accompany the Turk in his courſes and roads that
he made in Moravia, where having put a world of
poor Chriſtians to the ſword, he ſent four thouſand
to the chain. Never was ſeen any zeal like that of
theſe religious troops. They ſold to the Turks num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of their Chriſtian brethren. And as their crime
had no precedent, ſo that which followed on it, was
an unheard-of prodigy. Blood was ſeen to run out of
the gold that they received for the Chriſtians, which
they had ſold to the Infidels. Theſe civilities &amp; marks
of friendſhip which Boskay payed to our common
Enemy, were followed by an agreement between
them. The Turk offered him the tittle of King of
Hungary: but Boskay fearing a change of Fortune,
refuſed the favor, alleadging the Emperor had been
lawfully crowned. But by the accord, Boskay was
made proprietare of Tranſilvany, and it made free
for ten years of the tribute it uſed to pay formerly: and
that time being expired, it was to ſend yearly ten
thouſand duckats, in token of vaſſallage. Things paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſo in Europe, the Baſha of Aleppo and Carama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
cut out ſome work for the Sultan in Aſia. For
this reaſon, deſiring to be free of the obligation lay
on him to aſſiſt Boskay, he gave him permiſſion to
agree with the Emperor. On the other ſide, his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Majeſty being weary of ſo long and chargeable
a war, and perceiving that Boskay had no children,
and therefore a change of the Government would
quickly enſue, he agreed eaſily to all was deſired of
him. The principal Articles of this Peace, were theſe:
An act of oblivion to be paſſed on all ſides. That the
Religions of Rome, Augsburgh and Switzerland,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52894:37"/>
ſhould be tollerated through all Hungary. The Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
of Hungary ſhould be elected by votes. That the
Government of all places ſhould be given to Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
except Comore and Javarin, which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
might beſtow upon Germans. That all Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vany,
and that part of Hungary which belonged to
Sigiſmund Battori, ſhould be given to Boskay, and
that thereto ſhould be added Zacmar, Ugoc and
Totkai, with Bereg. That endeavors ſhould be uſed
to make Peace with the Turk: and if it could not be
obtained, then Boskay ſhould joyn his forces with
the Emperor againſt him. This treaty was approved
and ſworn by the principal Lords of Hungary, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,
Auſtria, Sileſia, Moravia and Luſatia. Neither
did any make difficulty to ſign it, except Melchior
Cleſel, at that time Biſhop of Newſtadt, and ſince Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal;
becauſe, ſaid he, no ſuccours ought to be given
to an Heretick; yet at length he gave his conſent. This
Peace was followed with a Truce of twenty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Emperor and the Turk. By this Accord,
the Grand Seigneur was obliged to call the Emperor,
Father, and the Emperor to give to the Sultan, the
tittle of Son. They ſhould both be called Emperors.
The controverſies that might in the future ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them ſhould be determined by the Governors
of Javarin and of Buda. All forts and ſtrong holds
ſhould continue as they were for the preſent: neither
ſhould any new ones be built by either of the parties.
The Emperor ſhould give to the Turk two hundred
thouſand crowns at one time: And after that, they
ſhould ſend preſents one to the other every third
year, by their Embaſſadors, to continue the firmneſs
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52894:37"/>
of their friendſhip This Tranſaction was made in the
year 1606. and followed by the ſickneſs and death
of Boskay, who declared for his ſucceſſor Valantin
Homonay, but the Eſtates of Tranſilvany any preferred
to him Sigiſmund Ragosky. But he loving his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and quiet more then honor, refuſed the offer;
But ſeeing it would be forced upon him, he accepted
it with as much reluctancy, as he could have againſt
an honorable ſlavery.</p>

               <p>Though they ſay that Crowns are heavy, yet

               <p>There is no leſs glory in refuſing Crowns, then
in endeavoring to deſerve them; and I avouch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, that if I did not know that this refuſal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
meerly out of contempt of honor, I ſhould
ſay it proceeded from fear. The Emperor Rodolph
repented he had agreed to the tolleration of more
Religions then the Roman Catholick. The promiſes
of the Perſian Embaſſador, with the rebellion of
Gambolah, who had drawn on his ſide Aleppo, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus
and Tripoli, made his reſolutions waver in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the obſervance of the Treaties. This gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to the Hayducks to continue their inſolencies,
and to the Arch Duke Matthias, to take arms to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to obedience. Which being done, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias
reſolves to purſue his deſign, ſo long as he was
in a capacity to do it with an Army: which proved
the ſtrongeſt Argument he could uſe to perſwade his
brother Emperor Rodolph to reſign Hungary and
Auſtria to him. Having then the power, he had not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52894:38"/>
the ſcruple that Rodolph had, but inſtantly ſigned
the Treaty of Vienne, and added one article more
to it, which was the expulſion of the Jeſuites out of
Hungary, and received homage from Ragosky for
his Principality: Shortly after, Ragosky gave an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
demonſtration of his contempt of ſublunare
greatneſs, for being in peaceable poſſeſſion of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvany,
equally cheriſhed by Matthias and the Great
Turk; he reſigned his Principality to Gabriel Batto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,
when he had reigned but one year. Achmet Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
of Turky confirmed the Election, and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias
did not oppoſe it. Battori was neither ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
nor ſo modeſt, as Ragoski thought he ſhould
have been; his inſatiable luſt rendered him inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable:
and the honor of the moſt vertuous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
and Virgins, not being aſſured under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of a Prince ſo horribly debauched, they
conſpired againſt his life, and aſſaſſinated him in the
year 1616. Bethlem Gabor, who had contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
much to his death, ſeized on his Eſtates; and
to appeaſe Matthias, who was then Emperor, and
Sultan Achmet, who were equally offended with
him, he promiſed to the firſt a reaſonable obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and delivered ſome Places in the hands of the
ſecond.</p>

               <p>This Tranſilvanian, made it his ſtudy all his life
to fiſh in troubled waters; but his fortune being
much inferior to that of Ferdinand, at the long
run he was forced to ſubmit to him: mean time, let
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52894:38"/>
us ſee, how things went in theſe parts, during the
reign of Ferdinand. This Arch Duke was the moſt
zealous Catholick in the World, and one who could
leaſt ſuffer the diverſity of Religions, which his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors
had permitted in their Territories. His
zeal and good fortune, moved his Couſine Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias
to prefer him to all the other Princes of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
And intending the ſucceſſion of the Empire
for him, he cauſed him to be acknowledged King of
Hungary and Bohemia before he died. Ferdinand
begins his reign with the oppreſſion of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
he cauſed ſhut up ſome of their Churches, and
demoliſhed others in Bohemia; He recalled the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
to Hungary, and rejected all theſe articles which
favored any other Religion, then the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
in all the Treaties that had been made by the
former Emperors with the Hungarians and Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
This action, which bred much evil blood in
a Body formidable at that time, gave occaſion to the
Bohemians to reject Ferdinand, and to elect Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
Prince Palatine of the Rhine, to be their King.
And Ferdinand was forced to ſee in a ſhort time the
Bohemians and Hungarians before the wals of his
capital City of Vienne. At the ſame time, Gabor
cloaths himſelf (as all rebels do) with the pretext of
Religion, and for the maintenance thereof, enters
in a League with the Bohemians, and ſets an Army
a foot of eighteen thouſand men, and eighteen
pieces of canon, and with it enters Hungary; where
finding mens ſpirits prepared for rebellion, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
proved ſucceſsful, which furniſhed him with
the confidence to proclaim himſelf King. At this
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52894:39"/>
time, Ferdinand was at Franckfurt, where he was
elected Emperor. This high dignity adminiſtred to
him both authority and forces, neither did he think
of any thing elſe, then ſhortly to recover the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
which he had well near loſt, and to humble
thoſe, who durſt ſo inſolently attack him. He ſpoke
loud of the wrong, diſhonor and injuſtice was done
him: he remonſtrated to the Electors of the Empire,
to the Kings of Great Britain, and France, the juſt
right he had on his ſide to look for his own. He
drew to his party all the Roman Catholicks of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
and the Elector of Saxe alſo, who was one of
the great Pillars of the Proteſtants, and endeavored
withal to keep the ſwords of ſtrangers within their
ſheaths. Not long after, the Elector Palatine, whoſe
forces were very conſiderable, was put to flight;
Gabor made more reſiſtance, and had put the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
affairs in a bad enough condition, if his aſſociats
had done their duty better at Prague. Count Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piere
General of the Imperialiſts loſt his life, viewing
the Caſtle of Presburg, in which Gabor had put a
garriſon: And Charles of Longueval, Count of
Buckoy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having reduced Moravia to the Emperors
obedience, and made a great progreſs in Hungary,
died there, after he had received ſixteen wounds.
The death of this great perſon gave means to Gabor
to recover many places, to diſſipate thoſe who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
his deſigns, and to over-run all the Countrey.
But at length ſeeing his Confederates beaten, and
his own forces ſcattered, he deſired peace, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it in the year 1622, upon theſe conditions;
That he ſhould retain all Tranſilvany, Tokai, Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſovia,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52894:39"/>
and ſeven other Lordſhips of Hungary. That
he ſhould deliver up the Hungarian Crown, and all
the other Towns that he keeped in that Kingdom.
That he ſhould abſolutly quite the name of King, and
content himſelf with the tittle of Prince of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
with the Dutchies of Opeln and Ratibore,
and that he ſhould re-poſſeſs the Jeſuites of theſe
places they enjoyed before the war. This peace
laſted not long. Gabor gives Vaczia to the Turk,
who ſends him fourſcore thouſand men, which the
Count of Torne had obtained for him. With theſe
he once more invades Hungary, alledging the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Treaty of Odinburg were not keeped to
him: That his Religion was oppreſſed, and that the
money they owed him was not payed him. The
Emperor deſirous to be at an end of this buſineſs,
cauſed remonſtrate to the Grand Seigneur, that Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
did but abuſe his authority and his forces; and
that he was invaded by him without any reaſon. To
his words Ferdinand added the powerful arguments
of arms, and by them conſtraineth his enemy to an
accommodation leſs advantageous then the firſt. By
this Treaty in the year 1624, Gabor loſt the tittle of
Prince of the Empire, and ſome of theſe Territories
in Hungary, which had been granted him by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Treaty. Shortly after, this reſtleſs ſpirit joyned
his forces with theſe of Charles Erneſt Earl of Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.
But forty thouſand Tartars, who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, being defeated by the Polonians, he left
him to go and take care of his own Eſtates. And
having only for the ſpace of four years enjoyed the
company of Catharine, Daughter of John Sigiſmund
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52894:40"/>
Elector of Brandeburg, he died in the year 1628.
having ſuffered incredible torment in his feet; and
at his death he made it known that he honored the
Emperor and the Turk equally, for he left to
every one of them a horſe, whoſe Capariſon was
garniſhed with rich ſtones, and forty thouſand du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats
in ſpeces. He left to the Princeſs his wife one
hundred thouſand pieces of Gold, every piece of
the value of ten ſhillings ſterlin, one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
dollars in ſilver, and one hundred thouſand Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins,
and three Lordſhips, which ſhe was to enjoy
during her life.</p>

               <p>This Princeſs having above four ſcore thouſand
pound ſterlin in coyned money, and Jewels ſutable
to a perſonage of her quality, had enough to help a
younger brother of a noble family; and it is probable,
it was for that, that Francis Charles Duke of Saxon
Lauemburg married her ſome years after the death of
her firſt husband. But I would gladly know who
ſucceeded to Bethlem Gabor, and what fell out in
that Countrey after his death?</p>

               <p>When the heir of a Principality is not certainly
known, the death of the laſt Prince is ever followed
with trouble; Princeſs Catharine, the widow of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,
not having learned the Art to reign, nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Stephen Czac to be her husbands ſucceſſor, and
intreated the Turk to confirm him. But this Election
diſpleaſed all the Tranſilvanians, who divided in two
factions, the one favoring Stephen Bethlem, the
brother of their late Prince, and the other inclining
to George Ragoski. The firſt was ſo misfortunate,
that his own children roſe up againſt him: the ſecond
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52894:40"/>
having overcome all oppoſition, made an agreement
with the Emperor, and gained the favor of the
Turk, and ſo enjoyed Tranſilvany peaceably, yet his
good fortune was not conſtant. Stephen Bethlem
who had yeelded all his pretentions to him, chanced
to kill one of his kinſmen; and fearing the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he deſerved, endeavored to ſhun it by a greater
crime. He demanded aſſiſtance from the Port, from
whence he received an army of Turks and Tartars,
with which he beſeeged Giula. Ragoski deteſting
the infidelity of the faithleſs Turk, ſubmits himſelf to
the Houſe of Auſtria, who aſſiſted him with three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of foot and one of horſe: with theſe and his
own troops, he routed five and twenty thouſand
Turks near Szabuta. At length Bethlem returning to
his duty, was received in favor, and Ragoski con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in his Principality by the Sultan. While theſe
things are a doing, Ferdinand the ſecond dies, and
left his ſon Ferdinand the third his ſucceſſor to the
Kingdom of Hungary, and all his other Eſtates. This
Prince having a moſt dangerous war to mannage in
Germany, was exceeding deſirous to preſerve peace
in Hungary, yet it was broke by the advice of theſe
who counſelled him to diſcharge the Lutherans the
uſe of a Church they had at Presburg, and to revoke
all he had promiſed in their favors, This ſtroke of
State reliſhed not well with theſe Polititians, who
thinks good actions loſe their price, when they are
done unſeaſonably. There is nothing that more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperates
mens minds, then the violence that is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to their conſciences, and there are few things in
the world which need more circumſpection, then
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52894:41"/>
doth the work of reforming an Eſtate. The Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans
of Presburgh, who could never endure the loſs
of their Church, or recover it without the aſſiſtance of
ſtrangers, call to Ragoski for help. This Prince fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to embark without bisket, and to enter in a war,
in which he could not rationally expect much aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the Turk, who was kept buſie in Aſia,
prayed the Emperor, and his Concel, to perform
what was promiſed to the Hungarians. But he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
no ſatisfactory anſwer from the Emperor, who
ſeemed to contemn both his prayers and his power.
Therefore conceiving he was more obliged to his
Religion, then to his Bene-factor, he ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be perſwaded by the Embaſſadors of the
Confederates, who earneſtly ſollicited his alliance:
And having denounced war to the Emperor, he
entereth Hungary with ſeventy thouſand fighting
men. And that the world might ſee he began not
the war without reaſon, he declareth by his Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that ſince the year 1619<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they had put Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the number of the hereditary Provinces of the
Houſe of Auſtria. That they gave theſe Offices to
Church men, which belonged to ſecular perſons. That
the Proteſtants were thruſt out of all Charges; nor
could their complaints be heard. And that againſt
their wills, the Jeſuits were ſettled in the Countrey.
Ragoski his firſt action was to waſte and ſpoil the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
of George Homonay: after which, he brought
to his obedience all that reſiſted him, even to Caſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via.
It being taken, the Emperor deſirous to calm this
ſtorm ſends againſt him the Count of Bouchaim, with
an army of eight and twenty thouſand men; and with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52894:41"/>
it was the Palatine of Hungary alſo. But not being
able to regain Caſſovia, he hearkened gladly to a
Peace. By the agreement, ſeven Lordſhips of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary
were given to Ragoski: And to pleaſe him, fifty
Churches were opened to the Proteſtants, wherein
they might freely teach their doctrine, and the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians
reſtored to all their priviledges. This Treaty
ſeemed diſadvantageous to the Catholicks; but it was
more prejudicial to the Sweds: for the Emperor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
picked this thorn out of his foot, ſent ſecours to
Brin, and forced Torſtenſon to raiſe the ſiege he had
laid to it. At which time, Lewis Count of Souches,
a French Gentleman, and who had been the principal
cauſe of the preſervation of the place, received the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of it, for the recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe of ſo ſignal a ſervice.</p>

               <p>I can hardly believe that ſuch remarkable, and

much as in Hungary and Tranſilvany. And I admire,
that a people which cannot almoſt ſtir without dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing

               <p>Theſe Countreys breeds a very warlike people,
&amp; ſuch an one, as can hardly live in quyet: And their
Princes very oft throw them in the fire, when they
think to draw them out of the furnace, making their
condition worſe, when they endeavor to make it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
whereof Ragoski hath given a demonſtration,
when he eſpouſed the quarrel of the King of Sweden,
and thereby equally diſobliged the Emperor and the
Grand Seigneur. This Tranſilvanian being ambitious
to have a ſhare of the glory and conqueſts of King
Charles Guſtave, marched with very conſiderable
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52894:42"/>
forces to Pole, and joyned with him. And not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done any great feats, was forced to return, either
with much ſhame, or with very little reputaion. But
his misfortune did not ſtop with the loſs of his army,
it purſued him further, and armed the Great Turk
againſt him, and made him die in a battel, where
with his life, he loſt his Principality, which he ſhould
have left to his ſon. Some writes, that they were
Chriſtians who ſtirred up the Turks hatred againſt
him; and that that ſhould be one of the cauſes of the
preſent war, and one of the trueſt too. Remin Janos,
his Lieutenant General, endeavored to ſtep up to the
Throne, in the room of his dead Maſter: and for that
effect, ſubmitted himſelf to his Imperial Majeſty,
ſought, and obtained his protection. But he was not
able to preſerve theſe Eſtates, on which he had ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
Then it was that the Court of Vienne, endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to ſave Janos, and not to offend the Ottomans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
did neiter the one, nor the other. Janos loſt his life
in a conflict, and the Turk was very evil ſatisfied with
the Emperor, who (as he ſaid) had contraveened the
Truce which was between them. This miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
occaſioned a great alteration on both ſides,
and procured ſeveral Embaſſies and Negotiations
from one party to the other. The Sultan proteſted
conſtantly, that he breathed nothing but the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
the Peace; and his Miniſters complained mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly,
that we were deſirous of war, which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not to make, unleſs neceſſity conſtrained them
to it. While things ſtood thus, Nicolas Count of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,
thinking the war was already at our doors, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
it would be very advantageous for him to build
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52894:42"/>
a fort on both ſides of the river Mur; which he did, and
began ſome acts of hoſtility. This Fort augmented
the Turks complaints, who demanded the demolition
of it by a Chiaux, and an Aga; whom I ſaw at Vienne
in January 1662. Theſe demands obtained no favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
anſwer; and it ſeemed they were made to men
who had no ears. And to ſpeak truth, ſeeing them
put on a fierce reſolution to grant nothing to the
Turk; I imagined, they ſought nothing but war; and
that Serini's Fort was a place of that hie importance,
that it was able alone to give work to many Ottoman
armies; yet experience hath made us ſee, that it is
worth nothing, and that we needed not to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadged
in a war of ſuch conſequence. I will not give
my reaſons, becauſe any man may imagine them. It
ſhal be enough for me to ſay, that the Imperial Court
ſeeing the Turkiſh forces in Tranſilvany, and fearing
to be taken napping, they ſent the Earles of Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuculi
and Souches, with two little bodies of armies,
whereof a great part periſhed without any ſtroke of
ſword, and without hindering either the loſs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
Janos, or the eſtabliſhment of Abafi. The Grand
Seigneur then ſeeing Tranſilvany in his power, and
that Abafi was firmly enough ſet in his ſaddle, and
obliged to ſerve him, demanded the demolition of
Serini's Fort, with greater inſtance then before; as
alſo a reparation of the wrong which he alledged was
done unto him. But the Court could not reſolve to
grant his deſires: and therefore without further tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
he reſolves to do himſelf reaſon, and make
a tryal if his firſt arms would prove as fortunate, as he
hoped they ſhould. Then he began that war which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52894:43"/>
he proſecutes yet with great vigor. and in which all
Chriſtendom ſeems to concern it ſelf. I adjure you to
conſider well all I have hitherto ſaid, and then (I
doubt not) but you will be able to judge of the equity
of the cauſe of both parties. We muſt now ſee in
what manner the Turk attacked us in the year 1663.
what forces we oppoſed to his, and that which both
parties hath done ſince the beginning of the war, that
ſo you may ſee what grounds we have, either for our
hopes, or our fears.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I ſhould think, that his Imperial Majeſties inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
ſhould have obliged him rather to have demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
the Fort of Serini, and to have given the Sultan
that ſatisfaction he demanded, then to have entered
in a war againſt him, for both Hungary and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
ſtand much in need of Peace, and we ſee but little
probability to wreſt Tranſilvany out of the Turks
hands, which he hath ſeaſed upon with ſome appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Juſtice.</p>

               <p>If it were permitted us to meaſure Counſels by
their ſucceſſes, we ſhould have juſt reaſon to blame
the reſolution was taken at Vienne. But I ſuppoſe the
Court did believe, that theſe who ſate quyet with
croſt armes all the time that our inteſtine bloody
wars gave them a fair opportunity to attack the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
would not have the boldneſs to meaſure the
length of their ſcimiters with our ſwords, now that we
enjoy a wiſhed-for Peace. But we have ſeen the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare;
for Mahomet the fourth reſolved to begin the
war by that rupture which he made, after he had kept
us long in ſuſpence. For to ſpeak truth, I doubt not
but all his Embaſſies, and the great ſhow he made of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52894:43"/>
moderation, was done for nothing elſe but to amufe
us. Theſe who were ſagacious, and pierced deeper
then the outſide of affaires, thought it hie time to
make leavies. The ſtupideſt could ſay, we ought not
to truſt theſe who had no faith. The Emperor ſeeing
he would ſtand in need of help, ſought it: and the
manner it was given, and received, was the only cauſe
that he was not ready when the war was at his doors.
The Confederates offered conſiderable troops which
they had already on foot; but they would continue
Maſters of them. His Majeſty thought it an affront to
his Imperial dignity, to receive them upon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
The Empire making theſe ſame offers, and
theſe ſame demands, rencountred with theſe ſame
difficulties. Hence it came that the Grand Viſier ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
advanced to the higher Hungary, attaked New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heuſel,
which the Hungarians call Vivar, defeated
three thouſand men, who ſallied with intention to
ſurpriſe ſome of his army, ſent the priſoners to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,
as marks of his victory; and at length for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the guarriſon to render the Town upon articles,
and triumphed not a little for the acquiſition of this
ſtrong place, which gave him means to make his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to the ports of Vienne, and to waſte and harraſs
the frontiers of Germany.</p>

               <p>The Treaty of Munſter, which was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the 24. of October 1648. having given ſome
Territories to the French, ſome to the Swedes, and
others to ſome German Princes: All of theſe were
afraid, the Houſe of Auſtria, and the Princes thereof
might repent that they had bought peace, that they
might attempt the recovery of theſe limbs of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
which the Treaty had cut from it, and that ſome
others might redemand that which they had loſt. To
obviate which conſiderable inconvenience, Cardinal
Mazarin perſwaded thoſe who had any cauſe of
fear, or who loved the quiet and peace of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
to make a ſtrict union, whereby all of them
ſhould be obliged to defend one another mutually,
in caſe any of them ſhould chance to be moleſted in
the poſſeſſion of that which the Treaty had adjudged
to belong to him. Ten or twelve Princes, Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and Temporal, and of all theſe Religions that are
permitted within the Empire, entered in this League,
twenty thouſand men, or thereby, being to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by this League for their mutual defence, under
the command of the Counts of Solms and Hollach;
each of the Confederates were to contribute for their
intertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, according to their ſeveral proportions.
The Emperor extreamly diſpleaſed with this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy,
endeavored to diſſolve it; but not being
able to do that, he reſolved to make his profit by it,
For this effect, ſeeing himſelf threatned with a war
from the Turk, he remonſtrates the danger, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
that theſe forces already on foot, ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
for the defence of the Empire. The Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
conſents, provided their Army ſhould not be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52894:44"/>
obliged to take any oath but to them, and be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
only againſt the common enemy. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare,
the Emperor deſired, that theſe forces ſhould
abſolutely obey him, and that they ſhould be ſent to
him without any condition at all. The buſineſs was
ſo long debated, that theſe troops came very late to
Hungary; whence you may eaſily judge, that though
the greateſt part of this League be compoſed of
German Princes, yet it is accounted to be a thing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the body of Germany; either becauſe
ſome ſtrangers have ſigned it, and contributes to the
maintenance of its Army; or becauſe the two Kings
of France and Sweden who are members of it, are
more powerful then all the reſt of the Confederates
together. For the preſent, their Army is under the
command of Wolfgang Julius, Count of Hollach, and
make a body a part, ſeparated from the forces of the
Emperor, and theſe of the Empire.</p>

               <p>That I may ſatisfie you in order to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
you may be pleaſed to know, that the Sultan
having reſolved to cut out work for us, ſent into
Hungary his Great Viſier, who arrived at Belgrade
the eigth of June. The Baron of Goes Embaſſador
for his Imperial Majeſty came there the day after,
and upon the tenth of the moneth was brought to
the Viſiers preſence. This great Baſha had upon
his left hand two of his Brothers, on his right hand
the Mufti, and round about him, no fewer then two
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52894:45"/>
hundred Officers: At this firſt audience, the Baron
told him, after he had complemented him, that he
was come there to conclude the Treaty that had been
begun between him and Ali Baſha. He was told
that he was come too late, and that they would
think further of the matter when they came to our
Frontiers. The Baron replyed, that then they had
done him wrong in making him come ſo far, that he
ſaw no reaſon why they ſhould not come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
at that time; that greater difficulties would
ariſe after the war broke out; and that God would
puniſh thoſe, who occaſioned the ſhedding innocent
blood. The Grand Viſier ſubjoyned, that he had
thought very deliberatly on all theſe reaſons at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;
and if that had been offered there,
which was done here, he had not undertaken ſo long
a voyage; neither would he hear any thing of the
Treaty of Themiſwar, but made grievous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of thoſe who had violated the peace. The
Baron told him, All theſe things had been already
ſpoken of, and fully anſwered. This was all was done
at their firſt meeting, but the Viſier ſaid, that the
Baron might yet ſend a Courrier to the Emperor and
tell him, that if he would disburſe ſuch a ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
as ſhould be demanded of him, evacuate the
places, which yet he keeped in Tranſilvany, and Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelheid
in Hungary, and demoliſh the Fort of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,
there was yet hopes of an accommodation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I believe by this propoſition the Viſier inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
only to amuſe the Imperialiſts: for I cannot fancy
that the Turk having advanced ſo far in Hungary
with an army of ſeventy thouſand men, and an
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52894:45"/>
dred and thirty pieces of Canon, would return
without ſo much as one blow.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I think ſo too, for I do not fancy, that any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
how great ſoever he may be, either in merite
or credite, dare fall upon any reſolutions, but ſuch as
his Maſter hath preſcrived to him. The Army then
began its march the eleventh of June 1663. with ſo
great pompe, that one would have thought that it
conſiſted of two hundred thouſand fighting men.
The noiſe of Camels, Horſes and Mules, the ratling
of Drums and Timbals, the ſound of Trumpets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
almoſt night and day, till the eighteenth of the
ſame moneth. The Officers moved but ſlowly, for
though every day ſome went away, yet it proved to
be almoſt none but Baſhas, and their equipage,
which being ſplendid, made a ſhow brave to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
At length upon the fifteenth day, the Agae
of the Janiſaries marched with four thouſand of his
Body, and was followed by the reſt of his Army till
the eighteenth day: on which the Grand Viſier put
himſelf on his way with royal magnificence. He
ſent before him a thouſand foot-men, each of them
having one or twoled horſes. After them came the
Spahi Alagarſi, who is General of the Gentlemen
that ſerves a horſe-back; his great Standard went
before him, and he was followed by ſix hundred
Spahi Edeli, the valianteſt men in Turky, having
their banner exceedingly fine. Theſe were follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
by a long ſtave, at the end of which, there was
a button of braſs, from which did hang a horſe tail.
A little after you might ſee two great Banners which
were carried before the Viſiers two Brothers, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52894:46"/>
other Perſons and Commanders of quality, who
were accompanied with ſeven hundred Hoſvadars
or Grooms, almoſt all covered with Jacks or Coats of
maile to their knees. At length the Collors, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
and Banners of the Great Viſier marched, and
were cloſe followed with ſixteen led horſes, decored
with Saddles and Capariſons, embroidered with
gold and precious ſtones. The Grooms who led
them, had coats of cloath of gold, and breeches of
crimſon velvet. Eight Lackeys of the Viſier were
in the ſame habit; and amongſt them Himſelf mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
accompanied with two Janiſaries, carrying
on his Head a Turban of a great value. After the
Viſier came the Roſevendy, or Great Chancellor;
the Teſtadir, or Commiſſar General, with ſome
others of the Principal Officers of the Army. The
Gentlemen of his Chamber, all young men, between
twenty and thirty years of age, covered with Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks,
ſix hundred Hoſvadars, or Grooms, forty
Cimbals and Trumpets, two hundred ordinary
horſe-men, and threeſcore horſes, which carried the
Great Viſiers Tents and Pavilions. With this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
and magnificent Company, he arrived at
Bukovar the twenty fourth of the moneth; and there
he was told by that Aga, whom he had ſent to the
Cham of Tartary, that in ſtead of fourſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
men which he had promiſed, he would ſend
ten thouſand under the conduct of his own ſon.
The excuſe he made for not keeping his word was,
that the white Tartars and the Muſcovites had made
incurſions in his Territories, which obliged him to
keep his troops for the defence of his Frontiers.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52894:46"/>
Two dayes after he arrived at Eſek, where he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
ten dayes, waiting for theſe who were to
come and joyn with him. At length he paſſed over
the Bridge which is twelve thouſand paces long, and
came to Buda the fifteenth of July. There after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
conſultations, the Seege of Newheuſel was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
on, and on the ſeventh of Auguſt the place
was inveſted. Three thouſand men which Count
Forgas Palfi, and Marqueſs Pio commanded, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out to ſurpriſe the enemy, were taken in the net
themſelves, and either killed or taken priſoners. The
place was ſo cloſe beſeeged, that it was forced to
capitulate and render on compoſition the eighteenth
of Sepetember that ſame year.</p>

               <p>The defeat of ſo great a number that ſallied,

               <p>It is probable it might have held out ſome lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
time, but having no hopes of relief, it would have
been conſtrained at length to ſubmit to the yoke.
It endured three aſſaults, in all which the Turk was
vigorouſly beat off and repulſed. Yet Count For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas
was put in reſtraint, accuſed not to have done
his duty in the Siege. But I believe his misfortune
was greater then his fault; they talked here when
that place was taken, that the Officers were young
and unexperienced: And in the contrare, the Viſier
is a man of thirty and five years, very active and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in his expeditions, skilled in the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and of an heroical courage; and it is certain
he was night and day in the trenches, exhorting and
incouraging his ſojors both by precept and example.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52894:47"/>
The Town being taken, he cauſed fire ſeven pieces
of Canon in ſign of victory; and having ſent one of
his brothers to the Port to carry the news to the
Grand Seigneur, he cauſed repair the breaches, and
then retired to prepare for the next expedition.
This loſs wakened the Empire, which till then ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be aſleep; and the Dyet being appointed to
hold at Ratisbone, ſome Princes appeared in perſon,
and the reſt by their Embaſſadors. There might a
man behold the magnificence of our Germany: for
though the Emperor had intreated the Princes to
come without pomp, yet nothing was to be ſeen but
that which was glorious and ſplendid. Many old Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
came and preſented their ſwords to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
and theſe Princes who had been accuſtomed to
ſmell powder, offered themſelves to be diſpoſed of as
his Majeſty thought fit. The number and known
deſervings of theſe who pretended to be Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
took away the liberty of choyce from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
as the variety of flowrs doth with Ladies,
when they walk in a garden in the month of May.
But there was a neceſſity to chooſe ſome for the new
levies that were to be made. His Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
having already three Armies under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Earls of Serini, Montecuculi, and
Souches, thought it expedient by the addition of
ſome more Officers, to render them more able to
act. To this end, without making any change of the
inferior Officers; and leaving the ſupreme Command
of the three Armies to theſe three Earls, he adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Philip, Prince Palatine of the branch of Sultſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
and Count Spar, who are perſons of great me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52894:47"/>
and high reputation. The firſt was to command
his Majeſties Cavallery in the quality of Captain Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and the ſecond was to conduct his Infantery
and his Canon. Leopold William Marqueſs of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
was to be Captain General in Chief of the Army
of the Empire: Under him Count Fugger, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of Jngolſtadt, commanded the Infanetry,
and Ulrich Duke of Wirtemberg was General of the
Cavallery. John Adolph, Duke of Holſtein, and
Guſtave Adolph Marqucſs of Baden ſerved in that
ſame Army, in quality of Mareſhals of the field, the
one for the horſe, the other for the foot. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of the Confederates having loſt the Prince of
Solms, a little before the beginning of this war, was
ever ſince under the command of Wolfgang Julius
Count of Holach or Hohenlo, who had under him
Officers and Sojors of good account and reputation.
Count Serini commanded an Army of Hungarians
and Cravats, who were very numerous. Count
Souches had a flying Army, with which he made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
in the enemies Countrey, and defended our
Frontiers, and obtained with it frequent victories.
He took Neutra and Levens in the beginning of the
Campagn, and fell upon the camp of theſe Turks,
who were endeavoring to regain theſe two places,
that they might the more eaſily come into Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.
By this action he layd ſix thouſand Turke
in the duſt, and put five and twenty thouſand to
flight; whereby he much encouraged all the reſt of
the Chriſtian forces.</p>

               <p>I would gladly know the number of the ſojors
of whom theſe Armies were compoſed, by whom
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52894:48"/>
they were leavied, by whom they were intertained,
and by whom they were furniſhed with proviſions
and amunitons, without which they could not ſubſiſt.</p>

               <p>Armies are ever more numerous in paper,
then in the field, ſo that I cannot certainly tell you
the ſtrength of ours; but they ſay the Army of the
Empire conſiſted of four and twenty thouſand, and
that of the Confederates of twenty thouſand. The
Emperor was ſaid to have in Montecuculies Army
twelve thouſand light horſe, ſeven thouſand Curaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers,
and eighteen thouſand foot: In that of Count
Serinis, there were between five and twenty and
thirty thouſand Cravats and Hungarians. In the
Count of Souches Army were ten or twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
men of ſeveral Nations. If ye adde to all theſe,
the Voluntaries and French Auxiliaries, which
amounted to four thouſand horſe and as many foot;
you will find that the number of all our forces far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
one hundred thouſand men, ſo many the
Chriſtians have not had in the field in a long time,
and which might ſeem to be of ſufficient ſtrength to
chace the Turk out of Hungary. And it is probable
they would have proved able enough for it, if all theſe
ſeveral bodies had acted with one Spirit, or that
there had been one Generaliſſimo of ſuch a quality,
that all the reſt of the Generals ſhould have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to pay him reſpect becauſe of his birth, and to
give him obedience becauſe of his charge. If then
our misfortune was ſuch, as that our Armies ſuffered
our ſtrong places to be taken by the enemy; we muſt
attribute it to the want of order, and to the hatred
that was amongſt the ſeveral Nations, whereof our
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52894:48"/>
Armies were compoſed. As to the reſt of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
the Princes then at Ratisbone, when it was
reſolved to aſſiſt the Emperor, every one promiſed
to do according to the proportion of his Revenue and
Eſtate. And in the mean time every one levied ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors,
who were entertained at the charges of thoſe
who raiſed and ſent them. But it was neceſſare, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that the Emperor ſhould make Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines
from which all the Armies might be furniſhed
with munitions, both for the belly and the war. And
certainly, if the orders of his Imperial Majeſty had
been well obſerved, the forces had wanted for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
For every Prince, Lord and Commonwealth
being careful to ſend that pay each to his own as was
promiſed, it is more then probable the ſouldiers had
been well enough entertained; and ſo nothing to
have been wanting but the ſpirit of union, to have
made them act with ſucceſs. It is true that as the
great body of the Empire moves but ſlowly, ſo the
troops came too late to the Rendezvous, and Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia
was relieved by the enemy before our forces were
together.</p>

               <p>The Gazets aſſured us, that the Forts of Serini,

               <p>Ordinarily victories and loſſes are followed by
others of that nature, and the one increaſeth, the
other abates the courages of men. The Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
having retired to Conſtantinople after the taking
of Newhauſel, cauſed attack the Earls of Serini and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52894:49"/>
Hollach. They having repulſed the enemy with a
notable loſs, breathed after nothing but conflicts and
victories: In effect theſe brave men taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Baſhas retreate, run over a part of
Hungary which belonged to the Turk, took and
plundered Raboska, Segues, and five Churches;
burnt the Bridge of Ezek, carried the terror of
their name throughout all the Countrey, and burnt
to aſhes all the corns, hay and ſtraw, which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
had on the border of the river Drave. The fame
of theſe victories ſpred it ſelf over all the Empire,
gave great reputation to the Generals, inflamed the
courage of their ſoldiers, filled their purſes with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and furniſhed them with abundance of proviant
whereof they ſtood in need. Theſe two Earls ſeeing
affairs look with ſo favorable an aſpect, ſought the
means to lead them to victory: they went to Ratiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,
and proponed ſome military exploits, made it
known that the Bridge of Ezek could not be rebuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
till the ſeaſon were farr ſpent; that in the mean
time they might beſeege and take Caniſia, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
they had blocked by the taking of Buzats, Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guet,
and by the garriſon they had in Serinſwar. They
demanded all theſe things that were neceſſare for the
ſiege of ſo important a place, and undoubtedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
they ſhould be ſent to them, they vigorouſly
begun it at the opening of the ſpring. This ſiege pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a Murtherer, for it hugely diminiſhed the number
of the beſeegers, and endured longer then they at
firſt did imagine; the enemy approaching for Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias
relief, the ſiege is raiſed, and before the Chriſtian
forces could draw together, the Turk takes Serinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>war
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52894:49"/>
and little Comorre. Theſe ſucceſſes were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
with greater: For after our Army was aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
he continued his victories by the taking of Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prin.
But fortune weary of following the wrong
party, turned on our ſide, after which time the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
and his Turks were not ſo ſucceſsful. Lewis
Count of Souches Governorof Comorre defeats the
Infidels at Sernevits, and purſues them ſo vigorouſly,
that he made them abandon Barcan, and ruined a
bridge of boats, which they had upon the Danube.
Raimund, Count of Montecuculi made them repent
that they offered to paſs the river of Raab, and the
Earls of Coligni and Fueillade, cut in pieces all thoſe
that had paſſed the ſame river near to Saint Godard.</p>

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>They ſay indeed, that the Count of Coligni
and Fueillade did great things, and therefore I ſhould
be glad, before this diſcourſe be at an end, to know
ſomething of the aſſiſtance the Emperor deſired of
forreign Potentates; for I ſuppoſe it hath been one
of the great members of our Armies, and one of
the great motives that obliged the Grand Viſier to
hearken ſo ſoon to a peace.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.</speaker>
               <p>There is no doubt to be made of that, for the
Emperor being very careful to make himſelf ſtrong
againſt ſo powerful an enemy, ſent his Embaſſadors
to implore aſſiſtance from all theſe who were able to
give it. Theſe he ſent, found good words in all places,
and in ſome, good deeds; all Germany was alarmed,
Italy, Sweden, Lorrain, Spain and France, took the
preſervation of Hungary to heart. Spain and Italy
promiſed to furniſh great ſums of money; Sweden
Lorrain and France offered to ſend troops enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52894:50"/>
at their own charges. I cannot tell preciſely
what the reſt did. But it may be ſaid truly, that the
zeal of the French ſurpaſſed that of all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
The King who hath as much piety as Saint
Lewis, as much valor as Philip Auguſt, as muſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as Charles the fifth, and as much courage as
Henry the Great, and more zeal for Religion then all
his Predeceſſors, did hear with much grief, that the
Turk had begun the war; and with much joy, that
the Emperor ſought his help. The miſchiefs the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
had done upon our frontiers, and the numbers
of poor Chriſtians that were every day brought in
ſlavery, and put in fetters, moved him to ſo much
compaſſion, that when Count Strozzi limited the
ſuccours which he ſought in name of his Imperial
Majeſty, to four thouſand foot, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
horſe, he wiſhed they had not offered to ſet
bounds to his liberality. Then the words Chriſtian &amp;
Royal which came from his mouth, did make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that all that can be ſaid of his piety towards
God and his pitty towards Hungary, is far below his
merite. He exhorted his Nobility to this glorious
Voyage; and told, even thoſe whom he loved beſt,
that they would make their Court as advantageouſly
in Hungary, as at the Louver. He proteſted in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of many Princes and Lords, That if his ſon the
Daulphin were ten years of age, he would ſend him in
this expedition. And which is more ſtrange, he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his Audience, that if it ſhould be Gods pleaſure to
afflict Chriſtendom ſo much, as to ſuffer the Emperor
to be worſted in this Campagn, he would go in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the next, to repair his loſſes, &amp; repulſe his enemy.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52894:50"/>
Theſe Diſcourſes full of martial heat, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
zeal, did put ſuch an edge upon the French No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
that inſtantly hundreths were ſeen who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
the ſatisfaction of their conſciences and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſities,
to all the pleaſures and contents they could
expect, either in the Court, or in this life. Prince Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,
Knight of Lorrain, knowing his Predeceſſors had
reigned in Jeruſalem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after they had expelled the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſens,
and that the Count of Harcourt his father, was
grieved that his age would not ſuffer him to put on
armor, nobly ſupplyed his place, and gave in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſo many proofs of his courage, that it may be
ſaid, he hath revived the memory of theſe Princes of
Lorrain, who in former times conquered the Eaſt;
and of the Duke of Mercoeur, who in the beginning
of this laſt age, made himſelf be admired at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
of Caniſia, and the taking of Alba Royal.</p>
               <p>The Princes of Rohan and Soubize, having a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
of their Predeceſſors to imitate, did make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
at this time: that if the Dukes of whom they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the tittle, knew how to defend theſe of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Religion, they knew as well to expoſe their
lives for the defence of Chriſtians. The Duke of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac
remembring the reputation which the Mareſhalls
of Coſſé and Briſac his Anceſters acquired, did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpare his body, nor his ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to follow their trace,
and to win glory to himſelf. The Count of Sault, and
the Marqueſs of Ragny and Canaples ſhew a burning
deſire they had to equalize the merit of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
of France the Duke of Leſdiguieres, the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalls
of Crequi, the Lords of Pontdormi, and an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit
number more of their illuſtrious Predeceſſors who
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52894:51"/>
went before them in the road of Military vertue. The
Duke of Boüillon, and the Count of Auvergn his
brother, led by the example of their brother and their
Uncle, and by that of the glorious Godfrey, who fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
all Europe with admiration in the year 1096. did
ſo ſignalize themſelves; that if they did not reign in
Jeruſalem, as their Anceſtors did, at leaſt they will
reign in the hearts of thoſe who were ſpectators of
their valors, and who knows the laudable ambition
they have to equalize the ancient Earles of Bologne,
of Naſſaw, of Berg, and the Princes of Orange. The
Count of Selle, the Knight of Saint Aignan, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
of Caſtelnaw, and all the other French Lords &amp;
Gentle-men, who were about two thouſand horſe,
remembring they had Lewis the Victorious both for
their King, and their Pattern, made the world ſee,
ſome by their glorious deaths, and the reſt by their
heroical exploits, that they were reſolved, either to
pluck the palm out of the Viſiers hand, or die hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
in the quarrel. In a word, the Auxiliaries which
the King ſent us, under the conduct of the Count of
Coligni, and the Lieutenant Generals Bodewels and
Gaſſion, did contribute much to the Victories which
we gained: and we may ſay, that there was not amongſt
them a ſimple ſoldier who had not been an Officer,
nor Captain, who had not very much experience. So
that this little Body, which might have furniſhed an
army of fifty thouſand ſtrong with Officers, had a great
ſhare in theſe advantages we acquired of the Turks in
this Campagn. And the glorious actions of the Count
himſelf, hath gained him as much reputation as may
make him ſhine in Hiſtory, as bright as an Admiral, an
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52894:51"/>
Andelot, or a Gaſpar, his Anceſters.</p>

fury, as if they would overflow the whole earth, and
yet are reſiſted and broken by the ſmalleſt rock that
ſtands upon the ſhoar. A few Chriſtian forces, a great
many whereof were but novices, gave a ſtop to the
power of the Great Viſier, covered the fields with
his valiant Spahi, and paſſed the river of Raab in ſpite
of his Janiſſaries. Theſe gallants who make it an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of their faith to contemn death, did learn here,
that nature perſwades more efficaciouſly then their
Alcoran, when ſhe taught them to fear the hail of our
muskets &amp; the thunder of our canons. Sernevits and
Saint Godard are names they will never forget:
And while they live, they will imagine, that the
Counts Souches, Hollach, Coligni &amp; Fueillade, are in
their rear, and with them the Princes of Baden and
Sultsbach. Their poſterity will never hear ſpeak of
theſe Lords but with terror, &amp; ours with admiration.
The Janiſaries never ſaw ſo fearful a thing, as the
French Cavallery, nor will they ever ſee Blew Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks
chamarried with ſilver, but they will call to
mind the extraordinary valor of our Volunteers.
The Moldavians will tremble, when they think of
the battel of Levens, ſo will the Turks when
they remember the fury of theſe blows, which forced
them to abandon Barcan, before they had formed the
deſign to beſeege it. Hungary and Germany hath
made war with the Mahometans with advantage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Enſignes of Vladiſlaus, Matthias Corvin,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52894:53"/>
Charles the fifth, Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the firſt, &amp; Rodolph the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
John Hunniades, George Caſtriot Scanderberg,
Sigiſmund Battori, George Martenuſias, Nicolas Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,
&amp; Philip Emmanuel of Lorrain Duke of Mercoeur,
made the Turks repent many times, that they croſt the
Helleſpont. But never were they reduced to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
to ſeek Peace, but by the forces that threatned
them in Aſia; and now by the good fortune of Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold,
and the conduct of his Majeſties Generals. This
Peace hath made it known, that the Grand Viſier
imagined our ſwords were in his reins, and that there
was no aſſurance for him, but by a reaſonable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation.
The Emperor then ſeeing the terror
which accompanied his enemy, and being apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
the diſcord that was amongſt the Chiftains of the
Chriſtian Armies, might convert the pleaſure we had
to be victorious five or ſix times in one ſummer, in
ſorrow and tears, layd hold on occaſion, entered
in Treaty with the Viſier, and granted him Peace,
whereof we ſtood as much in need as he. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of this Peace, is the ordinary entertainment
of curious people. Theſe who are taken up with
other important affairs, buſie their thoughts not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
with this Peace. Men of abilities talk
of the conſequences of it, and every one ſpeaks of it
according to his fancy. Some blame it, others
praiſe it, and few or none believes but there is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
in it; yea the common people, whoſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
ſeldom go deeper then the out-ſide, will
needs be Judges of what the Gazeter writes. And
the moſt ignorant will needs pierce into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
yea the Intereſts of both the Emperor and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52894:53"/>
the Empire. We ſee none but ſuch as carry evil
news, and who to alarm Germany, ſay, that Peace
is made with the Turk, of purpoſe to make war in
the Empire; and that we have ſpared the blood of
ſtrangers, to ſhed the blood of Patriots. And they
talk openly that the Emperor intends to break that
Union, which is amongſt the Confederate Princes;
that he deſires to favor one of the parties in the war
of Erfort, and force the Lutherans to go to Maſs.
Some Prophets who will needs fore-tell the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
of the Turkiſh Empire by the French Armes, will
aſſure us, that the ſmel of the Lillies will ſuffocate the
Roman Eagle; and that he who favored us with ſo
ſeaſonable ſuccours, muſt now be the object of our
valor, and the ſubject of our misfortunes. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
theſe malicious ſpirits know, that ſome of the
German people have obligations to the Swedes, and
that they do bad offices to the Emperor, when they
ſay that he hath ſome buſineſs to do with them; they
endeavor to perſwade the world, that the Swedes
have an eye upon Sileſia, and that his Majeſty hath
concluded this Peace purpoſely to oppoſe more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly
their unjuſtice. My purpoſe is to ſtop the
torrent of this malice, and to ſhow the reaſons which
probably moved his Imperial Majeſty to this accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation.
I know not if I ſhal do all I intend:
At leaſt I am very aſſured, that his Majeſty hath infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
more religious thoughts, then theſe ſuborners,
who dare blame his pure and pious intentions. And
I am verily perſwaded, he minds nothing but the
good of his Eſtates. I know if theſe ſeditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
durſt ask him, why he entred in a Treaty with
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52894:54"/>
the Port at a time, when all Europe believed he might
have remounted the Throne of Hungary, and
been crowned with Lawrels, he would give them
reaſons for it, to which no reply could be made.
But Soveraigns have not yet been obliged to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themſelves to the judgement of the populace or
commons, or give them an account why they have
made Peace, or why they have declared war. And
yet if they will hearken to me, I am hopeful to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their curioſity.</p>
               <p>The wiſe Pilot who knows and ſees the marks and
fore-runners of a ſtorm, cauſeth pull down his ſails,
before they be torn by the tempeſt, or that his ſhip be
in danger to be loſt. The Emperor did the like in this
rencounter. He ſaw that his own forces, thoſe of the
Empire, and thoſe of the Confederates, were in a
continual difference one with another; he was juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
afraid, that this diſcord might give the Turks for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which were more unanimous, an advantage to
give ſuch a blow, as might not only make the reſt of
Hungary ſubmit to the Ottoman yoke, but alſo
brangle Germany ſo, that he ſhould find it in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
diſorder. He was likewiſe weary of begging
aſſiſtance from his equals and inferiors, and was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with grief to hear continual complaints of thoſe
who were obliged to ſend recruts, and entertainment
to the troops they had levied. He knew that many
of our Patriots looked with no good eye upon the
Auxiliarites, and that every mean fellow endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
to refuſe them both victuals, and lodging for
their money: He knew he ought not quarter all the
Armies in his own Territories, and that he was not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52894:54"/>
obliged by the ruine of his own Eſtates, to preſerve
theſe which belonged to other members of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
He ſaw well enough the dangerous miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that was creepd in amongſt the German
Princes, upon the account of the City of Erfurt, and
had reaſon to believe if the matter came to blows,
they would recall the forces they had in Hungary, &amp;
leave him alone againſt the whole power of the Turk.</p>
               <p>Italy in this rencounter did move but little for his
Imperial Majeſty: and he whoſe lawful and holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
carried him to be moſt favorable to him, could
not do much, in regard, his frequent ſickneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition:
The great affairs he had to do, and the
conjunctures of time, had ever been contrare to him,
as all the world knows. A twenty years war had ſo
drained the Venetians, that they were not capable to
do great matters; and though they ſhould attempt
ſomething, yet their naval forces would not make
the Grand Seigneur recall thoſe Armies of his, who lay
heavy upon the Emperor, The King of Spain hath
not yet had time to breath, and though his Intereſts
are mixed with thoſe of the Emperor; yet being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
to quench the fire that burns his own houſe, he
is not in a capacity to aſſiſt Leopold with either great
ſums of money, or numbers of men. All he can do,
is to counſell him to take up his meaſures right, and
rather buy Peace, then want it: and thereby put
himſelf in a condition, to enter to the inheritance of
his Anceſtors, if he be called to it by the Laws of that
Kingdom. The King of Great Brittain hath made
an alliance with the enemies of the Illuſtrious Houſe
of Auſtria, which probably will hinder him to joyn
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52894:55"/>
his forces with ours againſt a Potentate whom he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
feared, or ever will be afraid of. The Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
having been once members of the Empire were
obliged to the Emperor Ferdinand the third, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
them to be Soveraign, and free Eſtates,
at leaſt indirectly, after the Peace of Munſter, have
ſome reaſon to embrace the intereſts of his ſon, but
they will not do it for all that, becauſe they can gain
nothing but honor by it, &amp; that is a morſel which doth
not relliſh their Palats, as alſo becauſe they may ſtand
in need of all their forces themſelves, if the Engliſh
chance to give them any work to do. The Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
are fickle and volage, on whoſe reſolutions, no
certain foundation can be laid. And becauſe they
find the inconveniences, and diſcommodities of the
war, (their Countrey being the Stage of it) the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
did believe, and had reaſon to do ſo, that there
was no better mean to keep them within the bounds
of their duty, then to procure Peace and Quiet to
them, and to get them to lay down arms under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pretext. The Polonians and Muſcovites, whoſe
intereſt it ever was to weaken this formidable enemy
of the Turk, were by the ears, &amp; deſtroying one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
at the time when they ſhould have taken that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
againſt him, which we furniſhed by giving
him work elſewhere. And the affairs of theſe two
Nations are in ſuch confuſion, that we have but ſmal
hopes to put them in order, and reconcile them. The
Coſſacks are in the ſame Category, and that warlike
Nation, which in former times made incurſions to
the Euxin ſea, ſides now with the Polonians, or elſe
we ungloriouſly quiet Spectators of their differences,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52894:55"/>
without daring to hazard the enterpriſe of any
important action.</p>
               <p>Theſe are, as I conceive, the reaſons which moved
the Emperor to embrace Peace: and it may be, the
Pope, fearing he might be obliged to contribute to
the maintenance of the war, hath adviſed him to
do ſo, for his own particular intereſt. Theſe reaſons
ſhould, if I do not flatter my ſelf, ſufficiently diſabuſe
thoſe, who have entertained themſelves with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare
opinion. But becauſe ſome ill natured Patriots,
whom I would gladly convince, bring reaſons on
the other part which ſeem plauſible; I will be at the
pains to examine them, &amp; caſt them one after another.</p>
               <p>They ſay, the fear the Emperor had, that the
Swedes would invade his Dominions, while he was
buſied in the war of Hungary, gave a ſtop to the
purſute of his victories there. I am not at all of that
opinion: But if it were ſo, what can any truly honeſt
man ſpeak againſt it. And certainly, no Polititian will
blame his Majeſty for having ſuch thoughts. And if
ſuch conſiderations of importance moved him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of an advantageous agreement, there is a great
deal of more reaſon to commend his prudence, then
accuſe him of precipitation. I ſuppoſe, there are few
or none in the world but knows, there are ſome ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities
between the Emperor and the Crown of
Sweden. The Swedes ſhow themſelves conſtantly
ready to own the Proteſtants, whom the Houſe of
Auſtria endeavors to bring back to the boſome of
the Church of Rome. The wars which the Sweds
made in Germany under the conduct of the Great
Guſtavus Adolphus, and the auſpicious reign of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52894:56"/>
Queen Chriſtina, being directly againſt the Imperial
Majeſty, hath imbittered their ſpirits, &amp; rendered their
diſtruſts &amp; miſunderſtandings immortal. King Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
Guſtave, waſted, ſpoiled and ruined Pole and Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.
He who is now Emperor, and was then but
King of Hungary and Bohemia, oppoſed his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
conqueſts, which inflamed that King with ſuch a
deſire of revenge, that it is not dead with him. Theſe
conſiderations, &amp; that of the great number of Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,
that the Emperor hath in his hereditary Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the deſire they may have to change their Maſter,
to preſerve the liberty of their conſciences, the great
preparations the Swed inceſſantly makes, though he
be alwayes conſtantly well armed; were capable to
give juſt apprehenſions and jealouſies to a Prince,
whoſe forces were ſcarce able to reſiſt that powerful
and dreadful enemy, whom he had in head of him.</p>
               <p>Theſe who will bring France in the play, and dare
alledge that the fear the Emperor had, that the Moſt
Chriſtian King might ſeaſe on the Spaniſh Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
forced him to this acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modation with the Turk,
ſeems to have far leſs reaſon on their ſide. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
which the Crown of France had with the
Auſtrian Family, are intirely removed by a ſolemn
Treaty: And two Queens, one whereof hath the
poſſeſſion of the Body, the other of the Heart, and
both of them of the Ear of the King; the one in the
quality of his Mother, the other of his Conſort, will
never permit them to come to a rupture The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
love the King bears to the Queen his wife, and
the reverence he carries to the Queen his Mother,
are theſe indiſſoluble bonds of the good intelligence
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52894:56"/>
he intends to keep with their kinſmen; and if this be
not ſufficient, yet there is one reaſon that is infallible:
This Prince is extraordinarly religious, and though
the heat of a gallant youth, a courage heroically mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
and immenſe riches, might perſwade him to a
breach, yet his conſcience will never ſuffer him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
any thing, that hath in it the leaſt appearance
of unjuſtice. And if he find he cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the exerciſe of his valor, and the ſtrength of his
admirable Genius, he will chooſe rather to go and
gather palms in Palaeſtine, then to imploy againſt us
the flaſhing ſword of his warlike Nobility. The Duke
of Beauforts ſetling foot in Africk, is a fore-runner of
what the Infidels have to fear, and the Chriſtians to
hope for. The Kings great ſoul aſpires to great
things, but he weighs all his actions in the ballance of
reaſon. The zeal he witneſſed, by reſenting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
done us by the Turk, the Chriſtian words he
ſpoke upon that ſubject, the brave and ſeaſonable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
he ſent us, hath blotted out of the Emperors
mind all ſuſpicions and jealouſies he could harbor of
him. The affronts, which Charles the eigth put upon
Maximilian the firſt, and the wrongs done by Lewis
the twefth, Francis the firſt, and Henry the ſecond
to Charles the fifth are buried and intirely forgotten.
The attempt of Henry the Great, and the aſſiſtance
which Lewis the Juſt, &amp; Lewis the Victorious, have
given ſince to the enemies of Ferdinand the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and Ferdinand the third, and the oppoſition was
made by the French to Leopolds election to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Dignity, have now no more power in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
heart, then if he had never heard of them.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52894:57"/>
His Imperial Majeſty knows, that his Predeceſſors
have ſerved the Kings of France in the ſame manner,
imploying both Policy and Power againſt them. He
is not ignorant, what evil uſage, Lewis the eleventh,
Charles the eighth, and Lewis the twelfth received
from John and Ferdinand Kings of Arragon; and he
hath read in the Hiſtory of his Family, how Charles
the fifth keeped Francis the firſt priſoner, till he was
reduced to great extremities: And how Philip the
ſecond uſed all means to rob Henry the fourth of the
Inheritance belonged to him without any diſpute.
And in one word the jealouſie of State hath ever
been ſo great between theſe two moſt Illuſtrious
Houſes, that the one never endeavored, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
any great action, but it was vigorouſly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the other. But Lewis following Maximes
wholly different from theſe of his Anceſtors, it is fit
Leopold do the like, and not ſuffer himſelf to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
in any act of generoſity: and that there be now
an entire good underſtanding between them. The
propinquity of Blood, the uniformity of Religion, the
equality of Age, and which is much more then all
theſe, the Glory of God, the propagation of the
Faith, and the quiet and repoſe of Chriſtendom,
which depends much upon their Union, ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them to love one another, to ſuccor one another,
and to have but one ſoul and one will.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid, that upon the death of this King of
Spain, the Intereſts of theſe two great Princes will
prevail more with them, then all theſe conſiderations
that I have alledged. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that both having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
to the Inheritance of their Father in Law,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52894:57"/>
they will ſhare it with dint of Sword, and the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
will carry away the greateſt part. To which I
anſwer, that the King of Spain dying, and leaving a
lawful Heir Male, the adminiſtrators of the Pupil
will dutifully render to the Moſt Chriſtian King all
theſe reſpects, all that friendſhip and good offices
and neighborhood, which were promiſed to him in
the laſt Treaty of Peace by the Catholick King. The
Emperor will do the ſame upon his part, and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing,
that the love and amity of great perſons is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by Civilities, by Embaſſies, and other
teſtimonies of honor and reſpect; he will not be
wanting to give all theſe Demonſtrations of Curteſie,
that can be required for the preſervation of ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
&amp; ſo neceſſare a friendſhip. But if it ſhould pleaſe
God (which we pray him to avert) to call to another
world, both the King and Prince of Spain without
any other heir male, I fear, we ſhould be in danger to
ſee bloody Tragedies. Yet we hope ſo much from the
prudence of the Spaniard, and the moderation of the
Emperor, and the King, that they will ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be over-ruled by reaſon, more then intereſt;
and every one of them quitting ſomething of their
right, come to a fair and arbitrary accommodation.
Peaceable men would wiſh, that the King of Spain
might live yet twenty years, and that his ſon the
Prince comd to a mans age, might ſucceed him. Yea,
I know ſome, who would gladly quite ſome of the
years of their own life, to prolong theirs who are ſo
neceſſare for the repoſe of Chriſtendom. But theſe
being vain wiſhes, I hope that he who hath taught
us not to care for to morrow, will provide for his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52894:58"/>
people, and will make it known to men, that what
ſeems impoſſible to them, is eaſie to him; and will let
us ſee, that he who can bring good out of evil, and
light out of darkneſs, knows how to bring ſtrength
out of weakneſs: And turn that to the glory of his
Great Name, which humane prudence made the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of their fear and deſpair. For my part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I think we
ought not to dive in the uncertainty of things to
come. But if it were permitted us to think of them,
we ſhould meet with that which might feed our
hopes. I ſpeak truth with ſome repugnancy, I am
of the opinion, if Potentates would ſuffer their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
to be removed, as eaſily as particular men
do, it would not be impoſſible to ſatisfie the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders,
who it may be, will demand their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with the mouths of Canons, and ſo clip the
wings of the ambition of all others. Don John of
Auſtria may read in Hiſtory, that perſons of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
have reigned in Caſtile, as well as in Naples
and Portugal. But ſeeing the dignity and power of
his Competitors, he will let his ſail fall, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himſelf to be Great Maſter of the Order of Saint
James, if they will not gratifie him with ſome tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
appenage. Theſe of the Houſe of Lacerda hath
been ſo long ſubjects, that they think not now of
reigning; and if they do, they will ſtiffle their hopes,
when they ſee the Emperor and the King agreed ſo,
that France ſhal enjoy what belonged to Mary of
Burgundy and Auſtria, that which appertained to
Joanne of Spain. Other Grandees will rather chooſe
to be governed by a Prince, who hath alwayes
been more eminent then themſelves, then be Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52894:58"/>
to one who formerly was but their equal.
And if they would rather have a Spaniard for their
King, then a Germane, let them caſt their eye upon
the King of Portugal, and ſo reunite all Spain in one
body, and at one pull pluck up the root of all theſe
differences which have brought them ſo low. But I go
too far, &amp; enters (before I be aware) in a ſtrange laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.
It is better for me to remit this ſo important an
affair, to the prudence of theſe great Souls, who kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
how to govern &amp; manage great Eſtates, knows
alſo how to divide them, when neceſſity requires it.</p>
               <p>I paſs therefore from this odious ſubject to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which is little better: to anſwer thoſe who aſſure
themſelves, that this Peace was made that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
might be in a capacity to force the Proteſtants of
all his hereditary Dominions, yea thoſe of Hungary,
which is elective, to go to Maſs: and if that ſucceed
with him, he will go a further length, and try if his
fortune in that attempt, will prove better then that
of his father, and grand-father.</p>
               <p>They ſay, and all the world believes it, that the
Princes of the Houſe of Auſtria hearkens much to the
perſwaſions of devout and religious perſons: and that
there is not one of them who would not gladly look
upon the picture of the laſt Proteſtant that ſhould
ever be in the world.</p>
               <p>Hiſtories teach us, that Philip the ſecond King of
Spain, loſt a conſiderable part of his Low-Countreys,
with a great deal of more zeal, then policy; and that
by introducing the Inquiſition in theſe places, he ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
obedience out of them. The Emperor Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
the ſecond brought Germany to the brink of a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52894:59"/>
precipice, when he made his averſion to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
known, and commanded them to give back the
Church-goods to their ancient Maſters. This Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
put rebellion in the hearts, and arms in the hands
of a world of perſons, who never laid down either
their ſwords or their animoſities, till that Emperor
and his ſon had ſufficiently drained their Provinces of
men, and their coffers of moneys; nay, till both of
them had learned that God had reſerved the Empire
of conſciences to himſelf. I have ſeen with my eyes,
and I have heard with my ears, ſome Hungarians,
men of quality, who ſaid openly at Vienne, that the
Emperors Counſel would force them to ſubmit to
the Turk, by offring to conſtrain them to embrace
the Roman Religion. There are many in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who in the like caſe, will do the ſame thing. And
almoſt all men prefer the liberty of their mind to that
of their body. Men have been ſeen become fierce as
Lyons, and women to eat their own children, rather
then ſubmit to theſe who made war againſt their tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
opinions. Many who live yet, will prefer death
to the Maſs; and will ſhow as much zeal againſt it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as
theſe of Flanders did in the time of our fathers. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria
had better imitate France, and in ſtead of fire and
ſword, apply meekneſs and doctrine, to bring home
theſe who they conceive are out of the way. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
an age and a half hath made the Emperor and
his Miniſters know, that violent courſes are not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
for the converſion of ſouls. The nature of man
oppoſeth it ſelf to all things that reſtrains its liberty.
Theſe Prieſts who adviſe mens conſciences to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
had better ſing in the Quire, &amp; read their Brevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52894:59"/>
then frequent Courts, and give counſel to Kings.
If any Church men be found who are fit to govern,
it is not they who are bred in Cloiſters: Their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes
and reſolutions being all taken out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Law, are fitter to bring the world in confuſion,
then to keep it in good order. There are an hundred
occaſions wherein the Law being executed in its ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor,
proves manifeſt unjuſtice: And therefore in ſuch
caſes, prudence is more neceſſare then knowledge.
The Almighty hath given to Princes the ſoveraignty
of the body, but hath reſerved that of the ſoul to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Men may be forced to go to Maſs, but cannot
be conſtrained to believe the myſteries of it. Fearful
people may be threatned to a bowing the knees of
their bodies, without any reverence in their ſpirits.
And ſome may be forced to acknowledge themſelves
Catholicks with their mouths, and yet are not Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
in their hearts. Spain hath ſeen a thouſand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
examples of this undoubted verity. The
fourth, yea the fifth generation of thoſe who have
been conſtrained to be baptized, have been baniſhed
for their unbelief: and thoſe who yet ſtay there, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
every day their Baptiſm, and participates
not of the Sacraments without ſacriledge. And in
matters of Religion, to be forced by the power of the
arm of fleſh, produceth ever ſuch effects. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
and ill governed devotion of theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots
who will have conſtraint to be applyed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
procures the deſolation of Provinces, and
profanation of holy myſteries. I have known ſome
prating fools, who durſt exclaim againſt Queen
Chriſtina of Sweden, becauſe ſhe conſented to the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52894:60"/>
Peace of Germany, before ſhe had chaſed the Pope
out of Rome. And, no doubt, there are hundreds of
petty Monks, who have thought, perhaps, ſaid as
much againſt thoſe who ſigned that Peace, before the
Lutherans were brought to renounce their Belief.
All ſuch are fiery zealots, whoſe maximes are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on their own capricious fancies. And aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their zeal would wax cold, if they were put but for
three days to the duty of musketeers, and be allowed
no other entertainement, but a pitance of bread and
water. But theſe fools imagine, that in every place a
bell rings to give notice of dinner time; and that all
things are to be got in armies, as in Convents; and
that it as eaſie to win battels, as to tell their beads. If
the Emperor would not look upon ſuch a people,
but at the Altar, and in the Pulpit, we ſhould not
have ſo much occaſion of fear. His Majeſty hath tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
almoſt all Germany, and having ſeen the bitter
fruits of the former war, hath put on a firm reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not to plunge any more his people in new cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
His principal Miniſters and Counſellors of
Eſtate, have ſufficiently felt the evils and devaſtations
which both civil and forreign wars have produced:
And know, that it is eaſie to begin, but almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to end buſineſs of that nature. They are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that the entertainment of armies, make the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt
coffers of treaſure empty, and layeth the moſt
fertile Provinces waſte. They know that a war for
Religion is the moſt plauſible, and the moſt obſtinate
that can be fancied; and that they cannot begin it,
without bringing all Europe in the play, and putting
their Maſters Eſtates in an evident danger to be for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52894:60"/>
ever loſt. We may then be confident, that the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Emperor, and the averſion he hath from
domeſtick broyls, will choak all the deſigns of incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries,
who would put a ſword in his hand to thruſt
in his own bowels.</p>
               <p>I am alſo informed, that ſome talk of deſigns the
Emperor ſhould have againſt the Confederate Princes
of the Rhine: and that there are ſome, who ſay, His
Majeſty is diſſatisfied with them, that the forces they
ſent to Hungary would not obey his orders entirely,
and therefore he thinks upon the means whereby he
may reduce them to the obedience they owe him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For my part, I think they ſpeak ſo without ground,
and ſhal deſire all who have ſuch thoughts, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what I am to ſay to them. This League is a hard
bone to gnaw; and I am of the opinion, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
may more eaſily impoſe his yoak upon all that
of Hungary which the Turk poſſeſſeth, then force ten
or twelve German Princes, ſupported by the moſt
conſiderable powers of Chriſtendom, to ſubmit to
him. It is not to be doubted, but this League making
the diſtruſt that is between the Head and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Empire, known, cannot but infinitly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
his Imperial Majeſty, making his power leſs by
the half, himſelf leſs to be regarded and honored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Germans, and more vilipended amongſt
ſtrangers. Good Patriots ſhould wiſh that all cauſes
of jealouſie might be buried in perpetual oblivion:
and that the ſeveral Princes would both ſeek and find
the preſervation of their authority, in the good graces
and favor of their Chief The Allies themſelves wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
the Emperor would baniſh that which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52894:61"/>
their confederacy; and that he would bring
back that mutual truſt which the unhappineſs of the
times hath chaſed from amongſt them, and ſo his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ſhould oblige them to think of nothing elſe but
his ſervice, to ſeek the honor of his favor, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
with all their power, his content and ſatisfaction.
But I ſhal never be perſwaded that the Emperor will
make uſe of his power, where it will not only be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
but very hurtful to him; yea, &amp; where modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it ſelf will ſerve to little purpoſe, if it be not ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the favor of the times, &amp; by many examples
of an extraordinary friendſhip. They ſay there was
no good underſtanding between his Majeſties Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
and thoſe of the League: And our ſpeculative
States-men will aſſure us, that there is as little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their Maſters: But conjectures are not always
convincing. And becauſe the Emperor hath little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to love thoſe who do not truſt him, it is not
permitted to conclude, that he will attack them with
open force. I ſhould rather think, he intends to gain
them by demonſtrations of kindneſs and love, and
that he hopes their own good nature and duty to
their Countrey, will be ſtrong motives to induce them
to contribute both their counſels and forces for the
preſervation of the Empire, and to aſſiſt him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
all mis-underſtandings from amonſt them. And
if theſe thoughts ſeem below the flight of a young
Eagle; at leaſt, I would have them to perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that he is extreamly generous, and that will
not permit him to have any obligations to theſe who
ſerve him out of no kindneſs or love: and therefore,
ſeeing theſe Confederates to be always puiſſantly
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52894:61"/>
armed, he concluded the Peace, that he might be in a
condition to reſiſt them, or any elſe would attack
him. If it be ſaid, this League is meerly defenſive,
that it hath no other end then the good and quyet of
the Confederates; it will be anſwered, that the taking
the Cities of Munſter and Erfurt, and the danger
other Towns apprehends, lets us ſee, that this defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
League, &amp; theſe who made it, can lay their hands
about them when they think it time to attack, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe
any thing. The Biſhop of Munſter, as brave
as he is, durſt never have hazarded to beſiege the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
City of his Dioceſſe, if he had not been aſſiſted
with both the troops and moneys of his Allies. The
like may be ſaid of the Elector of Mayence, who is a
Prince both rich, and wiſe, yet the City of Erfurt
would not have been afraid of him, in the time of the
war with the Turk, if the Confederates of his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral
Highneſs, had not contributed to the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of that inſolent City. It is therefore very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
that his Imperial Majeſty ſhould be in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
to concur with theſe confederated Princes,
when their pretentions are reaſonable, and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them when they are unjuſt. And this was not
in his power to do, while he was buſied in a war with
the Infidel; and this is that which ſerves for a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Peace he hath lately made, that by it
he is in a condition to countenance thoſe, who ſhal
ſtand in need of his Arms, and of his Protection.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe there be ſome in the world, who will
grant, that this diſcourſe bears with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome ſhow of
truth; and theſe who are not too much wedded to
their opinions, I hope, will believe that his Imperial
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52894:62"/>
Majeſty had no ſuſpicion of either the French or the
Swedes: yea I ſhall find ſome, who dare give aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to both the Proteſtants &amp; the Confederates, that
this Peace ſhal not trouble their repoſe; as alſo to all
Germany, that it is an advantageous Peace to both
great and ſmall; and that none of them ſhal have
reaſon to complain of it, unleſs it be, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
made it without ſeeking the advice of the Princes
of the Empire. I made this objection, before any
ſpoke of it to me, and I thought as my adverſaries
do, that the war having drawn theſe Princes to an
extraordinary trouble and expence, they would look
joyfully on that Peace would rid them of both. And
in regard contempt is inſupportable to men of quality
and courage, I perſwaded my ſelf, they could not hear
without ſome emotion of ſpirit, that his Majeſty had
valued them ſo little, as to conclude a Treaty of ſuch
importance, without ſeeking their advice. I know
there be many who complain, that theſe of the Court
of Vienne never conſult with them, but when they
ſtand in need of either their troops or their moneys,
or both, and that this manner of acting is altogether
unſufferable. I ſhould acknowledge this complaint to
be juſt, if the Peace had been ſubſcribed and publiſhed
without the approbation of thoſe who contributed
to the war. But I do not believe, that any perſons of
Judgement and experience, will think it ſtrange, that
to ſhun the tedious delays. which accompany the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
of all Imperial Diets, affairs have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
&amp; brought to the point of a concluſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſeeking the advice of theſe who might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arded
it. The intereſts of the ſeveral Eſtates of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52894:62"/>
Empire are ſo different, and ſo hard a matter it is, to
get them all to agree to one thing, that the Treaty
ſhould not have produced that effect, which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
deſired, if he had called them all to Councel.
Theſe who complain, ſees not, nor knows not ſo well
what is in the Emperors coffers, as they who advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him to this accommodation. The affairs of
Tranſilvany having obliged his Imperial Majeſty to
keep numerous forces a foot five or ſix years, hath
eaten up his Fronteer Provinces, and even forced his
Councel in prudence, to ſhun more quarterings on
them, leſt they ſhould have been laid entirely waſte.
If all the Germans loved the Emperor, as well-bred
children love their Fathers, they would believe all
he does, aims at nothing but the good of the State.
None would blame his conduct, but all the world
would praiſe him, for the care he hath had, and the
pains he hath taken, to acquire to us the ineſtimable
benefit of Peace. But I ſhal ſuppoſe, that the Eſtates
of the Empire, have ſome reaſon to complain: and
therefore will ask of theſe who are moſt capricious,
and leaſt reaſonable, if they will be ſatisfied, if the
Emperor tell them, that he waits for their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to conclude a buſineſs advantageous and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to all Germany, and particularly to them? It is
like, there are ſome who will ſay, that will not ſatisfie,
and will offer to aſſure us, that the charges they have
been at, and the trouble they have ſuffered to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
his Imperial Majeſty, hath deſerved ſomething
more then that. And here, I profeſs, I had rather
hold my peace, then ſpeak. I know the ſervices the
Emperor hath received from the Eſtates of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52894:63"/>
Empire, cryes for a thankful acknowledgement, and
that he is unworthy of any favor, who intends to pay
it with ingratitude: As alſo, that he who exacts
more then is juſtly own to him, ſerves to be paid
with little, or with none at all; for I hold it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable,
that the acknowledgement ſhould be
proportionable to the favor. It will be raſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent,
to demand of the Emperor an entire ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his will to that of his Princes, becauſe they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
him, and it were to oblige him to an impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
to pretend, he might do nothing of himſelf in a
Kingdom, which hath no dependance on Germany.
I ſhould think it ſufficient, that his Majeſty deſcends
ſo low, as to demand their conſent and approbation:
And that he lets them ſee, that he entertains as high
an eſtimation of them, as he ſhould, and values
them as much as ever any of his Anceſtors valued
any of theirs. If all this will not ſatisfie, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
will let them ſee, the ſuccours they gave him, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the preſervation of his Eſtates, aimed alſo at
the preſervation of the Empire. His Majeſty will
confeſs, that his hereditary Dominions are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the injuries and incurſions of the Turk, then
any other of the Empire; But he will never be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to believe, that they only are in danger. The
common enemies ambition is not arreſted by the
conqueſt of ſome places, a world will no more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
him then the Great Alexander. And Hungary
ſhal no ſooner fall in his hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he will advance
with his victorious arms further, if the united for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Chriſtians retain him not within the bounds of
his duty. The Princes then aſſiſted his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52894:63"/>
by ſaving themſelves: And whoever will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate
with him for ſuch a favor, will loſe the
fruits of it, and will ſhow that he knows not, that the
Grand Seigneurs ambition hath no other limit, but
that of his power.</p>
               <p>Believing then, that the Eſtates of the Empire
will eaſily acquieſce to his Majeſties juſt deſires, I ſhal
leave them, and make a ſtep over to Pole and Venice,
and ſee with what aſſurance, and upon what grounds
it is ſaid, that the Emperor made haſte to make this
Peace, to prevent the Venetians, who were buſie in
clapping up one with the Sultan, and to be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to receive the Crown which the Polonians
promiſed him.</p>
               <p>As to Pole, all Europe knows that in the year 1655.
the King of Sweden invaded that Kingdom; and that
in a ſhort time he reduced it to the neceſſity to implore
aſſiſtance from its neighbors. Neither can any be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
but it found the Emperor diſpoſed to furniſh
it with means to reſiſt its enemie, and ready to ſend
ſixteen thouſand men to reſtrain his further progreſs.
They ſay, that amongſt the conditions of the Accord,
that of the Election of Leopold, after John Caſimirs
death, was the moſt conſiderable: And upon this,
they ground their opinion, who ſay, that the Peace
of Hungary was made, that the Emperor might with
leſs oppoſition enter to that great Inheritance.
Treaties of this nature comes to the knowledge but
of a few, and therefore it were raſhneſs to avouch it
to be true, and folly obſtinatly to deny it. It ſeems not
improbable, but the Polonians being brought to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
might promiſe all could be deſired of them, by
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52894:64"/>
theſe who would put them in a more hopeful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But I ſee very great difficulties in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of this promiſe, as well on their part, who
made it, as on his to whom it was made. Theſe who
made it, are the Polonians, who in a buſineſs of this
nature, do not eaſily agree, and yet an accord amongſt
themſelves is neceſſare to make the election of their
Kings valide. He to whom it is made, is Leopold,
Emperor of the Romans, who cannot receive that
Crown, without putting Europe in a flame, his own
Eſtates in danger, and impoſing on the Empire a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
to take arms. No Prince or State will ſit with
croſſd arms, when a powerful neighbor acquires
new Provinces. The Swedes, the Muſcovites, and
the Turks, cannot ſee Pole in the power of the Houſe
of Auſtria without reſentment. The firſt will be
afraid, they may be forced to give back that which
they have gained with the point of their ſword, and
with ſolemn Treaties. The ſecond will apprehend,
they may be neceſſitated to keep within theſe bounds
which they would gladly enlarge. And the third
will imagine, that upon the union of Pole with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria
depends the ruine of Conſtantinople. The Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coviter
will make Peace with his neighbors, the
Swed will conjure up his old practiſes; And the
Turk will raiſe up Aſia; and all of them will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
to hinder the Emperor to enjoy the fruits of
his election in Peace. The Turk will imploy all
his induſtry and wiles, the Swed all his Arſenals
and Magazins, and the Muſcoviter all his riches and
treaſure, to divert Pole from the performance of what
it hath promiſed, Germany will not deſire to ſee the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52894:64"/>
Emperor on the Throne of Pole, nay its Princes will
bind all the nerves of their power and prudence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
to hinder him to mount upon it. The moſt
underſtanding of the Polonians themſelves, who
fore-ſee the ſad conſequences of this election, will be
well contented, it prove abortive. Theſe who in all
ages envyed the growth of the Auſtrian Family, will
open their purſes to hinder this addition to its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And in a word, all Europe will take arms either
for the Emperor, or againſt him: So that it is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
if this election will go on to the content of the
pretenders, and if they be not very well aſſured, that
it will have that ſucceſs they propoſe to themſelves,
they ſhould in prudence ſeem not to deſire it. For
my part, I believe the Emperor makes it rather his
work to guard himſelf from the ſtorm that menaceth
him on the other ſide, by oppoſing himſelf to any
choice may be made of one of thoſe who envy his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
then to procure his own election. Certainly
Pole hath need of a King, who can repare its loſſes,
and put it again in that flowriſhing condition, which
made our fathers look upon it with admiration. But
the jealouſie the Polonians would give to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
by the election of a Potentate already conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
eminent by the power of other Kingdoms,
ſhould lead them to the choice of a Prince, who
would give no cauſe of ſuſpicion to any. I know
ſome, whoſe high vertues and qualifications ſpeak
them worthy of Crowns, whom the Houſes of Auſtria
and France, would be content to ſee ſit on the
Throne of Pole, whom Sweden and Muſcovia
will reſpect without fear, whom the Ottoman
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52894:65"/>
Port would ſuffer without diſpleaſure, and whom
the Polonians would not reject, if they have not
entirely forgot the true intereſt of their Republick.
It is to ſuch that all Europe wiſheth the Polonian
Scepter: It is ſuch who can accept it, without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the quyet of Chriſtendom. It is to ſuch that
Pole may give it, without fear to ſow the bitter ſeed
of diſcord in its own bowels. Not knowing then
whether the Emperor be deſirous to have the Crown
of Pole, or not, I ſhal not doubt but his Counſel will
reflect ſeriouſly on theſe difficulties that will rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, and upon theſe horrid wars which will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
an honor which all his neighbors will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
him, and which none of his friends ſhould wiſh to
him.</p>
               <p>As to what they ſay, that the Emperor knew that
the Venetians were in treaty with the Turk, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Peace from him for themſelves, and let the
whole burden of the war fall on his Majeſty alone: I
profeſs freely, I do not know what to believe of that
intrigue; but if we ſhal narrowly examine the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of affairs, and of the time, we may make a
concluſion of the contrare: for though we need not
doubt but the Venetians with all their hearts wiſh to
have Peace, and that they would willingly empty
their treaſure to recover what they have loſt in their
laſt war with that enemy; yet I ſuppoſe there be none
who thinks they would do it at that time when the
Peace of Hungary was concluded. It is more then
ten years ſince the Senate of that Republick could
have ſpared all the expence they have beſtowed on
the maintenance of the war ſince that time, if they
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52894:65"/>
would have given over their right of the Kingdom of
Candia to the Grand Seigneur: And the Peace they
could have expected at this time, would have been no
more favorable then before: And the Venetians ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
then a repugnancy from ſo diſadvantageous a
Peace, when they alone ſuſtained the whole Turkiſh
forces, there is little or no appearance at all they
would conſent to it, when Germany made ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
a diverſion of the Ottoman power; and that
they might perſwade themſelves, that time would
give them an opportunity to repair the breaches of
their Eſtate, and force the Turk to an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
leſs hurtful to them. I ſhal rather believe, that
his Imperial Majeſty inclined to bring the common
enemy of Chriſtians to an accord profitable to all
Chriſtendom. But that the unhappy conjuncture of
affairs took from him the means to bring his heroick
deſigns to ſo glorious an end, he was forced to be
contented to do all he could, and leave the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of the reſt to Divine Providence. It is that
will care for the Venetians, and will prepare friends
for them, able to deliver them from theſe evils that
now preſſeth and threatens to oppreſs them. All
Chriſtendom wiſheth and prayeth for this to them,
and I as much as any, becauſe I know that the piety
and valor of the illuſtrious Venetians, deſerves that
both heaven and earth ſhould favor them.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe what I have ſaid will ſatisfie theſe who
are governed by reaſon, and not by a capricious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor:
and that all thoſe who ſhal read this paper, will
acknowledge with me, that his Majeſty was not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with any violent thoughts to conclude this
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52894:66"/>
Peace. I know, honeſt men will confeſs the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
hath reaſon to love and honor the Moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
King, and that prudence and reaſon of State, will
oblige him to diſſemble the diſpleaſure which the
Confederate Princes have given him occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
againſt their proceedings; that his intereſt will
oblige him to defer and delay the Reformation of
the Proteſtants. That he hath no other concern in
the buſineſs of Pole, but to hinder any perſon of
whom he may have juſt cauſe of jealouſie, to receive
the Scepter of that Kingdom. That he hath no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to pay the Venetians in their own coyn: And
that the Sweds ſhal have him for their friend, ſo long as
they keep themſelves within their bounds, and live
as good neighbors, and true and faithful members of
the Empire.</p>
               <p>I do now only imagine, that it will be told me,
that the Hungarians have ſome reaſon to complain:
And that it would ſeem the Emperor behaveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to them, rather as a ſtepfather, then a father, in
regard to ſpare his men and his money, he hath made
a Peace diſadvantageous for them. But they will
alter their opinion who ſay ſo, when they underſtand
that (which none ſhould be ignorant of) this people
did ſo often threaten the Emperor to lay down arms,
and make their own agreement with the Viſier, that
they impoſed a pure neceſſity on his Majeſty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them. The Chriſtian ſojors received as much,
yea more hurt from them, then from the Turks. And
none were aſſured of their lives, where they were
ſtrongeſt. Our horſes, yea our men ſtarved for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
in regard none could go abroad to fetch either
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52894:66"/>
proviant or fodderage, without whole Regiments to
guard them. I have ſeen letters writ by the Officers
of our armies, wherein they complained, that the
throats of moſt of their ſervants were cut by thoſe for
whoſe ſafety they were generouſly expoſing their
lives. Many French in their return from this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
have told me, that theſe of them who went ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo little aſtray, or who ſtraggled, were preſently
ſacrificed to the fury of that mercileſs people. And
that amongſt them, it was accounted a crime to be
well cloathed, or to look like men that had money.
It will be anſwered, that ſojors, though friends are
inſupportable to the inhabitants of any Countrey
which is the ſeat of the war, that they take with ſtrong
hand, not only what is neceſſare for their ſubſiſtence,
but much more, and ſo robs the people of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they ſhould maintain themſelves and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and conſequently drives them to diſpair, from
whence proceeds theſe exceſſes whereof I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
Let us grant all this to be true, and let us add to
it, that the orders of his Imperial Majeſty have been
ill obſerved; and that the Officers of his armies wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
bread to give their ſojors, were conſtrained to
ſlack the reins of diſcipline, and to permit them to do
that which is diſcharged by the Military Laws of the
moſt licencious war. Let it be granted, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
were as high as they can be imagined to be,
and that it was impoſſible for the ſojors to do worſe
then they did; it cannot be denyed, that the greater
miſchiefs the war drew upon that misfortunate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
the leſs reaſon the Emperor had to continue it:
And the more hurt the Hungarians ſuffered by the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52894:67"/>
war, the leſs reaſon they have to complain of the
Peace. This Peace hath taken a thorn out of their
foot, and hath freed his Majeſty from the misfortune
to ſee his friends and his ſubjects made the objects of
their diſpair. Some will ſay, that by this Peace this
people have loſt a part of that they had in Hungary,
whereas they hoped to have recovered by the war
what they had loſt, and this ſad conſideration hath
put tears in their eyes, and mournful complaints in
their mouthes. I confeſs, they have reaſon to bewail
their loſſes, and that all Chriſtians ſhould pitty the
wretched Hungarians, and be ſory they are no more
the Bulwark of Chriſtendom, and the terror of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.
He muſt have a heart of Marble, who will not
be grieved for the loſſes Jeſus Chriſt ſuffers, and the
advantages Mahomet gains. He muſt be a brute,
who hath not a kindneſs for the warlike people of
Hungary. The Hungarians are volage and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant;
but they are Chriſtians. They have often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to their own miſery, both by their malice,
and their inadvertency; but they are Chriſtians. They
have often called in the Mahometans to aſſiſt them
againſt their lawful Kings; but they are Chriſtians.
And though they had done worſe then all that, I
ſhould ſtill bewail their misfortunes, becauſe they are
Chriſtians. And I do believe, though we be in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
condition then the Hungarians, yet we are not
better men. But the time of their deliverance is not
yet comd: and we do but yet expect the ruine of the
Turks Empire. We hope notwithſtanding that ſo
great a deliverance is not far of. And we know aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly,
that our hopes ſhal not prove vain. The Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52894:67"/>
Monarchy hath no more priviledges, then theſe
who have been before it. And the Hungarians will
be unhappy in no higher meaſure, then others who
have called upon the Name of JESUS. God grant
it be ſoon that this afflicted Nation, and we who are
pertakers of their affliction, may have occaſion to
wipe the tears from our eyes, and to rejoyce when
we ſee the Almighty hath a care of his own people,
and delivers them from the oppreſſion of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
To him alone belongs honor and glory for
evermore.</p>
