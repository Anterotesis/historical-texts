         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in the ſame myght be more feruenter &amp; ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyſhed, to the whyche thynge I praye God to ſende his grace &amp; to helpe, for it is greatly neceſſary: ſeynge that in the perſone of ſo great a prince, the whych beynge wythdraw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>en fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelfe, is gouerned by Gods grace, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaluacion of many one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſyſteth: &amp; agayne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perdicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and damnacion of many one yf he beynge permitted to hymſelfe, is gyded with out grace. For though it be ſayd of al mens hartes: that the kynges harte is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hande of God, whych can wende it where it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth hym: yet is it not for nought ſayd of kyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges and prynces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Where by God wyll beate hys feare in the ſuperiours, that ſo they may learne and be ſure, that they can not once thynke ought in theyr mynde, wythout God do geue it ſeuerally in theyr myndes. The dede of other men doth ether hurte or profit only them, or a fewe beſyde: but princes and ſuperiours only be ſet in that rowme, that they ether profyte or hynder ſo many more, as theyr dominion doth reach farther. For the whych cauſe doth ſcripture call the godly and fearynge God princes, angels of God, yee goddes alſo, as in the .vii. chap. of Exo: I haue made the a God ouer Pharao. And in the .xxii. Chapter: Thou ſhalte not ſpeake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell

of the Goddes. And agayne, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wycked &amp; vngodly princes ſhe calleth Lions, Draggo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and furious beaſtes: whom God alſo calleth one of hys .iiii. plages whan he rehearſeth them, namely: peſtilence, derth, warre and furious beaſtes. Becauſe then that the hart of man, beynge naturall, fleſhe and bloude doth preſume euery thynge lyghtely, &amp; coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth therby dominion, ryches &amp; honoure, he is ſteared out of reaſon by ſuche occaſion to a raſh tranquillite and reſte, ſo that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth God, and careth nothynge for hys ſubiectes, and vſynge the brydle to hys plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſynnynge, he beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth a wodde &amp; fu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious beaſte. It chaunceth alſo, that a prince takynge hys pleaſure only, and vſynge hys affeccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, by name he is a lorde, but in dede he is a beaſte, ſo that it was well ſayde of Bias one of the ſeuen ſages of Grece: <hi>Magiſtratus uirum oſtendit,</hi> that is: Autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite or rule of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munalte declareth what a man is. For dominion doth vtter a man what he is, ſeynge alſo that the commune people darre not wythſtande for feare of punyſhment the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes of theyr heades, though they were wycked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlye. For thys cauſe ought the ſuperiours greatly to drede God, ſeynge they nede to
<pb facs="tcp:1149:4"/>
feare men ſo lytle, and to knowe hym &amp; hys workes perfectly, and wyth greate care and diligence to walke and exercyſe hymſelfe therin, as Paul doth exhorte in the .xii. chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter to the Romaynes, ſayenge: Let hym that ruleth, be diligent.</p>
            <p>Moreouer ther is nothynge in all the ſcripture that doth ſo greatly concerne the ſuperiorite, as thys mooſt holy ſonge of the bleſſed virgyne &amp; mother of God, the which ought to be well learned and exercyſed of all them that wyll rule well and be good go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uernours.

               <p>But the worlde &amp; mans eyen do the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they loke only aboue themſelues, they wyll mount on hygh as Salomon ſayeth: Pro. xxx.

               <p>And for thys cauſe doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſyght of God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Out of thys grounde now ſpryngeth loue and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prayſe of God: for noma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thanke and prayſe God, without he fyrſt loue hym: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may ony ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loue hym without he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe &amp; knowlege hym in the beſt &amp; ſyncereſt maner he can.

               <p>For thys cauſe alſo hath God charged vs all with death, and the croſſe of Chriſte, and with innumerable paynes and ſufferynges, charged hys ryght welbeloued chylderen the Chriſtians, ſufferynge them ſomtyme to fall in ſynne, that he maye ſe ſo much the deper, that he maye helpe many, worke muche, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynge hymſelfe a true creatoure thereby, that he maye knowe hymſelfe thereby, and maye cauſe hymſelfe to be louynge and mooſte laudable.

ſuche notable prouynge, full knowlege, loue and prayſe of God foreuer, as ſayeth the .xv. Pſalme: Thou ſhalt make me full of ioye wyth thy countenaunce. (that is,) That he ſeyth and knowlegeth the.

               <p>Lykewyſe alſo doth here the beloued mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſte, which wyth the enſample of hyr prouynge, and wyth hyr wordes, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs how we ſhulde knowlege, loue and prayſe God. For ſeynge ſhe reioyceth and thanketh God here wyth a ioyfull and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge ſprete, that he hath loked vpon her, though ſhe were lowlye and nothynge in hyr owne and mens ſyghte: therfore is it to be beleued that ſhe hath had ſymple frendes poore, and rather of the loweſt ſorte. And thys wyll we now ſo ſaye, becauſe of them that be ſymple and of the loweſt ſorte them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. At Ieruſalem doutleſſe were the doughters of the hyghe preſtes, and of the counſellers, fayre, yonge and bewtyfull vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines taught and brought vp after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mooſte honeſt maner before all the contry, as nowe

               <p>For thus prophecyed Eſaye in hys .xi. chapter: Ther ſhall a rodde come forth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynred of Ieſſe, and a bloſſome out of hys rodde, and the ſprete of the <hi>LORD</hi> ſhal lyght vpon it. The ſtocke and roote of the kynred of Ieſſe or Dauid is the virgine Mary, the rodde and bloſſome is Chriſte. Now lyke as it is not ſene, yee incredible that out of a ſeere and rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtocke or roote ſhulde growe a fayre rodde or bloſſome: euen ſo was it not to be loked for nor lykely, that Mary the vir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gine ſhulde be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother of ſuch a chylde. For I thynke Mary was not called a ſtocke and a roote therfore only, becauſe that aboue na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture &amp; vnſtayned flore of hyr maydenheade ſhe became a mother, as it is alſo aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:1149:8"/>
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> a rodde ſhuld ſpringe of a dead blocke: But alſo becauſe that ſhe was of a kynglye ſtocke and of Dauids kynred, which was ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But at the laſte, whan Chriſte ſhulde come, dyd the hygh preſtes vſurpe and take to themſelues that dignite, hauyng the rule alone, and the kyngly progeny or kynred was falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to extreme prouerte, and deſpyſed as a deade blocke, ſo that ther was no hope nor lokynge for more, that ony kyng of great worſhyp and renowne ſhulde ſprynge of it.

Euen as it chaunceth alſo vnto them that be endued wyth godly ſwete<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe and ſprete: ſo that they fele more, than they can vtter and expreſſe wyth wordes. For it not mans worke to geue thankes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God wyth ioye. It is rather a ioyfull mynde, and the only worke of God, the whiche is not perceaued by vtteraunce, but by experience, as ſayeth Dauid in the .xxxiii. Pſalme: Tayſte and ſe how good the <hi>LORDE</hi> is, happy is the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that truſteth in hym. He ſayeth fyrſte: Tayſte, and than ſe, becauſe he can not be knowen wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a mans owne experience: wher vnto neuertheleſſe noman commeth, wythoute he do wholye and fullye truſte in God, whan he is into the depthe and anguyſhe:
<pb facs="tcp:1149:9"/>
and for thys cauſe doth he adde continently and ſayeth: Happy is the man that truſteth in hym. For ſuch one ſhall perceaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worke of God in hymſelfe, and by thys waye he ſhall come to the perceaueable ſweteneſſe, and therby come to all vnderſtandynge, and knowlege.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs marke &amp; weye euery worde in order: The fyrſt is, <hi>My ſoule.</hi> Scripture dealeth man in thre partes, as Paule the fyrſt to the Teſſalonians the laſt Chapter ſayeth: The very God of peace, ſanctifye you thorow out. And I praye God that your whole ſprete, ſoule and body be kepte blame<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſſe vnto the commynge of our <hi>LORDE.</hi> And euery one of theſe thre, wyth al the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is agayne dealte another waye in two, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely: the fleſhe, and the ſprete. The whyche particion is not of the nature, but of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge or properneſſe. That is to ſay: Nature path .iii. partes, namely: the ſprete, the ſoule, and the body, and all thre maye altogether, be ether good or bad, and is than called the ſprete and the fleſhe, wherof we wyll not ſpeake at thys tyme.</p>
                  <p>The fyrſt part (that is) the ſprete, is the mooſt excellente, the depeſt and the mooſte nobleſt parte of man, wherewyth he is apte
<pb facs="tcp:1149:10"/>
to vnderſtande incomprehenſible, inuiſible and eternall thynges: and to be ſhorte, it is the houſe wherin fayth and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of God are conteyned, wherof Dauid ſpeaketh in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> L. pſalme ſayenge: <hi>LORDE</hi> renewe a ryght ſprete in myne intrayles, that is, a ſtrayght and not bowed fayth. And agayn in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .lxxvii. pſal. ſpeakyng of the vnfaythful, he ſayeth: A frowarde &amp; ouerthwart generacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a genera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion that ſet not theyr harte aryght, &amp; whoſe ſprete was not true towarde God.</p>
                  <p>The ſeconde part, the ſoule; is euen the ſame ſprete after the nature, but after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther operacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Namely, in that it quyckeneth the body and worketh by the ſame, and is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes taken in ſcripture for lyfe. For the ſprete maye lyue well ynough wythout the body, but ſo maye not the body. Thys parte ſe we alſo that euen as we ſlepe it doth lyue and worke wythout ony ceaſſynge. And hys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicion or properte is not to perceaue thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges that be incomprehenſible, but ſuche, as reaſon can haue knowlege of and meaſure: And reaſon is the chefe lyght in thys houſe. Yee wythout the ſprete beynge lyghtened wyth fayth, or a greater lyght do rule &amp; gyde thys lyght of reaſon, it can not be wythoute errour: for it is to vyle, to beare ony ſwynge
<pb facs="tcp:1149:10"/>
in godly buſyneſſe. Vnto theſe two partes doth ſcripture attribute much: but chefelye wyſedome and knowlege: wyſedome vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſprete, and knowlege vnto the ſoule. Beſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des theſe attributeth it alſo, hate, loue, plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure, lothſomnes, and ſuch lyke.</p>
                  <p>The thyrde is the body wyth hys mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bres, whoſe workes are mere exercyſe &amp; vſe of ſuch thynges as the ſoule knoweth, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſprete doth beleue. And to confirme thys by a wytneſſe of the ſcripture: Moſes made a Tabernacle with a threfolde and ſeuerall manſion: The fyrſt was called <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum,</hi> in the which God dwelled, and this had no lyght. The ſecond was called <hi>Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> wherin was the candelſticke wyth the ſeuen ſhaftes and lampes. The thyrde was called <hi>the forecourte,</hi> whych was vnder the open ſkye, and bare to the Sonne beames. In thys fygure is euery Chriſten man feat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribed: For hys ſprete is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sanctu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is, the mooſt holy, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dwellyng of God in a ſecrete &amp; (as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> myght ſay) in a darke fayth: for he beleueth it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not perceaue with his eyeſyght, nother feleth, nor yet doth comprehende. The Soule is the Sanctum, (that is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy) there be the .vii. lampes, that is, all maner of vnderſtandynge, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and knowlege of corporal &amp; viſible thynges.
<pb facs="tcp:1149:11"/>
The bodye is the forecourte, whych is bare to euery man, ſo that they maye ſe what he doth, and how he lyueth.</p>
                  <p>Therfore now prayeth Paule &amp; ſayeth: The very God of peace ſanctifye you tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout. Not only in one parte; but thorowe out, that the ſprete, ſoule, bodye, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be holy. Here were many thynges to be ſpoken, of the cauſe of thys prayer, but I wyl brefely rehearſe ſome of them: Yf the ſprete be not holy, ther ſhall nothynge els be holy. Than is the mooſt ieoperdy and buſyneſſe in the holyneſſe of the ſprete, whych conſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth only in a pure fayth: that is, yf y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſprete be not combred wyth comprehenſible thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as it is ſayd. In the meane tyme than come falſe teachers, whych entyſe the ſprete forth of it, whan the one ſeketh to be ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by theſe workes, another by that waye and maner. Yf the ſprete be not here wel pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyded and wyſe, then falleth it out and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to leane vpon outward workes &amp; coſtumes, whereby it imagineth to be ſaued.

Euen ſo ſheweth Mary wherof hyr ſonge of prayſe ſhall ſynge and treate, namely: of the renowmed &amp; excellent workes of God, the comforte of our fayth, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lowly and to fraye all the hygheſt of the earth.

Surely than muſte he not onlye beleue that God can, and knoweth how to helpe hym, but alſo that he wyl helpe hym: where a ſtraunge and an vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpeakeable thynge muſt be done, namelye, that he delyuered from the death euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtynge, do beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me the chylde of ſaluacion, &amp; the ſonne and heyre of God. Thys fayth (as wytneſſeth Chriſte hymſelfe) is able to do all thynges. Thys fayth doth abyde, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the knowlege of the godly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, from thence into the loue of God, and forthe from thence into the prayſynge and thankynge of God: ſo that a man doth than make much of God, and conceaue a good opinion of hym.</p>
                  <p>For God in his nature is not magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed of vs, ſeynge he is immutable, but in oure knowlege and mynde: that is, yf we
<pb facs="tcp:1149:13"/>
holde muche of hym, or ſet muche by hym, ſpecially for hys godneſſe and mercy. For thys cauſe doth not the bleſſed mother ſay: My voyce, my mouthe, myne handes, my thoughtes, nor my reaſon and wyll do mag<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifye the <hi>LORDE,</hi> (for ther are manye one, that prayſe God wyth loude voyce, prayſynge and preachynge hym with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe and godlye wordes, ſpeakynge, diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge, wrytynge and payntynge muche of hym, and alſo many that haue greate medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacions, and by the gyde of reaſon haue greate ſearchynges of hym: fynally ther are ſome that wyth fayned religion and in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tente make muche of hym.) but ſhe ſayeth of thys wyſe: <hi>My ſoule magnifyeth God,</hi> (that is) my whole lyfe, ſenſes, and powers haue a greate opinion of God: ſo that as though ſhe were rauyſhed vp to hym, ſhe felte ſome rayſynge and rauyſhynge in hys goodneſſe, the whiche the verſe followynge doth declare. Of thys wyſe ſe we alſo, that yf ony man doth vs good, that euen all our wyttes be moued and bended to hym, ſo that we ſaye Oh how greate and good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion do I conceaue of thys man? And euen thys is the verye ſygnifycacion of the ſayenge: <hi>My ſoule magnifyeth the Lorde.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:1149:13"/>
Howe muche more ſhall ſuche lyuelye ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge be cauſed, what tyme as we perceaue the goodneſſe of God, the whyche is verye greate in hys workes, ſo that euen wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and thoughtes ſhal fayle, and the whole lyfe and ſoule ſhall be neceſſarelye ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and euen as though all that is quycke and lyuely in vs wolde ſynge and prayſe God.</p>
                  <p>Now are ther two falſe ſpretes, whiche can not ſynge the <hi>Magnificat</hi> aryght: The fyrſte that prayſe not God before he haue fyrſte done them good, as Dauid ſayeth: They ſhall prayſe the whan than haſt done good vnto them. Theſe ſeme to prayſe God very earneſtly, but ſeynge they neuer wyll ſuffre the depth, the makynge lowe,, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duynge, they can neuer fele and perceaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ryght wayes of the <hi>LORDE,</hi> and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently nother loue nor prayſe God truly. Hereby commeth it that the worlde now a dayes is full of diuine ſeruices (as they call them) and laudes, wyth ſyngynge, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge, playenge on the organes and other inſtrumentes of muſike: Yee and this ſonge of prayſe called <hi>Magnificat</hi> alſo. But thys is to be pytyed, namely, that ſo precious a ſonge is handled ſo vnfrutefully &amp; wythoute pyth
<pb facs="tcp:1149:14"/>
of vs, the which we do not ſynge, wythoute all thynges go well wyth vs: for yf ony myſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chaunce do happen vnto vs, than hath oure ſyngynge an ende, nother is ther ony re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde or eſtimacion more of God, thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge that nother he can nor wyll worke wyth vs, and therfore haue both ſyngynge, and the Magnificat alſo done wyth vs.</p>
                  <p>The other be yet more peryllous, which leane to the other ſyde, the which be proude of the gyftes of God, and do not thanke the pure wyll of God for it, wyllyng parte both of the prayſe and hygh eſtimacion to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed vnto themſelues. Such wyll be ſene aboue other, and beholdyng the great good that God hathe done wyth them, ſtomble thereat, vſynge it as theyr owne, auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cyng and heauynge themſelues aboue ſuche as haue not thoſe gyftes, as though they were ſome ſtraunge or peculiare thynge. Thys veryly is a brykle and yeoperdous hauen for ſhyppes, it is a daungerous eſtate. The gyftes of God be ſuche that they make men proude &amp; to ſtande in theyr owne conceate and opinion: and therfore it is requyred that the laſte worde be conſydered, namely, <hi>the Lorde.</hi> For Mary ſayethe not: My ſoule magnifyeth herſelfe, or ſetteth greate
<pb facs="tcp:1149:14"/>
pryce by herſefe, yee ſhe wold haue nothyng to be holden of her: but ſhe doth exalte and lyfte vp God only, vnto hym ſhe geueth glory, robbynge herſelfe thereof, and aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth and referreth all thynges vnto hym. And though ſhe perceaued the mooſt plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous workes of God in herſelfe, yet was ſhe of that mynde and abode therin, that ſhe dyd not exalte herſelfe aboue the mooſt vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and pooreſte man on earth: and yf ſhe had done ſo, than hadde ſhe fallen wyth Lucifer into the loweſt bottome of hell.</p>
                  <p>Nother hath ſhe thought otherwyſe than yf ſuche goodneſſe of God hadde hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vnto another handmayden, ſhe wold haue ben euen as wel content, &amp; wyſh it her ſo well, as herſelfe: yee ſhe hath cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnworthy, &amp; al other worthy of ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure, nother wold ſhe finally haue ben miſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>content yf God takynge agayn fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her ſuch gyftes, had geuen them vnto another in hyr preſence. So lytell dyd ſhe drawe all thys to herſelfe, and left Gods gyftes fre, whole and proper to hymſelfe, vſynge herſelfe as a glad hoſpitall and a gladde ooſteſſe of ſuche a geſte: and therfore hath ſhe alſo kepte it foreuer. Lo thys is ſayde to magnifye God, of thys wyſe to haue a great opinion and
<pb facs="tcp:1149:15"/>
hyghe eſtimacion of hym, and of vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge.</p>
                  <p>Hereby now is it euident in what greate yeopardy of fallynge and ſynnynge ſhe was, ſo that it is no leſſe maruayll how ſhe dyd ſo refrayne herſelfe that ſhe dyd not pryde and ſwell for the exceadynge plentye of goodes, nother dyd aſcribe ought to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: than that ſhe dyd receaue them. Thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keſt thou not that to be a wonderous harte? She ſeyeth herſelfe a mother of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited farre aboue all men: yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe doth ſhe remayne in that lowlyneſſe, ſimplicite, vpryghtneſſe and courteouſy that ſhe hath not counted the leeſt handmay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den to be vnder her. O we mooſt wretches, whome yf a fewe goodes, a lytle authorite or honoure, or a lytle more bewty than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do befall can not counte vs equal with them of the lower ſorte: nother ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we make an ende of ſuche opinion and ſtandynge in oure owne conceate: what wolde we do yf we had great and hygh gyftes?</p>
                  <p>Wherfore God letteth vs remayne ſtyll in pouerte and wantynge, becauſe we kepe not hys bewtyfull goodes vndefyled, &amp; can vſe vs as we dyd before we dyd receaue them. But we let oure myndes increaſe
<pb facs="tcp:1149:15"/>
or decreaſe, as the goodes ether growe or minyſh. But the harte of the virgine Mary remayneth euer ſtedfaſte in one mynde and equalite, ſhe letteth God worke in her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge to hys wyll and pleaſure, takynge therby nomore ſaue an earneſt conſolacion, ioye and truſte to Godwarde, and euen ſo ought we to do alſo: for that were truely to ſynge the <hi>Magnificat.</hi>

all Gods gyftes, lettynge hym to geue more, and to worke more luckelye wyth them. Wherof let vs heare a proper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſample:</p>
                  <p>A certayne honeſt woman and fearyng God dyd ſe .iii. virgins ſyttyng by an altare, and at maſſynge tyme, a goodly boye lepte from the altare vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrſt virgyne, vſynge her very frendly, claſpynge her aboute the necke, and ſmylynge vpon her. After that wente he to the ſeconde, but he dyd not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue hymſelfe ſo familiarly to her, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he lyfte vp hyr vayle, and ſmyled vpon her. Vnto the thyrde he ſhewed no ſygne of loue at al, but bet her on the face, haled her by the heere, trode her wyth hys fete, &amp; vſed her very vncourteouſly: and ſodenly lepte a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gayne vpon the altare, &amp; vanyſhed awaye.</p>
                  <p>Then was the interpretacion of that ſyght ſhewed vnto the woman. The fyrſte virgyne ſignifieth the vnclenly ſpretes, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge theyr owne, vnto whome God muſte geue many good thynges, and rather accom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plyſh theyr mynde and wyll, then hys owne, whyche wyll wante nothynge, and euer haue comforte and pleaſure of God, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge ſuffiſed wyth the goodneſſe of God. The ſecond ſygnifieth thoſe ſpretes, whych

haue begonne to ſerue God, and can ſuffre ſome ſcarceneſſe, yet neuertheleſſe are not wythout loue of themſelues and theyr pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte. Vnto them muſte he ſometyme ſhewe a ſmylynge countenaunce, lettynge them aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaye hys goodneſſe, that thereby they myght learne to loue hys bare goodneſſe, and hygh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to prayſe it. The thyrde virgine, poore, wretched and cleane forſaken hath nothyng but myſery &amp; ſmarte, ſhe ſeketh no profyt ſhe is content therwyth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God is good, though ſhe ſhulde neuer aſſaye it (the whych neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe can not be) the ſame abydeth of one faſhion and of both the ſydes, ether to loue or to prayſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goodneſſe of God, as wel wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is felt, as wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not felt: nother doth ſhe fal vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goodes wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they fal to her, nor fal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they fayle. And this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true ſpouſe of Chriſte, whych ſayeth to hym: I wyll not it that thyne is, but thyſelfe: I loue the no better whyle all thynges go proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, than I do hate the whyle it goeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But yf he ſaye thus: I haue no pleaſure to the, beholde, here am I, let hym do wyth me as it pleaſeth hym. O what a pure ſprete was that, whych dyd not ceaſſe to loue, prayſe and to obey the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, no not in extreme neceſſite. Suche ſprete alſo doth the holy mother and virgine Marye ſhewe, whan ſhe ebbynge and flowynge in the myddeſt of al ouerflow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ynge and excellent goodes dyd not ſtomble nor fall at them, nother ſeketh hyr owne, but kepeth hyr ſprete pure and wythout blame in the loue and prayſe of the mere goodneſſe of God, glad and wyllynge to take in good worth, yf God wyll ſpoyle her of the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, and leaue her a poore, naked and fay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lynge ſprete.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:1149:18"/>Moreouer as it is more ieopardous to refrayne hymſelfe in wealth, ryches &amp; great worſhips, than in pouerte, ſhame and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſſe, ſeynge ryches myniſtre great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to wyckedneſſe: euen ſo is thys pure and wonderfull ſprete of Mary ſo muche more to be allowed, that ſhe beynge endued wyth ſo exceadyng hygh honoures, doth not for all them ſet vp hyr combe, behauyng her ſelfe as though ſhe ſawe it not, remaynynge ſtrayght &amp; ryght in the hygh waye, leanynge to the goodneſſe of God only, the whych ſhe nother feleth nor ſeyth, ſettynge lytle ſtore by ſuch goodes as ſhe feleth, nor taking plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure in them, nother ſekynge it that is hyr owne, ſo that out of a true and ryght funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe doth ſynge: <hi>My ſprete reioyceth in God my Saueour.</hi> It is truly a ſpret that ſpryngeth of fayth only, and reioyceth not for the goods of God whych the bleſſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine dyd fele, but for God onely, whom ſhe felte not, and is glad of hyr ſaluacion, whych ſhe now knewe by fayth. Theſe lo are the true, lowly, empty, and hungry ſpretes, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whych we ſhall ſhortly ſpeake.</p>
                  <p>By thys now maye we knowe &amp; iudge how ful thys preſent worlde is of falſe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and ſayntes, whych do beate in much
<pb facs="tcp:1149:19"/>
of good workes vnto the ſymple people. And though ther be fewe that preach earneſtlye the very thynge, namely, how good workes ought to be done, (for many one do preache mans tradicions and workes, that they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For they teach good workes and the wholſome lyuynge, not for the mere goodneſſe of God, but for theyr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage. For yf ther were no heauen nor no hell, and yf they loked for no grace of the goodneſſe of God, they ſhulde ſoone leaue the goodes of God vnloued and vnprayſed. Thoſe are ſekers of themſelues, hyrelinges, bondmen, ſtraungers and not heyres, which make an Idoll of themſelues, and aſke loue and prayſe of God, wyllyng God to do that vnto them, that they neceſſarylye ſhulde do vnto hym. They haue no ſprete. Nother is God theyr Saueoure, but Gods gyftes ſaue them, where wyth he muſte ſerue them as a ſeruaunte. They be the chylderen of Iſraell, vnto whom it ſuffiſed not to be fedde wyth heauenly Manna, but luſted alſo after fleſhe, onyons and garlyke: and as they pery<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhed,

and attayned not the londe of promyſe, ſo ſhall ſuch falſe ſpretes do alſo.</p>
                  <p>Now (God amende it) is all the worlde, all cloyſters and temples full of ſuche kynde of men, whyche all throughe falſe, wycked and croked ſpretes do walke, driue, chaſe and heaue good workes ſo hygh, that finally they imagyn to deſerue heauen by them: where before all thynges the goodneſſe of God ſhulde haue bene declared.

Only God doth knowe, iudge and open the lowe degre or lowlyneſſe, ſo that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth leſſe of it, than whan he is mooſt lowly.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of ſcripture is to call <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are</hi> to caſt downe, to preaſſe downe and to brynge to nought: wherfore Chriſten men alſo in ſome place of the ſcripture are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led poore, vyle and brought lowe, as in the .C.xiiii. Pſalme: I was brought downe, &amp; he helped me. <hi>Humilite</hi> than is nothynge ſaue a deſpyſed, vyle, depreſſed or caſt down thynge or eſtate: of the which kynde are the nedy, ſycke, hongry, thyrſty, preſoners, trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bled &amp; dyenge creatures: as Iob wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was proued, Dauid as he was chaced &amp; dryuen out of hys realme, and Chriſte wyth all the true Chriſtians in theyr nede. And thys is the depth, whereof we haue ſpoken before, namely: that the eyes of the <hi>LORDE</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the depthes, but mans eyen loke only in the heyghte: that is, the outwarde appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
<pb facs="tcp:1149:21"/>
and ſhynynge eſtate or condicion. And for this cauſe is Ieruſalem called a citie where vpon Gods eyen do beholde. After thys maner lyeth the Chriſten congregacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or church in the depth, and is of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the worlde: wherfore God doth loke vpon it, and wendeth hys ſyghte alway vpon the ſame, as Dauid wytneſſeth in the xxxi. Pſalme, ſpeakynge in the perſone of God: I wyll enfourme the and ſhew the the waye wherein thou ſhalt go, I wyll faſten myn eyes vpon the.</p>
                  <p>Of lyke faſhion ſpeaketh. Paule .i.

By thys mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes maketh God the worlde folyſh, with all hys wyſedome and ſtrengthe, and geueth another wyſedome and power. Seyng than that thys is the mynd of God, to loke down<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde, and to the thynges that are nothyng therfore haue I englyſhed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word <hi>Humilitas</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:1149:21"/>
for a thynge of no price or regarde, ſo that thys be the mynde of Mary: God hath wen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded his eyen vpon me that ame a poore, vyle and a mayden of no regarde, which myghte eaſyly haue founde ryche, renowned, noble quenes and of great lynage, ether myght he haue choſen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doughters of prynces &amp; great eſtates, yee he myght haue choſen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Annas or Cayphas rulers of thys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Thus haue we now ſufficiently ſhewed here aboue, how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy virgine vnloked for is come to thys honoure, out of a deſpyſed eſtate: and how God hath ſo graciouſly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon her.

Wherfore they that ſaye ſhe dyd not auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hyr virginite, but hyr lowlyneſſe, do her in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iury. For ſhe nother dyd auaunce hyr virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, nor lowlyneſſe, but the only, the godly and gracious ſyghte of God.

                  <p>But that the wronge opinion maye be auoyded, and the true lowlyneſſe maye be knowen from the fayned, we wyll make a lytle digreſſion, and treate of humilite or lowlyneſſe: for many one haue erred not a lytle therin.</p>

                     <hi>Humilite</hi> do we cal communely a wyl to ſmal and deſpyſed thynges.

myght be counted and eſtimed greate, rych, learned, holy, yee alſo God, as ſuch that loue to be conuerſaunte in lowly thynges. But yf they knewe, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dyd not ſet thereby, they wolde ryght ſoone leaue them. Thys is a fayned lowlyneſſe, for theyr wycked eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth nought ſaue the rewarde, auayle and prayſe of humilite. Nother beholde they the vyle thynges, not lokynge for rewarde and profite, nomore than a kooke doth to rooſt meate that doth not droppe: wherfore whan the rewarde and prayſe do nomore appeare, than hath humilite done with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <p>They that be lowly in dede, turne not theyr eyen to the rewarde and prayſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milite, but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a ſimpel hart do they beholde the vyle thynges, beynge glad to be occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſame, nother do they at ony tyme perceaue theyr lowlyneſſe. Here ſpryngeth the water out of the fountayne, here follow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:1149:24"/>
it of hys owne ſwynge, wherfore they do vſe vyle veſtures, geſtures, wordes, places and perſones, though they do euery where ſhone gorgious and hyghe thynges: which thynge Dauid alſo wytneſſeth in the .C.xxix. Pſal. ſayenge: <hi>LORDE</hi> I ame not hygh myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I haue no proude lokes. &amp;c. And Iob in the .xxii. chapter: Whoſo humbleth hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſhalbe ſet vp: and whoſo loketh mekely, ſhalbe healed. Hereby commeth that vnto ſuch doth honoure befal vnwares, and theyr heauynge vp wythoute foreknowlege or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberacion. For they were content wyth theyr lowe eſtate and ſimple condicion, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought they once vpon hygh thynges. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayned lowly maruayle greatly that theyr exaltacion &amp; honoure taryeth ſo longe, nother is theyr falſe and fayned pryde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente with theyr vyle condicion, but ſecretly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſydereth hygher eſtates in theyr myndes.</p>
                  <p>Therfore dyd I ſaye that true humilite or lowlynes doth not at ony tyme perceaue that ſhe is lowly, (for yf ſhe dyd knowe it, ſhe wolde be proude wyth the ſyghte of ſo greate a vertue) but wyth harte, mynde and all hyr wyttes is ſhe pyght vpon ſleghte and lowly thynges, whiche alwaye preſente themſelues to hyr ſyghte. Theſe are hyr
<pb facs="tcp:1149:24"/>
images, wherein ſhe hath hyr conuerſacion and paſtyme: and as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge as ſhe hath them in ſyghte, ſo longe can not ſhe beholde herſelfe nor be combred with herſelfe: much leſſe be rauyſhed and haue pleaſure in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placion and ſyghte of hygh and greate thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or geue hyr mynde therto. For thys cauſe than muſt the honoure and dignite be fall vnto her vnwares, &amp; fynde her in though<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes cleue contrary to honoures and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes: for after thys maner doth Luke ſaye, that the Angels gretynge was ſtraunge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the virgine, for it came ſodenly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loked for. Yf theſame gretynge hadde chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vnto Cayphas doughter, ſhe wolde not haue thought: What maner of gretynge is thys, but wolde ſoone haue accepted it, and wolde haue ſayde wythin herſelfe: Ah howe well and happely doth thys befall?</p>
                  <p>And agayne fayned lowlyneſſe doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer know that ſhe is proud: for yf ſhe dyd, ſhe ſhulde quickely be refrayned wyth the ſyght of the haynous faute, but ſhe faſteneth hyr harte, mynde and thoughte vpon hyghe thynges, the whyche ſhe hath in ſyght wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute ceaſſynge. Theſe are hyr ymages, wherewyth ſhe is alwaye combred, and as longe as ſhe ſetteth hyr mynde on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb facs="tcp:1149:25"/>
nother beholde nor conſydre herſelfe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the honoure commeth nother vnwares nor vnthought vpon, for it fyndeth though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes therto agreynge: but ſhame and enpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueryſhynge come vnloked for vnto ſuch: for they were mynded to ſayle with another &amp; more luckelyer wynde.</p>
                  <p>For thys cauſe is it not good to learne lowlyneſſe after thys maner, that he haue in ſyghte and imagine vyle and deſpyſed thynges or perſons. Nother contrarywyſe waxeth ony man proude becauſe he ſeyeth hygh and greate thynges. The images are not to be auoyded, but the eye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt be wee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned therefrom. As longe as we lyue vpon earth, we muſt lyue both wyth the hygh and lowe thynges or eſtates: but (as Chriſt ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) the eye muſt be put out. Geneſis the .iii chapter ſayeth not Moſes, that Adam and Eue ſawe other thynges after the preuari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they dyd ſe before it, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr eyen were opened, that they myght ſe theyr nakedneſſe, where as they were naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo, and yet dyd not conſyder it. The quene Heſter dyd weare a verye coſtlye crowne vpon hyr heade, yet dyd it ſeme but a ſtayned cloth in hyr ſyght. Here were not the hygh images taken away from her, but
<pb facs="tcp:1149:25"/>
rather were ſet before her, as vnto a mooſte puiſſaunt quene, and no ſleyght or vyle thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges were before her: but the ſyght was wen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded therfrom, and hyr harte and mynde dyd not beholde the hye thynges and gloriouſe: Wherfore God wroughte alſo ſtraungely wyth her. After thys faſhion muſt not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde thynges be altered, but we muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tered in our mynde and wyttes: for tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal we eaſely learne to deſpyſe and flye hyghe thynges, to ſet much by and to ſeke ſleyght &amp; lowly thynges. For there is humilite or low<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyneſſe founde and ſtedfaſt for all chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, &amp; yet neuer are ware of it. This is done with delyte and the harte remayneth alwaye one and of one faſhion, howſoeuer other thynges do befall or chaunge, ether to the heyghte or depth.</p>
                  <p>But (<hi>LORDE</hi> God) what pryde ſkoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnder the vyleneſſe of clothynge, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and behaueoure? wherof the world now a dayes is full. The whych viſures and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers do ſo ſubmytte themſelues, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wyll be deſpyſed of no man: they do ſo flye honours, that they notwithſtandynge wyll be chaced therwyth: they do ſo ſhone hyghe thynges, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neuertheleſſe they be not myſprai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed, nor theyr poſſeſſions myniſhed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whych
<pb facs="tcp:1149:26"/>
they couet alwayes to haue of the beſt and pycked out. But thys virgine vttereth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge but hyr vyleneſſe, wherin ſhe lyued &amp; abode wyllynglye, ſhe neuer coueted nor thought vpon honoure and heyght, nother dyd ſhe conſyder and behold hyr lowlyneſſe. This humilite is ſo fayre and precious, that ſhe can not abyde hyr owne countenaunce but that image is reſerued vnto the face of God, as wytneſſeth the .C.xii. Pſalme, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge: Who is lyke vnto the <hi>LORDE</hi> oure God that hath hys dwellynge ſo hygh, which humbleth hymſelfe to beholde that is heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and earth. For he that can beholde hys low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe, the ſame can iudge hymſelfe worthy of eternal bleſſe, &amp; ſo were Gods iudgement at an ende, ſeyng we know ſurely that God doth ſaue the lowlyones. Therfore muſte God reſerue and kepe the ſame for hymſelfe to knowe and to iudge, and hyde them from vs wyth the fence of exercyſe in lowly thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, by beholdynge of the whych we alſo do forget ourſelues. To thys now ſerue many perſecucions, deathes &amp; al kynde of trouble on earth, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is trauayle &amp; payne, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>we may put out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falſe &amp; deceatful eye.</p>
                  <p>Thus is it euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto vs by thys word humilite or lowlyneſſe, that Mary the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyne
<pb facs="tcp:1149:26"/>
was a deſpyſed, vyle, and a mayden of no eſtimacion, &amp; in thys lowe degre to haue ſerued God, and not to haue knowen, that hyr low eſtate was much worth before God Whereby we are taught and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted, that though we ought wyllyngly be deſpyſed and brought low, yet ſhuld we not deſpayre ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, as though God dyd hate vs: but rather truſt that he ſhalbe mercyful vnto vs. Only thys ſhal we beware, leſt we be not wyllyng ynough in thys ſubduyng &amp; caſtyng downe, leſt oure wicked eye be to much open, and ſo deceaue vs wyth preuy lokynge vpon hyghe thynges, or ſearchynge out of our pleaſures, wherwyth the humilite or lowlyneſſe do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſh. For what helpeth it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned to be caſt downe to the nedermoſt &amp; loweſt, ſeyng they do not ſuffre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduerſite gladly and wyth a good wyll? And agayne what hurteth it the angels to be hyghly exalted, ſeyng they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue no falſe luſt and preſumpcion therby?</p>
                  <p>Finally, to be ſhorte, thys verſe doth teach vs to know God truly, ſeynge it wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth that God doth behold lowly thynges and perſons. And he knoweth God aryghte, that knoweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth hys eyen to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as we haue ſufficiently declared: &amp; of the ſame knowlege followeth the loue &amp; truſt to
<pb facs="tcp:1149:27"/>
Godwarde, ſo that a man do yelde hymſelfe and followe hym wyllyngly. Of thys haue we a goodly place in the .ix. Chapter of Iere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>my, ſayeng: Let not the wyſeman reioyce in hys wyſedome, nor the ſtronge man in hys ſtrength, nother the rych man in hys riches: But who ſo wyll reioyce, let hym reioyce in thys, that he knoweth and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth me. Thys doth Paule confirme in the .ii. epiſtle to the Corinthians the .xi. Chapter, ſayeng: Let hym that reioyceth, reioyce in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>LORD</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After than that the mother of God had in ſuch wyſe prayſed hir God and Saueour wyth a bare pure ſprete, &amp; aſcribed none of the goodes to herſelfe, and therfore had ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge truly vnto hym of hys goodneſſe: now dothe ſhe fynally and orderlye go to the prayſe of hys workes &amp; goodes. For (as we haue ſayd before) we ought not to ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne headlynges to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goodes of God, nother ought we to aſcribe and drawe them to vs: but by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as by ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes we muſte pearſe vnto the author &amp; cauſe of all goodneſſe, we muſt cleue vnto hym onely, and make much of hym. And after that prayſe and thanke hym in hys workes, wherin he hath ſhewed vs ſuche goodneſſe, that we maye truſte, loue and prayſe hym: ſo that hys workes are nothyng ſaue a great

                  <p>She begynneth fyrſt wyth her ſelfe, and ſyngeth what God hath done for her, wherin ſhe teacheth vs two thynges: Fyrſt, muſte euery man marke diligently what God wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth wyth hym, more than all the workes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he doth wyth other.

Where Paul .i. Corin. iii. ſayeth: that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhalbe rewarded accordynge to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes: ergo not after another mans workes.</p>
                  <p>It myght be ſuffred yf they dyd pray for other, or brought theyr workes as meanes &amp; interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to god. But ſeyng they come to
<pb facs="tcp:1149:28"/>
God therwyth, as wyth ſome gyfte or preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it is a wycked and haynous intent. And (that mooſt abominable is) they deale and geue theyr workes vnto other, the whych neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe they knowe not howe acceptable they be vnto God. For God doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the workes, but the harte and fayth, by the whych he worketh wyth vs. Whereof they do not force, leanynge vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workes only, wyth the whych they do deceaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and other alſo. And ſo farre is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter come, that they perſwade men that be at the poynte of death, to put on a freres ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſayenge: that yf ony ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dye in ſo holy an habyte, al his ſynnes ſhalbe forgeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym, and get eternall bleſſe. Thus do they not on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſaue men wyth ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge good workes, but alſo wyth ſtraunge garmentes. I thynke (yf ther were no hede taken therto) that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell wolde brynge ſuch men ſo farre, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wolde thynke to brynge the people to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyth religious meates, dwellynge, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryenge.

Beware, bewar of wolues, walkyng in ſuch ſhepes clothyng, for they do begyle the &amp; tear the, &amp; thynke that God doth worke with the, &amp; thy ſaluacion, &amp; that by the worke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth in the: nother put thy truſt in ony other as thou ſeyſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy virgine Mary do here.

And no man ſhall truſt vnto other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s workes, wythout the owne &amp; proper workes of God: but wyth great dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce take hede to thyſelfe &amp; Gods workes, euen as though God &amp; thou were one in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth, and though God dyd worke wyth noman but wyth the, and ſo forth loke vpon other mens workes alſo.</p>
                  <p>The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that Mary teacheth, is, that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyl be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrſt in the prayſynge of God, &amp; to recyte the workes done to hym, &amp; after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yrayſe hym alſo in other workes.

<pb facs="tcp:1149:29"/>
prayſe of God, wher euery one prayſeth the grace of another, and his mooſt of al, though he be vyler than another: nother doth he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uete to be the chefe in the goodes, but in the loue and prayſe of God. For euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath ynough of God, &amp; hys mere goodneſſe, how ſlender that euer hys gyfte be, ſo ſymple an harte hath he. But the hypocrites, ſekynge theyr owne auayle loke a ſquynte and playe the luſkes: whych whan they ſe they be not the chefeſt nor beſt in the goodes, they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure in ſteade of prayſe, and ſaye: that they be ether lyke or vnder other, lyke as they dyd wherof we reade Math. xx. that murmured agaynſt the huſbandman, not that he dyd the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wronge, but that he cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the laſt lyke wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy of the dayes hyre wyth them.</p>
                  <p>After thys maner are ther many fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de that do not prayſe the goodneſſe of God, yf they ſe that they haue not receaued ſo much as Peter, or ony of the other ſayntes, ether thys or that holy man alyue on earth: thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge that yf God had geuen them ſo many good gyftes alſo as he hath geuen to other, they wolde prayſe and laude hym lykewyſe, ſettynge it lyght to be endued of God wyth ſuch goodes, as they do not perceaue, as be: the body, lyfe, reaſon, ſubſtaunce, honoures,
<pb facs="tcp:1149:29"/>
frendes, the ſeruice of the Sonne, wyth al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures. The which perſons, yf they had all the goodes that Mary had, yet wolde not they knowlege nor prayſe God in them, For as ſayeth Chriſte Luke .xvi. He that is faythfull in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leeſt, is faythful alſo in much: and he that is vnryghteous in the leeſt, is vnryghteous alſo in muche. Therfore are not they worthy of the greate and much, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe they deſpyſe the ſmall or lytle. Yf they dyd prayſe God in the leeſt, they ſhuld haue abundauntly the greate: wherof the cauſe is they haue theyr ſyghte aboue them, and not vnder them. For yf they had theyr ſyght bowed downwarde, they ſhulde ſe ſome, which perchaunce haue not halfe ſo manye goodes and gyftes, and yet be at reſt and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tente, prayſynge God. A byrde hoppeth for ioye and ſyngeth yf it can, beynge contente wyth it that it poſſeſſeth, and murmureth not becauſe it can not ſpeake. A dogge lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth and waggeth hys tayle, ſhewynge a ioyfull countenaunce, nother is he myſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente that he wanteth reaſon. All maner of beaſtes are contente wyth theyr goodes, &amp; ſerue God wyth theyr endeuoure &amp; prayſe. But the onlye wycked and louynge it ſelfe eye of man is vnſatiable, nother doth it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoure
<pb facs="tcp:1149:30"/>
itſelfe to be ſaciate by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hys vnkyndneſſe and pryde, ſeynge it coueteth euer to be the chefeſt &amp; beſt, preferred aboue other: nother wyll it prayſe and glorify God but rather loke for honoure of hym.</p>
                  <p>Of thys maner do we reade that in the tyme of the councell holden at Conſtaunce in Germany, two Cardinals rydynge vpon coſtlye mules ouer the feldes by the waye, dyd ſe a ſhepeherde ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de wepyng. The one of them a more meker ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and moued wyth pytie, wold not paſſe by hym that was ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, approched to comforte hym, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked fyrſt what hym ayled. The ſhepeherde after he had wepte bytterly, and holden hys peace a greate whyle, ſo that the Cardinall was greued and ſorowfull alſo. At the laſte he ſhewed hym a tode and ſayde: For thys cauſe do I wepe, namely, that God hath ſha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pen and created me ſo fayre a creature, and not lyke thys euell fauoured worme, and that I dyd neuer conſydre thys by myſelfe, nor thanked hym therfore. Of thys was the Cardinall ſo abaſhed, that he fell from hys mule, and was boren in the councell houſe, where he cryed and ſayde: O Auſtine howe truely was it ſayde of the: The vnlearned ryſe vp and take in the kyngdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:1149:30"/>
but we wyth oure learnynge do wander in fleſh and bloude. Now do I thynke that the ſhepeherd was not ſo rych nor fayre, yet dyd he ſo hyghly &amp; earneſtly conſyder the gyftes of God in hym, and rendre thankes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he dyd fynde more in hymſelfe, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he coulde well attayne &amp; perceaue with hys ſyghte.</p>
                  <p>The fyrſte worke of God towarde the holy virgine doth ſhe confeſſe to be the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge vpon her, the which alſo is the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, of the which al the reſte hange &amp; flowe. For yf it be come ſo farre that God wende hys ſyght to ony man to beholde hym, that is nothynge but grace and mercy, and there muſt nedes followe all gyftes and workes. As we reade Gene. iiii. that God dyd loke vpon Abell and hys gyftes, and not ſo vpon Cayn nor hys offerynge. Of thys come the prayers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munely in the pſalter, that God wyll lyghten hys countenaunce vpon vs, and not hyde hys ſyghte, but directe it vpon vs, and ſuch lyke. And that ſhe doth thynke thys to be the chefeſt, ſhe doth ſufficientlye ſhewe, ſayeng: Lo, for thys beholdyng of me ſhall <hi>al chyldes chyldren call me bleſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Marke the wordes, ſhe ſayeth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hyr prayſes ſhall be ſpred abrode, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hyr vertues
<pb facs="tcp:1149:31"/>
ſhalbe commended, that hyr virginite or hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>milite ſhalbe extolled, or that hyr excellente dedes ſhalbe ſonge and vttered wyth ſome ſonge or ballade, but ſhe doth only often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pete and ſaye: that God hath loked vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, and that thereby ſhe ſhalbe called bleſſed. And that is to geue the honoure and prayſe to God ſo holyly and purely, that ther is no thynge more holy nor pure. And therefore poyntynge vpon the beholdynge or lokynge vpon of God, as wyth a fynger ſhe ſayeth: <hi>Beholde from he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce forth novv ſhall they call me bleſſed.</hi> That is, from the tyme that God hathe beholden my vyleneſſe, I ſhalbe called happy. Wherein not ſhe, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God in her is prayſed: yee ſhe is made lytle, and maketh herſelfe lytle, whan ſhe ſayeth that hyr vyleneſſe is loked vpon of God. And for thys cauſe doth ſhe fyrſte auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hyr ſaluacion, before ſhe recyte the workes of God declared toward her, and at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tributeth the lokynge vpon hyr vyleneſſe al together vnto the ſyght of God.</p>
                  <p>By thys now is it euident, &amp; we maye geſſe by thys whyche be the true honoure, wherewyth ſhe muſt be honoured, yf ſhe per chaunce hath nede of it. But howe ſhall we ſaye to her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Loke vpon hir wordes, and they
<pb facs="tcp:1149:31"/>
ſhall teache the to ſaye thus: O thou bleſſed virgine and mother of God, howe vyle and deſpyſed wereſt thou? yet not wythſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge God dyd wende ſo mercyfullye and rychely hys ſyghte towarde the, and hathe wrought great thynges in the, wherof thou wereſt neuer one worthy: and the ouerflo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynge grace of God in the is farre aboue thy deſeruynges. Happy arte thou &amp; bleſſed arte thou from that tyme forth for euer, the which haſt founde ſuch a God. Nother ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ony man to thynke that ſhe wyl not be pleaſed, yf ſhe be ſayde to be vnworthy of ſo greate fauoure: veryly ſhe fayled not, whan ſhe graunted of hyr owne mynde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe was vyle and vnworthy, that God dyd loke vpon her for none of hyr merites or deſeruynge, but of hys mere and only grace.</p>
                  <p>She hath no delyte to heare ſuch vayne ianglers, as both preach and wryte manye thynges of hyr merytes, wherewyth they crake and auaunce theyr greate learnynge: not conſyderyng how greatly they derogate the <hi>Magnificat</hi> accuſe the mother of God of lyenge, and minyſh the grace of God. For ſo much worthy merite as is geuen vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Mary, ſo much is the grace of God rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of, and the virginis ſonge is robbed of
<pb facs="tcp:1149:32"/>
truth. The angell dyd only grete her on the grace of Gods behalfe, and that the <hi>LORD</hi> was wyth her, wherfore ſhe is bleſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge wemen. Wherfore they that attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute her ſo many prayſes and honoures, and let them ſo ſtyck and cleue vpon her, they be not farre from makynge an idol of her: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as though ſhe ought be worthely worſhyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and truſted vnto, where as ſhe doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte and render all vnto God, &amp; wyll haue God to be prayſed in her, labourynge and endeuourynge fynally to cauſe euery man to haue truſte and confidence in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure by hyr enſample.</p>
                  <p>Whoſoeuer therfore wyll honoure the virgine Mary aryght, theſame muſt not ſet her nexte hys harte, and by God, but farre beneth hym, makynge her bare and naked, and ſo (as ſhe ſayeth herſelfe) behold hyr na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kedneſſe. After that muſt he maruayle of the vnſpeakeable and abundaunte grace of God, whyche ſo rychely and bountyfully both loke vpon, loue, and bleſſe ſo vyle, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and deſpyſed a perſone: that ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdynge he be moued to prayſe &amp; loue God in lyke gyftes, and ſo he be occaſioned euer to truſt &amp; to hope ſome greate goodneſſe of God, and that of ſuch a God, as doth not deſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pyſe

the poore, deſpyſed &amp; vyle, but wyteth them ſafe of hys owne ſyghte, that ſo hys harte be ſtablyſhed in fayth, hope and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. What more acceptable thynge ſuppoſe ye can befall vnto her, than that ye come to God by her after this maner, and learne to truſte and hope in God by hyr enſample, whan ye lykewyſe are deſpyſed and ſet at nought, what maner of waye that euer it be, ether in lyfe or death: She wyll not haue the to come to her, but by her to God.</p>
                  <p>Agayne, that ye learne to eſchue al hygh eaſte and condicion, the which euery man enuyronneth to obtayne, ſeynge that God nother fande nor dyd wyll theſame in hys mother. But thoſe paynters and counterfay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters, the whych do ſo paynte and ſet out the bleſſed virgine vnto vs, that ther be no vyle thynge ſene in her, but all excellente thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, what do they els but teach vs to ſet our ſyght on the mother of God, &amp; not her in the ſyght of God: Whereby they do fraye vs, &amp; neareha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de do cauſe vs to deſpayre, &amp; darken vnto vs the ymage full of conſolacion, euen as they do ſtoppe the ſayntes in Lente. For ſeyng ſhe is drawen aboue all enſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trones, ther is nothynge lefte whereof we maye
<pb facs="tcp:1149:33"/>
take ony cooſolacion or cmnforte, where ſhe ought and wyth a good wyl wolde be a prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipall enſample of grace, to ſteare all the world to the grace, loue and prayſe of God, that the hartes of all men myght conceaue ſuch an opinion of her towarde God, which with all confidence myghte ſaye: Ah bleſſed virgine and mother of God, what greate comforte dyd God geue vs by the, becauſe he dyd wyth ſo gracious a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenaunce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde thyn vnworthyneſſe and lowe degre, whereby we are admonyſhed henceforth to truſt, that after thyn enſample he wyll alſo loke vpon vs wretches.</p>
                  <p>Thynkeſt thou not that yf Dauid, S. Peter, Paule, Mary Magdalene and ſuch lyke for the greate grace that they vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely dyd obtayne, are become enſamples to comfirme the Godly fayth and hope, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſed mother of God doth not couet lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe gladly and worthely to be an enſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and patrone vnto all the worlde? But now can not that be for the ſuperfluous blo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wers out of hyr prayſe and vayne ianglers, which do not declare by thys verſe how the abundaunte ryches of God were vnyed and made one wyth hyr ſlender pouerte, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly worſhyppe wyth hyr humilite, the Godly

To the whych in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the lyues and ſayenges of all ſayntes be wrytten alſo. But ther are now a dayes ſome that ſeke helpe and comforte at her, as at ſome God, ſo that I feare me ther raygne more Idolatry in the worlde in oure dayes, than euer dyd. Let thys ſuffiſe at this tyme.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two wordes: <hi>All generacions</hi> do ſignifye as much as: Chyldes chylderen, and it is ſo darkly ſpoken, and ſo profoundly, that ſome haue buſely combred themſelues, thynkynge whych waye thys ſhulde be true, ſeynge that the Iewes, Turkes, Saracens, and other Heythen, beſyde no ſmall nombre of falſe Chriſtians do not only refuſe to cal her bleſſed, but deſpyſe and curſe her. The cauſe of thys is that they vnderſtande the worde <hi>Generacions</hi> of the congregacion of men, wher as it ſtretcheth farther in this place. As namelye: the degrees or membres of the naturall yſſue, where the one euer fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loweth or ſuccedeth another: the father, the ſonne, the coſyn, and ſo forth, whereof euery
<pb facs="tcp:1149:34"/>
membre is called a Generacyon. So that the mynde of the holy virgine, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſe ſayeth that hyr prayſe ſhall laſte from generacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to generacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is, that ther ſhalbe no tyme, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in hyr prayſes ſhall not be publyſhed. And that doth ſhe meane whan ſhe ſayeth: <hi>Lo from henceforth ſhal all generacions,</hi> that is, it begynneth now and ſhall endure in all generacions or kynreds that ſhall ſuccede hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde <hi>to call bleſſed</hi> hath a larger ſygnificacion in the Greke tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it can ſo be expreſſed. For it ſygnifyeth alſo to make happy or bleſſed, ſo that it is not done with tunge only, or wordes, or makyng courteſy, or bowynge of the heade, or vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge of the bonet, or ſettynge vp of ymages or pictures, wyth buyldynge of temples or chappels, the which wycked men can do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: but wyth all thy ſtrengthe, truly and har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tely. And that is done, whan the harte (as it ſayde before) with beholdynge of hyr lowly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and lokynge of the Godly grace vpon her doth conceaue an inwarde ioye and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte towarde God, and ſaye or thynke thus from the very entrayles and bottome of the harte: O how happy is thys virgine? Such bleſſynge is hyr true honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyppe,

The gyfte of God is euerlaſtynge lyfe in oure <hi>LORDE</hi> Ieſu Chriſte. In the goodes geueth he that is hys, but in the ſyght and grace doth he geue hymſelfe.

Where a gracious beholdynge is, there are gyftes alſo, but not contrary wyſe is there a gracious ſyght, where gyftes are. For thys cauſe doth thys verſe or parte of this ſonge duely follow the fyrſt verſe. After thys maner do we reade Geneſis .xxv. that Abraham gaue gyftes vnto the chylderen of the concubines, but vnto Iſaac hys true and lawfull ſonne by Sara hys lawfull wyfe, he gaue the whole heretage.

Whereby ſhe teacheth vs, that the hygher the contemplacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſprete be, the leſſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ought we to make. For ſhe feleth well
<pb facs="tcp:1149:35"/>
ynough that ſhe can not vtter wyth wordes the thynge, that ſhe thynketh in hyr mynde, and wolde fayne expreſſe.

But vnto them that be voyd of the ſpret do ſuch wordes ſeme very ſleght and clene wythout ſwetneſſe or tayſt, which diſpatch theyr taxe wyth many wordes and greate noyſe. Chriſte in the .vi.

                  <p>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayth in the .xxvii. chap. of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pro.

For men do thynke: it is not as he doth ſaye, and he doth it of an hatynge and euel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyllynge harte, ſo that he doth make hys cauſe worſe, and hys neghboures better. On thys wyſe do they that endeuoure to prayſe God with multiplyenge of wordes, with cry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>enge and ianglynge. They do as though he were deafe, or knewe nothynge, and that we muſt wake or teach hym. Such opinion of God is rather a diſprayſynge of hym, than a prayſynge. But he that thynketh vpon the workes of God aryght euen from the botto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hys harte, and beholdeth theſame wyth wonderyng and geuynge of thankes, ſo that for very feruentneſſe he bruſte out, and ſygh rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeake, and the wordes that flowe by themſelues, not fayned nor connynglye deuyſed do ſo rolle oute, that euen the ſprete do alſo comme oute: Yee that the wordes haue euen handes, fete and lyfe, ſo that final<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the whole bodye, the whole lyfe and all the members do longe to ſpeake, that is, to prayſe God truly in ſprete and verite. There
<pb facs="tcp:1149:36"/>
are the wordes very fyre, lyghte and lyfe, as wytneſſeth Dauid in the .C.xviii. Pſalme, ſayenge: <hi>LORDE</hi> thy wordes are fyry. And agayne: My lyppes ſhall ſet forth thy prayſe: euen as water in a ſethynge potte runneth ouer and fometh, ſo that it can not retayne it ſelfe therein, for the vehemente heate in the potte. Of thys kynde be all the wordes of the virgine Mary in thys ſonge, the whiche be fewe, yet both greate and hygh. Such prayſers of God doth ſaynt Paule vnto the Romaynes the .xii. chapter call: Feruente of ſprete, the whych chafe and burne in ſprete, teachynge vs to be of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame ſorte: and ſuch were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyry tunges, that the holy gooſte deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the diſciples.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>greate thynges</hi> be nothynge els ſaue that ſhe is become the mother of God, by the whyche thynge ſo greate goodes and ſo excellent are geuen vnto her, that paſſe all the vnderſtondynge of ony man. For fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence floweth all honoure and bleſſe, ſo that amonge all mankynde ſhe be euen one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone, excedynge all other and pereleſſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe hath only the heauenly father with the ſonne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune with her. And hereby com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth that ſhe herſelfe can not name theſe greate thynges, for the abundau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy
<pb facs="tcp:1149:37"/>
of them: but muſt reſt there, and breſte oute in prayſynge wyth a feruent affeccion, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge: <hi>He that is myghty, hath done great thynges vnto me.</hi> For thys cauſe is all hyr honoure comprehended in one worde, name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly yf ſhe be called the mother of God: for no man can ſaye greater thynges by her, nor to her, though he had as many tunges, as the earth hath herbes and floures, the ſkye hath ſtarres, or the ſee ſondes. Moreouer it muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſydered wyth a depe harte, what it mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth to be the mother of God.</p>
                  <p>She doth alſo featly aſcrybe and attry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute thys thynge vnto the grace of God, and not hyr merite. For thoughe ſhe was wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſynne, yet was that grace ſo greate, that ſhe was in no wyſe worthy of it. For howe coulde a creature be worthye to be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God? Although ſome vayne ia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>glers, and not wryters, do bable very much of hyr worthyneſſe and deſeruynge of thys office. But I geue more credence vnto the bleſſed virgine, than vnto thoſe vayne wryters and bablers. She ſayeth that hyr lowe degre was loked vpon, and that God hath not rewarded her therfore, but that he hath done greate and myghty thynges vnto her. He hath done greate thynges vnto me (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:1149:37"/>
ſhe) not for my deſeruynges: For ſuche a thynge dyd the holy virgine neuer thynke vpon, muche leſſe than dyd ſhe prepare her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to it, that ſhe myght be the mother of God. The meſſage came ſodenly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wars vnto her, (as ſayeth Luke the euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſte.) As for a deſeruyng abydeth and loketh not for the rewarde to come ſodenly, but of a redyneſſe and ſet purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Now it that is in the ſonge called, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina coeli letare.</hi> &amp;c. (namely: <hi>Vvhome thou deſeruedeſt to beare.</hi> And in another ſonge: <hi>Vvhome thou vvereſt vvorthy to beare</hi>) is nothynge to purpoſe. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame wordes are alſo ſonge of the holy croſſe, the whiche not wythſtandynge was a tre, and coulde deſerue nothynge. And euen ſo is thys alſo to be vnderſtande. Yf it than of neceſſite muſt haue ben the mother of God it was requyred agayne, that it ſhulde haue ben a woman kynne, a virgine, of the tribe or kynred of Iuda, and to beleue the meſſage of the angell, that iudged her apte to theſame, as the ſcripture had wytneſſed of her. The preciouſneſſe or worthyneſſe of the woode was none other, ſaue that it was mete to be a croſſe, &amp; was ordyned of God to theſame vſe: Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo had the holy virgine
<pb facs="tcp:1149:38"/>
none other worthyneſſe to be the mother of God, ſaue that ſhe was comly and ordyned therto: that ſo it myght be a mere grace and no deſeruynge or duety, that in no caſe it were preiudiciall and mynyſſhynge ether the fauoure or the glorye of God. It is more ſemely to abayte to much from her, than fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the glory of God. Yee ther ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be abayted to much fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, ſeynge that ſhe (as all other creatures) is created of nought. But vnto the grace of God is to much derogated, the which is daungerous, nother is the mother well apayed therewyth. It is nedefull alſo, that we paſſe not the markes that Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry doth admitte, in vſurpyng of callyng her: as whan we grete her <hi>a quene of heauen,</hi> yet is ſhe not an idoll thereby, that ether ſhe maye geue or helpe, as they do, which call vpon her, deſyre her to be gracious, and final<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly flye vnto her rather than vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rych trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſures of God. She geueth nothynge, onlye God geueth all as it followeth: <hi>He that is myghty,</hi> wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe robbeth all creatures of theyr ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth &amp; power. O what greate hardy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe is thys, and what ſpoyles of ſo tender and yonge mayden? whiche can make deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtute all myghtye and ſtronge men of theyre ſtrengthe, al puyſſaunt men of theyr power,
<pb facs="tcp:1149:38"/>
all wyſe men of theyr wytte, and all boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtynge and glorious men can ſhe brynge to ſhame, attributyng al ſtrength, noble actes, wyſedome and glory vnto God only. For the ſayenge: <hi>He that is myghty,</hi> is ſo much to ſaye, as ther is noman that can do ought, ſaue only God, as wytneſſeth S. Paule ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>enge in the .i. chapter to the Epheſians: that God worketh all thynges after the counſell of hys owne wyll, and that the workes of all creatures, are the workes of God: the which thynge we alſo acknowlege in oure Crede, ſayenge that we beleue in God almyghtye. He is ſo <hi>Almyghty,</hi> that in all thynges, by all thynges, and aboue all thynges, nothyng doth worke, ſaue only hys ſtrength and puyſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaunce. After thys maner ſayde Anna the mother of Samuel, in the .i. boke of Regum, the .ii. chapter: Ther is noman that can do ought of hys owne power. And Paule ſayth alſo in the .ii. Epiſtle to the Corinth. the .iii. chapter: Such truſt haue we thorow Chriſt to Godwarde, not that we are able of oure ſelues to thynke ony thyng, as of ourſelues, but oure ableneſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of God. Thys is an hygh &amp; worthy artycle, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teynynge very much, alayenge ato<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce al pryde, curioſite, pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, raſhnes, boaſtyng, falſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth
<pb facs="tcp:1149:39"/>
only God: yee and ſheweth the cauſe alſo why he oughte to be exalted, euen becauſe he worketh all thynges. It is eaſy to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but to refourme and redreſſe oure lyfe accordynge to it, that is laborious, and full of payne. For they that leade theyr lyfe in ſuch thynges, are louers of peace, geuen to God, and ſimple men, attributyng nothyng to themſelues, certifyed that God hath all thynges, and they nothynge.</p>
                  <p>Thys is than the meanynge of Gods mother in theſe wordes: Of all theſe greate goodes is nothynge myne, but he that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all thynges alone, and whoſe power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone worketh in all thynges, he it is that hath done ſo greate thynges vnto me. For the worde <hi>Myghty</hi> ſygnifyeth not a worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ydle, and reſtynge power, (as we ſaye of a worldly kynge that he is myghty, which neuertheleſſe is ſtyll, and worketh not) but a workyng power and continually doynge, which without intermiſſion doth procede &amp; worke. For God doth not holde vp, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth in workynge, as wytneſſeth Chriſte Ioh. v. My father worketh hetherto, and I worke alſo. Of thys wyſe alſo ſayeth Paule Epheſ. iii. that God is able to do exceadyng abundauntly, aboue all that we axe or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtonde
<pb facs="tcp:1149:39"/>
accordyng to the power that wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth in vs. That is: He euer geueth greater thynges than we requyre, as hys nature is to do, ſo doth hys power worke. For thys cauſe dyd I ſaye, that Mary wolde be no I<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>doll, and that God doth all, &amp; ſhe nothynge.</p>
                  <p>For thys cauſe doth ſhe adde and ſaye: <hi>And holy is hys name.</hi> That is: As I do not take the worke to me, euen ſo do not I aſcribe the honour thereof vnto me nother. For he only ought to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prayſe &amp; name, that fulfylleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worke. It is vnſemely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one ſhall do the worke, and another ſhall drawe the name and prayſe thereof vnto hymſelfe. As for me, I ame the workehouſe only, wher in he worketh, and therfore is no prayſe nor honoure due vnto me, that I ame the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, but God and hys excellent worke are to be prayſed and honoured in me. It is ynough for me that I reioyce with hym, and ſaye: Happy ame I, that God hath ſeparate me, in whome it hath plaſed him to accomplyſh ſuch hys workes.</p>
                  <p>Lo how purely doth ſhe wende all to Godwarde, how wholye doth ſhe drawe no honoure, no worke, no glory to herſelfe, and behaueth herſelfe as before whan no ſuche thynge had happened vnto her, ſettynge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more

Nowe muſte euerye man than abſtayne from the name of God, ſo that he nother touch it, nor drawe it to hymſelfe, the which is alſo ment Exod. xxx: where Moſes was commaunded by God to make precious oyntme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; it was ſtraytelye forbydden onye man to anoynte hys bodye therewyth.

Moreouer as many as hallowe ſo his name makynge themſelues voyde of prayſe and honoure, worſhyppe it aryght, wherfore they alſo be halowed of it: whiche the precious oyntment that is ſpoken of in the thyrtyeth chapter of Exodus doth ſignify w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the which all that was touched, was clenſed.

                  <p>For thys cauſe ought we to beware, ſeynge that we can not be on earth without the goodes, name and honoure of God, that yf we be prayſed of ony man, or get a name, that than we vſe thys example of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, beynge ready to anſwer them wyth thys verſe, vſynge the honour &amp; prayſe aryghte, confeſſynge openly, or at the leaſte thynkynge thus in oure mynde: <hi>LORDE</hi> God, it is thy worke that is prayſed &amp; auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all the ſcripture iudgeth the thynges to be good, therfore thou alſo wylt kepe the worde of God, and defende or requyre agayne theſame goodes both wyth body and lyfe, orels to forbeare them or let them go agaynſte thy wyll: Were not thys a ioly viſure? Yf thou wylt therfore do well in thys behalfe, thou mayeſt not runne head<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lynges after thyne owne brayne. But howe ſhall I do than? ye ſhall feare God, and ſaye on thys wyſe: <hi>LORD</hi> they be good thynges and thy gyftes, as thyne owne worde and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture do wytneſſe. Neuertheleſſe I doue

whether thou doeſt enuye me them. Yf I knewe I ſhulde not vſe them, I wolde not beſtowe one heare vpon the hauynge agayn of them: but yf I knewe thou woldeſt them to be in my power, I wolde (obeynge thy wyll) beſtowe both body and goodes to haue them agayne. But ſeynge nowe I ſtande in doute of ether of theſe thy wylles, and I ſe what now is don, namely, that thou ſuffreſt them to be taken from me, I commytte the matter vnto the, and wyll wayte vpon thy pleaſure in thys behalfe, redy ether to kepe them, or to forgo them.</p>
                  <p>Thys (lo) is a faythfull ſoule, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge God, by whome is mercy, as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God ſyngeth of. And here by maye it be euident, of what fundament and ſprete Abraham, Dauid, and all Iſrael dyd warre and ſlaye ſo many in tymes paſt. For they toke the matter in hande at the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and wyll of God, and wyth feare: not fyghtynge for ryches, but becauſe God dyd requyre it of them, ſhewynge otherwhy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les the commaundement of God in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, as the holy ſcripture maketh mencion ſomtyme. Now maye ye ſe that the truth is not denyed, whych ſayeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe be good creatures: Yee the ſame truth alſo doth ſaye

and teach that thou do forſake, and ready at all tyme to forgo the ſame goodes, yf it pleaſe God, and ſo hange onely vpon God, The truth doth not compell the to requyre the goodes agayne, in that ſhe ſayeth they be good: nother doth ſhe conſtrayne the to ſaye they be not good, but renouncynge the ſame ſaye that they be not euell.</p>
                  <p>Lykewyſe muſt be done wyth the lawe, and all maner of goodes ether of wytte or reaſon. Iuſtice is a good thynge, geuen of God, who douteth therin? Gods worde it ſelfe doth confeſſe that the lawe is good. No<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther maye ony man ſaye that hys ryghteous cauſe is euell, but ſhall rather dye the death, and forgo al that is not God.

Wylte thou therfore crye out, rage, playe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> madde man, and kyll all the worlde, becauſe ſuche ryghte or lawe is taken from the? As ſome do whyche lyfte vp theyre voyce vntyll heauen, cauſynge great myſery, way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng people and contryes, fyllynge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world wyth warre and bloudſheddynge.

or to morowe, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> depriue the of them, and reſtore the to theſame agayne whan it ſhall pleaſe hym by frendes or enemyes, euen as it pleaſeth him. He doth proue, whether thou wylte loſe thy ryghte for hys loue, ſuffre wronge and iniurye, ſuffre rebuke for hys name, and cleue only to hym. Yf thou than arte dredynge God, and ſayeſte thus within the: <hi>LORDE,</hi> it is thyne, I wyll not haue it in my power &amp; ſubiection, wythout I know that thou do wyſh it me, than ſhal this verſe haue rowme: <hi>And hys mercy endureth tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rovv out all generacions, vpon them that feare hym,</hi> which wyll worke nought, but it be accordynge to hys wylle.</p>
                  <p>Here (lo) is the worde of God kepte on both partes: fyrſte, that thou graunteſt thy ryght, reaſon, vnderſtandynge, wyſdom, and all thyne opinion to be good and iuſte, the which euen the worde of God doth alſo ſay. Secondlye, that thou arte contente to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare ſuch gyfte for the loue of God, to be wrongefully condemned, yee to be a moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kage and a gaſynge ſtocke to the worlde, the which Gods worde alſo doth teache. Ther be .ii. thynges: to confeſſe the thynge that is iuſte and good, and to obtayne or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. It is ynough for the to knowlege and
<pb facs="tcp:1149:48"/>
confeſſe that thou haſt a good cauſe. Yf thou canſte not ouercome, committe the matter vnto God. It is thy parte to knowlege, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome hath God reſerued vnto hymſelfe. Yf he wyll haue the to ouercome, he ſhall do it, ether ſhall he ſo brynge the thynge to pas, wythout thy counſell or thoughte, that thou muſte nedes take the matter in hande and ouercome, and that after ſuch faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as thou neuer woldeſte haue thought or deſyred. Yf he wyll not, let hys mercy ſuffyſe the. Yf the victory of thy ryghteouſneſſe be taken from the, yet can not the knowlegynge of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame be taken from the. Lo, here muſte we ſtande backe, not from the goodes of God, but from the wycked and euell geuynge of to muche mynde to theſame, that we can ryght well both vſe and forgo them, ſo that in all chaunces that befall, we cleue on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to God.

<pb facs="tcp:1149:51"/>
that noman is ware of it, before it be diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: and that no man can knowe the ſame arme or power, ſaue onely by fayth. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, few do geue fayth therevnto, as Eſaye doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playne in the .liii. Chapter, ſayenge: Who geueth credence vnto our preachyng?

Chapter that God hath hornes in hys han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, meanynge thereby hys great ſtrength: yet notwythſtandynge doth he ſaye that the ſame power is hyd. But how is thys done? namely after thys maner:</p>
                  <p>Whan God worketh by the meane of creatures, than is it euidentlye ſene where ſtrength or febleneſſe is: wherof is ryſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this prouerbe: God doth ayde the ſtronger part. Whatſo euer prynce therfore vanquyſheth the other, the ſame is he, thorow whom God doth ſtryke the other. Yf a wolfe teare ony man, or he get ony da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage otherwyſe, that ſame is done by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creatures. Of thys wyſe doth God make or deſtroye one creature by another. He that ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth: he that abydeth, abydeth. But where as he
<pb facs="tcp:1149:52"/>
hymſelfe worketh wyth hys arme, there go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it otherwyſe to worke: for there is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter deſtroyed or made agayne, contrary to our opinion, no man perceauynge it. Thys kynde of workynge doth he vſe in two ſortes of men, namely good and wycked: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good he ſuffreth to be ſo feble, ſtrengthleſſe and op<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſſed, that euery man wold thynke it were all done wyth them, and that they were at theyr latter meace, &amp; at the very ſame tyme is he ſtrongly by them, and that ſo ſecretly, that they themſelues that ſuffre can not tell therof, but beleue it. There is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ful ſtrength and arme of God. For whan the ſtrength of man fayleth, than co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the power of God in: yf fayth only be there, waytynge for the ſame. Now whan the trouble is come to an ende, then doth it appeare what ſtrength lay hyd vnder the febleneſſe. Of thys wyſe (lo) was Chriſt deſtitute of ſtrength on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe and euen than wrought he exceadyng great thynges, vanquyſſyng ſynne, death, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, hell and all euell. After thys maner were all martyres ſtronge and ouercame: and after thys maner do all ſuch as be troubled nowe a dayes ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me. For the which cauſe Ioel ſayeth in the .iii. Chap. Let the weake man ſaye, I am ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, but in fayth, not in felyng,
<pb facs="tcp:1149:52"/>
vntyll it be nearehande come to an ende.</p>
                  <p>Agayne, the other parte ſuffreth God to heaue and exalte it ſelfe, wythdrawynge hys power from them, and letteth them be puft vp by reaſon of theyr owne ſtrength. For whan mans power co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in, than go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the power of God out. But whan the bladder is full, &amp; euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thynketh to haue the better hande, then commeth God ſoden<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, and prycketh the bladder, whereby all is daſhed. Thoſe fooles knowe not, that euen whan they ryſe and proſpere, they are forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God, &amp; that Gods arme is not wyth them. Therfore doth theyr endeuoure laſte an appoynted ſeaſon, and after that doth it ſayde and vanyſh, lyke a burble, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth as though it neuer hadde ben, wherof Dauid (maruaylynge in the .lxxvii.

<pb facs="tcp:1149:53"/>
ymage to vanyſh out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cytie. And agayne in the .xxxvi.

                  <p>Lacke of fayth is only the cauſe that we can not alſo abyde a lytle, or els ſhulde we ſe ſeatly how the mercy of God is wyth them that feare hym, and the arme of God alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the proude wyth all force &amp; ſtrength.

It is neceſſary, and he wyl be knowen by fayth Therfore muſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wytte &amp; reaſon be ſhut vp, theyr eye offendeth vs, we muſte therfore plucke it out, and caſt it awaye.</p>
                  <p>Lo theſe are the two workes of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ech to other, wherin we are taught that to be the mynde of God, that he be

farre from the wyſe and prudente, but be neare vnto the foolyſh, whiche muſte ſuffre wronge. Thys maketh God to be loued and prayſed, and conforteth the ſoule, body and all powers.</p>
                  <p>Now conſydre the wordes: <hi>He ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them that are proude in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion of theyr harte.</hi> Thys ſcatterynge or wayſtynge is done (as it is ſayde) whan they are wyſeſte of all, and mooſte fulleſt of theyr owne wyſedome, for than ſurely is the wyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God gone. But what waye can he ſcatter them better, than wyth depriuynge them of hys eternall wyſedome? and by per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mittynge them to be fylled wyth worldly &amp; tranſitory wyſedome. It is pythy that ſhe ſayeth: <hi>them that are proude in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginacion of theyr harte,</hi> that is, ſuche as theyr owne mynde, vnderſtandynge (the which not God, but theyr harte doth mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre) doth greatly playſe, as though they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were the mooſt iuſteſt, wyſeſt and beſte: whereby they auaunce themſelues aboue ſuch as feare God, myſprayſynge theyr opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and ryghte, reuylynge &amp; perſecutynge them to the vtermooſte, ſo that theyr cauſe only muſt be iuſte and abyde.

Thus do we ſe than that thys verſe ſpeaketh of ſpirituall goodes, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth by what meanes the workes of God are knowen on both partes, and teacheth vs alſo to embrace wyllyngly the pouerte of ſprete, and to ſuffre iniury, to permitte vnto oure aduerſaryes theyr requeſt, for they ſhal not longe reioyce. Herein is a ſtronge and ſure promyſe that the proude ſhal not eſcape Gods arme, they muſte be throwen downe, though they heaue themſelues neuer ſo ſore, yf we at the leeſt be fully ſo perſuaded. For where ſuch fayth is not, there doth God not worke ſuch greate workes, but leauynge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he worketh openly by creatures as is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before. But theſe are not true workes whereby he maye be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the powers of the creatures are ioyned to them alſo: No<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther are they the bare workes of God, which ought be to ſuch, as he worketh alone, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out ony foren helpe, which is done whan we are oppreſſed for oure opinion and ryghte, and ſuffre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of God to vſe hyr wyll in vs.

                  <p>Moreouer, Mary doth connyngly checke the vngodly hypocrites here, and loketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to theyr handes nor eyen, but to the harte, and ſayeth: <hi>them that are proude in the imaginacion of theyr harte,</hi> where wyth ſhe doth ſpecially meane the enemyes of the truth, euen as the Iewes were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme agaynſte Chriſt, and as ſome are now a dayes lyke vnto them.

                  <p>Theſe are the mooſt wycked and poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men on earth, whoſe pryde of harte is ſo depe and deuellyſh, that ſhe can brouke no medecyne nor wholſome counſell. For they heare not what is ſayde, yee they reken it not to be ſpoken vnto them, but vnto the wretched ſynner, which hath nede of it, they nede it not. Ihon baptiſte doth call them the generacion of vipers Mathew .iii. and Luke the thyrde: and euen ſo doth Chriſte alſo Mathew the .xii. and .xvi. Theſe are they that do not truely feare God, do &amp; ſerue to be deſtroyed of God wyth theyre pryde and arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy.

Wherfore ſhe ſayeth alſo: <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth mercy.</hi> She ſayeth not: He reme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>breth oure merite and worthyneſſe, for we
<pb facs="tcp:1149:64"/>
were in neceſſite and vnworthy. Of this tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth hys prayſe and honoure ſpringe, &amp; oure boaſte and preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſuaged. He had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge at whoſe ſyghte he myght be moued, ſaue only hys owne mercy, the whiche alſo was therfore to be ſhewed on all nacions.</p>
                  <p>But wherfore ſayeth ſhe more: He <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth mercy,</hi> than <hi>he loked vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hys mercy?</hi> Euen becauſe he had promyſed the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame, as the verſe followynge doth declare. Moreouer, he wytheld y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame mercy ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, that he ſemed nearehande to haue forgotten it: (euen as all hys workes do ſeme to haue no care for vs) neuertheleſſe wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came, it was euidently knowen that he had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten vs, but that he was euer mynded to fulfyll hys promyſes.</p>
                  <p>Truth it is, that by <hi>Iſraell</hi> the Iewes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are ment, and not the Gentiles: but ſeyng they refuſed hym, he choſe a few of them, and ſatiſfyed the name of Iſraell therewith, and made a ſpirituall Iſraell. Thys is figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Gen. xxxvii. by the patriarke <hi>Iacob</hi> wra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtlynge wyth the angel, whoſe thygh the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell touched, and made hym to halte. For therby was ſignifyed that the chylderen of Iſraell ſhulde not from thenceforth boaſte theyr carnall byrth, (as the Iewes do) where
<pb facs="tcp:1149:64"/>
he alſo obtayned the name <hi>Iſraell,</hi> that he thenceforth ſhulde ſo be called, as a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arke, which were not only <hi>Iacob,</hi> the father of carnall chyldren, but alſo <hi>Iſrael</hi> the father of ſpirituall chylderen. To thys doth agre alſo the name <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the which is as muche to ſaye, as, <hi>the LORDE of God.</hi> That is ſurely a very holy &amp; hygh name, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teynynge in it ſelfe that great mirakle, that a man by the Godly fauour, hath in a maner brought God in his power, ſo that God do acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plyſh all mans requeſtes: as we ſe alſo that the church is made one w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God thorow Chriſte, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a bryde vnto the brydegrome, which hath power of hyr brydegromes body and all that he hath. All this is done by fayth, where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by a man obeyeth the wyll of God, and God agayne agreeth vnto mans wyll, ſo that <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> be ſo conformable to God, and of ſuche power ouer hym, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in God, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God &amp; by God he do all thynges, &amp; be able to do all thynges</p>
                  <p>Thys (lo) ſignifyeth Iſraell. For <hi>Schar</hi> in Hebrue is as muche to ſaye, as a lorde or a prince, and <hi>El</hi> ſignifyeth God, &amp; ioynynge them together, maketh <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Such an Iſra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ell wyll God haue, wherfore whan Iacob hadde wreſtled wyth the angell &amp; ouercome him, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> angel ſayd: Thou ſhalt nomore be cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led

Iacob, but Iſraell: for thou haſt ſtryue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyth God and with men, &amp; haſt preuayled. Many thynges more were to be ſayde hereof, for Iſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raell is a hygh myſtery.</p>

                  <p>Here are all merites and preſumpcion ouerthrowen, and the grace and mercy of God are lyfte vp. For God hath not holpen vp Iſraell for hys owne merites, but for hys owne promyſe. Of only and mere grace hath he promyſed, and of mere grace alſo hath he fulfilled it. Therfore ſayeth Paule in the .iii. chapter to the Galathians that God dyd bynde hymſelfe to Abraham foure hundreth yeare before he gaue the lawe by Moſes, leſt ony man myghte ſaye or boaſt that he had deſerued or obtayned ſo greate grace and promyſe by the lawe or the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of theſame: Thys ſame promyſe doth the mother of God laude and prayſe aboue all thynges, attributynge the mooſte cleare worke of the incarnacion vnto the pure, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerued, godly and fre promyſe made vnto Abraham.</p>
                  <p>Thys promyſe of God vnto Abraham is ſpecially wrytten in the .xii. and .xxii. chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters of Geneſis, and diuerſe other plades,
<pb facs="tcp:1149:65"/>
ſoundynge on thys maner: <hi>In thy ſede ſhall all the nacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> The which wordes of God, S. Paull and al Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phetes (as they be worthy) lyfte vp vnto the cloudes, for in thoſe wordes both Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and all hys poſterite are ſaued, becauſe that Chriſte is comprehended in theſame, and promyſed to be the Saueoure of all the worlde. Moreouer thys is <hi>Abrahams bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,</hi> wherein all they that were ſaued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſtes natiuite, dyd remayne. Nother was ony man euer ſaued without theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des, though he had done all the good dedes that euer were done, the which we wyl loke vpon continently.</p>
                  <p>Fyrſt doth it fellowe by theſe wordes, that all the worlde, excepte Chriſte, was in thraldome and daunger of ſynne, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and curſe wyth all hys workes and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nynge. For whan he ſayeth, that not ſome, but all nacions ſhalbe bleſſed in Abrahams ſede, it is manifeſte, that wythout theſame ſede; ther ſhalbe no bleſſe. What neded God to promyſe the bleſſe wyth ſo earneſte, ſo greate and ſo preciouſe, an oth, yf the bleſſe and not rather the curſe had ben in the worlde? Out of thys place haue the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes ſucked and concluded many thynges
<pb facs="tcp:1149:66"/>
as namely: that all men are euell, vayne, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, fayners, blynde and brefely Godleſſe or wythout Godlyneſſe: ſo that it be no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyppe in ſcripture to be called a man. For that name is nomore worth by God, than yf a man were called before the worlde a lyar or periured. So wholy dyd he peryſh by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams fall, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the curſe beynge borne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hym, was neareha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de become one nature w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hym.</p>
                  <p>Secondely it followeth, that that ſede of Abraham neded not to be borne by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſede of man and wyfe: For ſuche byrth is curſed, and bringeth forth curſed frutes, as is ſayde euen now. Yf now all the worlde was to be delyuered from thys curſe by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams ſede and to be bleſſed, it was requy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſede were bleſſed before, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched or vndefyled of ſuche a curſe, and to be a mere bleſſe, full of grace and truthe. Agayne, yf God that is no lyar doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe (and that wyth an oth) a naturall ſede vnto Abraham, that is a naturall and lawfull chylde, whyche ſhalbe borne of hys fleſh and bloude: it was neceſſary that ſuch one ſhulde be a true naturall man, borne of the fleſhe and bloude of Abraham. Now do theſe two thynges ſtryue together: To be the naturall fleſhe and bloude of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<pb facs="tcp:1149:66"/>
and yet not to be borne by man and wyfe after the courſe of nature. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vſeth he thys worde, <hi>thy ſede,</hi> and not <hi>thy chylde or thy ſonne</hi>: that ſo it were clere and euident, that it muſt be hys naturall fleſhe and bloude, as it is alſo hys ſede.</p>
                  <p>Who wyll now here attayne a meane, that the worde and oth of God be true, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in thynges ſo contrary do mete? That ſhall God ſurely do, whiche can accomplyſh that he hath promyſed, though noman couet it before it be done. Therfore do hys wordes and dedes requyre no naturall wytte, but a fre and pure fayth. Lo how he hath vnyed theſe two thynges: He geueth vnto Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a naturall ſede, of one of hys doughters, the pure and chaſte virgine Mary, by the holy gooſte, wythout the workynge of man. There was not the naturall concepcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and generacion wyth hyr curſe, nother coulde it ſtayne the ſede: and yet neuertheleſſe is thys the naturall ſede of Abraham as well, as all other Abrahams yſſue. Beholde than, thys is the bleſſed ſede of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, whereby all the worlde is delyuered of hys curſe. For from hym that beleueth on thys ſede, calleth vpon it, confeſſeth it,
<pb facs="tcp:1149:67"/>
and cleueth there vnto, is the curſe taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye and forgeuen as a cryme, and al bleſſe is geuen him, for the ſounde of the word and oth of God, namely: <hi>In thy ſede ſhall all nacions be bleſſed.</hi> That is, Loke what is to be bleſſed, that ſhal be bleſſed, by thys ſede and none other. Lo thys is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſede of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the which is borne of none of hys chylderen, (as the Iewes haue alwaye loked for to haue ben) but of hys only doughter the virgine Mary.</p>
                  <p>That ſame meaneth here the bewtyful mother of God whan ſhe ſayeth that God hath taken vp Iſraell, accordynge to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe made vnto Abraham: vnto Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (I ſaye) and all hys ſede. Veryly ſhe ſawe that the promyſe was than fulfylled in her, and therfore ſayd ſhe: It is now fulfylled, he hath now taken hym vp, he hath acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plyſhed hys worde by the only callynge to mynde hys mercy. Here do we beholde the fundamente of the goſpell, wherfore all doctrines &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynges of hym do dryue vnto Chriſtes fayth and Abrahams boſome. For ther is no coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell, nor helpe yf thys fayth is wantynge, whereby y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſed ſede maye be vnderſtand. And veryly <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> all the ſcripture hangeth vpon thys oth. For all that is wrytten in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole
<pb facs="tcp:1149:67"/>
Bible, doth behold and concerne Chriſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydes thys do we ſe that al the fathers of the olde teſtamente, and all Prophetes alſo had theſame fayth, and theſame goſpell that we haue, as Paule doth teſtifye .i. Corinth. x. For in thys teſtamente of God &amp; Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s boſome dyd they all remayne by ſtedfaſte fayth, and therfore are ſaued: ſauynge that they beleued in the ſede that was promyſed and for to come, but we beleue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſede that hath appeared and is geuen. Neuertheleſſe the truth of the promyſe remayneth on both partes, it is all one fayth, one ſprete, one Chriſt, one <hi>LORDE</hi> that was at that tyme and is now, and ſhall be for euer, as the .xiii. chapter to the Hebrues doth beare witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>But that the Iewes had a lawe geuen them afterwarde, that is not lyke vnto thys promyſe, for it was done therfore, that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyght of the lawe they myghte knowe theyr curſed nature, and that they ſhulde more fer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uently and wyth more whoter deſyre ſygh and longe for thys promyſed ſede of bleſſyng in the whiche they had a prerogatiue before all nacions on earth. But they haue turned the prerogatiue into hurte and dammage, &amp; haue thought to accomplyſh and fulfyll the lawe by theyr owne ſtrength, and therfore
<pb facs="tcp:1149:68"/>
haue not they ſene theyr wretched myſery. And after thys maner haue they ſhut y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dore to themſelues, ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſede promyſed muſte nedes go by them, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mayne yet, God geue it be not longe. Ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thys hath ben the debate that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes haue had wyth them, for ſeynge the Prophetes knew wel ynough the meanyng of the lawe, namely: that thereby the wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of our nature ſhulde be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to learne how Chriſte ſhulde be called vpon, therfore refuſed they all the workes &amp; lyues of the Iewes, that wente not in that waye: for the whych cauſe the Iewes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaued an anger agaynſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſlew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as thoſe that refuſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods ſeruice, good workes, and the good lyuyng, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hypocrytes and graceles ſayntes d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Let your hyghneſſe call thys to mynde, namely: That God neuer ſuffred one Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile kynge or prince in all the ſcripture to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, no not ſence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but cauſed them alwaye to be rebuked: the whiche is a dredefull enſample vnto all ſuperiorites.

               <p>What tyme as the chylderen of Iſraell were come into the lande of promyſe, &amp; had taken poſſeſſion of it, they had no kynges, but were ruled by rulers.

On lyke maner prophecyeth here Zachary that God will do, in ſendynge hys ſonne Ieſus Chriſte, of the ſede of Dauid, to delyuer the true Iſraelites and to rydde them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hande of ſuch ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, as oppreſſed them. Lo (ſayeth he) howe true is God, and how well abydeth he by his promyſes. For he kepeth not only theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſes that he made by the prophetes, but alſo the teſtamentes and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenauntes that he made vnto the Patriarkes, namelye:

Abraham and Dauid, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he dyd bynde wyth an oth.

And agayne: Thy ſede ſhall poſſeſſe the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of hys enemyes, and in thy ſede ſhall all nacions on earth be bleſſed. Gene. xxii.

Hys ſede ſhall endure for euer, and hys ſeate alſo lyke as the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne before me. &amp;c. Theſe and ſuch lyke promyſes made vnto Abraham and Dauid of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of theyr enemyes, of the ſureneſſe and quyetneſſe of theyr lyfe, of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of theyr happy kyngdome, ſounde to be ſpoken only of outwarde bleſſynges, and ſhulde be fulfylled after the meanynge of thys worlde: But by thys ſonge of Zachary, whiche is an vtteraunce of the promyſes made vnto Abra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ham and Dauid, it is euidente, that theſe bleſſynges concerne mooſt chefely the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bleſſynges.

Nother is it to be thought that theſe enemyes although they do enuy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in dede, yet are they farre from them, but it is to be marked that theſe enemyes haue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wholy in theyr clawes. For naturally are we the chyldren of wrath, that is, the deuels owne, borne in ſynne, and by reaſon of ſynne, we be in daunger of troubles of thys worlde, bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyly death &amp; alſo hell. Theſe enemyes hath Chriſt ſo ouercome (though they ſomtime do repyne and gnaſh, threatnynge men many thynges) that they can in no wyſe hurt them that beleue in Chriſte Ieſu.

Nowe hath Ihon prepared the waye vnto Chriſte, as is ſayd aboue, not only in that he rebuked the people of theyr ſynnes, but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he declared ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly that thys is the true Chriſte, and ſente hys diſciples vnto the ſame Chriſte, ſayenge: Beholde the lambe of God, whych taketh awaye the ſynnes of the worlde.

Wherfore, that we maye be delyuered from the cruelte of the deuel, and from the power of death and hel, it is requyred that we be delyuered fyrſte of all from ſynne. Ihon was the fyrſt that preached Ieſus Chriſte, that we for hym onely haue the forgeueneſſe of ſynnes, by the fayth in hym.

Nother were it poſſible for a man to endure (yf Gods worde dyd not ſuſtayne hym, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vpon he wayteth) vntyll that tyme, that God hath choſen to theſame.

Now though ther appeared many thynges contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry to thys worde or promyſe, and though it ſemed to haue ben a vayne and fayned tayle neuertheleſſe, ſeynge all men are lyars, but thou <hi>LORDE</hi> my God arte true, thou ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fylleſt it at the fulleſt that thou haſt promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and letteſt me now go in peace. Hether to haue I carefully abyden thy commynge, and that thys many yeares, and what myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtynge dyd not the fleſhe in the meane ſeaſon ſteare me vnto? What infidelite dyd not Satan inſpire me wyth? And becauſe thou dyddeſt differre thy promyſe of ſeynge Chriſt, therfore was I nearehande cauſed to

thynke that all thy promyſes were vayne. And (good <hi>LORDE</hi>) what rumoure or vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>roure dyd than ryſe in my conſcience? With what engins dyd Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſaulte my mynde? layenge now my ſynnes before me, than ſhe wynge me an hougle image of death, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme kyndlynge the horrible fyre of hell in myne entrayles, wherewyth I was ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made, that I was nearha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in deſpayre.

               <p>But what is happened vnto the good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that thou arte ſo ſodenly chaunged, and where afore thou wereſt ſo ſorowfull, that thou arte now eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> filled with ſo great ioye? For what cauſe doeſt thou now ſo leape for ioye, as though thou wereſt reuyued, which afore ſemedeſt to haue ben more than dead? Surely hys ioye is not for nought. Let vs therfore heare hymſelfe. For thys ſayeth he to be the cauſe of hys myrth, and gladneſſe, namely: <hi>For myne eyen haue ſene thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueoure, vvhome thou haſt prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all people.</hi>

But the good Simeon reioyceth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wyll departe in peace, as though ther were no death. He calleth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paſſynge a death, he diſdayneth to honoure it ſo much.

               <p>From whence hath he the connyng that he feareth not death, but counteth it a ſwete ſlepe, for the whych not wythſtandynge all the worlde is afrayed? Euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence that ſynne, the law and death were banyſhed out of hys harte, he dyd not regarde them. For where the lawe is, there is alſo a conſcience of ſynne: but where ſhe is not, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge ſaue ryghteouſneſſe, and Moſes is exiled, and ſo wholy out of ſyghte, that hys ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pulture is not ſene nor knowen where it is. Where Moſes is gone, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence is ſynne taken awaye alſo, and ſo becommeth death a louely ſlepe.</p>
               <p>But whereby getteth he that? Veryly not by hys deſeruynges &amp; workes, but onely by the beholdynge of the ſaueoure. For he ſayeth: <hi>Myne eyen haue ſene thy Saueour</hi> He maketh no mencion, nor is once thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge that he hath done or procured it wyth hys handes, but hath ſene it wyth hys eyen, though the outwarde ſyght wythout the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde do auayle ſo lytle as the handes.</p>

Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, Marye, Anna, and Simeon haue ſene hym aryghte, but all the other that behelde hym not lykewyſe, they haue not ſene Chriſt nor the Saueoure. Caiphas, Annas, Pilate &amp; Herode, dyd beholde hym in dede, but they ſawe not that he was the Saueoure. But where in is the faute, that they can not ſe hym? In the eyen of the harte, they muſt be cleare, that they may beholde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yonge <hi>LOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DE</hi> that is entred in to the wynepreſſe for vs, and hath ſuffred wronge for vs, ſettynge vs at lyberte, not for our merytes or deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynges, but for hys truth and loues ſake.

               <p>The true ſeynge conſiſteth not in the bodely eyen, for many haue ſene hym after that maner, which were neuer the better for it: but in fayth in the harte.

Euen ſo muſte we alſo not onely heare at Chriſtes mouth, but alſo beleue in the harte thorowe the holy gooſt, and ſo muſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harte be illumined by the holy gooſt: for it is natu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rally ſtony, hardened and darkened ſo ſore, that it can not knowlege ſuch ſaluacyon and ſe ſuch lyghte.

The fyrſt tytle that Chriſt is declared wyth, is, <hi>Saueoure,</hi> ſayenge: <hi>Myne eyen haue ſene thy Saue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oure,
<pb facs="tcp:1149:98"/>
vvhome thou haſt prepared before all people.</hi> Thys ſayenge ſemeth Simeon to haue taken out of the .lii. Chapter of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaye where he ſayeth: The <hi>LORDE</hi> wyll make bare hys holy arme, &amp; ſhewe it forth in the ſyght of all the Gentyles, and all the endes of the earth ſhall ſe the ſauynge health of oure God. That Eſaye doth prophecy for to come, that ſayeth Simeon to be now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyllynge. That is, that our <hi>LORDE</hi> Chriſt whych as the true Saueoure is ſhewed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſhe, and ſet vp therfore, that he myghte be ſhewed vnto al nacions, both the Iewes and Gentyles. Yf the ſynnes do racke oure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and caſt them to the euerlaſtynge damnacyon, than is Chriſt oure Saueoure, the wholſome playſter, whyche layed to the ſores of our ſynnes, doth ſo drye vp, clenſe &amp; heale the etter of them, that although he fele hymſelfe greued wyth ſynnes, and yet do be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leue in Chriſte, yeldynge hymſelfe wholy to hys cure, yet is he for all that rekened clene from all ſynne, ryghteous and holy. And yf Chriſte be wholſome to clenſe and heale ſyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, it followeth alſo that he is wholſome in al aduerſites, troubles, grefes and paynes of death and hell. For yf ony man be pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or greued, than is Chriſte wholſome
<pb facs="tcp:1149:99"/>

Yf ony ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be caſt before death and hell in hys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, Chriſt is a Seueoure vnto hym, the whych ſeynge he hath ſatiſfyed hys father for our ſinnes, he chaungeth the feare of death and hell in a waye, not vnto perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but vnto lyfe &amp; euer laſtynge ſaluacion. Let vs therfore embrace thys Saueoure of God, the whych Simeon dyd beare in hys armes, and let vs lykewyſe beare hym by fayth, that we maye be letten go in peace lykewyſe.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde tytle that Simeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> decketh Chriſt wyth, is, <hi>the lyght.</hi> For he ſayeth: <hi>A lyght for the lyghtenynge of the Heythe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> he ſhall not onely be a Saueoure, but alſo a lyghte to lyghten the Heythen, that is: He is a lyght that ſhall not only ſhyne amonge the Iewes, but alſo, amonge the Gentyles, and lyghten them, that they alſo maye come to the eternall bleſſe oute of the darkeneſſe of death and hel. Thys part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonge ſemeth to be taken out of the .xlii. Chapter of Eſay, where he prophecieth of Chriſt on thys wyſe I wyll geue the for a conuenaunt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, and to be the lyght of the Gentyles, that thou mayeſt open the eyes of the blynde,
<pb facs="tcp:1149:99"/>
and let out the preſoners, and them that ſyt in darkeneſſe out of the doungeon houſe. And Chriſte ſayeth thus of hymſelfe, in the viii. chapter of Ihon: I ame the lyght of the worlde, He that followeth me, ſhal not walke in darkneſſe, but ſhall haue the lyght of lyfe. What are than thoſe darkneſſes that Chriſt the lyght doth dryue out? The darkeneſſe are fyrſt all mans power, wyſdom, and rygh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, the whiche, though they glyſter and ſhyne before men, yet to optayne the grace of God thereby, to apeace gods wrath to make ſatiſfaccion for oure ſynnes, and to get the true bleſſe wyth them, they are but euen darkneſſe. Secondly are the darkneſſe all doctrines of philoſophers, all lawes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Heythen, or of Moſes. For thoſe though they be profitable, and be neceſſarye to redreſſe maners by them, and to repreſſe the wycked, yet to put awaye ſynne with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and to get the true ryghteouſneſſe before God, they are euen darkneſſe. Only Chriſt is the lyghte, becauſe that whoſo beleueth hys goſpell, hath the clenſynge and remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſynnes thorowe hym, the whiche is oure ryghteouſneſſe, conſiſtynge in the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God. Finally are oure ſynnes, death and hell darkneſſe, but Chriſte is the true lyght,

For yf God hath not ſpared the naturall brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, let vs beware, leſt he ſpare not vs alſo. God refuſed the Iewes for theyr wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, howe muche more ſhall he refuſe vs Gentiles, yf we be lyke vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe? He refuſed the Iewes, not becauſe they crucifyed Chriſte, but becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued not in hym who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they crucifyed, nother repented at the preachynge of the goſpell of Ieſu Chriſte: Euen ſo ſhall not God refuſe vs, becauſe we haue ſynned, (orels had we ben longe ſence refuſed,) but we ſhalbe refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe we wyll not beleue hys Goſpel agaynſte whome we haue ſynned, nother haue done penaunce by fayth, but partly per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecute the goſpel wyth tyranny, partly with deſpyſynge and lothſomneſſe. Therfore let vs be diligent by obedience vnto the goſpel, that the ſame glory of Chriſte that is come and tranſlated vnto vs, do abyde with vs for euer, and not be ſklaundered by oure miſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haueoure and vngodly lyuynge. For better were it that a milſtone were hanged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute oure neckes and we caſte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſee, than ony ſklaunder vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God and hys holy worde ſhulde come by vs.</p>

Wherein fyrſt by his owne enſample he ſheweth wher by the true peace and tranquillite of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth come, and whereby we become wyllynge to dye, namely thereby, that we knowe Chriſte to be the ouercommer and vanquiſher of ſynne and Death. For yf we do beholde the Death in vs and in herſelfe, ther is nothynge more haynous or dredeful.

               <p>Moreouer doth Simeon ſette forth Chriſte with thre goodly titles, callyng hym the Saueoure of all people, the lyght of the Gentyles, and the glory of Iſrael: that with theſe titles he myght ſo ſet forth the maieſty of Chriſte, that ether he myght prouoke the vnbeleuynge to the fayth, or ſtablyſhe the weake in fayth, or kepe them that be ſtronge</p>
