         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
GRAND CHEAT
Cryed up under-hand by many in the Factious and Giddy part of the
Army; and greedily ſwallowed down by many People that do not
diſcern the <hi>Poyſon</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> thereof; in ſeverall Particulars,
as followeth.</head>
            <byline>By
<hi>One that was A Member of the Army whilſt they were Obedient to Authority.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>FIrſt, If you Accept a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> as the Caſe now ſtandeth, you Conclude the Army to be Supream; than which nothing is
more dangerous: for that the firſt Queſtion that would be moved in a Free Parliament, will be, How the Nation ſhall be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned?
It is eaſily to be Reſolved, what would be the Reſolution in a Free Parliament, that is to ſay, <hi>A King.</hi> This will be the
way and means to keep the Nation in perpetuall Slavery; for that the difference between the Honeſt part of the Army now under
<hi>Monck</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and elſewhere; and the Diſobedient Officers of the Army, who Uſurp the Erecting a Government, and the giving their
Military Sanction: The Honeſt part of the Army, they deſire that the Settlement of the Nation may be from a Civil Power; therefore they
Endeavour, That the Parliament lately Interrupted, may again Return to the Exerciſe of their Authority: For ſeverall Reaſons;
The Chief of which are, This Parliament, although they are under the Evill Aſpect of a great part of the Nation; yet, let it be duly
conſidered, and it will be found, that the Reaſons for which the Nation doth ſo much diſreſpect them, is, for that they were for the moſt
part over-ruled, and their Councels were Influenced by the Factious and Diſobedient part of the Army; ſo that they never could accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
the good they Declared for, or Intended to the Publique. But now the Caſe is far different, of which they have given ample
Teſtimony, in their Endeavouring to bring the Army to their Duty and Obedience (in their laſt Sitting); So that as formerly they did
adhere to the Army againſt the Publique Intereſt out of Neceſſity; Now they muſt adhere to the Intereſt of the Publique, againſt the
Intereſt of the Factious and Diſobedient part of the Army, that have been the Cauſe of All the Unquiet, Unſettlement, and Changes
that have been of late years produced, to the Detriment of the Publick: and unleſſe the Army be purged of them, they will be the Authors
and Abettors of more Changes, to the Ruine of All.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is the Intereſt of the Nation to expect Settlement by Succeſſion of Parliaments, conveyed to Poſterity by their Authority:
A <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> 'tis true, will pleaſe moſt of People; yet if they ſhall receive a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> from the <hi>Army,</hi> or by their permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Authority of the Army is then, and thereby, granted and concluded to be Supream. If ſo, Then how will Poſterity be bound to
curſe Us, if We do ſubmit to ſuch a Snare and Bait as that will prove in the Iſſue?</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, If the Nation doth ſubmit to any kind of Government, that ſhall be inſtituted by the <hi>Army,</hi> let it be a <hi>Free Parliament</hi>
or a <hi>Parliament</hi> under Qualifications, ſtill the Caſe is the ſame; you receive your Laws from the Sword, and make the <hi>Army</hi> the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
for which Power no Ballance can be found: So that they will run into all Extreams of Tyranny and Uncertainty, which are equally
dangerous with the worſt of Miſchiefs.</p>
            <p>If they permit a free Parliament, then they will quarrel with them, and turn Them out of Doors for adhearing to a King or Single
Perſon: If they give You a Parliament under qualifications, then they will be the Interpreters of thoſe qualifications, and ſo often as the
Parliaments ſo qualified, ſhall not keep tune to their Luſts, Pride, and Ambition; ſo often ſhall the Nation be bereaved of Parliaments:
So that if that the Parliament now in beeing, by Vertue of that Act that maketh Them no leſs then a Parliament, untill They ſhall diſolve
Themſelves: Do not ſettle your Government, and eſtabliſh a Law for ſucceſſion of Parliaments. The Army will be your Supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Standerd to your Liberties, to meaſure out to you what Liberty or Slavery they pleaſe: as the Caſe ſtandeth, it appeareth to be
nothing leſs then madneſs, That People ſhould be contented to ſubmit to a proud Inſolent Army, rather then to this Parliament, if they
cannot have a free Parliament; But ſome may ſay, That the Sheriffs may Elect a Parliament, by Vertue of the Act for Tryenial Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
To that I anſwer, then you make the Sheriffs to be the Supream Authority, or elſe Him or Them, That ſhall appoint the Time for their
Convention, That proviſo was made in reſpect to an orderly Convening and Determination, which is diſcompoſed by the many and various
Events of affairs that hath happened amongſt Us; the which, muſt be ſet right by the again ſitting of the Parliament, the which, is the Intereſt
of every Individual Engliſh-man; without which, every Intereſt in the Nation will be deſtroyed by an Ignorant and Unskilful, Proud
Malicious, and Inſolent pack of Giddy Fellows; Who will adventure to Change the Government of three Nations upon half an hours
Conſideration: the Effect of their Ambition, and then ſay God led them to it. If theſe Perſons be fit to fit at the Helm of Affair? Let
the World Judge.</p>
            <p>If it were ſo, That the Inſignificant General Council of Legiſlating Corporals and Landſprizadoes could hitt upon the beſt Form of
Government under Heaven, (a thing impoſſible for them, to do any thing elſe then what ſhall be nonſence it ſelf, above which their Capacities
cannot reach,) It would be dangerous to receive it from them, for that thoſe that have abſolute Power to do Good, have alſo abſolute Power
to do Evil; and the Nation can expect no aſſurance to the contrary from them, but from ſuch a Power as are limited by time, or otherwiſe
they may.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Parliament</hi> is already limited to <hi>May</hi> the 6th. as to Time, and are more eſpecially limited by Intereſt, which will not, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſupport them in Power beyond that time: So that by this means, whatever the Nation can expect by Succeſſion of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> will be
convayed to them, without running the hazard of truſting a perfidious <hi>Army.</hi>
