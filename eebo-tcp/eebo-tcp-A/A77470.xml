            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FRiend, had I leaſure and ſtrength, I ſhould tell you the ſaddeſt ſtorie that I think you ever heard, of a Town no bigger then <hi>Marleborough,</hi> where in three hours time were conſumed at leaſt two hundred and fifty houſes, and all thoſe the chiefeſt, not one Shopkeepers houſe ſtanding, not ſcarce one ſufficient mans, except Mr. Majors, and that was entered upon by the fire, but God made me an inſtrument to ſave it; and in probability, by ſo doing the moſt part of the poor houſes now left: all the other lying in the duſt. My loſs is about 2000 pounds, 1100 in houſes, 300 quarter of mault, 100 l. in wood, beſides houſholdſtuff, ſome goods, and money, and goods lent to ſeverall men that were ſufficient before this ſad calamity, but now are not able to pay four pence. But all this troubleth me not ſo much as that many honeſt and ſufficient Tradeſmen have not money to buy bread; though I praiſe God, I have; and divers friends in and about the Town would entertaine me: but I bleſſe God, I am not yet brought ſo low, and I truſt that no man ſhall loſe four pence by me, neither ſhall they ſo long as I have three pence leſt. I have gotten two rooms to make a ſhop of, in the moſt convenient houſe, though a thatched one. We have ſent three friends to the Generall, and I hope every good man will be put forward by all that have heard of the once flouriſhing condition of <hi>Marleborough,</hi> that it may be built again: If not, we are all utterly undone for ever both for Trade and Lodging, for we have not one Inne left ſtanding in the Town. The Lord keep you, and your true loving friend to his poor power.</p>

S. <hi>Maries</hi> Church, with the Market houſe, and all the chief houſes in the Town on both ſides of the high Street burned to duſt: three hundred families at leaſt out of doors. I do not know well what courſe to take for the preſent. Pray tell Mr. <hi>Sparks</hi> of this. The loſſe is unſpeakable, all being on fire in an inſtant of Time. I reſt your loving friend</p>

            <p>ON Thurſday laſt there hapned in our town a great and lamentable fire, which did burn down and conſume all the eminent parts of the Town. The fire did begin almoſt at S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, at <hi>Francis Freemans</hi> houſe, a Tanner, on the ſouth ſide of the high ſtreet, and did burn down both ſides of the way: not one houſe eſcaped. It burnt the Town-hall, the Market-place, and four or five tunne of Cheeſe in it; alſo S. <hi>Maries</hi> Church, and the chiefeſt part of S. <hi>Maries</hi> Pariſh is burnt. The like fire was ſcarce ever ſeen by any man in <hi>England,</hi> it is thought there are between three or four hundred houſes burnt: the loſs cannot be conceived as yet: all the ſhops and Innes in the Town are burnt to the ground. It hath pleaſed God to ſpare our houſe, (yet we had a great loſs) which we acknowledge his great mercy to us in ſparing us. It is a great and ſore affliction; I pray God it may be ſanctified to us, that ſo we may have cauſe to ſay, It was good for us that we were afflicted.</p>

            <p>IT pleaſed God that on Thurſday the 28. of April 1653. in the out-houſing of one <hi>Francis Freeman</hi> a <hi>Tanner,</hi> almoſt at the Weſt-end of the High-ſtreet, near St. <hi>Peters Church,</hi> on the ſouth ſide, his people being drying of <hi>Barke,</hi> it took fire about 7 or 8 of the clock in the morning, and they endeavoured to put it out: the Neighbours eſpying of it profered their helpe, which was refuſed, <hi>Mr. Freeman</hi> himſelf being (as it is ſaid) from home. At laſt it prevailed ſo much that it took hold of the dwelling houſe, and grew ſo violent on a ſuddain, that within a ſhort ſpace the fire by the hand of God was carryed from this ſide of the ſtreet to the other ſide on the North of at: So that it took hold of ſome thatched houſes, and the ſtacks of wood in their backſide, and ſo ſuddenly ran along the whole length of the Town Eaſtward, and totally conſumed the ſtreet on both ſides, in three or four houres ſpace, as is before related.</p>
