                  <note>Seafaring men have not gained by the late war. Customs are paid so that the seas may be guarded, but now there is no convoy to the Netherlands or France, so that all goods are sent in Dutch bottoms who can set sail in a day. Cites statutes forbidding this. Prays that four or five ships be set apart as constant convoys between Gravesend and the Netherlands. [With two orders of the Commons concerning the matter] -- Cf. Steele.</note>
                  <note>At foot: This petition being presented by several masters and commanders of ships, the honorable House of Commons after the reading thereof made two orders to this effect: Die Lunæ, 11 September 1648. Ordered by the Commons assembled in Parliament, that it be referred to the Committee of Complaints to receive the particular grievances complained of in by the petitioners, and that they report them to this House. Ordered that a reference be sent unto the lord admirall, to the end that a constant convoy may be provided to guard the merchant ships, for the advance of the trade of the nation.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The humble Petition and Repreſentation of divers well-affected

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat as in Judgment and Conſcience (being thereunto induced by the ſolemn Declarations of this Honourable Houſe) they at firſt did, and ſtill do, contribute their
Eſtates, and adventure their lives, for the preſervation of the Parliaments honor, ſo they alſo expected the ſecuring of the peoples juſt Rights and Liberties.</p>
            <p>That, contrary to the ſaid <hi>Declarations,</hi> and their own <hi>Expectations,</hi> they have found ſuch practiſes promoted of late days, as hath not only wounded the
<hi>Parliaments honor,</hi> and made them become odious in the eyes of many of the Nation, but alſo (inſtead of <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Preſervation,</hi> ſo ſolemnly promiſed to the
<hi>People) ſlavery</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion</hi> is entaild to them and their poſterity, as the only <hi>price</hi> of that <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>treaſure</hi> ſo freely <hi>lent</hi> and <hi>expended</hi> in the late War.</p>
            <p>That as <hi>Seamen</hi> have not had the <hi>leaſt ſhare</hi> in contributing their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and venturing their <hi>Lives,</hi> for to preſerve your <hi>honor</hi> and their own <hi>Freedom,</hi> ſo
none hath reaped <hi>leſs benefit,</hi> nor found more <hi>diſreſpect</hi> nor <hi>diſcouragement</hi> from the <hi>Parliament</hi> then they.</p>
            <p>That though they have conſtantly paid <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> which were <hi>ordained</hi> and <hi>granted</hi> for no other end but that the <hi>Seas</hi> might be <hi>guarded</hi> by a competent number of Ships for the
advancing of <hi>Trade,</hi> and encouragement of thoſe men which ſhould venture their Eſtates in a Merchandizing way to ſupport the ſeveral Manufactures of the Nation; as appears by
many Statutes, eſpecially that of the 1. of King <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 33. Yea though as an Additional Charge we have paid <hi>Exciſe</hi> alſo; yet we have found our ſelves wholly <hi>neglected</hi> and
<hi>oppreſſed,</hi> and the <hi>Seas</hi> worſe guarded then ever, no <hi>Convoy</hi> being allowed to ſecure our ſhips and goods in their paſſage to the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> by reaſon whereof Your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
are almoſt utterly ruined.</p>
            <p>That for want of proviſion herein <hi>Merchants</hi> daily <hi>refuſe</hi> to ſhip their goods with us, and chooſe rather to ſhip them in Dutch Bottoms, whom they ſay have a conſtant Convoy,
and can ſet ſail at a day, then with us, who they ſay muſt (to the loſs of their markets) ſtay in the Downs till a <hi>Convoy</hi> be ready; for which cauſe ſeveral goods hath been ſeveral

of many hundred families, whoſe livelyhoods depend thereon.</p>
            <p>That we find our real and conſtant adherence to the Parliament hath added in a great meaſure to our miſery; for ſuch is the Malignancy of many Merchants, that they <hi>refuſe</hi> to
employ us becauſe we have been <hi>active</hi> in ſupporting your <hi>Intereſt</hi> in the <hi>Navy,</hi> eſpecially in aſſiſting the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> in the making up the <hi>preſent Fleet;</hi> for which we receive
many <hi>reproaches,</hi> nay, <hi>aſſaults</hi> and <hi>affronts,</hi> not only to the detriment of our <hi>names,</hi> but hazard of our <hi>lives,</hi> by evil affected perſons; ſo that unleſs this honorable Houſe be pleaſed
to take us into timely conſideration, we are like not only to be expoſed to <hi>want</hi> and <hi>miſery,</hi> but alſo to be neceſſitated to fly to the <hi>prime Laws of Nature for refuge,</hi> and to abandon

will doubtleſs ſuffer us to reap <hi>ſome fruit</hi> of our <hi>labour,</hi> if we be inſtrumental in the increaſe and ſupport of their glory.</p>
            <p>We are ſenſible, though willing to forget the great oppreſſions we lie under by <hi>Monopolies</hi> and <hi>reſtraint of Trade;</hi> the <hi>illegal Liberty</hi> taken, and countenanced in Merchants
ſhipping Goods in Forraign Bottoms, contrary to ſeveral Statutes, eſpecially 2 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. chap. 3. 14 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. chap. 6. 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> chap. 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The rigorous exaction of Cuſtoms and Exciſe, even of the <hi>poorest Seamen,</hi> and vexatious proceedings of <hi>Committees thereupon,</hi> to the total diſheartening of all Seamen; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
our <hi>Trade</hi> at <hi>Sea,</hi> which was wont to be the <hi>glory of the Nation,</hi> is now totally loſt, and many thouſands which lived comfortably thereon, and were ſerviceable to the

            <p>If therefore there yet be any bowels of Compaſſion remaining in you toward a <hi>distreſſed,</hi> yea almoſt <hi>deſtroyed people,</hi> let ſome <hi>yernings of ſpirit</hi> be ſpeedily manifeſted: and as
an evidence thereof we deſire.</p>
            <p>That ſince the <hi>Hollander</hi> hath almoſt <hi>engroſſed</hi> all the <hi>Trade</hi> at <hi>Sea,</hi> and now abſolutely <hi>refuſeth</hi> to grant <hi>Convoys</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as heretofore; and foraſmuch as thereby <hi>our
Trade</hi> is wholy deſtroyed, ſome <hi>Merchants</hi> not <hi>daring,</hi> and others <hi>abſolutely refuſing</hi> to ſhip their Goods with us, for want hereof; and ſeveral quantities of <hi>fine goods</hi>
being now in the <hi>Netherland,</hi> which cannot be brought home (being now, not only denyed a <hi>Convoy</hi> by the <hi>Dutch;</hi> but alſo expreſs command given to their <hi>Convoyers</hi>
that none of them ſhall take any Engliſh Ships into their protection) although ſome Engliſh Ships have waited there this three moneths for the ſame.</p>
            <p>That therefore this Houſe would be pleaſed to appoint <hi>four or five fitting ſhips</hi> to ſerve as <hi>conſtant Convoys</hi> to guard our ſhipping from <hi>Graveſend</hi> into the <hi>Ports</hi> in
the <hi>Netherlands</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and return back with others homeward bound: That being the <hi>constant order</hi> of the <hi>Hollander,</hi> by which means their <hi>Trade</hi> is increaſed,
and they mightily <hi>enriched.</hi> That this Houſe will <hi>prevent</hi> that <hi>neceſſity</hi> which muſt (if not removed) occaſion an eſtrangement of our <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>aſſistance</hi> toward you.
That as ſoon as may be all <hi>Monopolies</hi> and <hi>reſtraint of Trade</hi> be removed, and ſome way taken to prevent the ſhipping of Goods in <hi>Forraign Bottoms,</hi> to the end that Trade
may again be reſtored, and the Glory of the Nation preſerved.</p>
