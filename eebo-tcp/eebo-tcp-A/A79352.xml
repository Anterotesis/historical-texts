            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now (though We have made a firm and ſtrict reſolution with Our Self, never to give any the leaſt Countenance or Imployment, to Men of ſuch Inclinations; to the end that all Our Subjects, may at laſt perceive, that it will be their Intereſt, as well as their Religion, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Virtuous and Sober Perſons; Yet) becauſe ſuch Methods as theſe, are not like to prove of ſo quick an operation as the infectious Manners of ſome Men do require;</p>
            <p>We do therefore hereby ſtraitly Charge and Command All Our Subjects, of what Quality or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſoever they be, That they preſume not, contrary to the good Laws and Statutes made in the time of Our Royal Father, and Grand-father, to be Tipling in any Tavern, Victualling-houſe, Ale-houſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And We do further Charge and Command All Mayors, Bayliffs, Sheriffs, Iuſtices of Peace, Conſtables, and other Officers, to take ſtrict care that this Our Proclamation be duly Obeyed, and to enter into any Tavern, Ale-houſe, or other Tipling-houſe, to ſearch for ſuch diſorderly Perſons as ſhall be found there Tipling contrary to the ſaid Laws, or that ſhall abide there after the hour of Nine of the Clock, in contempt of Our Laws, and this Our Proclamation, and to Levy the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, and cauſe the Offenders, together with the Maſter or Miſtreſs of ſuch reſpective houſe where they ſhall be found, to come before the next Iuſtice of Peace, who is hereby required to cauſe all and every the Perſons ſo brought before him, to enter into Bond for their Appearance at the next Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Peace to be held within their reſpective Limits, and then, and there, to anſwer ſuch matters as ſhall be objected againſt them on Our behalf.</p>
            <p>And to the end that no inferiour Officers, or Miniſters of Juſtice, may be any ways diſcouraged, in their diligent and vigorous Proſecution of theſe Our Commands; We do hereby Publiſh and Declare, That if any Our Officers aforeſaid, ſhall be reſiſted in the execution of this his Charge, or any ways affronted or abuſed, We ſhall look upon it as a Contempt of Our own Perſon and Authority, and cauſe it to be Proſecuted and Vindicated accordingly.</p>
