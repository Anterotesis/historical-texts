         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing within theſe few daies lighted vpon this booke, by the meanes of a familiar friend of mine, who lately had receiued it out of <hi>France,</hi> and conſidering the happy ſubiect and methodicall compoſure thereof, I thought it would not be amiſſe (nay rather a very profitable worke for the Church, at leaſt for the bringing home of ſuch, of whom there is yet good hope they may be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) if I did ſet by ſome few of theſe vacation
<pb facs="tcp:17711:3"/>
houres for the tranſlating thereof. And I was the rather induced thereunto, by reaſon of a more particular charge, which not long ſince it pleaſed you to lay vpon me, to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming whereof this might (with Gods helpe) not a little auaile. The points perhaps that are handled in this Treatiſe, or at leaſt moſt of them, haue beene formerly and often diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the full by others, but yet very ſeldome (would to God it happened more often) by way of recantation or reclaiming: and if in that manner, as of late we haue had an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereof, <note place="margin">The aduice of a ſonne, &amp;c. printed at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> 1616.</note> and our Preſſe is yet hot with it, (I would our affections were ſo alſo) yet moſt ſeldome by men of my Authors coat, by ſuch I meane who are ſo farre gone, and ſunke ſo deepe into the whirle-poole of their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they haue with a neerer bond, and as it were an apprentiſhip for terme of life, bound themſelues neuer to depart, I will not ſay, from their religion (for that is common to them with others) but from their particular order and quinteſſence as it were of religion; it being from thence that ſuch only (and no others, either of their Clergie or Laitie) are called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and by way of eminencie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious.
<pb facs="tcp:17711:3"/>
Hauing thus ſhewed the profit which (I truſt) may come from this my ſmall ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, or rather from the Authors owne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours &amp; trauels (his indeed being as the very waters of life, the only taſting whereof is ſalvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall, and mine but the channell to conuey them) it remaines now that I recommend this my labour to your patronage, from whom I firſt receiued the occaſion of taking it in hand. I will not now ſtand vpon Apologies (as the manner of moſt is) either for my ſelfe or the booke. The booke (I am ſure) needs none; and for my ſelfe, I truſt, I haue met with a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron that wil reade me without any Apologie. If any ſhall thinke I haue beene too buſie herein, it being a ſubiect for the which I am ſcarce ripe; let him know thus much, that what I haue done, may be the worke, nay ought of dutie ſo to be, I ſay not, of euery Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, (<hi>Quanquam ô,</hi> would to God euery ſuch would put to their helping hands) but of euery one that is onely brought vp in the bare ſchoole of Chriſtianitie. Thus committing my ſelfe and theſe my labours to your good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, I pray to the Almighty God, that he will continue and confirme in his Church
<pb facs="tcp:17711:4"/>
thoſe that to all appearance are in already, with the ninety and nine of that good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard in the Goſpell, and that it will pleaſe him, with the ſame Shepheard who brought home his one ſheepe, daily to bring home and adde vnto his true Church, ſuch as either by others ſeducing haue ſtraied from, or out of forced ignorance neuer could finde the way to his fold.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Irs, I haue a long while debated and diſputed with my ſelfe, whether I ſhould ſet to your view the cauſes and reaſons of my retreate from you and your Church, and of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion and vnion to the Reformed ones of this Kingdome, and their ſocietie and company. On the one ſide, the ſinceritie of my intention in this charge ſeemed wholly to diuert, turne, and hinder me from ſo doing, as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring very little what men thought, ſpake, or eſteemed of it; ſo that my actions were pleaſing and acceptable to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame and eternall maieſty of my God, conformable to his holy and diuine will, tending and redounding to his honour and glory, and aduantagious and profitable for mine owne good and ſaluation. And beſides contenting my ſelfe with that which I haue ſpoken, treated, and declared thereof in my Profeſsion, made in the Church of this Citie, the <hi>24.</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> But on the other ſide, the duties and obligations which I owe to the truth, ioyned with the moſt affectionate ſuits and opportunities, which almost an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber haue vſed towards me, and often reiterated, and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies and ſlaunders, wherewith many amongst you (though vniuſtly and wrongfully) doe charge me, doe force and conſtraine me to ſet downe in this paper, produce to the day and bring to light, that which almoſt I then ſaid of it; this only excepted, that now I will enlarge my ſelfe a little
<pb facs="tcp:17711:5"/>
more, then the ſhortneſſe of the time and diſcourſe could at that time permit me. I haue thought and beleeued that I could not more iuſtly, and with better reaſon and equitie, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this Treatiſe to any, then to thoſe, from whom I ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelfe, to the end I might take from them the idle and light opinions, and the bad beliefes, farre remoued from pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and honeſty, and remoue the ſcandall which they might haue conceiued therevpon. Receiue it therefore, I pray you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the ſame gentlenes and ſincerity of affection, with the which I offer and preſent it vnto you. And doe mee the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to take the paines to read it; but with quietneſſe, if it pleaſe you, and tranquillity of minde, without trouble and paſsion. And I hope, nay I am certaine, and aſſure my ſelfe that you ſhall finde, that there is more reaſon and knowledge in my action, then you thinke, and more obligation to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, and to do that which I haue done, then you imagine. To this end I doe open all the ſecrets of my heart, and foulds of my ſoule before the Maieſty of my God: and in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, with a ſolemne oath and proteſtation, that I will ſay nothing but the truth. I beſeech the diuine goodneſſe, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt you with his grace and heauenly light, to make you know clearely both the one and the other. I doe pray with all my heart, and with as great affection, as I am verily, and ſhal be all my life, notwithſtanding this change and alteration of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and departure from you, and your ſociety &amp; company.</p>

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:17711:6"/>I am now come to the 32. yeare of mine age, or thereabouts; and though it hath beene with much paines, weariſomneſſe, and trauell, partly in my ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and partly in my other publike or priuate buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, yet I doe not thinke (thankes to Gods bountie) that I euer did weare in my countenance and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head any marke whatſoeuer, which might make mee bluſh for ſhame, or hinder mee from going with my head lifted vp aloft. I haue not loſt with that little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience which I haue gotten in the world, the deſire of going on and ending my life in the ſame bed of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſtate of innocencie, for to proſtitute that ſo lightly, which I haue kept and maintained ſo dearely and with ſo much care. And how weake ſoeuer I am in body and minde, yet the lightneſſe, inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and inconſtancie, which ſome cloſely obiect vnto me and reproach mee withall, hath not as yet (God be thanked) ſo farre poſſeſſed my braines, as that any one ſhould haue ſeene from thence to iſſue the effects of follie; and I hope that his goodneſſe will not derelinquiſh or leaue me to that wretched and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable extremitie. As for the matter and occaſion of diſcontent, which ſome others produce and lay abroad, I ſhould be to blame, and ſhould lie, if I ſhould complaine thereof; it being true (and I muſt needs auouch and confeſſe it ingenuouſly) that I haue beene but too much beloued, cheriſhed, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in that ſtate wherein I was, and as much or more aduanced then I could haue deſired, wiſhed, or chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, hauing beene put to the ſtudie of Philoſophie and Diuinitie euen ſooner then their cuſtomes, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and ordinances could well allow of and permit,

hauing alſo beene made Prieſt preciſely at the time permitted and appointed, and eftſoones admitted and preferred to the office of preaching, which I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to exerciſe from my 25. yeare, and alwayes ſince continued at <hi>Burges, Bloys,</hi> in this City, <hi>Tours, Angiers, Chaſteaugontier, Laval, Mayenne, le Mans, Alenſon, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and other ſuch like wel knowne townes of <hi>France,</hi> with all kinde of contentment and ſatisfaction (thanks be to God) being welcome to all, and vnderſtood by euery one. As for the libertie and a more licentious life, which others laſt of all doe obiect vnto me, God knowes and is my record (and experience alſo can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it, and giue an aſſured proofe thereof) that I haue had nothing leſſe in my minde and thought then that, but rather on the contrary it was the deſire of a more retired, ſolitary, peaceable and quiet life, and for to put an end to thoſe poaſtings and vagaries, which are ordinary and eſſentiall to men of that eſtate and condition, who like <hi>Daedalus</hi> his images are in a perpetuall ſtirring, motion, and agitation. But if that had beene the cauſe, I neede not to haue come out from thence where I was, ſuch occaſions and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities offering and preſenting themſelues daily vnto me (as well as to others, yea a thouſand times more) if I would haue taken and accepted them as well as they. But God by his infinite goodneſſe and mercy hath kept and preſerued mee euen againſt theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, wherein the ſtrongeſt and perfecteſt in ſhew haue ſhamefully yeelded and foulely fallen.</p>
                  <p>I would not therefore ſo play with my ſelfe, and and out of an humour (as it were) change my Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if that I had not ſome ſound cauſe and ground for

it, it being otherwiſe very eaſie for me (if I had willed) to keepe my wonted manner of life, and to keepe my ſelfe (ſo doing) from ſo many blowes of the tongue, from wry lookes, from pricking ſuſpicions, which I haue (in truth) to the quicke felt, and doe yet feele in good earneſt. But there is no remedy: I muſt reſolue with my ſelfe to ſwallow downe by little and little this cup of bitterneſſe for the loue of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> who (ſaith <hi>S.

                  <p>What doe I then? And by your fauour I doe pray you (you which take the paines and the patience to reade theſe draughts of my penne, or rather of my ſoule) to thinke on mee with as much attention, as I my ſelfe haue thought of it, and to weigh my reaſons with the iuſt balance of reaſon it ſelfe, and then I am certaine and aſſured that you will iudge and finde me as farre from haſtineſſe, precipitation, inconſtancie, inconſiderateneſſe of minde, and other ſuch like things, which many amongſt you, yea it may be your ſelues doe obiect vnto me and reproach me withall, as I am neere to the truth.</p>
                  <p>My change and my departure doe ſeeme ſtrange to you, I deſire it. I can doe nothing in it, much leſſe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17711:8"/>
and ſtop the readineſſe of your mindes. But if it pleaſe you to ſtay a while with mee, I ſhall it may be make this change more familiar vnto you. For it firſt of all it be ſtrange vnto you, becauſe that euery alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and change of religion is ſimply ſo of it ſelfe, and that we ought to end in that wherein we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; what then I pray will become of thoſe among the Iewes, Turkes, the men of <hi>Iapan,</hi> of <hi>Margaia,</hi> and other barbarous and ſtrange nations, which haue changed and daily doe change their owne religion, and that of their fathers, in the which they had beene nurtured and brought vp, for to make themſelues Chriſtians, to wed themſelues to the law and faith of our Sauiour, and to profeſſe his religion? If it be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that more particularly and ſpecially it is ill done to depart from your company, you might haue right therein, if you or your Doctors could enlighten or eaſe me in this doubt. But I thinke that you and they would be troubled as much to doe that, as to proue, ſhew, and make it plaine vnto me, that yours is more worth and truer then that which I haue embraced, the which notwithſtanding would be wholly and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together requiſite and neceſſary to that proofe.</p>
                  <p>From whence then (you will ſay vnto me) commeth this ſo ſudden a change? From the ſpeciall and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar grace of God, and from the particular knowledge which it hath pleaſed his goodneſſe to giue me, for to depart from the diſorders, abuſes, and errours of your Church, as well in matter of faith and doctrine, as of manners. It is very long ſince I began to know and take notice of them; finding it very ſtrange, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, without reaſon, nay againſt all reaſon both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

and humane, and not being able to comprehend and conceiue,<note place="margin">Bellar. caeterique omnes vna voce &amp; communi conſenſu.</note> 1. How the holy Scriptures (and the Spirit of God ſpeaking in them) were not the certaine and infallible rule of faith, but rather men which are blinde, ignorant, and faultie of their owne nature: 2. That they were obſcure, doubtfull, vnperfect, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inſufficient to ſaluation: 3. That of themſelues without traditions they were not ſo neceſſary, and that the traditions of themſelues purely and ſimply (without the ſaid Scriptures) were abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: 4. How the ſubſtance of bread and wine were changed and conuerted into the ſubſtance of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt: 5. How the humanitie of our Sauiour in the ſame Sacrament was ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent almoſt euery where, or at leaſt was really in almoſt infinite, diſtinct, and ſeuered places in one and the ſame inſtant: 6. How the Maſſe was a true, proper, reall, and ſubſtantiall ſacrifice, in the which the body of Chriſt in his owne eſſence, ſubſtance, and nature and proper perſon, was againe offered, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and ſacrificed by the hands of the Prieſt to the euerlaſting Father, for the expiation of our faults, ſinnes and offences: 7. How there was a <hi>Purgatorie</hi> and ſet place wherein the ſoules of the faithfull after this life were detained for the ſatisfaction of their crimes: 8. How the ſaid ſoules could be helped by the ſuffrages of the liuing, as by praiers, cries, almes, and other the like, but eſpecially by applying of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Papall Indulgences: 9. How there was in the Church a treaſure compoſed of the ſuperfluous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Virgin, of the Saints, &amp;c. which could bee applied to the liuing and to the dead for a ſatisfaction
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17711:9"/>
and remiſſion of their faults and offences: 10. And that this application belonged and was proper to the Pope alone, who might diſpoſe thereof as ſhould ſeeme good vnto him, and deliuer by the meanes thereof the ſoules detained in this pretended <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie</hi> at his will and pleaſure: 11. How <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> was not alone the only ſufficient <hi>Mediator, Interceſſor,</hi> and <hi>Aduocate</hi> for vs to his euerlaſting Father: and that for this purpoſe we ought to reſort and haue our refuge to the Saints and bleſſed ones: and that a thouſand other ſuch like things which you beleeue, and your Doctors teach and preach, ought to be held for Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of faith, there not being any trace or ground of them in the ſacred Scripture, the true rule of that which ought to be beleeued and done. Not being able (I ſay) to perſwade my ſelfe that that was the true Church, in the which the true faith and the doctrine of the Goſpell was held and taught, wherein the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, life and actions were ſo contrary and oppoſite vnto them, and the corruption ſo great and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally diffuſed and extended throughout. But thoſe were but ſmall, light, and vaine <hi>Ideaes,</hi> which went no farther by reaſon of the negligence (as I beleeue) in the which the watchings which I beſtowed on my ſtudies and other buſineſſes kept me aſleepe: as alſo by reaſon of the age whereof I was, which for that time did not giue me more liuely conceits thereof for want of ſome body that might haue heartened them on farther, as indeed I was bred in the midſt of them who beleeued and did the quite contrary. Thus did my ſimplicitie hatch my ignorance, wherein I liued fiue or ſix whole yeers ſince this firſt glimpſe of light,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17711:10"/>
which did kindle in my ſoule and heart this deſire and affection of the truth, and to returne to this firſt ſpring and originall of the faith and manners of the Apoſtles and Diſciples of the Sonne of God our Sauiour, yet of that very Sauiour, from whom by proceſſe of time euen your Church hath ſwarued. At the end of which yeeres finally it hath pleaſed that ſupreme goodneſſe and maieſtie (which doth impart and communicate his graces and fauours to whom he thinkes good, yea oftentimes to leaſt worthy and capable ſubiects, and makes the ſplendor of his euerlaſting light to caſt his beames on thoſe ſoules that are deepeſt plunged into the obſcuritie of darkneſſe) to poure out on mine the amplitude and greatneſſe of his heauenly and diuine benedictions, and to make mee to ſee abundantly, purely and to the full, in their owne eſſence and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall day, both the truth and falſhood, and to harden, ſtrengthen and encourage my minde for to embrace valorouſly the one, and to reiect the other, againſt all the obiects and repreſentations of humane reaſon, the attractiue and alluring perſwaſions of nature, the impetuous aſſaults of fleſh and bloud, and the ſtrong ſuggeſtions and temptations of the deuill, and the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and bloudy combats of hell.

This my

the metaphore and compariſon of a materiall edifice and building (which that it may be firme, ſound, and laſting, hath neceſſarily neede of a good ſtrong foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of firme and hard ſtones, laid very farre and deepe in the ground) he declareth, ſignifieth, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth cleerely to vnderſtand, that the true faith and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe in Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour (ſuch as he teacheth and ſheweth vs in his writings) is the true, ſure, and onely foundation, and the ſolid and ſetled ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke of all Chriſtian religion, and conſequently by a neceſſary ſequele, of euerlaſting ſaluation, according to my propoſition, which for this firſt point remaines enough by this place and ſufficiently proued. As alſo no man doth deny it and call it in queſtion, but all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally doe admit and receiue it for a certaine and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured ground.</p>
                  <p>Let vs come to the proofe of the ſecond point thereof, to wit, of Charitie: I had need of more time then the ſhortneſſe of this diſcourſe can affoord mee, for to relate all the places of holy Scripture making for this purpoſe.

the which neither one nor the other (as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid) can remaine and continue ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſee whether thoſe two grounds and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſaluation be or can be found in your Church, and in the ſtate and condition from whence I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, to the end that from thence you may know and iudge, whether I haue had iuſt cauſe and lawfull occaſion to doe this or no; and that the tongues that make themſelues malicious and ſlanderous, may ceaſe from their calumnious aſſaults and purſuits. And to begin with the faith and beleefe in Ieſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">How the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts faile in matters of faith.</note> wee haue amongſt many others three things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in him; 1. his perſon, 2. his charge and offices, 3. the ſingular graces, fauours and benefits which hee hath conferred on vs, and wee haue receiued from him.</p>
                  <p>As for his perſon,<note place="margin">1.

Now although your Doctours directly and openly doe not beate downe and deſtroy theſe two things in the Sonne of God our Sauiour; yet ſo it is notwithſtanding that by

manner of conſequence and neceſſary ſequele, they take from him, rob him of, and carry away at the leaſt his humanitie, when as they ſay (and it is their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doctrine and vniuerſall beleefe) that in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt, by the meanes which they call (and they haue forged and inuented it for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues but of late times) of tranſubſtantiation, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of bread and wine is conuerted and changed (they are the proper words of the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> in the firſt and ſecond Canon of the fourth chapter, and of all your Doctours in dependance thereof) into the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt; which is properly and to ſpeake truly, to ouerthrow topſie turuie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the truth of the incarnation and humanitie of our Sauiour, and to giue him a body not taken and drawne from the ſubſtance of the Virgin, made and begotten by the ſeede of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, following the promiſe which had beene made them thereof by that ſupreme maieſtie long time before; but from the ſubſtance of the bread, and by a neceſſary conſequence and infallible concluſion, no longer any true body or a naturall man, but a morſell of paſte, a peece of the ouen: hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and accurſed blaſphemie! but yet farre more when as they affirme, auouch, and wilfully maintaine, that the ſame humanitie of Chriſt (in the ſame Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is ſubſtantially preſent almoſt euery where: or at leaſt is really and corporally in almoſt infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and ſeuered places in one and the ſame inſtant.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, when as ſhe preſumes to reiterate this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; doth fondly imagine, that ſhe offers vp again e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day at the Maſſe, the body of Ieſus Chriſt for the ſinnes and ſaluation of the liuing &amp; dead: by meanes wherof the anger and wrath of the eternal father is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaged and appeaſed, and men find and obtaine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; ſo that with you the Maſſe is a propitiatory, and impetratorie ſacrifice. Whence it followes plainely, that that firſt oblation and ſacrifice of our Sauiour, made on the tree of the Croſſe, by the effuſion of his precious and diuine bloud, was not ſufficient but wholly imperfect? as the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> 7.10. argueth and gathereth very well from the ancient ſacrifices of the old Law, the which becauſe they had not the force and efficacy fully to wipe away ſinnes, were therefore reiterated many and ſundry times, but the ſacrifice of the Sonne of God hauing had that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, power, and efficacy: hence it is that it ought in no waies to be reiterated and offered vp againe, hauing beene more then able and ſufficient, euen the firſt time to blot out and to quit the ſinnes of the whole world,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17711:17"/>
yea of a thouſand worlds, if ſo many there had beene. This notwithſtanding your Church denies by thoſe pretended imaginary,<note place="margin">The ſacrifice of the Maſſe.</note> vnbloudy (as ſhe calls them) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and ſacrifices, which ſhe repeateth euery day, ſhewing enough thereby that ſhee doth not beleeue the firſt to haue beene ſufficient, impairing in this manner the authority, credit, and dignity of this only High-Prieſt, according to the order of <hi>Melchizedeck.</hi> Read I beſeech you, and take paines to conſider heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, the 7.9. &amp; 10. of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and you ſhall ſee more cleerely, how your faith and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe in this matter and doctrine of your Church, is farre different and contrary, to that of the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and of the firſt beleeuers of the primitiue Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Mediation and interceſſion of Saints for vs.</note> ſhee taketh from him the office and charge of mediatour, &amp;c. when as to his diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe ſets, and appoints almoſt an infinite number betweene God and men, the Virgin, Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. the which ſhe commands to be called vpon, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that reciprocally they vnderſtand our prayers, and make interceſſion for vs to his diuine Maieſty, &amp;c.

This faith is not an idle imagination, or falſe illuſion and perſwaſion, or fantaſticall ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the beleeuers braine (as your Doctors doe ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouſly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17711:19"/>
ſay) but an holy aſſurance and firme confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the bounty and mercy of God, by the which we beleeue that according to the truth of his infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble promiſes hee will be gracious and mercifull vnto vs in Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, freely for his ſake pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vs all our faults. Such a beleefe is not idle nor fruitleſſe in thoſe who haue it, but fructifieth vnto all manner of good workes, righteouſneſſe, godlineſſe, holineſſe, loue, &amp;c. Not for to merit and obtaine that pardon, which is already wholly gotten; but for to ſhew towards God that we acknowledge this ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable a benefit. This faith is not from our ſelues, but is a ſpeciall gift of God, <hi>who hath giuen vs freely through his Sonne not onely to beleeue in him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake,</hi> as ſaith <hi>S.

                     <note place="margin">Sanctification.</note>God hauing thus iuſtified vs freely through faith in his Son, he ſanctifieth vs alſo through his ſpirit, which is the ſecond benefit that wee haue obſerued to be gotten for vs in Ieſus Chriſt, and which he hath me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited and obtained for vs by his death, as we haue ſaid: and doth beſtow it vpon vs by the vertue and efficacie of his Spirit of regeneration and ſanctification, by the which mortifying daily more and more the naturall corruption in which we all are borne, he makes vs by little and little to renounce and to die to all ſinne, for to liue to righteouſneſſe and holineſſe all the dayes of our life, vntill that in the end he doe ſanctifie vs fully, when as after this life hee ſhall receiue vs into that other, in his heauenly glory. This is briefly that which concernes theſe two great benefits of our Lord, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as the Scripture and Gods holy word doe ſhew and teach vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:17711:19"/>It is a pitifull thing to ſee after how many ſorts and manners Satan hath lamentably ſpoiled, ſophiſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, falſified, peruerted, and corrupted in your Church, by your Paſtors and Doctors, this doctrine being ſo wholſome and full of comfort touching theſe two benefits of Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour: firſt,<note place="margin">How Papiſts erre about iuſtification.</note> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating as much as they could, and can, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theſe graces and fauours: ſecondly, by taking from him and robbing him of all what they can, for to attribute it to the merits either of themſelues, or of others, and to their owne ſatisfactions and papall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences. They extenuate the greatneſſe of grace two wayes: firſt, by leſſening and diminiſhing the greatneſſe of our offence and ſinne; ſecondly, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing the excellencie and perfection of Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. They doe leſſen and diminiſh the greatneſſe of ſinne; firſt, in denying that originall ſinne deſerues eternall death, contrary to that which the Apoſtle teacheth vs to the <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. that <hi>the wages of ſinne is death</hi>; and to the threatning of the Law, which ſounds thus, <hi>Curſed is he, whoſoeuer doth not continue and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere to obſerue all things written and deliuered in the booke of the Law.</hi> Secondly, by their diſtinction of ſinnes, <hi>veniall</hi> and <hi>mortall,</hi> teaching that there are ſome pettie ſinnes which doe not deſerue eternall death and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but rather pardon, which is directly againſt that very ſentence of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> that <hi>the wages of ſinne is death</hi>; and that menace of the Law, <hi>Curſed is hee,</hi> &amp;c. They debaſe the excellencie of Chriſts merit, when they teach: firſt, that he hath not ſatisfied for thoſe ſinnes and offences which they call <hi>veniall,</hi> but onely for thoſe that are <hi>mortall,</hi> contrary to that which <hi>Saint
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17711:20"/>
Iohn</hi> hath in his firſt Catholike Epiſtle, chap. 1.7. That <hi>the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt cleanſeth vs from all ſinne.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that as for mortall ſinnes, he hath only chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the eternall into a temporall puniſhment, which is by them affirmed and maintained, not onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ground vpon the holy Scripture, but alſo is much repugnant to the goodneſſe and mercy of God, who in ſo doing would pardon but by halfes. Thirdly, that by the death of Ieſus Chriſt wee obtaine only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the guilt, and not of the puniſhment, which is as much, as openly to mocke with God, and to diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null altogether the merit of our Lord: for what is it, I pray you, to remit and pardon the guilt, but not the puniſhment? As if a Maſter ſhould ſay to his ſeruant, a Lord to his ſubiect, a King to his vaſſall, that had grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly wronged and offended him, Goe thy wayes, I pardon and forgiue thee thy fault, but I will puniſh thee howſoeuer when I ſee time for that that thou haſt done, according as thou deſerueſt. What pardon would that be? nay would it not rather be a mocking of him? It is euen ſo with God according to them. They doe take from Ieſus Chriſt, and rob him as much as in them lieth, of the glory of his merit, for to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to the merits of another, when as refuſing the true pardon of God by faith in the bloud of his ſonne, they will themſelues deſerue of God by the power of their workes this pardon, and the fruition of life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting: wherein they doe iuſt like a wicked malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, who being in the hands and power of his Iudge ready to be executed, would refuſe the grace and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his Prince, and would make no vſe of it, but would thinke that hee could merit, yea would ſtifly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17711:20"/>
maintaine, that hee had iuſtly merited by his good deeds both his freedome and the expiation of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which was prepared and made ready for him, and to be one of the chiefe officers and beſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed houſhold-ſeruants of his Lord: wherein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the intolerable arrogance whereof they cannot (nor you) cleare themſelues, they fall into a groſſe, foule, and palpable ignorance; firſt, in that they thinke that they can of themſelues doe any worthy thing, and ſuch as can deſerue at Gods hands that which they thinke they doe deſerue, although not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it ſtands ſo, that <hi>of our ſelues, as of our ſelues, we are not able to thinke any thing, but all our abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is and proceeds from God,</hi> as ſpeaketh the Apoſtle in the ſecond to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> chap. 3. yea euen all the moſt iuſt actions of man, which God worketh in him through his grace, are ſo marred, infected and tainted with our naturall corruption, that they are all (as ſaith <hi>Eſay</hi> 64.) <hi>as a menſtruous cloth.</hi> Secondly, when as (for a refuge) they ſay that thoſe good workes which they doe, are not from themſelues, but from the grace of God working in them: for it is little to the purpoſe for to preſume to merit of him by ſuch workes; it is as if a vaſſall, that had receiued as a free gift from his chiefe Lord al the goods that he poſſeſſeth, would challenge to merit of him yet more then he hath receiued, for hauing giuen him ſome apple, peare, or other fruit, which he had gathered vpon theſe grounds: there being farre leſſe proportion betweene all the good that we doe through the grace of God, and the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our ſins or life euerlaſting, which they thinke and pretend to merit by their workes, then there is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17711:21"/>
betweene an apple and many large poſſeſſions. For to merit, it is required that there be a proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene that which we doe or giue, and that which we challenge thereby to merit: it is alſo required, that that whereby we doe merit, do come from our ſelues, and be not giuen vs by him from whom wee pretend to merit: for to merit by grace, it is to merit without merit, it is not to merit at all, it is to renounce all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; grace and merit being in ſuch ſort oppoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues, that they can by no meanes ſtand together:<note place="margin">Rom. 11.6.</note> 
                     <hi>for if it be by workes</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>then is it no longer by grace; if it be by grace, then is it not by workes, elſe grace is no longer grace.</hi> This ſpirituall pride is ſeene yet more cleerely herein,<note place="margin">Againſt works of ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to merit pardon and Paradiſe through good workes commanded by God, they thinke and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to merit yet ſomewhat ouer by their workes not commanded, which they haue forged for themſelues, of ſupererogation, as they call it: a name that witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth throughly their pride, whereby they thinke that they beſtow vpon God ſomewhat ouer and aboue that which he requires and demands at their hands, or then they are bound to giue him: as if God asking and requiring of vs that wee ſhould loue him with all our heart, with all our ſoule, force and ſtrength, and our neighbour as our ſelues, which is the vpſhot of the whole Law, we could doe any thing beyond that. And yet what ar theſe goodly workes of ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that are of ſo great a merit? They will come to this, to weare a frocke, an habit, a cord, the ſandals of a Monke, a Capuchin, &amp;c. to goe bare-footed, not to weare a ſhirt, to vſe the diſcipline and chaſten the

body, to vſe an haire-cloth, to weare the cord of <hi>S. Francis, Dominicke,</hi> &amp;c. to be of the brotherhood of the Roſarie, of the Beades, &amp;c. and other the like workes, in truth not commanded nor appointed by God, but of which alſo one day iuſtly and with good right he will ſay, <hi>Who hath required this at your hands?</hi>

                     <hi>In vaine doe they honour me with their workes, and their feare towards me is an humane commandement inuented by men.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding what is it that they make account of, or commend in your Church, but theſe workes of ſupererogation?

And what doe you make (for the moſt part) of all the workes commanded and ordained by God, in reſpect of thoſe which men haue inuented, but hay and chaffe, which no man regardeth? 2. They rob Chriſt of the glory of his merit, in that they teach that wee muſt our ſelues ſatisfie for the temporall puniſhment of our ſinnes and offences, our Sauiour hauing (by their ſaying) onely taken away the eternitie thereof.<note place="margin">Againſt Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.</note> Whereupon they haue deuiſed and kindled in their braine the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fire of Purgatorie, which they ſet in the very next place, and as it were in the ſuburbs of hell, for therein after this life to ſatisfie in our owne perſons the iuſtice of God for our ſinnes, as if <hi>the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> which <hi>cleanſeth vs from all ſinne,</hi> were not a ſoape and lye (as it were) ſtrong enough for to waſh away all this filth, and that we needed another ſcouring more rugged and purgatiue, of fire altogether as hot and violent (ſay they) as hell-fire it ſelfe; for they muſt needs know much certaine and aſſured newes thereof
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17711:22"/>
in particular, by the relation of ſo many ſoules as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from thence, as they ſay. But to what end, I pray you? Is it for to haue Maſſes ſung, for to haue ſeruices and obits ſaid for the dead for their deliuerie from this ſo boiling a fire? Alas poore fooles, that ſuffer your ſelues to be deceiued and couſened by theſe tales, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and gulleries, and to be muffled by theſe weake terrours and humane inuentions! No, no: it is for to fill their purſe and belly, and to make good cheere at your coſt, and vnder the name and pretence of the poore deceaſed. But though it were true, that there were ſuch a fire and place appoinred by diuine iuſtice for the ſatisfaction of ſinnes after this life, (whereof notwithſtanding wee haue not, nor can they produce any true, ſound and cleere ground and teſtimonie in the Scripture) is there any thing amongſt all thoſe which they giue and offer you for to deliuer you, yea alſo for to keepe you quite from the comming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſuch as are anniuerſarie Maſſes and obits, teſtamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie legacies and foundations, &amp;c? Is there, I ſay, any of theſe things, yea any other that might poſſibly be deuiſed or imagined, which can counterpoiſe the greatneſſe of theſe torments which they faigne to be in this pretended and ſuppoſed Purgatorie? Truly if that which the Deuill maliciouſly ſaid of the holy man <hi>Iob,</hi> be true, though ſpoken by him to a very bad end, <hi>Skinne for skinne, and all that a man hath he will giue for his life</hi>; how much more ſhall it be true in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and what will not men giue for to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from ſuch a fire, and to redeeme themſelues from ſuch torments, if poſſibly it could bee done?

very ſhirt, yea euen to their skinne. And thus it is, and vnder this faire cloake and pretence, that they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen folkes, and deceiue and abuſe poore ſilly people, ſqueeſing out and drawing to themſelues all their goods and ſubſtance, for to make their owne hearts merry withall, and to make their fleſh-pot to boile. An horrible wickedneſſe; beyond all compariſon, and more then deteſtable miſchiefe and impietie! for to make way for their auarice and gluttonie, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of pietie, deuotion, and compaſſion towards the deceaſed. No, no: if it were ſo (as I haue ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which notwithſtanding is not) that this Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie and the fire thereof were true, nothing of this world, nor any humane action would be able and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bring deliuerance and freedome, and to counteruaile the paines and torments; and we ought therein (as ſaith our Sauiour, but to another ſenſe then they vrge and alleage him for) to ſatisfie the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of Gods iuſtice euen to the vtmoſt farthing, and to the ſmalleſt fault, before we ſhould come out from thence: which notwithſtanding would ſauour rather of a cruell Tyrant, then of a louing, pitifull, bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and compaſſionate God, ſuch a one as ours is. But to their account, they doe deliuer themſelues yet more eaſily, and at a cheaper rate then the aforeſaid, by meanes of the Popes Indulgences and Pardons, by wearing a paire of Beades, or an hallowed Medaill, and ſaying three <hi>Pater-noſters,</hi> or ſome ſuch other the like meere fooleries, bables, and inuentions procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of the forge and ſhop of ſome ſuperſtitious braine, or rather couetous and deſirous of gold and ſiluer, very fit in truth and conuenient for to helpe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

the charges and expences of the Popes Court, and of other Eccleſiaſticall perſons his deputies. But (as I haue ſaid) an impious wickedneſſe and deteſtable impietie, nay, an horrible and execrable blaſphemie, thus to diſrobe and depriue Ieſus Chriſt of the glory of his merit, and to imagine by ſuch meanes to ſatisfie the rigour of Gods iuſtice, better then by the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and diuine vertue of his precious bloud, ſhed for the ſinnes not only of the whole world, but of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, yea of a thouſand, if ſo many there were. I giue leaue to all truly Chriſtian and religious ſoules, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of their owne ſaluation and zeale to the honour and glory of their Sauiour, to thinke well of it, and to iudge whether this be to giue him the entire glory of our ſaluation, and whether he be well aſſured, leaning and being built vpon ſuch foundations.</p>
                  <p>The time would faile me, if I diſcouer, and my heart would ake and pant at the ſight of all the filth and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations that are couered and hidden vnder this cloake of merits and ſatisfactions, which are taught and preached in your Church, farre more then the grace, goodneſſe, mercy, and free pardon of God; yea by the which merits and ſatisfactions this grace, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, mercy, and free pardon of God, and the merits of Ieſus Chriſt are not onely darkned and disfigured, but quite defaced and altogether aboliſhed, as much at leaſt as in them lieth. Let that which hath beene ſaid be enough, and ſuffice for this time, for to ſhew and make you to ſee how the benefit of our iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour, is ſet as it were at naught by the doctrine of your men. Let vs now come to the benefit of ſanctification, which hee hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17711:23"/>
(as I haue already ſaid,<note place="margin">How Papiſts erre about ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</note> and repeated twice or thrice) obtained and merited for vs by his death and paſſion, and by the effuſion of his pretious and diuine bloud. This is no leſſe peruerted, corrupted and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, then the former. For in ſtead of acknowledging with the Scripture (which teacheth it vs) that of our owne nature, being dead in our ſins, vnable to frame euen a good thought, and bring forth of our ſelues any good thing, by reaſon that the whole imagination of mans heart is ſet vpon nothing but euill at all times euen from his youth; God hereupon doth baptiſe vs not onely with water, but principally with the holy Ghoſt, by the which correcting and mortifying by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little the corruption of our nature, infected with the ſinne which we bring with vs from the belly of our mother, of vnbeleeuers, impenitent, rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, wilfull, and diſobedient to his commandements and precepts, ſuch as wee are of our ſelues and of our owne nature, he makes vs to beleeue his truth, takes from vs the hardneſſe of our hearts, makes vs flexible and pliable vnder the yoake of his lawes, and of his obedience, that ſo renouncing all vnfruitfull workes of ſinne and darkneſſe, we may liue as true children of light in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe: in ſtead (I ſay) of acknowledging, teaching, and carefully vrging this, they doe the quite contrary, 1. extenuating (as I haue already ſaid) and diminiſhing as farre as they are able, this naturall corruption and originall ſinne which is in vs, ſaying that it is but a light infirmitie, ſpirituall languor, and weakneſſe of nature, which makes vs indeed backward and ſlow in good, but not dead to all good, and quicke and ready to all euill:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17711:24"/>
2. attributing to the water, ſalt and ſpittle, and other ſuch like things of baptiſme, the mortification of that naturall corruption in vs, and not rather to the merit of Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour, and to the power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of his death and paſſion: 3. in that, that ſeeming to acknowledge the grace of God to be neceſſary for the healing of this euill, yet in effect they doe quite diſanull this,<note place="margin">Free-will.</note> and attribute it to themſelues, and to the force and power of their free-will: 1. in that they imagine that in man, by the force and power of his nature, there are ſome preparatiues and diſpoſitions to receiue this grace, and conſequently that there are in him certaine merits of congruitie; ſo that with them the cauſe why God offereth and preſenteth his grace to one and not to another, is becauſe the one is well prepared, (of himſelfe, you muſt vnderſtand, and not by the grace of God, ſeeing he prepares and diſpoſes himſelfe for to receiue it) and the other is not: as if man being ſo miſerably corrupted as hee is, could of himſelfe doe any thing that might deſerue grace <hi>de congruo,</hi> as they ſpeake, that is, might binde God by way of honeſtie and conueniencie, to beſtow vpon him his grace: 2. in that they make this grace to bee ſuch, as that all the vertue and efficacie thereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends wholly vpon the libertie of man, which in effect is to make this grace idle and vnprofitable: for how can any man call that medicine ſufficient, and effectual for the healing of a maladie, which can doe no good without one certaine ingredient? Now do they make the grace of God like to this medicine; it can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (as they ſay) nor worke in vs without the force and vertue of our free-will, which is the chiefe ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17711:24"/>
according to them, which giueth force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie to this ſpiritual medicine. Is this to recommend the grace of God vnto vs, or to exalt it, and is it not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to exalt man and his abilitie? Is not this to take from God for to giue to man? to rob the Creator for to couer, decke, and enrich the creature? Thus you ſee that thoſe of your Church (eſpecially your Doctours, directours and Prelates) like to children of a peruerſe, neglectfull, and vngratefull nature, with a preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſhuts to their heart and puffes vp their ſpirit, they hate nothing ſo much, as to acknowledge, auouch and confeſſe their fault, paſſe condemnation vpon it, cry for mercy, aske pardon, and acknowledge that all their good and eternall happineſſe conſiſts in the goodneſſe, mercy, grace, and meerely free pardon of God: but doe extenuate as much as they can their fault and offence, doe plucke downe grace, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh as much as in them lieth all pardon, that ſo they may not ſeeme to be beholden to God; they do preach and extoll the greatneſſe of their merits, by the which they pretend to make God beholden and indebted to them: whence it is not very hard to conſider, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and iudge, whether the true humilitie, which is eſſentiall to Chriſtianitie, and ſo beſeeming it, yea the faireſt and richeſt ornament of a true beleeuer, can be in them, who not onely maintaine and wilfully defend ſuch a doctrine, but doe glory therein, and doe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne and perſecute euen to the fire and bloud, thoſe which on the contrary, forſaking themſelues, and all that can come from their owne ſtrength and merits, haue no other refuge, prop, foundation and aſſurance for their eternall ſaluation, then in the meere bountie,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17711:25"/>
grace, mercy, and free pardon of God, in Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, his merit, and interceſſion.</p>
                  <p>Hee ſhould neuer haue done, that would relate, ſhew, and ſet to view all the abuſes and errours touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the points of faith neceſſary to ſaluation. Gather only and iudge out of that little which the ſhortneſſe of the time &amp; this diſcourſe giues me leaue to ſpeake, whether the firſt ground and foundation of ſaluation premiſed and ſuppoſed, to wit, a true faith and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe in Ieſus Chriſt, (ſuch as the Scripture declareth, and requireth of vs) is and can bee found in your Church, in which is taught and preached a doctrine ſo diametrally contrary and oppoſite to it, yea againſt all reaſon; and whether I haue had iuſt cauſe and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to withdraw my ſelfe from thence (and you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are bound to doe the like) in caſe that you and I deſire to worke out our ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>But that which is worſe, and more to be lamented, (euen with teares of bloud if it were poſſible) is, that for the moſt part amongſt thoſe of your Church, there is no more any faith, or law, or God, or religion at all: but by a lamentable euent (permitted notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by Gods prouidence for the iuſt puniſhment of their deſerts) are fallen into a groſſe ignorance of matters of God, (I will not ſay into Atheiſme) and is fulfilled in them compleatly and in all points, that which the Apoſtle <hi>S. Paul</hi> hath ſometimes ſpoken of the Gentiles, Pagans, and Idolaters, in the firſt to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 21.22.</note> namely, that <hi>hauing knowne God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankfull; but became vaine in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkened, profeſsing themſelues to be wiſe, they became fooles, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17711:25"/>
changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to a corruptible man,</hi> &amp;c. And who then would not withdraw himſelfe from men ſo blinded, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer to errour, and the darkeneſſe of ignorance?</p>

But yet more fitly and more to our purpoſe may they be compared to the Gods of the Egyptians: without were they ingrauen with imboſſements, with inlaying, guilded, carued, enammelled, and inlaide with diuers colours, there could nothing be found ſo faire, pleaſing and acceptable; all the world did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them, did reuerence vnto them, kneeled before them, did offer and ſacrifice to them all the faireſt, richeſt, and moſt precious things they had: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were nothing but hay, chaffe, and filth, a neaſt for toads, adders, and ſerpents. Euen ſo it is with theſe men without, and to the outward appearance they ſeeme to be milde, courteous, affable, peaceable, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17711:32"/>
treatable, bountifull, humble; euen mildeneſſe and goodneſſe it ſelfe, &amp;c. Clothed with coarſe and baſe cloth, with a contemptible habit, without ſhirts, without hoſen, or ſhooes, with a mortified looke, and an orderly pace, &amp;c. and there is nothing ſo goodlie and perfect in ſhow, they ſeeme to be young Saints, I I will not ſay little gods: All the world reſpects, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and worſhips them (if I may ſo ſpeake) does reuerence vnto them, bends the knee before them, yea offereth and ſacrificeth vnto them the faireſt, fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and beſt of all their goods and ſubſtance; but as for the inward, and that which is within, O! what a ſtore of dirt, filth, and villanie is therein! There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (as I haue ſaid) but pride, vanitie, ambition, proud preſumption, arrogance, enuy, iealouſie, and a thouſand other ſuch like wickedneſſes and miſchiefes, altogether incomparable, vnconceiuable, yea (as I haue ſaide) incredible and beyond all thought, to thoſe that haue not the triall and practiſe hereof. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no other witneſſes thereof, then their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, they know how it ſtands with them, and wil acknowledge, I am ſure, and ingenuouſly confeſſe (at leaſt in their ſoules) that what I ſay is true: But what? I doe not ſay the tenth part of it, no not the hundreth of what might be ſaid: and the wiſeſt, the moſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, and honeſt men amongſt them (for there are yet ſome ſuch amongſt them, and we muſt giue them this commendation, and confeſſion to the truth) doe not conceale this; but doe ſay with a loud and cleere voyce, and affirme amongſt them, that if men did know and take them to be ſuch as they are, in ſtead of white loaues and wine, wherewith they fill their wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17711:33"/>
and bottles, they would fling ſtones and flints at their heads, and throw them head-long into the water.</p>
                  <p>We will ſpeake and diſcourſe hereof, God willing, another time more particularly and at large, to the end (as I haue ſaid) that I might enlighten thoſe ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple folkes, that ſuffer themſelues to be deceiued vnder theſe faire ſhewes and appearances, and fained and diſſembled perfection and ſocietie, and to make them to ſee the truth in his naturall brightneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Now all what before hath beene ſaid, being as it is, and that no man as I thinke, of iudgement and reaſon, and that will neuer ſo little open his eyes to the light, can be ignorant heereof, or call it in queſtion, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deny it: Iudge, (and that I pray you, without trouble and paſſion, but with a quiet and ſettled minde, and in the ſerenitie of your conſcience;) Iudge, I ſay, whether I haue had any iuſt matter and occaſion, to doe what I haue done, deſiring to worke out my ſaluation. And whether it bee without cauſe that I haue ſeparated and withdrawne my ſelfe from you and your company; for to vnite and ioyne my ſelfe to the ſocietie of the faithfull and true Diſciples of our Sauiour, and to the true Church, without the which there is no hope of ſaluation. And I am certaine and aſſured (as I haue told you in the beginning) that you ſhall finde me as farre remoued from haſtineſſe, precipitation, inconſtancie, and inconſiderateneſſe of minde, and other the like things, which inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and in ſomewhat too hot a moode you haue obiected to me, as I come neere to the truth.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, I haue made bold after this former Treatiſe yet a while to trouble (or rather to delight) you with this enſuing ſhorter, yet no leſſe zealous, diſcourſe. The neereneſſe of both their arguments may in ſome ſort challenge a neereneſſe of place, and I hope ſhall obtaine at your hands a like acceptation. I will ſay no more: onely giue me leaue to adde this obſeruation of Gods conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall watchfulneſſe ouer his Church. We haue ſeene of late what troubles, what broiles, what feares of a generall deua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation haue beene (and it is to be feared are ſcarce yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) in that our neighbour Country. Many ſmall Treatiſes and Pamphlets (that were daily througed as it were to the Preſſe) doe giue hereof a ſufficient teſtimonie: ſo that wee might in a manner ſay (as it is in the firſt chapter of <hi>Iob</hi> often repeated) <hi>Whiles hee was yet ſpeaking,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob 1.</note>

Whileſt the matters of their Common-wealth ſtand thus, ſee how God on the other ſide prouides for his Church, and <hi>daily addes to it ſuch as ſhall bee ſaued.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 2.47.</note> Not many moneths ſince wee haue heard of the happy conuerſion of the Duke <hi>de Candale,</hi> one of the Peeres of <hi>France,</hi> and with

him of a many likewiſe that were of his retinue. This newes was ſcarce downe, but behold this other Treatiſe comming forth, declaring the conuerſion of a Gentleman, though not equall to the former in birth, yet (if wee may beleeue the <hi>Romaniſts)</hi> as farre aboue him in regeneration, as they eſteeme a ſpirituall vocation to exceede the temporall. And <hi>whiles he was yet ſpeaking, another came,</hi> I meane, whileſt this booke (at leaſt the tranſlation thereof) was yet in the Preſſe, another came, namely this preſent Declaration of Marquiſe <hi>Boniuet,</hi> &amp;c. So that wee haue cauſe ſtill to bleſſe God for his goodneſſe, who though (with thoſe buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in <hi>Nehemiah) hee hath</hi> for a while <hi>had his ſword girded on his loines,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Neh. 4.18.</note> for to ſtrike by way of puniſhment his people, yet at the ſame time hee kept in the other hand the hammer and chizell for to ſquare and fit theſe liuing ſtones to the building of his ſpirituall Temple. But what doe I? I muſt conclude, leſt mine obſeruation ſhould proue to be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the text it ſelfe. In the meane time accept of that which is done for you, and bee thankfull to God for that which he hath done for his Church: and in particular ceaſe not to pray continually for the peace of the diſtreſſed <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> which he hath in <hi>France.</hi> Farewell. </p>

(more to be lamented then any other) that I could neuer haue a taſte of that good affection which pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are wont to beare toward their children; and that thoſe, from whoſe care I might haue looked for a faithfull inſtruction in matters of ſaluation, hauing beene taken out of the miſeries of this world, as ſoone almoſt as I came vnto it, there was left vnto mee no other light then for the body, and my ſoule ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in darkneſſe and the ſhadow of death, and that in ſuch manner, that accordingly as I grew in age, ſo I daily proceeded in errour, and ſtraying from Ieſus Chriſt and his Goſpell, I ſtrayed likewiſe from mine owne happineſſe, and had beene likely miſerably to continue in that lamentable and deplorable eſtate euen vnto this day, and ſo forwards, if God, <hi>who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who are his, and whoſe names hee hath written in his booke of life,</hi> had not had pittie of me: and if the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of him, <hi>who ſheweth mercy to whom hee ſheweth mercy,</hi> had not preuented mee, and formally oppoſed it ſelfe to the miſchiefe which was pleaſing vnto me, and to that curſe, which being to mee the greateſt of all, yet aboue all others was hugged and liked of by my ſoule.

wont to draw ſweetneſſe out of bitter things for his children,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> and generally <hi>to make all things to turne to the beſt for thoſe who are called according to his determined purpoſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is now twelue yeeres agoe when I was at <hi>Rome</hi>: (I will ſay no more) there mine eyes ſaw wonders, but ſuch as were quite of another nature then thoſe which heretofore the Apoſtles (being directed and animated by the holy Spirit) brought forth for to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize and confirme the doctrine of grace. And how carefully and induſtriouſly ſoeuer I was nurtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ignorance, and brought vp in the hatred of the Religion, and the loue of Idolatrie, yet I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee hindred from perceiuing that there was a great diſproportion betweene the ſtate of thoſe, who at this day doe domineere ouer the Church, and the condition of them, who formerly did feed the flocke of Chriſt that was committed vnto them. Yet that was ſcarce any more, then if I ſhould haue beheld the darkneſſe of the night, without being able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the brightneſſe of the day: or if I did beginne to take notice, it was in that manner as men beginne to ſee at the breake of day. That beginning, how ſmall ſoeuer it was then, did not continue vnprofitable: the riſing of the Sunne drew nigh, the light increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and was ſtrengthned in mine vnderſtanding; the abuſes of Poperie appeared vnto me both groſſer and more; God left not in mee his worke vnperfect, hee did put me in minde of inquiring a little further, and to be informed truly by himſelfe in his owne word, whether of the two Religions that are receiued in this Kingdome might haue the vpper hand in regard
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17711:38"/>
of the truth, or had more conformitie vnto this word. This enquirie did make mee to reſolue about ſome three yeeres ſince, to forſake the ſeruice which I finde condemned in the Scripture, and to embrace that which I find therein commanded, and to come forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> for feare that partaking longer of her knowne crimes, I ſhould bring my ſelfe into a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt danger of partaking of her vnknowne plagues. Whileſt I had this reſolution, which came to me from God, behold on the contrary many conſiderations, which came from elſewhere: on the one ſide were preſented to mine eyes the luſtre, the pompe, the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, the greatneſſe, the hopes of the earth, and with all this oſtentation of the glories of the world, as it were a certaine voice well-neere like to that which ſaid ſometimes to our Lord, <hi>I will giue thee all theſe things, if thou fall downe and worſhip mee</hi>: on the other ſide, the pouertie, the miſeries, the ruines of houſes, the hatred, the contempt, and all what is moſt able to cauſe a diſtaſte, which ſhould bee mine aſſured lot in caſe of change. Theſe two tentations, the one on the right, and the other on the left hand, did make me ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the effect of that wil which the ſpirit of God had inſinuated into my ſpirit; I looked behind me a good while,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> 
                     <hi>I withheld the truth in vnrighteouſnes,</hi> I made my ſelfe beleeue that by doing much euil I ſhould haue good done vnto me; I fled from the preſence of God, but God did make me at length feele that he deceiues himſelfe, which thinkes to ſcape by ſwiftneſſe from before him: he prepared for me a Whale for to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, but yet not for to deſtroy me; I was chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his hand, and that through the ſame things

in the which I had ſinned: he tooke away out of mine hands both that which I had, and that which I had not. And now my hopes were cut off euen at the root, now many things by me poſſeſſed were loſt for me, now my libertie (more precious then all the reſt) was taken from me: but God be praiſed, who hauing taken from mee ſo many things, yet hath giuen mee ſo many, that if hee hath ſent mee any euill, it was onely for to ſend me ſome good; if he hath made mee poorer, it was for to make mee richer then euer I was before, and that in better riches, in thoſe namely that are the onely true ones: if hee hath made my body to bee caſt into priſon, it was for to make my ſoule to come out of thrall: if hee hath ſuffered mee to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of ſuch men as hated me, it was for feare that I ſhould fall into his hands, yea into his hands as he is a rigorous Iudge, and yet to the end that I might fall into his hands, as hee is a kinde and mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that I might learne to my coſt (being I could not doe it by the example of others) to feare him, to reuerence him, to giue him the glory, and to conſecrate to him whatſoeuer belongs to me, without any reſeruation, as I acknowledge my ſelfe truly and after an infinite number of ſorts to be bound to doe, and acknowledge likewiſe, that it was the pure mercy of God that I was not conſumed, becauſe that his compaſſions did not faile me. And ſeeing that God hath done mee that fauour, that his word doth ſerue mee at this day in ſtead of a lampe for my feet, and of a light for my ſteps, to this word and to this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, diuinely inſpired, I purpoſe to keepe mee, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euer any more repairing to the traditions of men,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17711:39"/>
ſeeing that God hath giuen Ieſus Chriſt for to be the head to his Church (of the which I am a member) for to bee the onely Mediatour betweene him and men, and our Aduocate towards his Father; for to be the onely Prieſt for euer, for to haue an euerlaſting Prieſthood, and for to offer (as hee hath offered) one onely ſacrifice for ſinnes, for to bee the Lambe of God, whoſe bloud doth cleanſe vs from all ſinne, for to ſit for euer at the right hand of God, and to be held in the heauen vntill the time of the re-eſtabliſhing of all things, and vntill that hee ſhall come from thence for to iudge the quicke and the dead: I acknowledge from henceforth no more (to the preiudice of him) any miniſteriall head of the Church on the earth, nor Aduocate, taken from among either men or Angels, nor any Prieſt ſacrificing his body, nor Maſſe ſeruing for a propitiatorie ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the liuing and the dead, nor Purgatorie after this life, nor reall preſence of the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt in the Sacrament vnder the kindes of bread and wine. And becauſe that the Spirit of God doth teach mee, that no fleſh is iuſtified by the workes of the Law, but only by faith in Ieſus Chriſt, I will no longer forge vnto my ſelfe any merit of good workes, and much leſſe of ſupererogation; and I will account the good workes of the faithfull to haue beene prepared by God, to the end that wee may walke therein, and will eſteeme them to be <hi>the way to the Kingdome of heauen, and not the cauſe of raigning.</hi> And it is in this truth, and in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion thereof, that I deſire, and that I promiſe here before God, his Angels, and his Church, to bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to liue and to die, deteſting with all mine heart
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17711:39"/>
all Idolatries, ſuperſtitions and errors, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the confeſſion of faith of the Churches of this Kingdome, and proteſting to ſubmit my ſelfe wholly to that which concernes the order and diſcipline of the Church. Thus ſigned, <hi>Boniuet.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue with the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniency ſent ouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, the neweſt, and (heere) moſt knowne newes, dated, as before; hauing receiued no let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from you ſince the tenth of the ſame. And whereas, not onely in many before, but eſpecially in your laſt, you ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly importun'd mee (knowing what windes
<pb facs="tcp:17711:41"/>
blew heere) to giue you intelligence of French preſent occurrences, as they ſhall happen; I haue done ſo, rather to ſatisfie your minde, deſirous of nouelties, than to pleaſe my ſelfe in ſetting downe the troubles of others, that haue too many of mine owne. France (as you know) is to mee nothing, in regard I am an Engliſhman and a ſtranger to her factions. Shee is as one of her Vineyards, rob'd by French-men in my ſight, which ſtelth is no loſſe to mee. I ſtand ſafe on the ſhore, and beholde her ſides beating vpon a rocke, the wracke I feele not; yet am I bound, in common humanitie, to compaſſionate my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſorrow, ſeeing his houſe burning about his eares: And doe therefore proteſt to you, that I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as much, as if I were a naturall French-man borne, in being preſent within ſo goodly a Citie as <hi>Paris</hi> is, when ſhee is full (at leaſt looking howrely to bee ſo) of turmoiles, vproares, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill combuſtion: and to ſee ſo many thouſands of the French (I meane the <hi>Pariſiens</hi>) walke vp and downe with ſuch amazed, wilde, and diſtracted faces; that if tenne be in a troupe together, not three of them can ſafely ſweare, that a fourth man is his friend. In euery ſtreet, yea at euery corner, the people flocke in heapes, muttering and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, and whiſpering one to another; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more expected, (nay more deſired by ſome) than that a ſword may be drawne, to the end that pell mell they may fall to cutting of throates. The Townes of France are rich, and ſpoiles would now taſte ſweetly, eſpecially to the Peſant, who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17711:41"/>
wiſheth to build vpon his countries ruines, and to ſet an edge vpon his fury, this occaſion gaue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. For vpon the twentie two of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> now preſent, (euen this day, in which I write vnto you) the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being in <hi>Paris,</hi> well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed, came to the Court, where hee had not beene long, but he was ſurprized and carryed priſoner to the <hi>Louure,</hi> why hee came, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of himſelfe or ſent for, is not in my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and if I ſhould ſet downe all which I heare touching the cauſes of this ſurprizall (of whoſe true notice I deſire not to bee guiltie) you might thinke mee, either very idle, to call euery ſhadow a ſubſtance, or elſe very buſie to bee ſo inquiſitiue in the affaires of a kingdome, when mine owne are altogether priuate. I had rather walke vp and downe the ſtreets of <hi>Paris</hi> (albeit with ſome feare of danger) than thruſt my head into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell chambers, and to meddle with Princes mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which no whit concerne mee. And therefore doe I ſparingly deliuer you theſe vproares, not ſearching into the ground and reaches of them, as hearing various and inconſtant reports: I giue eare to many, but credit few, and dare not (albeit I might) vtter my owne opinion, becauſe I am as loth to wrong you by this of mine, as that you ſhould doe the like to your friends in England, by a ſecond relation. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the Duke of <hi>Vandoſme</hi> eſcaped. Others like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fearing the ſame danger, met with the ſame happy meanes of ſafetie: For the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> with <hi>Tremouille,</hi> &amp; many other perſonages of note
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17711:42"/>
being at a ſermon, hauing notice giuen, as they came from Church, fled; and to make their ſide the ſtronger, the Duke <hi>Du Maine</hi> is ioyn'd with them. How theſe Noble-men came to the knowledge of the Prince of <hi>Condees</hi> ſurprizall, is (euen heere) doubtfull. Some ſay by a French Page, who ſaw him carried away, &amp; that he was demanded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vp his ſword, which he refuſed to do: others otherwiſe: But howſoeuer it happened, it ſeem'd a good and miraculous deliuerance of the reſt, (who hold with him) if at leaſt they turne not that preſeruation of themſelues, to the confuſion of others. Which the rather is to bee feared, for that hauing (to auoid the blow) turned their backes for ſafety, they now (as it is thought) arme their hands with weapons, aſſembling themſelues, and freinds with all their forces at <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> to make their party (for defence) as ſtrong as they can. Now, whether in loue to the <hi>Prince of Conde,</hi> or in hate for any priuate reſpect they beare the <hi>Marqueſse d' Ancres</hi>; a man famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough in <hi>England</hi> and elſe where for exceeding fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, done him by the Queene mother in France; or whether (as often it ſo happeneth) a deſire of doing ſomething (though neuer ſo ill) ſet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peoples fingers on itching, I know not: But preſently vpon ſurprizall of the Prince (it being noyſd through <hi>Paris,</hi> that hee was ſent priſoner to the <hi>Louure</hi>) they ranne in heapes and height of fury to the <hi>Marqueſses</hi> houſe, aſſaulted, entred, and rifled it; making ſpoyle of all that was in it, and when no other prey could feede them, they ſpent
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17711:42"/>
their malice on the inſenſible walles (tearing and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the building downe) which (if hee could haue beene gotten) they ſwore to execute vpon himſelfe. In this wauering eſtate the Kingdome ſtill ſtands. What the euent of theſe troubles will bee, lies in the hands of God onely: the occurrences whereof (as hereafter time ſhall deliuer) I will (as theſe) ſend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, expecting a returne (by way of exchange) from you of ſome newes out of <hi>England.</hi> And ſo with wiſhes of your health, I bid you farewell, from <hi>Paris,</hi>
