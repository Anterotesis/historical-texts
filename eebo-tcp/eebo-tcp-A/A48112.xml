            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Dear, Dear, Dear, R.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MY Pangs thicken ſo faſt upon me, that although I have Midwiv'd my ſelf of many little Shams, it's my fear I ſhall cry out for Madam <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> at laſt: but alas! She's incaſtrate, and St. <hi>Bridget</hi> knows when we ſhall have the benefit of her skill.</p>
            <p>Well! I was ſtill afraid I ſhould burſt with <hi>Ignoramus</hi>'s, and this laſt Bout in the <hi>Baily</hi> has giv'n me ſo ſtrong a Fit, that I muſt beg the uſe of your Beads for me. <hi>Certes,</hi> that Heretick <hi>Care</hi> has Influenc'd them. But how unhappy are we! all the Jurors Coats are Drabdeberry, and Impenitrable; ſo cloſe that we cannot pick one hole in 'um.</p>
            <p>And the misfortune is, that we are like to loſe our poor Friend <hi>Whip-Cat,</hi> for ſince the good Wives Puſſes have forſaken his Houſe, a new Plague is come to him; the Rats and Mice have gathered on him in ſuch Legions, that they have devour'd the whole Stock of Parmiſant he bought in <hi>Holland:</hi> ſo that 'tis fear'd he muſt take another Voyage to new ſtore himſelf; or put Madam <hi>Joanna</hi> to the charge of getting him a Pot of Extreme-Unction, as ſhe did for <hi>Capricorn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the unlucky Whigs have inlarged their Dominions into the very Bowels of the Church, ſo that ſcarce a Divine of Sence or Honeſty in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but is as Incredulous of a Proteſtant Plot, as themſelves.</p>
            <p>Our Evidence too are ſo bemir'd, and ſtuck in the Bog, that the very Boys hiſs'd 'um, and they had been certainly thrown into <hi>Fleet-Ditch,</hi> had not the Proverb ſav'd 'um, which ſays, He that's born to be Hang'd ſhall never Drown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Booth</hi> they ſay's in Pimlico, and for fear of Martial Diſcipline, is gone to his Colours in the <hi>King-Bench;</hi> though 'tis thought his Name was never on the Captains Liſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Narrative</hi> drew his Sword, and ſwore, Damm him, to the Rabble; upon which occaſion, an unlucky Baggage brought me this Epigram by the Penny-Poſt.</p>
            <lg>
               <head>On <hi>Narrative</hi>'s Drawing his Sword.</head>
               <l>Your Popiſh-Prieſts are Sons of War,</l>
               <l>Soldiers of Fortune Jeſuits are;</l>
               <l>Juſtice Rewards 'um with a Rope, or Hatchet;</l>
               <l>But the Pope gives 'um Heav'n, if they can catch it.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:104318:2"/>Oh! the intolerable Charge we have been at to bury this Curſed Plot, for Maſſes, Pardons, Evidences and Perjuries! And ſtill it ſtinks ſo damnably, that it nauſeates every Paſſenger. Curle on all <hi>Romiſh</hi>-Bulls! I thought their Horns had been ſtrong enough to have toſs'd all Proteſtant Princes out of their Thrones before now: but <hi>vae nobis!</hi> the Hereticks ſtand their ground: and here's the Plague, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentry can't be prevail'd upon to truck away their Title to the Abby-Lands on ſo ſlender a ſecurity as the Popes Broad-Seal. Well, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, What ſhall we do? we have had ſo many <hi>Con-stults</hi> already, that its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in vain to call another: and for thoſe Conſecrated Heads that are in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> though when they were out they deſign'd to give Laws to Kingdoms, yet now we ſee they are like Witches in Cuſtody, their power forſakes them.</p>
            <p>But the great Plague of all is, our own Party begin to laugh at our Artifices, and more then that, ſome of 'um clapt at the Hieroglophicks wherein the Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices expoſed us on Queen <hi>Beſſes</hi> Night: and have not ſtuck to ſay, We were no better than ſo many Apes, Baboons, and Mimmicks.</p>
            <p>And it vexes me conſoundedly to think how I ſhall anſwer for all the tranſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of my Wit and Railery upon <hi>Tap-skin,</hi> &amp;c. with which my Weekly <hi>Labels</hi> do ſo Crawl, that there's <hi>Littera Scripta</hi> in the Caſe; and I fear the <hi>Salamancha</hi> Sermon will be turn'd upon us, and an Epitaph upon the <hi>Tridentine</hi> be Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to our Memories.</p>
            <p>And is this at laſt the Reward we are to meet with after the expence of our ſlender Wits, and Fortunes in the Service of Holy Cauſe? Ungratefull World! muſt we after all our Merits be made <hi>Pendulums</hi> to tell the Rabble what time of day 'tis? How glad would we be if we might but commute for the Dicipline of having our Noſes grubd againſt the Grate, and Skins ſoundly Claw'd, and curri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Alas! there were ſome Relief in this, and we might come off, as ſome of our Dear Siſters do, from the Dancing School behind St. <hi>Brides,</hi> with ſore Backs, and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Faces. But Fate alas! has another Game to play with us: This is evident by the Omens that have of late befallen us. For, as for thee, <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> thy riſible Faculty hath quite leſt thee, and inſtead of laughing, thou doſt Grin the moſt wretchedly, thou doſt already look like one of our Fathers that hath been ſtrung up by the Left Ear a day or two in the Sun. And poor <hi>Roger</hi>'s Fiddle is curſedly out of tune, all the <hi>ſmall Catlings</hi> are broken, nothing but the two big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtrings left, that make the lamentable ſound of <hi>O hone! O hone!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What think'ſt thou can be the meaning of theſe diſmall Prodromes? I fear the curs'd preſage of 'um, for already I have ſo perfectly received the very form of Hanging into my conſideration, that ſometimes I am feeling in my Pocket for a piece of Silver to give <hi>Ketch</hi> at the dead lift. But prethee, if thou art yet able to ſet Pen to Paper, let me have thy Opinion of the moſt effectuall means (if there be any) to prevent theſe direfull <hi>Cataſtrophes.</hi> But anon I intend to meet thee at the <hi>Conſtult</hi> at the <hi>Wonder.
