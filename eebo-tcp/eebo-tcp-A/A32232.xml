            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">A <hi>DECLARATION</hi> to all His Maieſties Loving Subiects in His Kngdoms of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, and IRELAND, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>FOraſmuch as we have lately received an Overture, in the name of ſome thouſands of Our Loving Subjects in our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> and Our Dominion of <hi>Wales, &amp;c.</hi> wherein is expreſſed the late cruel, Tyrannical and perfidious practiſes and proceedings of a pack'd piece of a Parliament or Juncto, who have aſſumed a Power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves far beyond what ever hath been acted or done by any of Our Predeceſſors, contrary to Law, Reaſon and the juſt Rights and Priviledges of all Our good Subjects.</p>
            <p>We do therefore Declare, that We ſhall according to our late Proclamation endeavour ſo far as in Us lyes, to make good Our Promiſe in every particular. To which end and purpoſe, We have already provided ſhipping, and embarqued a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of Our Army to be landed at one of the places therein mentioned; reſolving with Our Self to appear in Our own Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Perſon at the head of thoſe Forces, for the better encouragement of all Our good Subjects. All which might have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed long ſince, had not the ſiege of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> put a demur to Our proceedings therein, it being a place very conſiderable and of great concernment as to the management of Our ſo weighty undertakings; Our chief ends being, to reſtore Religion in its purity, the Lawes to their Channel, the Nobility and Gentry to their Eſtates, and all Our loving Subjects to their Ancient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties; In effecting whereof, if not aſſiſted by you, we do verily believe ſalvation will come ſome other way, and we ſhall by Divine providence be reſtored to Our Royal and Legal Prerogatives; Yet we doubt not in the leaſt but that many of Our good Subjects will ſo far provide towards Our aſſiſtance, as to unite their heart in a joynt and hearty conſent to ſo publick a good as concerns not only Our Self, but them and their Poſterities for ever.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, (to prevent effuſion of blood) If Propoſitions of Peace ſhall be propounded by thoſe at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> Our ears ſhall be alwaies open unto them, and not only ready to receive them, but even to ſeek and ſolicit for them, when ever We can probably judge that they are a Full and Free Parliament, and will not reject Our Overture, which with all poſſible expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will come to their Hands.</p>
            <p>And We are ſo far from denying to anſwer any Propoſitions of Peace ſent by them, that we will and do promiſe, upon the word of a King, that if a Treaty may be procured, We will uſe no Hoſtile means, or other way which may be a hinderance therunto; the Sum of Our demands being. The glory of God, in the maintenance of the true reformed Proteſtant Religion, the juſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable right of the Crown, the juſt power and Priviledges of Parliament, and the lawful Rights of all Our Good Subjects: and all theſe under no ambiguous tearmes, whereby the contrary party have formerly deluded and miſlead ſo many of Our Loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, pretending that they have all along fought for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding if no Treaty can be procured, we ſhall hazzard Our Self to defend and maintain theſe our ſo juſt and Legal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and for thoſe who are obſtinate, and refuſe to joyn with Us in the proſecution of theſe Our juſt intentions, We do De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them unworthy of Our aſſiſtance. Nevertheleſs we know and do aſſure our ſelves, that few or none of Our good Subjects are ignorant of the heavy Taxes that have been impoſed upon them ſince our exilement, upon pain of plundring their goods, and and impriſonment of their perſons, taking from them a fifth part of their yearly Revenue, beſides Contribution; plundring al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all men of quality in every County, to the undoing of many of Our good. Subjects; And after theſe ſufferings what an Exciſe hath been ſet upon the Bread and Meat they eat, and which is far worſe how our Churches have been abuſed and made Stables, robbing and defacing them, aboliſhing the true Proteſtant Religion, and inſtead thereof introduced ſo many Religions as men ſhall fancy to themſelves.</p>
            <p>We are likewiſe confident, That many of Our Good Subjects are ſenſible of the happy Government they and their Anceſtors have enjoyed under many godly and pious Kings and Queens; Therefore we will and require all Our Loving Subjects ſeriouſly to conſider how ever probable they can expect ſuch dayes again, except they joyn with Our Self and Our Forces, to advance Our Throne and Regal Dignity. Which will be the only means to make up the Breaches in Our poor Maſſacred and divided King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, procure a happy Union betwixt Our Good Subjects, prevent all future diſtractions, and we may obtaine honour from all Chriſtian Princes, that Religion, Juſtice, Loyalty and a Free Trade may flouriſh throughout Our Dominions.</p>
