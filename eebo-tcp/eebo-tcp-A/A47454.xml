            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is more than a Year ſince, I began a Morning-Exerciſe on
the Lord's-Day at ſeven a Clock, when I entred upon an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of all the Parables and expreſs Similitudes contained in
the four Evangeliſts, according to the meaſure of Light and
Knowledge received; though by reaſon of a Journey into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
it has not been continued.<note place="margin">The whole will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 100 or 120 Sheets in Folio.</note> The Explication of this Parabolical
Speech of our Saviour, I have been prevailed with to make publick.
And if this meets with Acceptance, I may in a ſhort time publiſh
Propoſals for printing the whole; which in regard of the greatneſs
of the Charge, cannot be done but by Subſcriptions. And though I
muſt confeſs my Ability to perform ſo great a Work to be much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to many others; yet by God's Aſſiſtance I ſhall do what I
can.</p>
            <p>And the Conſideration of the kind Acceptance my other Labours
have had amongſt God's People, has cauſed me to take the more
pains: God having bleſſed the Writings of divers of his Servants to
the Converſion of many Souls, and Comfort of others; yet if I have
not ſufficient encouragement from Chriſtian Friends, I muſt deſiſt
this great Eſſay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader;</hi> The ſecond Sermon I have much enlarged, ſcarcely half
of it was delivered when preach'd, thinking to have preached a third
time upon the Text, but was prevented by laying down that Lecture, for
the Reaſon afore-mentioned: Neither have I been ſo large on other
Parables already opened, nor intend to be on thoſe I purpoſe to explain;
ſo that the firſt Sermon is rather a proper Specimen of the whole
Work than the ſecond.</p>
            <p>As touching ſome part of this dark Parabolical Saying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
I may differ in my Conceptions, 'tis probable, from divers Men;

mentioned, are ſuch only that Satan overcomes, after they have made
a profeſſion of Religion, with the ſame ſcandalous Sins, and ſo they turn
with the Dog to their old Vomit. I grant this may be true in reſpect of
ſome of them; yet I do not believe the Lord Jeſus intends to ſhew
<pb facs="tcp:59960:3"/>
hereby they do all after manner fall from their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

other People of that Generation; but many of them never became open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Prophane, yet was their State worse by many degrees, (than whilſt
they abode under the Power of groſs and ſcandalous Sins) and died
in their Vnbelief and Hypocriſy, which 'tis to be feared many now
do. If the Scope of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <hi>an unclean Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Becauſe he hath loſt his own original Purity, or clean
and Holy Nature, he being at firſt created an Angel of
Light, having like Holineſs before he fell, which the bleſſed
and elect Angels of Heaven have.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe he is ſo univerſally filthy and abominable vile
in himſelf, and ſo remains and will abide for ever, there
being no Poſſibility for him to become better, he being left
and forſaken of God, without any means afforded of being
purged from his unclean and filthy Nature.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe he is not only unclean in himſelf, but alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth
the Hearts and Spirits of all ſuch Perſons who receive
and entertain him; nay, all the Pollution of our Nature,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59960:4"/>
yea, the whole Nature of humane Race, was originally
from that Compliance and yeilding to him by our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
'tis this unclean Spirit that hath poyſoned and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
defiled the whole Man both Body and Soul in all its
Powers and Faculties, and not the whole Man only, but
the whole World alſo. And as this is naturally the filthy
and miſerable Condition of all Creatures, ſo thoſe who
yield to his Temptations, come to have farther Polution and
Defilement cleave to their Hearts and Lives. Sin is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
thing, and it makes all ſuch loathſom and abominable
in the Sight of God, who are overcome by it. Though all
naturally are vile and filthy, yet there are Degrees of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſ,
ſome are worſe than others, more wicked, and
ſo more like to the Devil, in whom his very Image or Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ
clearly may be ſeen.</p>
            <p>4. He may alſo be called <hi>an unclean Spirit,</hi> becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
inticeth and ſtrives to draw Men to Filthineſſ, and
to all manner of Uncleanneſſ, being an utter Enemy to all
Purity and true Holineſſ, envying all thoſe who love it, and
ſtrive to promote it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is gone out of a Man.</hi>] Not that the Man was actually
poſſeſſed with the Devil (as ſome may think) though
'tis very like the Lord Jeſus may borrow this Parabolical
Speech from a Perſon actually poſſeſſed; but he ſheweth
hereby that all wicked Men are in a myſtical and ſpiritual
ſenſe poſſeſſed with the Devil; all graceleſs Sinners have
an unclean Spirit in them. Where Sin predominates and rules
in the Heart, there the Devil has Poſſeſſion; that Heart is
Satan's Throne where he reigns and ſways the Scepter: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
was ſaid to enter into <hi>Judas</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Luke 22. 3.</note>; and to fill the Heart of
<hi>Ananias</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Acts 5. 3.</note>: both theſe had this unclean Spirit in them; the
one was plagued or poſſeſſed with a treacherous Devil, and
the other with a lying Devil. Hence 'tis alſo ſaid, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
who is the Prince of the Power of the Air, both
<hi>worketh</hi> and <hi>ruleth in the Children of Diſobedience</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 2, 3.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gone out</hi>] Either by the Power and Force of the Grace
of God in its common Operations he was thrown out; or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59960:5"/>
elſe, through Policy, he voluntarily leaves his Houſe for a
time, with an Intention to return again with a ſtronger
force: Some adhere to the firſt ſenſe, and others to the
laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gone out,</hi> i.e. as a carnal, prophane, or black Devil, for
ſo he may be ſaid to be in all debauched Perſons: and in
this reſpect he may be ſaid to be gone out, or thrown out of
the Phariſees, and other falſe and counterfeit Profeſſors;
he may not be able to keep them any longer under the Power
of open and groſs Prophaneneſs. And from hence the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee
proudly breaks forth, <hi>God, I thank thee, I am not as other
Men are,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 18. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Extortioners, Vnjuſt, Adulterers, or even as this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican.</hi>
Why may not Satan be expelled or forced out of his
Houſe in ſome degree, by the common Influences of the
Spirit? All generally grant that legal Convictions, and the
Operation of common Grace through the Workings of
natural Conſcience, have ſome conſiderable Power in them
to reform the Life of a wicked Perſon. Nor can I think
Satan would yield to any Soul voluntarily ſo far as to let
him become ſo much as civilized if he could help it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I rather think he was forced to give place, as not being
able to hold his own (in ſome reſpect) as formerly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
whilſt the Creature abides in his natural State, not
having a changed Heart, Satan hath poſſeſſion of that Soul
ſtill in a great meaſure; and therefore he leaves, no doubt,
a ſtrong Guard behind him, when he is ſaid to go out,
though they may be ſaid to hide themſelves, or retire into
ſome lurking-holes and Corners of the Houſe, or rather of
the Heart. Satan cannot doubtleſs keep Poſſeſſion always,
ſo far as to hold Men under the Power of groſs and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Sins, or cauſe them to continue openly prophane;
ſuch Power and Virtue is there in the common Operation
of the Spirit, or in legal Convictions and workings of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Conſcience, together with the help of the external
Miniſtration of God's Word, and by the means of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and thoſe ſevere Providences and Diſpenſations, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which wicked Men may be exerciſed, that it may tend
to make them become other Men: though it cannot change
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59960:5"/>
their Hearts, yet it may make a great change in their Lives,
by which means they may look like Saints, and talk like
Saints and ſanctified Perſons, and be taken for ſuch too by
the truly Godly; nay, and that which is worſe, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
within themſelves they are converted, ſince their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Enemy, that debauched groſs and unclean Spirit is gone
out of them. I am ſo far of the mind of <hi>James Arminius,</hi>
that Man by the means of that common Help and Power
God affords to all in general, may leave the groſs Acts of
Wickedneſs, let Satan do what he can; which has been
often evinced by that Terror ſevere humane Laws have had
on the Conſciences of wicked and ungodly Perſons. I am
perſwaded were there a Law that he that ſwore an Oath,
or was Drunk, or committed Adultery, ſhould have his
right Hand cut off, or be made a Slave all the days of his
Life, we ſhould ſee Men would get Power over thoſe Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Satan, and neither be Drunk nor commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
            <p>He walketh through dry Places.]</p>
            <p>1. Satan is ſaid in that of <hi>Job</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Job. 1. 7.</note>, <hi>To go to and fro in the
Earth, and to walk up and down in it.</hi> Satan here ſpeaks, ſaith
Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> like a Prince; therefore ſaith he; <q>Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this was the Prince of Devils that is mentioned in
this Text, or Belzebub the chief of Devils.</q> He walketh
about to view his Provinces and Territories, from one
place to another, but he doth not walk to and fro as an
<hi>idle Peripatetick,</hi> but to enquire, to obſerve, and conſider,
as a Spy, to ſearch all things and Perſons as he paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.
Therefore;</p>
            <p>2. This noteth that Satan is a diligent Enemy; if he hath
loſt a little ground, or is worſted in one Soul, he will try
what Power and Succeſs he can find in another.</p>
            <p>3. It ſhews that he is an unquiet and reſtleſs Spirit, being
caſt out of Heaven, he can reſt no where; and if he be
forced out of ſome Men at one time, he will tempt others;
nay, if the Servant hath a little worſted him, he, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
himself, will fall perhaps in the next place upon the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59960:6"/>
Son; if he loſe ſome place in his own Houſe, he will ſee if
he cannot get into the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt; or, if
he is forced to leave wet and filthy places in which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
he will walk through <hi>dry places,</hi> and ſee what he can
meet with there.</p>
            <p>4. Satan's great Work which he imploys himſelf in and
about, is no doubt to get into the Heart of Men to dwell,
nay rule there, and ſo ſubject them to himſelf, and defile
and polute them one way or other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dry places, ſeeking Reſt, and finding none</hi>] i. e. where there
is no Water or Moiſture, or not enough to refreſh him; he
has a cruel Thirſt upon him, and unleſs he can meet with
that he ſeeketh, which is to make a Prey of the Souls of
Men, he is in a reſtleſs ſtate, like a thirſty Perſon who walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through dry Places can find no Water. There are ſome
ſorts of Men that aford Satan no Content nor Satiſfaction;
he ſeeketh for that oft-times which he finds not; he is not
pleaſed to be as a Travellor, to paſs through a place and ſtay
(as it were but for a Night) but would fain find Reſt, <hi>i.e.</hi>
have a Place or Heart to dwell in, and take ſole Poſſeſſion of.
I find one of the Ancients, who writing on this dark Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
ſpeaketh thus: <hi>So long as he dwelleth not in me, he is
ſaid to ſeek Reſt he is grieved and vexed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Dry Places</hi> are commonly clean Places, or Places where
there is no Dirt or Mire: and Satan, that unclean Spirit,
is like a Swine, <hi>i. e.</hi> he delights in filthy and mirery Places,
which may ſignify his aſſaulting the Saints, or ſeeking to get
into ſanctified Hearts, or Hearts renewed by the ſpecial
Grace of God, and throughly purged by the Blood of
Chriſt, in whom that filthy ſink of Sin and Polution is not
only dryed up, but the Heart is changed and made new, and
ſo no more a Houſe or Habitation for this unclean Spirit,
but is become the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, or a Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
for God through the Spirit. And theſe Men's Hearts
are unto Satan, like dry Places to a thirſty and reſtleſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
for as the Holy Spirit cannot reſt, nor take up his abode
in filthy and poluted Hearts; ſo the Devil, that wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59960:6"/>
can find no Reſt nor Place of abode in renewed and
ſanctified Hearts. And as it is no ſuitable Houſe or Habitation
for him; ſo likewiſe Believers have one dwelling in them,
ſtrong enough to keep Satan out: <hi>for ſtronger</hi> (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle<note n="*" place="margin">1 John 2. 14.</note>)
<hi>is he that is in us, than he which is in the World:</hi> and
again he ſaith<note n="†" place="margin">1 John 5. 18.</note>, <hi>Ye are ſtrong, and the Word of God abideth in
you; and ye have overcome the Wicked one: He that is begotten of
God, keepeth himſelf, and the wicked one toucheth him not:</hi> ſhall
not ſo touch him as to enter into his Heart, and take up his
Dwelling, or get Poſſeſſion of him any more; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
theſe Men's Hearts, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Hearts of true ſanctified
Chriſtians, I conclude are meant here by our Saviour, which
are to Satan as dry places, where there is no dwelling or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding
for him.</p>
            <p>2. As <hi>dry Places</hi> are clean Places; ſo likewiſe they are
commonly barren Places, Places where little or nothing
will grow; Satan is for ſuch Hearts that will receive his evil
Seed, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuited and fit to cloſe in with his curſed Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which are like to moiſt or mirery places; ſuch as all
corrupt and unregenerate Hearts are, in others that bitter and
evil Seed which this unclean Spirit ſows, will not take root:
Or if it ſhould ſo fall out, that through the Careleſneſs and
Negligence of Believers, and Strength of Temptations, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
ſhould drop ſome of his curſed Seed in them, and it
ſhould meet with a little of the old corrupt Nature (there
being in the beſt of Men an unregenerate part) yet it would
ſoon wither and come to nothing; for their Hearts are, (as
I ſaid before) no proper Soyl for the Seed of the wicked
one, therefore if he gets in a little, he is ſoon turned out
again; ſo that in a Word, according to the Import of this
Saying of Chriſt, (as I conceive) theſe Mens Hearts are to
the Devil, like dry places, where he can find no Reſt.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Dry Places</hi> are for the moſt part places leaſt inhabited
for want of Water; the Hearts of Saints are like uninhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Places to Satan, in them he cannot find thoſe proper
Accommodations which he needs and muſt have where he
dwells. But ſince he can find no Dwelling here, no Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
Comfort nor Refreſhment, <hi>i. e.</hi> no abode in Godly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59960:7"/>
Hearts; he ſaith, <hi>I will return into my Houſe from whence I
came out,</hi> ver. 44.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will return:</hi> Not that he was quite routed and vanquiſhed
before, 'tis called ſtill his Houſe, he lays claim and pleads
Propriety in him and Interest ſtill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore this Man's
Heart was not become the Temple of the Holy Spirit, he
was gone out, or forced out before, as a <hi>Swearing, Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Whoring,</hi> or <hi>drunken Devil,</hi> &amp;c. and this might inrage
him, and move him to attempt ſome greater Enterprize,
which we have already ſpoken to. Satan doth not love to
looſe or let go any ſtrong hold he hath of carnal and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Perſons; but ſeeing he had received ſome ſmall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat,
he ſets upon the truly Godly Chriſtian; like as when
he was caſt out of Heaven unto the Earth, he preſently
perſecuted the Woman which brought forth the Man-child,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 13. When he ſaw he could not uphold his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by Paganiſm, nor farther execute his Malice by Pagan
Emperors, but was routed and overcome as to that Power
he had, (as our late Annotators obſerve) to let us know that
he retains his Malice, though he hath loſt his former ſtrength,
he goes on in purſuing the Church of God. Even ſo, I ſay,
he having been forced to give way before (as was hinted) he
walks about to ſeek Revenge upon the Saints; but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him like dry Places to a thirſty Man, or as an Inn to a
Traveller, <hi>viz.</hi> no reſting Place, he reſolves to return to his
own Houſe, that is, the Hearts of hypocritical Profeſſors,
ſuch as the Phariſees were: And this returning of his into
his old Houſe, imports (as I conceive) his coming again in
another form or ſhape, and with a Reſolution to get better
and more firmer and ſurer Poſſeſſion than he had before.</p>
            <p>Now he <hi>appears as an Angel of Light.</hi> Nor can we ſuppoſe
he had no Party left in the ſaid Houſe when he went out.
Parables muſt not he ſtrained too far; We ought not to
ſcrue or make too ſevere a Scrutiny upon every Phraſe:
therefore we cannot think when he is ſaid to return to his
former Houſe, or attempt afreſh the falſe and counterfeit
Chriſtian, that he hath quite given over his Deſigns in aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſanctified Perſons, but he cannot indure to be an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derling,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59960:7"/>
he is for kinging it in the Souls of Men, would fain
reign and ſway the Scepter there; and where he cannot rule
and domineer, he harh no Reſt, nor can be ſatiſfied. And
therefore he may be ſaid to return as an exiled Prince, and
leſt he ſhould be diſcovered, he puts on a new Garb, and is
now contented his Captive ſhould become religious, that ſo
the deluded Sinner might not diſcern him, but take him for
his lawful Sovereign; as if he ſhould ſay, I will yield to
you now; if you will be a Profeſſor and become religious,
ye ſhall, but I will dwell with you notwithſtanding; here is
room enough for me as a white Devil, tho not as a black one</p>
            <p>And when he is come, he findeth it empty, ſwept and garniſhed.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Empty;</hi> That is, the Spirit of God was not there, true
Grace was not there, Chriſt dwelleth not there; that Houſe
may well be ſaid to be empty, where God and Jeſus Chriſt
are not; nor is it a hard and difficult thing for the unclean
Spirit to enter into ſuch a Soul, ſince there was no Enemy
ſtrong enough to keep him out; but contrariwiſe, the place
ſeems to be rather prepared and made fit for him, to take up
his abode in this new religious and ſpiritual Appearance;
nay here is not only room for himſelf, but the Houſe is ſo
empty, that many other unclean Spirits more wicked than
himſelf, may have their abode and dwelling there alſo. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
ſaith, <hi>I will return to my Houſe,</hi> &amp;c. He ſpeaks as if he
was ſure enough that this ſinner was his own, and therefore
ſhould without any difficulty enter in, in that new Diſguiſe
in which he now appears; and accordingly 'tis ſaid, he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it <hi>empty,</hi> and alſo <hi>ſwept:</hi> but doubtleſs ſome Dirt and
Filth was yet in ſome Hole or Corner: For like as a lazy
and ſlothful Houſe-wife uſes to ſweep a little of the looſe
Duſt and Filth in the open and middle of the Room, and lets
many ſecret Corners lie foul as before, and may be leaves
the Dirt behind the Door out of the publick view of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
So the falſe and counterfeit Chriſtian reforms his Life
in the ſight of Men; or, like the Phariſees, makes clean
the out-side of the Cup and Platter; but their Hearts are
ſtill polluted, and as vile as ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59960:8"/>
               <hi>Swept;</hi> but not with a proper and fit Broom; 'tis ſaid to
be ſwept, but alas 'twas only with the Beeſom of legal Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
and how far that will cleanſe the unclean and wicked
Perſon, is known to all underſtanding Men; it only takes
away the Filth of groſs and ſcandalous Sins: therefore ſaid
by St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.</note> 
               <hi>To eſcape the Corruption that is in the World;</hi> that
is, the prophane World, <hi>i. e.</hi> vile and notorious Sins and
Pollutions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And garniſhed,</hi> or painted; which may ſignify that ſeeming
Sanctity, moral Vertue, and the common Graces of the
Spirit. Our Saviour elſewhere compares Phariſaical Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 27, 29.</note>
to painting or garniſhing of a Sepulchre; <hi>Wo unto you
Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites, for ye are like unto whited Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres,
which indeed appear beautiful outward, but within are full
of dead Mens Bones, and all Vncleanneſs: Ye build</hi> (saith he)
<hi>the Tombs of the Prophets, and garniſh the Sepulchres of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>
And thus Phariſaical and Hypocritical Profeſſors
may be ſaid to be garniſhed, <hi>i. e.</hi> they ſeem glorious to
Men, who only judg by the outward Appearance, and know
not the Heart; there may be a great change of Life, a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
outſide, and yet the evil and vitious Habits and Polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Heart may be ſtill the ſame, and not changed.
And remarkable is this Phraſe of our Saviour [<hi>garniſhed,</hi>]
which we know is commonly a curious piece of Art: Men
by their Ingenuity ſtrive to imitate Nature; they will draw
the Face of a Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with curious Painting, very exact,
ſo that it much reſembles the Perſon's natural Face, yet 'tis
not the ſame, 'tis but a piece of Paint, an artificial Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Even ſo in like manner by the Improvement of a Man's
natural Parts, common Grace, Light and Knowledg, he
may appear in the view and ſight of Men, as a true Child
of God, and may talk and diſcourse like a Saint, read and
hear God's Word, nay, and pray alſo with much ſeeming
Devotion and Piety, and may likewiſe bridle many unruly
Luſts, and groſs Enormities of Life, and give Alms to the
Poor, inſomuch that he may very exactly reſemble a true
and ſincere Chriſtian, and be taken by all Godly People to
be indeed ſuch an one: but notwithſtanding all, 'tis but an
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59960:8"/>
artificial Piece, 'tis but like a curious Paint, or vain-glorious
Garniſh; it is not the Image of God, it is not the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
though it looks like it, much reſembles it, yet it is not
the ſame: for the Man is a meer Hypocrite, a counterfeit
Chriſtian, the work upon him being only the Product of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Improvements, and not the Effects of the ſaving Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the Holy Spirit. Nay, and Satan, though an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Spirit, likes to dwell in ſuch a Houſe, I mean ſuch a
Heart, thus ſwept and garniſhed, as well as in the Heart of
a vile and debauched Perſon: And evident it is, that this
ſweeping or external cleanſing with the Broom of outward
Reformation, or the Garniſh of moral Righteouſneſſ, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Gifts and Graces of the Spirit, Prayer, hearing the
Word, partaking of the Sacraments, and doing many good
Works, cannot ſecure the Soul againſt Satan's Attempts, in
order to his taking up his Habitation in ſuch Perſons Hearts.</p>
            <p>After I had preached theſe two Sermons, a Godly Friend
who heard them, told me he had met with a Treatiſe of Mr.
<hi>Richard Allen</hi>'s, Author of <hi>Vindiciae Pietatis,</hi> who gives the
ſame ſenſe on this myſterious place of Scripture: He helped
me to the Book which I was ignorant of, and Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> being
a very worthy Perſon, I ſhall give you ſome brief Hints of
what he hath ſaid.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the unclean Spirit goeth out of a Man,</hi> &amp;c. That Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are vile and abominable, ſaith he, it is from that wicked
Spirit, Satan, that dwells in them: Every Sinner is a Perſon
poſſeſſed of a Devil; when a little reformed, they ſeem
for a time to be diſpoſſeſſed, <hi>&amp;c. He walketh through dry
Places;</hi> what theſe dry Places may be, is not eaſy to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine:
Some by theſe <hi>loca arida,</hi> underſtand <hi>loca vacua,</hi>
void empty Places, the Deſerts and Waſtes of the Earth,
where he finds no body to attempt or moleſt.</p>
               <p>But could Satan, ſaith he, think to find Reſt there where
was no Houſe for him to lay his Head in? Would the
Tempter waſte his time in ſeeking whom to devour in
thoſe waſte Places, where he knew well enough there were
none to be found? He knows too well where Sinners dwell,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59960:9"/>
to go to ſeek them where they are not; more like to find
the Devil at a Market, than in a Wilderneſs. Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſeems not to be the ſenſe—.</p>
               <p>Why may not, ſaith he, theſe <hi>dry Places</hi> be the Saints
on Earth, the Fountain of whoſe Blood is dried up? in
whom the Sun hath dried up their Dirt and Mire, in
which this Swine loves to wallow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [<hi>He ſeeketh Reſt</hi>]
this notes two things.</p>
               <p>1. When the Devil is gone out of any Perſon, he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
at Reſt till he is gotten in again, either thither whence
he went out, or into ſome other Habitation, where he may
do more Miſchief: Like Children, like Father, 'tis ſaid
of them, ſo 'tis much more true of him, <hi>He reſts not but in
doing Miſchief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Devil loves to dwell where he may be at Reſt;
that is, not from Work (his Reſt is his Work) but from
Reſistance or Oppoſition, <hi>i. e.</hi> in carnal and unclean
Hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[<hi>Seeking Reſt and finding none.</hi>] He goes, ſaith he, through
theſe dry Places, from Saint to Saint, from Heart to Heart,
in hope to find Entertainment, but is ſtill diſappointed;
here's little Reſt for me to be had, theſe dry Places I ſee are
no Places for me, here's watching and wreſtling and warring
againſt me; ſo much praying, complaining againſt me,
that there's no ſtay for me here:—Ile go back to my old
Habitation: And when he comes, he finds it empty, ſwept,
and garniſhed, a little cleaner and handſomer than when
he left it. The Devil can allow Sinners a little Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but though it be a little cleanſed and garniſhed, yet
it lies empty ſtill, there's no Tenant hath taken it up, though
the Devil went out, Chriſt was not let in, but there it lies
void for the next that comes.</p>
               <p>Then he goeth and taketh ſeven other Spirits more wicked than
himſelf, and they enter in, and dwell there; and the laſt ſtate of
that Man is worſe than the firſt. <hi>Beware of a returning De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
the Devil at his return often makes ſevenfold worſe
Work than before he did.</hi>

He modeſtly offers this as his Thoughts on the Place, and
I find others confirming by ſome brief Hints the ſame things.
I thought it not amiſs to recite this Paſſage of his, as a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Confirmation of the Expoſition I have briefly given
you of this dark Place of Scripture, not doubting but 'tis the
ſenſe and meaning of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>But now to draw towards a Cloſe, take two or three
Points of Doctrine.<note place="margin">Doct. I.</note> Obſerve,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Satan is an unclean Spirit.</hi> As God is the Author and
Original of all true Holineſs, ſo is Satan of all Sin and
Wickedneſs: And as God's Nature is pure, ſo the Devil
in his Nature is impure; all Purity proceeds from God, and
all Sin proceeds from Satan; God ſtrives to promote the
one, and the Devil labours to promote the other: As God's
Kingdom is ſet up in the World, and maintained by Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſpiritual Sanctity; ſo the Devil's Kingdom is ſet up
and upheld by Sin and Filthineſs. As God by his Spirit dwells
in ſanctified Hearts, ſo the Devil dwells in polluted and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Hearts: And as Chriſt makes that Man or Woman holy
and clean where he makes his abode; ſo Satan makes thoſe
Souls where he takes up his Dwelling, unclean and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
wicked. Moreover, as he who is truly ſanctified and
made Holy, is ſaid to be of God; ſo they that are wicked
and ungodly,<note place="margin">1 John 3. 8, 12.</note> are ſaid to be of the Devil<note n="*" place="margin">John 8.</note>. All thoſe who
are ſpiritual and truly gracious are like to God, or bear ſome
Reſemblance of him; and all unclean and wicked Perſons
are like to the Devil. Theſe things conſidered, no marvel
Satan is called an unclean Spirit.<note place="margin">Doct. II.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. All prophane notorious and ungodly Sinners are in a woful ſtate,
the unclean Spirit is in them, their Hearts are Satan's Habitation.</p>
            <p>The Heart of Man was not originally Satan's Houſe, nor
hath he any juſt Right or Propriety in it; 'tis his by Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Conqueſt, as Men yield up themſelves to him,
and entertain his Temptations. Man both Body and Soul is
the Lord's, he is his Creature; nor ought he to ſuffer any to
dwell in him, much leſs to rule and ſway the Scepter over
him, but the Holy God. But as all Men as they come into
the World, have wretched and curſed Natures, through
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59960:10"/>
original Depravity; ſo ungodly Men actually have caſt off
God, their lawful and only Sovereign, and have imbraced
the wicked one, they have received, and do ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Satan that unclean and filthy Spirit, he is King and
Lord over them. The Devil hath got Poſſeſſion by Craft,
he inticed our firſt Parents to open the Door to him, they
gave him the firſt Entertainment, 'twas then he took Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and thereby at once corrupted all that are in the Houſe;
I mean, all the Faculties of the Soul, to ſuch a Degree, that
they all naturally ſide with Satan, and are for him, and are
filled with Enmity againſt God,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> and oppoſe and reſist his
Spirit, and rebel againſt the Light. Wicked Men had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be under the tyrannical Government of the Devil, than
to be ruled and governed by Jeſus Chriſt: And from hence
'tis no wonder they rather chuſe to have wicked earthly Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and tyrannical Kings to be over them, than to be ſubject
to a Prince who is an Enemy to Wickedneſſ, Tyranny and
Oppreſſion. This ſhews the Blindneſs and miſerable State
and Condition of all wicked and ungodly Men. We may
further note alſo,</p>
            <p>3. That Satan may loſe ſome ground in Sinners Hearts,<note place="margin">Doct. III.</note> he
may ſeem to be gone out of them, and they may become ſober and
civilized, and yet may be in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and their
Hearts notwithſtanding may be ſtill Satan's Habitation.</p>
            <p>Let theſe Men change their Lives, and become other Men
in the View of the World, alter their courſe of Life, yet
they are miſerable; Satan has ſpiritual Power and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over them; he has a ſtrong party in their Hearts, when
he ſeems to be gone out, and knows they are his ſtill, and
owns them as his dwelling place. When he cannot meet with
Entertainment in other places, when Saints afford him no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
but diſplease and defy him, and their Hearts
are as dry places, he can nevertheleſs return at pleaſure to
his old Habitation, and there he enters and dwells. Let
them change their Religion, yet they are Satan's Slaves ſtill,
he matters not if they leave Popery and cleave to Prelacy,
and ſo become Proteſtants in general; nay, imbrace a more
refined ſort of People, and take upon them a more ſtrict
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59960:10"/>
Profeſſion of Religion, yet ſtill they belong to him, if they
are not truly regenerated and renewed in their Souls; let
them be <hi>Preſbyterians, Independents,</hi> or <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> it ſignifies
nothing, they are ſtill the ſame, and under Satan's Power
and Dominion. O how miſerably are ſome Men deceived,
thinking if they are reformed and become zealous for exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Ordinances, and have taken up this or that form of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and are taken for Saints by Men, that all is well,
and they ſhall be ſaved! How did the Phariſees glory in
their ſeeming Zeal and Piety, and flatter themſelves, and
yet wofully blinded, and in a damnable State and Condition?
Note alſo, that,</p>
            <p>4. Morality,<note place="margin">Doct. IV.</note> external Gifts and common Grace, are but like a
vain Paint, a mere empty and artificial Garniſh.</p>
            <p>They make a fair ſhow in the Fleſh, they pride it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and Men praiſe and admire them, but what doth all
this ſignify? they are ſtill under a diabolical Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
and <hi>twofold more the Children of the Devil than they were
before:</hi> Nay, as I ſhall hereafter ſhew, rather ſeven times
worſe than when they were openly wicked and prophane.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>1. A Terror to Sinners. Tremble you that live wicked
Lives, remember the unclean Spirit dwells in you, and has
Power over you, your Hearts are his Habitation, he rules
in you, and takes you Captive at his Will. If in this State
you die, you are undone for ever.</p>
               <p>2. See to it, you that are Profeſſors, leſt you are alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
What is a reformed Life without a changed Heart?
To caſt off the groſs Acts of Sin, will not avail you any
thing, without the evil Habits are broke, and you renewed
in the Spirit of your Mind. Though you ſeem to be godly
to Men, yet God knows your Hearts, and how they ſtand
affected to him, and to true real Godlineſs. A form of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will never ſave you; and though you may have got ſome
ground againſt Satan, and he ſeems to have left you, or is
gone out, yet take heed he does not return again with greater
ſtrength, and get you into ſtronger Bonds now, than he had
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59960:11"/>
before. But becauſe this will be more fully opened in the
next place, I ſhall at preſent ſay no more to it now.</p>
               <p>3. This alſo affords much Comfort to God's People. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
ſets upon you, and fain he would ſubject your Souls to
himſelf, and take Poſſeſſion of your Hearts, but he cannot
prevail, you have got one in you who is ſtronger than Satan,
who will preſerve you to his Heavenly Kingdom. But no
more at this time: I ſhall leave what I have ſaid to the
Bleſſing of God.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THE laſt Day I opened the ſeveral Parts of this place
of Holy Scripture,<note place="margin">Morning-Exerciſe on <hi>Horſely-Down,</hi> Auguſt 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1690.</note> in the uſual Method I have all along
taken in my Expoſition of other Parables, which I
have already ſpoken to, according to that ſmall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of Light and Knowledg the Lord hath been pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
upon me. There remains one thing further to be done,
and that is indeed the chief and moſt material of all, which is
to ſhew you the ſad State of the falſe and counterfeit Profeſſor,
out of whom the Unclean Spirit is ſaid to be gone, but yet is
returned again with ſeven other Spirits more wicked than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Our Bleſſed Lord ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 45</note> 
                  <hi>The laſt State of that Man is worſe
than the firſt.</hi> Now in what reſpect a painted Hypocrite, or
one garniſhed only with common Gifts and Graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
may be ſaid to be in a worſe State than the open Prophane,
I ſhall endeavour, God aſſiſting, to demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid, <hi>Satan returned with ſeven other Spirits,</hi> &amp;c.] Seven
is a number of Perfection. I judg our Saviour deſigned hereby
to ſhew that the Devil hath now got ſtronger hold and poſſeſſion
of ſuch a Perſon by many degrees; many unclean Spirits, or
worſe and more dangerous Sins cleave to him than before, ſo
that he is like to be perfectly miſerable. But to proceed;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> That which renders falſe Profeſſors, or counterfeit
Chriſtians, to be in ſuch a deplorable Condition, (which alſo
evidently appeared in the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and other People in that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
to whom primarily our Saviour refers, as the cloſe
of the <hi>45th</hi> Verſe ſhews) is, that great Ignorance that cleaves
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59960:12"/>
to them notwithſtanding their common Illuminations; which
uſually does conſist in theſe Reſpects following.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>They know not their own miſerable State, looking upon themſelves
to be rich and increaſed with Goods,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and to have need of nothing:</hi> as
appears by that Charge of the Lord Chriſt againſt the Church
of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who were fallen into the like Condition; they
think none knows more than themſelves, inſomuch that they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
contemn him who tells them how it is with them; and
this riſes from the conſideration of that great Knowledg they
conceit they have above others;<note place="margin">Joh. 9. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>But now ye ſay, Ye ſee, therefore
your Sin remains.</hi> If your Ignorance were ſimple, (as if Chriſt
ſhould ſay) and not affected, or were you ſenſible of your blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ,
then your Diſease would not be ſo incurable: But now
you ſay you ſee, and you doubt not but you are in a ſtate of
Happineſſ, and are the only People of God, and yet preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly
refuſe the way of your Relief and Salvation, and do
not conclude you are under Guilt and Wrath, as indeed you are.
Prophane Perſons, though their State is bad, and very miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet are not generally ſo blind as once to imagine their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to be good, but act and do thoſe abominable Deeds of
Darkneſſ, againſt the Light and Dictates of their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences:
And though Satan hath got power over them, and their
Luſts predominate in them, yet are they commonly poſſeſſed at
certain times with fear about their eternal State, (unleſs whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given up to a reprobate Mind,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>having their Conſcience ſeared
with an hot Iron</hi>); and that which ſeems to bear up their Spirits,
is the hopes they have of future Repentance; for the thoughts
of dying in the preſent Condition they are in, is grievous to
them: Nay, and the falſe Profeſſor, whilſt he abode under the
Power of the Unclean Spirit, being openly prophane, might
tremble, as ſeeing himſelf poſting headlong to Hell; but now,
through the blindneſs of his Mind, for want of a true illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit, he thinks he is in the direct way to Heaven,
his Conſcience being miſled, (and his intellectual part darkened)
never reproves him, but rather gives in its teſtimony for him.
And thus it was with <hi>Paul</hi> before his Converſion; whilſt he
abode a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> his Conſcience never accuſed him for thoſe
great Evils in perſecuting the Church of God; for he himſelf
ſaith, <hi>he did it ignorantly in unbelief.</hi> What can render the State
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59960:12"/>
of a Perſon worſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be an Enemy to God, and Jeſus
Chriſt, and to the Power of Godlineſs, and yet think he is
Holy, and a good Chriſtian; nay, and his Conſcience being
blinded in the Matter, acquits him of Hypocriſy for want of
Saving-light, whilſt he keeps up in a zealous performance of the
external Acts of Duty and Religion, by which means he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of that help which ſome openly-prophane meet with
from the Rebukes and Laſhes of their own Conſciences, which
oft-times proves a means of their Converſion. But the hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Profeſſor, not knowing the want of a changed Heart, nor
the defect of thoſe Sacred Principles from whence ſhould flow all
he acts and does, but contrarywiſe is ſtirred up by falſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and acts only by the power of natural Conſcience and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
having no clear judgment to diſcern his own Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
nor what a State is he ſtill in; His Condition is deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and this Unclean Spirit is worſe and more direful than
that which he was in before.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Their Blindneſs and Ignorance conſiſteth, in that they cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
nor diſtinguiſh between a changed Heart and a changed Life, or
between legal Reformation and true Regeneration.</hi> They think, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their State ſeems ſo much better than it was before, in
their own apprehenſion, and in the apprehenſion of others alſo,
their Condition is good enough, they comparing themſelves with
themſelves,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 12.</note> beholding what a vaſt difference there is, or ſeems
to be in reſpect of what they once were, when Swearers, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
Whoremongers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot but commend themſelves
to themſelves: once they ſaw themſelves Sinners, and called
themſelves ſo, and were aſhamed of their own ſinful and wicked
Lives; but now they are Righteous in their own conceit, and
ſo have no need of any further work, being arrived to that
State of Holineſſ, (as they think) to that degree of Piety, to
that Change, to that Converſion, that they conclude they need
not ſeek for any other, and yet are deceived, and in the Gall of
Bitterneſs. And hereby they ſeem to put themſelves out of the
Call of Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>who came to ſeek and to ſave that which was
loſt: not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</hi> Let Men
think what they pleaſe, certainly there is no Devil like this
Devil: If he can perſwade a Man that he is whole, and not
ſick at all, and ſo needs no Phyſician; and that when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59960:13"/>
is preached to Sinners, and the danger of Unbelief is
opened, yet it doth not affect him, nor concern him, he being
become a righteous Perſon; what hopes can there be of
ſuch a one? Alas, the Miniſters of Chriſt have received no
Commiſſion to offer Chriſt to any but to Sinners. Now theſe
are not the Perſons a precious Saviour is tendred unto, they
ſee no want nor need of him, and therefore theſe are paſſed by
as ſuch who need no Repentance.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Their Blindneſs conſiſteth in their ignorance of God's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi>
not knowing what Righteouſneſs it is that will render
them accepted and juſtified in the ſight of God; and ſo, like
the poor Jews,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note> go <hi>about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs,</hi> their
own perſonal Righteouſneſſ, a home-spun Righteouſneſs; they
ſee no need to go to another, to be beholden to another, for
that which they ſuppoſe they have in themſelves. And this
ignorance of the Righteouſneſs of God, partly riſes from their
ignorance of the Nature of the Law, and pure Nature of God,
concluding, there is no need of a ſpotleſs or perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ
in point of Juſtification, (as either being inherent in us,
which can't be, ſince all have ſinned) or elſe by Imputation, as
wrought out for us in the Perſon of the Mediator; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
think (as <hi>Paul</hi> once did) he is a juſtified Perſon who
breaks not the Letter of the Law, or is not guilty of the groſs
Acts of Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly; Their Danger appears alſo from a proud Devil that
now is entred into them.</hi> Pride commonly accompanies Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and this abounds in the Heart of Man by Nature, and
there it will predominate, till the Soul paſſes through an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Change; but it appears in none ſo fully, or to ſuch a
Degree, as in a Phariſaical Perſon; he cannot indure to think
he is ſo poor as prophane and notorious Sinners are; what, go
to his Neighbour's Door for every Morſel of Bread he eats,
and for every draught of Drink! no, 'tis below him to beg,
he thinks 'tis enough for Publicans and Sinners to do ſo. And
indeed what need he go to be fed and clothed by another, that
is full, and ſees his Goods increaſed, and hath need of nothing?
Faith empties the Soul, makes it poor, before it fills and inriches
it. But this Man knows not what Faith is, nor the Life of it.
Pride ſprings from an inordinate Self-love: Self-love, and Self-flattery,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59960:13"/>
are the Glaſſes in which a ſelf-deceived Hypocrite
looks daily in, in which he appears indeed that which he is not.
Self-love is a Multiplying, yea a Magnifying-Glaſs. Theſe never
had a true ſight of themſelves, never ſaw their own Poverty,
and horrid pollution of their Nature; 'tis with them, as it
was with the Apoſtle, before the Commandment came, they
are alive,<note place="margin">Ròm. 7. 9.</note> and beautiful in their own Eyes. <hi>Behold, thou art
called a Jew,</hi>

                  <hi>and reſteſt in the Law, and makeſt thy boaſt of God,

Thou art, as if he ſhould ſay, called a Saint, looked upon by
all to be a Holy Perſon, a Religious Man, one of great Parts,
and Knowledg, and Abilities, exceeding many; makeſt thy
boaſt of God, as if none knew him ſo well as thou doſt: but
this was their Pride, their Hearts were lifted up, by reaſon of
that knowledg they had of the Letter of the Law; though
neither their Hearts nor Lives were conformable to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualneſs
of it, never ſaw that the leaſt Sin and Luſts lays them
open to the dreadful Wrath of God, and to the Curſe of his

                  <hi>i. e.</hi> all ſcandalous and groſs Sins, and
ſo were puffed up in Pride and Vain-Glory. Theſe Self-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Perſons will not be made ſenſible that they are in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
State, becauſe of thoſe commendable Qualities poſſeſſed
within, as they ſeem in their own Eyes; and do not perceive
how they are degenerated, and have loſt the Image of God
which we had in Creation, and how now they bear the Image
of the Devil by Corruption; they underſtand not the Nature
and Extent of Original Sin, the pravity of their natural
Faculties, the lameneſs and impotency of their own natural
Powers, nor the ſinfulneſs of the firſt motions of their Hearts;
boaſting (as one obſerves) of ſelf-Ability in the midſt of utter
Weakneſs,<note place="margin">Charnock.</note> and an affection to God under prevailing and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Enmity. Pride commonly ariſes from a conceit of ſome
excelling Quality, whether Beauty, Parts, or Knowledg, or
affected Piety; and theſe Men never being convinced of their
own natural Deformity, Filthineſs, and Pollution of Sin, that
contagion of the Soul, the univerſal ſtain of Nature, nothing
but Pollution ſucceeding in the place of original Purity, are
ſwelled up in ſpiritual Pride and ſelf-conceitedneſs. The <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59960:14"/>
were the proudeſt of all People, and they were the moſt
ignorant of Goſpel-Truths; they would have their Opinion a
Rule to all the People, and that muſt be a Truth which they
ſo eſteem to be, and that an Error, which they conceit ſo
to be. Pride being the Devil's Sin, is hateful to God. He
that looks upon himſelf too much, looks upon God too little.
If God hides the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven from
any,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 25.</note> 'tis <hi>from the Wiſe and Prudent.</hi> The Deſign of God in
the glorious contrivance of the way of Salvation by Chriſt,
is to confound and deſtroy the Pride of Man; and becauſe
Man's corrupt Reaſon cannot comprehend the Sacred Myſteries
of the Doctrine of Faith, they contemn and diſbelieve the
revelation of it.</p>
               <p>No Religion nor Ordinance of God is valued by ſome Men
but what ſuits with their own affected Principles and Notions;
from hence the <hi>Greeks</hi> counted the Goſpel Fooliſhneſs:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.</note> and the
<hi>Jews</hi> were ſo wedded to their own legal Righteouſneſs, that
unto them Jeſus Chriſt was a ſtumbling-block; the pride of their
Knowledg and Attainments was the Mother and Nurſe of their
incredulity:<note place="margin">Joh. 7. 48.</note> 
                  <hi>Have any of the Phariſees believed on him?</hi> Theſe
Men ſin (as I have often told ſome of you) againſt the Remedy,
and fence againſt the Edge of that Sword by which their Souls
ſhould be wounded, and they die, if ever they come to live in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
therefore what hopes is there of them? Alas, Men
ſwelled up with an Opinion of their own good Estate and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
without Chriſt, are unfit for Faith. This is one of
the ſtrong Holds, exalting it ſelf againſt the Knowledg of God:
How loth is a proud Man to become a Fool, that he may be
wiſe? or to captivate his Reaſon to the obedience of Faith,
to be juſtified by another's Righteouſneſs? and that our own
Righteouſneſs, which is ſo pleaſant and acceptable in our
ſight, and in the ſight of Men, ſhould be as filthy Rags, or a
loathſome thing in the ſight of God, is to theſe ſort of People
a ſtrange Paradox.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucifer,</hi> as ſome pretend, is one of the chief of Devils, who
is called alſo the <hi>King of Pride:</hi> If ſo, certainly he is one of
thoſe wicked Spirits that entred into this Perſon. Now what
but infinite Power can throw out this Devil, this Pride, and
bring this Soul to the foot of the croſs, and make it ſtrike its
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59960:14"/>
ſwelling Sails to Jeſus Chriſt, and become nothing in it ſelf,
and to hate and loth its own Righteouſneſs, by reaſon of that
impurity and pollution that cleaves to every beſt Duty they
do or can perform? Thus this unclean Spirit raiſes up ſtrong
Fortifications againſt the way of Salvation, the way of Faith,
or going to Jeſus Chriſt for all as poor and undone Sinners.
Theſe Enemies, in Hypocritical and Self-righteous Perſons, ſtand
armed in the Breaches of Nature (as one obſerves) to
beat off all Aſſaults of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Charnock.</note> and therefore the latter
State of theſe Perſons is worſe than the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly; Self-confidence</hi> may be another evil Spirit that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into theſe Perſons, and which renders their State ſo bad.
'Tis impoſſible to perſwade them that their Condition is nought
and damnable: you may (as I hinted before) quickly bring a
vile and debauched Perſon to acknowledg his State is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
tho there is no turning him from his evil courſe; yet he ſtands
not upon ſelf-juſtification, but rather readily yields to you: if you
deal with him at a ſeaſonable time with Wiſdom, and tell him
he is a very wretched Creature I know: I am ſo, ſaith he,
the Lord have Mercy upon me. But the Man out of whom
the debauched Devil is gone, is in his own Eyes become ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Perſon, a ſeeming Saint, one that hears Sermons, Prays,
and gives Alms, and yet not renewed, nor his evil Habits
changed. O 'tis no eaſy thing to bring him once to doubt or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
the Goodneſs of his Condition, he bleſſes God for that help
he has had to change his former courſe of Life; <hi>God, I thank
thee, I am not as other Men, nor as this Publican;</hi> I was as bad as
other, but I am become religious; now I am no Swearer,
Whoremonger, Drunkard, Extortioner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this purpoſe
you have the <hi>Phariſee</hi> boaſting and praiſing of God: this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
his ſtate lamentable with a witneſs. What made the fooliſh
Virgins ſo bold as to go forth to meet the Bridegroom? Was
it not that confidence they had that their condition was good?<note place="margin">Prov. 14. 16.</note>
                  <hi>A wiſe Man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, feareth, and departeth from iniquity;
but a Fool rageth, and is confident.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Confidence is oppoſed to Fearing; ſo that this ſort of Men
are ſecure and unſensible of their Danger till it is too late. As
in the Caſe of the Fooliſh Virgins, they ſaw not their fearful
State till the Mid-night Cry was heard. And hence our Saviour
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59960:15"/>
told the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 32, 33.</note> that <hi>Publicans and Harlots went into
the Kingdom of Heaven before them:</hi> Which fully confirms what
we ſay from this dark Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> That openly prophane
Perſons, and notorious Sinners, are not in ſo dangerous a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
as a falſe Profeſſor or counterfeit Chriſtian, who having
paſſed under a ſeeming change of Life, and left the groſs Acts
of Sin, though never throughly wrought upon by regenerating
Grace; and I conclude this of Self-confidence is one of thoſe
more wicked Spirits that are now entered into him. <hi>Behold, thou
art called a Jew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 17, 18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>and reſts in the Law, and makes thy boaſt of
God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And art confident that thou thy ſelf art a Guide of the
Blind, a Light to them that ſit in Darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Thus theſe
Perſons proudly, with great Self-confidence, arrogate all Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Knowledg to themſelves; and are like the Sluggard
<hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">Prov. 26. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>i.e. wiſer in their own conceit than ſeven Men that
can render a Reaſon.</hi> Tremble ye who fear nothing, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all Wiſdom and Knowledg is with you, and that you need
not be taught more than you already know. Some Men, tho
openly prophane, glory and boaſt of their Church and Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and doubt not but in that Faith to be ſaved: But if thoſe
who are of a good moral Life, and zealous for the external
Parts of true Religion, for want of a ſaving Work of Grace
on their Hearts, are in ſuch a deplorable State, what vain pride
and folly poſſeſſeth that fooliſh and debauched Crew we have
amongſt us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly; Vain-Glory</hi> alſo certainly may be another Sin this
Perſon is become guilty of. The Deſign of God in the Goſpel,
is to diſcover how vile, helpleſs, and wretched all Men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
are in themſelves, and ſo to ſhew us that we have nothing
to glory in,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>but that he that glorieth might glory in the Lord.</hi> But
theſe Perſons glory in their ſeeming Gifts, Parts, Learning,
Knowledg, and external Privileges: they are like thoſe of old
who cried out, <hi>the Temple of the Lord,</hi> or <hi>the Church of God are
we.</hi> Poor Sinners have nothing to glory in unleſs it be their
Shame. The <hi>Publican</hi> cries out, <hi>Lord, be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi>
But the falſe and ſelf-righteous Profeſſor, like as a rich Man
glories in his Riches, and a ſtrong Man glories in his Strength,
ſo he glories in his own Righteouſneſs, in his ſpiritual Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and ſeeming Sanctity. And doubtleſs this is another
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59960:15"/>
ſtrong Chain with which the Devil binds theſe deluded Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Self-confidence, Pride, and Vain-glory, are all of near
Kin, and proceed from that horrid Ignorance I firſt mentioned;
they are all the ſpurious Off-spring of that curſed Parent.
But why ſhould we glory in the Lord, or rejoice only in Chriſt?
Why 'tis,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> becauſe <hi>ye are in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto
us Wiſdom, and Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption:</hi> Ye
are in him by Faith, by Regeneration, and his Spirit dwells in
you. Our Righteouſneſs is ſo imperfect, and ſo filthy, that it
is compared to a menſtruous Cloth; inſtead of glorying in it, we
have cauſe to be aſhamed of it, and to loath our ſelves, and
with <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8, 9.</note> to <hi>account it but Dung;</hi> our beſt Actions, Works and
Duties we perform, cannot commend us to God, nor in any
reſpect procure the leaſt Good from his Hands, foraſmuch as
Sin cleaveth to them, and nothing but a perfect and compleat
Righteouſneſs can render the Soul juſtified and accepted in his
ſight.</p>
               <p>This vain-glorious Perſon little conſidereth what horrid Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
abides ſtill in his Heart, for which he is accurſed by the
Law of God, and ſo remains till he hath real Union with Chriſt,
and is brought under a Divine Change. What though he has
eſcaped ſome abominable Evils and Corruptions of his Life,
ſince his vicious Habits, and filthy Nature is not changed, nor
he ſees not the Purity of the Law of God? Alas, he beholds it,
as only forbidding all outward Acts of Sin, but the Spirituality
of it was never opened to him, for if it had, he would ſee no
cauſe of glorying in himſelf, but contrariwiſe would ſoon be
convinced of his Error and ſad Miſtake, and behold himſelf
an undone Man, and cry out of the deceitful Nature, turnings
and windings of his own baſe Heart, Thoughts and Affections,
and what a diſproportion or diſagreement to the perfect Rule;
or how far he is from that Holineſſ, and Purity, and Rectitude
deſcribed in the Book of God. It amazed <hi>Paul,</hi> when he once
came fully to underſtand the Law, when he looked on all the
parts of it, not only on the groſſer Sins forbidden by it, but
on the Rectitude, the Holineſs which is required therein: When
he ſaw the Law diſcover'd Luſt to be Sin, and that the leaſt Luſt
of the Heart is as palpable a breach of it, as Murder, Theft,
or the outward Act of Adultery, and expoſed equally to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59960:16"/>
Curſe of it, and ſo to the Wrath of God: Then (saith he)
<hi>Sin revived,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>and I died;</hi> that is, as to any hopes of Life and
Salvation by that Righteouſneſs which before he gloried in, and
made his boaſt of. The ſame Apoſtle afterwards came to ſee
that in him,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> that is to ſay, <hi>in his Fleſh dwelt no good thing;</hi> nay,
and the Holy Ghoſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>All are gone out of the way, all are
become filthy, and there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> What
cauſe is there then for this Man to glory in his Parts, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
and ſeeming Righteouſneſs, ſince theſe things for which
Men value and eſteem themſelves above others, God ſaith there
is no good in, nothing excellent, but 'tis contrariwiſe abhorred
and hateful to him? But O how hard a thing is it to bring this
and that ſelf-righteous Perſon to believe this, or receive it as a
Truth? What, ſays he, can ye make me think I am ſtill a vile
Sinner, and God doth not accept me, who do ſo much good,
that pray as I do, and hear Sermons, and am thus much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed?
O this is a worſe Devil than the former, and he
hereby is in a worſe ſtate than at firſt. Before he was eaſily
brought to confeſs his State bad: when openly prophane, his
groſs and ſcandalous Sins appeared odious to him, being ſo
indeed in the Eyes of all ſober and civilized People; groſs
Wickedneſs ſeemed to him as filthy Rags, or as a menſtruous
Cloth: But to tell him his Righteouſneſs is alike abominable,
filthy, and hateful to God; this he cannot believe, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
'tis a glorious Cover, a rich Garment, a precious Ornament,
and ſo prides himſelf in it, and makes his boaſt of it, pretending
now to ſo much Sanctity, that like thoſe of old he is ready in
his Heart to ſay to others,<note place="margin">Isa. 65. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Stand by your ſelves, come not near
me, for I am holier than you.</hi> Thus the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
themſelves from all ſorts of Men, muſt not be ſo much as
touched by any; for ſo it ſeems by that paſſage, when the poor
Woman came to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>and touched the Hem of his Garment,</hi>
they wondered that our Saviour would ſuffer himſelf to be
touched by her, ſhe being a Sinner; they could not endure to
have any legal pollution upon them, would not eat a bit of
Meat until they had waſhed their Hands, and oft waſhed their
whole Bodies, eſpecially after they had been at a Feaſt, for fear
any pollution had fallen upon them: and ſo alſo when they
came from the Market, leſt peradventure they ſhould have
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59960:16"/>
touched ſome Heathen, or ſome Perſon who was legally unclean.
And now in this Righteouſneſs they gloried, truſted to it, and
ſought hereby for Juſtification and Acceptance in the Sight of
God, which rendered their State worſe than before. And
that which ſeems to feed and heighten this Pride, Self-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and Vain-glory, in ſome of theſe blind and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
People, is that ſtrange Conceit and Apprehenſion they
have of their own Power and Abilities to do and perform
thoſe things God requireth, in order to their Acceptance with
him, together with their falſe Notions of God's Mercy in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
them wherein they come ſhort. In this very reſpect the
Jews erred to their eternal Overthrow; they thought they had
Power, and were able to keep the Law to ſuch a Degree, that
they were accepted as righteous Perſons in God's Sight by it;
and though they might not be puffed up with Pride (as ſome of
late amongſt us are and have been) as to think they were without
Sin, yet did not doubt but wherein they came ſhort or were
guilty, God, as a pure Act of his Mercy, would forgive them,
not ſeeing a Neceſſity of Chriſt and of his Righteouſneſſ.
Which Notion tends at once utterly to make void the Doctrine
of Faith, and Covenant of Grace, and ſo conſequently the
whole Deſign of God in ſending Jeſus Chriſt into the World:
for if Salvation may be obtained this way, <hi>Chriſt is dead in
vain.</hi> And whilſt I am hinting theſe things to you, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but bewail another ſort of Men, who though not ſo
groſsly blind and miſtaken as ſome others are, yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
greatly miſs it, and run upon almoſt as bad a Rock,
whilſt they apprehend and think all Men are put into ſuch a
Capacity that they may be ſaved if they will, <hi>i. e.</hi> by improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the means of Light and Knowledg, they have by their own
inherent Power and Abilities, without the ſpecial Operation of
the ſpirit, not conſidering the woful pravity of Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by original and actual Tranſgreſſion, they being dead in
Sin, and ſtand in as much need to be quickned by Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 1, 2.</note>
or to have a Principle of Divine Life infuſed into them, if ever
they ſpiritually live, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> had to be quickned and raiſed
again, after he had lain four days in the Grave. Nay and 'tis
evident, God doth work in us, who are ſpiritually quickned
and brought to believe, after the ſame manner which he wrought
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59960:17"/>
in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead.<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 18, 19, 20.</note> One ground or
cauſe of theſe Mens Miſtake may ariſe from the Conſideration
of that Power Men in general have by the help of natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and the external means of Grace, to leave the groſs
Acts of Sin, and ſo reform their Lives, and cleave to God in all
Acts of Obedience, in the external Ordinances of the Goſpel,
which is I fear all the Converſion ſome Profeſſors ever attained
unto, and is alſo indeed the Subſtance of that which Man by
the Power of his own Will, is able to arrive unto, to affirm that
Man by his own natural and internal Abilities (as influenced by
common Grace) hath Power to renew himſelf, change his own
Heart, or form Jeſus Chriſt in his Soul, is in effect to attribute
to him Omnipotency, and make a God of him, even no leſs
than a creating Power: For the Image of God, which is wrought
in all true regenerated Perſons,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> is called <hi>the new Creature;</hi> and
a glorious Creature it is as ever the Almighty formed, being the
top-Glory of all his creating Power. And beſides, this neceſſarily
makes way for Men to boaſt and glory in themſelves, for it
makes Man a Competitor, a Co-partner, and a Co-worker
with God in Redemption; for the Work of Redemption doth
not only conſist in a price paid, or an Atonement made by Jeſus
Chriſt, (whereby he appeaſed Divine Wrath, and ſatiſfied God's
offended Juſtice) but alſo by Power and bleſſed Conqueſt the
one was done without us in the Perſon of Chriſt, the other is
done in us by the Spirit of Chriſt, whereby thoſe evil and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Habits that are in us, naturally are removed, and the Power
of Satan broke into Pieces, or that ſtrong Man armed over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,<note place="margin">1 John 3. 8.</note>
and the Soul ſet at Liberty. <hi>To this purpoſe was the Son of
God manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the Works of the Devil.</hi> No
Man can be ſaid to be redeemed by Chriſt, until he is redeemed
from his Sins, or delivered from that Enmity that naturally is
in his Heart againſt God, or that ſacred Image of God be again
reſtored in him,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> not until he is quickned or raiſed from the
dead.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 17, 18.</note> Hence St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking of Redemption, ſaith, <hi>We were not redeemed with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, from a vain
Converſation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but with the precious Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, as
of a Lamb without Blemiſh and without Spot.</hi> The Redemption is
from a vain Converſation, 'tis not from Wrath only, but from
Sin the cauſe of that Wrath alſo. And all Men know this is not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59960:17"/>
univerſal, ſeeing but a very few are indeed thus redeemed; and
they may as well perceive that this is as abſolutely the Work of
Chriſt, as he is our Redeemer, <hi>viz.</hi> thus to work in us, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
us as it was his Work to die for us. How good is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for us to conſider the Danger that ariſes from miſtaken and
unſound Principles, if we would not be found guilty of this
Sin of Vain-Glory? The truth is, ſome good Men are ſo miſled,
that they make the new Covenant a mere conditional Covenant,
and if after all Chriſt hath done, their Intereſt in it and eternal
Life wholly depends upon the weak and wavering Principles of
the depraved Creature, and his ſtubborn and rebellious Will
has its negative Voice: and if the Creature works not, complies
not to thoſe Conditions required, the whole of Redemption-Work
may be loſt, and not one Soul redeemed. And were it
thus, there is more reaſon to believe Chriſt would have loſt all
his Labour and infinite Kindneſſ, than otherwiſe. Since Man
is naturally ſo depraved and averſe to that which is truly good,
having ſuch Enmity in his Heart againſt God, and is wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Power and Government of the Devil, and this alſo
would render the new Covenant not better, nay, not ſo good
as the firſt; for then Man was a perfect Creature, having not
then ſuch a captivating Power of Sin nor Satan in him, but had
a Power of Will to ſtand, if he had exerciſed it, and reſisted the
Tempter from without. There is one thing more I ſhall note,
before I leave this Point: 'Tis eaſy to perceive from hence,
what Grace it is that Man may fall from, I mean finally and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
fall, <hi>i. e.</hi> whatſoever Men may act or do from thoſe common
Operations of the Spirit, or by the Power of natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
under the external Preaching of the Word, or means of
the Rod or Afflictions, by the Aſſiſtance or Help of which I doubt
not he may become another Man, a great Profeſſor, pray,
hear the Word, have a ſort of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Credence,
be baptized, and ſo become a Church-Member, yea, a Preacher,
and may be in the Sight of Men of a blameleſs Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
and yet never changed in Heart, or regenerated by
the effectual and ſpecial Operations of Chriſt's Spirit, nor have
Union with Chriſt: From this Grace, or ſuch a reformed Life
and Profeſſion of Religion, a Perſon may fall away, and indeed
riſe no more. And ſuch I conclude the ſtony and thorny-ground-Profeſſors
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59960:18"/>
were.<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> Moreover, 'tis as evident that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground,
<hi>viz.</hi> the honeſt-hearted Perſon, brought forth Fruit to
Life eternal, and fell not finally and totally away from the
Grace of God.</p>
               <p>If any aſk,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> how it came to paſs any of the ground is ſaid to be
good?</p>
               <p>I anſwer.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Naturally all the Hearts of Men and Women are
evil, the Defection was univerſal. But theſe Hearts of Men
who are ſaid to be good ground, were prepared for the Word;
by which means, through the Spirit, they came to be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
their Hearts were plowed up or broken in pieces by the
Word and Spirit in effectual Convictions. <hi>Plow up the fallow
Ground,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 4. 3.</note> (saith the Lord by the Prophet) <hi>and ſow not amongſt

<hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 11. but the former is the Work of the Spirit by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions;
the latter the Work of the Spirit in Regeneration.
Till the Heart is pierced by the Holy Ghoſt, and broken to
pieces and made ſoft, which naturally is hard, the Word can

ſo ſtony or thorny, that no Fruit of the Word will abide to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

Worſhip be of Divine Inſtitution or not, nor whether they
perform their Devotion in the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, flowing
from a rectified Nature, and from ſacred Principles in the Life

Others of the ſame ſort may be right in the matter of Worſhip,

for the Traditions and Commandments of Men: as they
are formal in their Worſhip; ſo their Form is not that form of
Doctrine once delivered to the Saints; 'tis not the true form of

they deny not the Power of Godlineſs in Words, yet do deny
it in their Practice, making a Profeſſion, but Strangers to that
Life, Peace, Love, Faith, and Self-denial, which attends and
doth accompany all true Chriſtians. But the other ſort, though
they are formal, yet 'tis a better Form, hence may be called
Virgins, that is, ſuch who have not, will not, defile themſelves

New-Moons, Sabbaths, and calling of Aſſemblies, with
appointed Feaſts, which were Inſtitutions of God. But theſe
Men reſting on them, and having unſanctified Hearts and Lives,
God hated them, and loathed their Services, being not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in Faith, and hearty Love, and ſincere Reſolutions: that
which they did, was but as if they had offered up a dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe

               <p>Such who ſhew never ſo much Zeal for the viſible Worſhip

many Profeſſors deceive themſelves? Sirs, all is and will be in

have ſuch unclean Spirits in them, that their State is worſe
than before they made no profeſſion at all; theſe Devils are
ſtronger than the firſt, have more cunning, craft, and ſubtilty

prevail and predominate in them, by which means they bring
great reproach upon Religion, and all thoſe who do profeſs
it: hence the Apoſtle calls this ſort, <hi>the Enemies of the Croſs

ſo much Church-work, which makes the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Saints the more uncomfortable to them: for though
it cannot be denied but ſincere Perſons may fall under Sin and
Temptation, and ſo all the trouble of Churches, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

counterfeit Chriſtians, or formal Profeſſors; yet doubtleſs the

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly; The wicked Spirit, or abominable Sin that ſome of theſe
Mens Souls are alſo poſſeſſed with, is Legality.</hi> And though this
clearly appears by what I have already ſaid, yet I ſhall ſpeak a
little more fully and diſtinctly unto it. All that theſe Perſons
do and perform, is in a legal Spirit; and that I may ſhew you
what I mean by Legality, in ſhort it is this, <hi>i. e. They act and
do for Life,</hi> look upon themſelves to be under a conditional Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
and whilſt they live up to that Law or Rule which
they judg they are bound to obſerve and keep, in order to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
they have Peace, rendring the Goſpel and Covenant
of Grace (by their falſe Apprehenſions of it) no better than
a legal Miniſtration or conditional Covenant, as was hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in reſpect of another ſort of Men: For like as the <hi>Jews</hi> of
old acted in a legal Spirit, and ſought to be juſtified by the
Works of the Law, ſo theſe perform all their Services and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the ſame Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> not from Life, or a Divine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Saving-Faith, but for Life. To keep the Commandments
of God, and live religiouſly, is abſolutely neceſſary. But then
this muſt be done from a renewed Nature, and flows from
Faith, it being the proper Effect or Fruit thereof; but to ſtrive
to live a ſober and holy Life, and obey God's Precepts, and reſt
upon their ſo doing, and look to be accepted with God, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
thereby, is that which too many of this ſort of People
do, and this is to act in a legal Spirit. Poſſibly a Man may ſay,
I know I cannot perfectly keep the Law, but I will do (by the
help of God) what I can; and wherein I through weakneſs do
tranſgreſs, the Lord is merciful, and I truſt will forgive me.
But let me remember what God ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>he will in no
wiſe clear the Guilty.</hi> Moreover, <hi>what the Law ſaith, it ſaith
to them that are under the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 19</note> 
                  <hi>that all Mouths may be ſtopped, and
the whole World become guilty before God.</hi> 'Tis evident, as God
will not forgive an impenitent Perſon, ſo he will not forgive the
Penitent, except they believe in Jeſus Chriſt. 'Tis not for the
ſake or worth of Repentance that God forgives any Man, the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59960:20"/>
Penitent as well as the Impenitent are guilty, all have broke the
Law, all are under Sin and Wrath, Repentance will not do, a
holy Life will not do, Prayer and hearing Sermons will not do;
<hi>By the Deeds of the Law</hi> (and by any thing we can do) <hi>no Fleſh
ſhall be juſtified.</hi> If Men believe not on Chriſt, let them be what
they will, Profeſſors or Prophane, they ſhall die in their Sins:
God pardons no Sinner as a ſimple Act of his Mercy,<note place="margin">Joh. 8. 24.</note> without
a reſpect had to the Satiſfaction Chriſt hath made to his offended
Juſtice by his Death: And hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>All have ſinned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 24, 25.</note> 
                  <hi>and come ſhort of the Glory of God, being juſtified
freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt;
whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation, through Faith in his
Blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of Sins that are
paſt, through the forbearance of God.</hi> Therefore God doth not
accept of our Obedience in keeping the Precepts, either of the
Old or New Teſtament, and forgive all our Deviations as a
meer Act of his Mercy; for if this way Righteouſneſs and
Juſtification were attainable, 'tis evident Chriſt died in vain, as
I ſaid before; for could not God have done this, if Chriſt had
never come to ſhed his precious Blood?</p>
               <p>I remember ſome Years ago, I heard of a Man who lying on
his Death-bed, when a Godly Perſon deſired him to look out
for a Chriſt; anſwered, He had lived a godly Life all along,
and why (said he) do you tell me of a Chriſt? or to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
He thought, ('tis evident,) none needed a Chriſt but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Perſons; and I fear many are of his Mind, tho they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
it not as he did, with their Tongues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But poſſibly ſome may ſay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note> We do not think that our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
juſtifies us any otherwiſe than through Chriſt'<hi>s</hi> Merits.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 'Tis not throug our perſonal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
though joined or coupled with Chriſt's Merits, that we
are juſtified, but through the perſonal Righteouſneſs of Chriſt
alone, and the Merits of his Blood received by Faith; 'tis in
this way, and only by this way we muſt be ſaved if ever we
come to Heaven,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Another Foundation can no Man lay. He that

                  <hi>ſhall be damned.</hi> Let him be what he will, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or Wicked, 'tis a great Error to think that Chriſt's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
make our Services or Performances meritorious: though
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> are accepted thereby when they flow from Faith, yet not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59960:21"/>
as the Spring, or procuring Cauſe of our Juſtification.</p>
               <p>To cloſe with this, let me add one thing further, which
ſhews the Danger theſe Perſons are in. This Errour is a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
One, 'tis to err in a main Fundamental of Religion, and
therefore Hereſy, a damnable Principle. And hence the Apoſtle
calls it,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 24</note> 
                  <hi>a ſubverting the Souls of ſuch who receive it.</hi> And it
was alſo from hence God gave the <hi>Jews</hi> up to Judicial Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>i. e.</hi> becauſe they went about to eſtablish their own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and <hi>did not ſubmit to the Righteouſneſs of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as it is written,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>God hath given them the Spirit of Slumber,
Eyes that they ſhould not ſee, and Ears that they ſhould not hear.</hi>
That muſt needs be a dangerous Evil, that provokes the Holy
God thus to leave and give up a Perſon to blindneſs of Mind,
and final Impenitency; for ſuch muſt needs periſh of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the laſt place it follows, that the ſtate of
theſe People is worſe than it was when they were no Profeſſors
of Religion at all, but were openly wicked and prophane Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
theſe unclean Spirits are worſe than the firſt. And from
hence let all take heed how they mix Law and Goſpel together
in the caſe of Juſtification.<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>If by Grace, then is it no more of
Works, otherwiſe Grace is no Grace. But if it be of Works, then it
is no more Grace, otherwiſe Work is no more Work.</hi> There is no
mixing of the Merits of good Works and the free Grace of
God together, but one of theſe doth exclude and deſtroy the
Nature of the other: for if Election and Juſtification were part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Grace, and partly of (or from foreſeen) Works, then
Grace is no Grace, and Works no Works. For whatſoever
proceedeth of Grace,<note place="margin">Annotat.</note> (as one obſerves) that cometh freely, and
not of Debt; but whatſoever cometh by Merits or Works,
that cometh by Debt. But now Debt, and free Grace, or that
which is free and abſolutely by Grace, and that by deſert, are
quite contrary things: therefore to ſay Men are Called and
Juſtified, partly by Grace, and partly by Works, (or by
whatſoever is done by the Creature) this were to put ſuch
things together that cannot agree, for 'tis to make Merit no
Merit, Debt no Debt, Works no Works, Grace no Grace,
and ſo affirm and deny one and the ſame thing. Therefore
how abſurd a thing is it for Men to mix the Law and Goſpel
together in this ſenſe, or make that which is the Creature's
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59960:21"/>
Act or Work, a procuring Cauſe of acceptance and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in God's ſight? ſeeing it utterly deſtroys the nature of
Grace, and ſo conſequently the glorious Deſign, of God's eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Purpoſe in Jeſus Chriſt, and that bleſſed Covenant of his
confirmed by the Mediator thereof. Where the Creature is
wholly abaſed, and the free Grace of God alone exalted, Man
is not a co-worker or co-partner with God: therefore thoſe
Principles that have a natural tendency ſo to do, ought to
be abominated by all good Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it is objected,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note> That we are ſaid to be juſtified by Faith, and
alſo that Repentance is required as a Condition of Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. I anſwer;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Some put Faith in the room and place of perfect
Obedience to the Law; and that Faith which they ſpeak of
they affirm is the ſole Act of the Creature: But this certainly
is a grand Errour, for it would make our Juſtification to be
ſtill by Works, and ſo deſtroy the Nature of God's free Grace:
for that which is the Creature's Act, is all one with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's
Work; 'tis but to change one Work of the Creature to
another; from an external Work of the Life, to an internal
Work of the Heart. For, as Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> well obſerves, <q>'Tis
Chriſt's perfect Righteouſneſs and Obedience only which is
put into the room and place of ours, to juſtify and ſave us,
and his Sufferings take away the Curſe which our Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
brought upon us.</q> Faith therefore is only the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Cauſe of our Juſtification, 'tis only as an Inſtrument
or Way of our receiving and applying the Righteouſneſs of
Chriſt, if it juſtifies, as a Condition of the New Covenant, (as
Works were required under the Old); and as that act or work
injoined on our part to be done by us as Antecedent to the
benefit of the Promiſe, that would make our Act or Work
the formal Cauſe of our Juſtification, and ſo render the Terms
of the New-Covenant much of the ſame Nature with the Old.
Faith is not our Righteouſneſs in it ſelf, as a Work, but in
relation to Chriſt the Object of it, or as an Act of receiving
and applying his Righteouſneſs and Merits; as Eating nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
though it be the Meat that doth it in this ſenſe.<note place="margin">Annotat. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Him that

is counted for Righteouſneſs.</hi> And now whereas the Apoſtle
<hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Works juſtifying, and not Faith only,</hi> Jam. 2. 24.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59960:22"/>
it is eaſy to be comprehended, and the great Apoſtle of the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> and he reconciled. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the Cauſe of our
Juſtification before God, and <hi>James</hi> of the Signs of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
before Men; or ſhews how our good Works juſtify
our Faith:<note place="margin">Annotators.</note> 
                  <q>The one ſpeaks of the Imputation of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the other of the Declaration of our Righteouſneſs;
or one ſpeaks of the Office of Faith, the other of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Faith; the one ſpeaks of the Juſtification of the
Perſon, the other of the Faith of that Perſon; the one
ſpeaks of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be juſtified, the other of <hi>Abraham</hi>
already juſtified.</q> Moreover,</p>
               <p>2. That Faith by which we are ſaid to be juſtified, is as much
the Free-Gift of God's Grace to us, as Chriſt is the Free-Gift
of his Grace for us: and hence Faith is called the <hi>Gift of God</hi>
Eph. 2. 8, 9. and alſo <hi>a Fruit of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 22. And as it
is a Grace wrought in us, ſo alſo ſuch a Grace that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to us as part of Chriſt's Purchaſe; <hi>To you it is given</hi>
(saith the Apoſtle) <hi>in the behalf of Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>not only to believe, but

That by the drawing here, is not meant of any coaction or force

uſed in the Miniſtry of the Word, we do deny; though in this
ſenſe ſome do take it, and conclude, it is of the ſame import
with that compelling mentioned, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 23. for the Miniſters
of the Goſpel (as one obſerves) have no other Power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
But the Act of drawing here is not aſcribed to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
but to the Maſter, not the Preacher, but the Father;
therefore doubtleſs it ſignifies a Divine Power put forth upon
the Soul of Man, by which the Lord opens the Heart, as he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59960:22"/>
did the Heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> ſo that he is made obedient to the call
of God, and willing to cloſe with the Offer of Chriſt. And
that this muſt be the meaning of the Text, it is rational to
conclude, conſidering the nature of the motion in coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt, which is the motion of the Soul to a ſublime ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Object to do; which as no Soul hath any power of it ſelf,
ſuch is the darkneſs of the Mind, the obſtinacy of the Will,
and pravity of the Affections, unleſs influenced and wrought
upon by the Spirit. So in like manner nothing is proud Man
naturally more averſe to, cannot indure to think he is ſuch a
poor Miſcreant, a mere beggarly Wretch, that he has not ſo
much as a bit of Bread to eat, nor a Garment, in a ſpiritual ſenſe,
to cover him, but muſt be beholden to his Neighbour for all:
For as no Soul is able, without ſupernatural Grace, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
ſpiritual Things [<hi>cannot</hi>] <hi>diſcern them;</hi> ſo there is in
his mind enmity againſt God,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> for it is not ſubject to the Law
of God, neither indeed [<hi>can</hi>] be.</p>
               <p>From all which I have ſaid, it appears Faith (as before hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
is not the Condition of Juſtification, tho the Way or
Means appointed to receive that Righteouſneſs that doth juſtify
the Sinner; ſo likewiſe Faith is God's Gift. Yet 'tis fooliſh to
ſay, Man doth not believe, but rather the Spirit for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he cannot believe by any natural Power inherent in him,
till he is divinely influenced by the Holy Ghoſt: For ſuch may as
well ſay, <hi>Lazarus</hi> did not live, or it was not his Life which he
had after quickned, becauſe it was infuſed into him by the
Power and Spirit of Chriſt. Therefore this and the former Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
are both gone, and the ſuppoſed Condition of the New
Covenant vanquiſhed, ſince Faith it ſelf being the Fruit of it,
cannot be the Condition thereof.</p>
               <p>

               <p>To which we anſwer;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> That Faith and Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
Promiſes of the New Covenant, as well as Juſtification and
Eternal Life; and he that hath ordained the End, hath alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
the Means:<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>I will put my Law into their inward Parts, and
write it in their Hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my
People. And I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, that I
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59960:23"/>
will not turn away from doing them good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 32. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>but I will put my Fear into

hath promiſed to make us Happy, hath alſo promiſed to make
us Holy; he hath promiſed Grace to us here, and to change our
Hearts of Stone, and to give us Hearts of Fleſh, as well as he
hath promiſed to give us Glory hereafter.</p>
               <p>Our being called in Time, is but the effect of God's eternal
Love before Time,<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 3.</note> becauſe <hi>he hath loved us with an everlaſting

by the free Grace of God according to his purpoſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note> as well as juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and eternally ſaved. We are predeſtinated that we may be
conformable to the Image of his Son in Holineſs here on Earth, as
well as in Heaven hereafter. If Men are left under the power
of their Sins, or only to the bare improvements of their own
natural Abilities in a meer reformed Life, and never brought by
the free Grace of God to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo to have
real Union with him,<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 37.</note> 'tis an evident ſign they ſhall never be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
they being none of them that the Father hath given to
Chriſt;<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> for, ſaith he, all that the Father giveth to me, ſhall
come unto me; and in theſe only are infuſed the Divine Habits
of Saving-Grace. The Apoſtle poſitively affirms, that God
<hi>hath choſen us in Chriſt before the Foundation of the World, that we
ſhould be Holy, and without blame before him in love;</hi> not only cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
to Salvation which is the End, but to Holineſs as the Means:
Not becauſe we are Holy are we choſen, but that we may be
Holy; but this ought not to take any Soul from the uſe of the
Means. And as a clear demonſtration and illuſtration of this,
I might mention that paſſage concerning <hi>Paul</hi>'s Voyage to
<hi>Rome,</hi> in reſpect of that aſſurance God gave him of the Lives
of all that were with him in the Ship; the Angel of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to him,<note place="margin">Act. 27. 24, 25, 31.</note> and ſaid, <hi>And lo, God hath given thee all them
that ſail with thee. Wherefore, Sirs, be of good chear, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
God, that it ſhall be as it was told me.</hi> This Promiſe was
abſolute, yet ſee what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to them, <hi>Except ye abide in the
Ship, ye cannot be ſaved.</hi> That God that hath promiſed us Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
doth not ſave us without the uſe of Means, although
the efficaciouſneſs and truth of the Promiſe, does no ways de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the virtue of the Means, but the Means are made
effectual by virtue of the Promiſe, yet whoever neglects the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59960:23"/>
Means, under any pretence of a free Promiſe, he does but
tempt God,<note place="margin">Annotators on the place.</note> but doth not (as ſome obſerve) rightly believe in
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly;</hi> Amongſt the wicked Spirits that are entred into
this Man, namely, into this <hi>Counterfeit Chriſtian,</hi> that horrid
and wicked Spirit of Unbelief muſt not be left out, for tho
this Sin of Sins is in all unconverted Perſons, yet it reigns and
triumphs more in this ſort of People than in others. Prophane
Perſons are kept up by a falſe Faith, depending, as they will tell
you, on the Death and Merits of Chriſt, tho 'tis only curſed
preſumption in them; for that cannot be a true Faith, which
changes not the Heart and Life of the Creature. But they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not, by reaſon of love to their Sins, which they are not as
yet willing to forgo. But theſe believe not on Chriſt, becauſe of
that love which they have to their own ſeeming Righteouſneſs,
which in point of Truſt, Hope, and Dependance, they alſo are
not willing to forgo. Theſe Men place that Hope on their own
Works and Righteouſneſs, which true Chriſtians place on Chriſt,
and ſo unbelief in them throws Chriſt quite away, they having
no need of him.</p>
               <p>1. What is Unbelief, but an actual or vertual denial of the
Truth of the Goſpel, when Men do not aſſent to the Doctrine
of it, by an act of the Underſtanding?</p>
               <p>2. 'Tis a refuſal to accept heartily of Chriſt upon the Terms
of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Charnock.</note> which is oppoſite to Juſtifying-Faith, when
there is not a fiducial Motion to Chriſt as the Center. When
Chriſt, the only Foundation and chief Corner-Stone, is laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
and the Need and Worth of him not believed. This Sin
binds all the Guilt of all their old and new Sins upon their Souls,
'tis a Sin againſt the higheſt Goodneſs of God, and caſts Contempt
upon it; for never did God manifeſt ſuch ſovereign Goodneſſ
unto his Creatures as in Jeſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Acts 4. 12.</note> God hath ſaid, there
is no Life, no Salvation any other way, but by the Lord Jeſus.
But theſe Men do not aſſent to this Truth, do not believe the
Report God hath given concerning the want of perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
and Regeneration, and Self-debaſement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay,
they ſeem to contradict the Will of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note> by their going about
to eſtablish their own Righteouſneſs, and ſo not ſubmitting to
the Righteouſneſs of God. In a word, 'tis a denying of Chriſt,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59960:24"/>
and a diſesteeming the Price of his Blood, as it alſo reflects on
the Wiſdom of God, in fixing on this way to ſave Sinners:
'Tis an invaluating the Excellency of Chriſt's Perſon, Blood
and Merits. As Faith counts all things Dung in Compariſon of
Chriſt; ſo Unbelief accounts the Perſon, Offices, and Doctrine
of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8, 9, 10.</note> but as Dung in Compariſon of the Excellency of
Self-Righteouſneſs, Self-Wiſdom, Self-Sufficiency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe
Men are the worſt Neglecters of the great Salvation, they do
not only neglect it, but ſlight and contemn it, there being in their
Thoughts not any need to look for Salvation this way: They
that ſin againſt the Law, fly to the Goſpel; but theſe ſin againſt
the Cure held forth and extended in the Goſpel. Whither muſt
theſe fly? ſince there remains no more Sacrifice for Sin: if this
be ſlighted, no other way or means is ordained for Salvation.
Such who refuſe the Covenant of Grace, and depend on the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Works, how woful is their Condition? And what
hope a Law often tranſgreſſ'd can give a Malefactor, is (saith
a worthy Perſon) eaſy to imagine: Millions have periſhed by it,
none can be ſecured by it, as none ever by it were or could be
ſaved. At firſt theſe Perſons tranſgreſſed againſt the Rule, but
now they tranſgreſs againſt the Rule and Remedy too. None
but Unbelievers are deſpised by God, none but theſe ſhall taſte
of his Wrath and Divine Vengeance; this is the condemning Sin,
this is Satan's ſtrongeſt hold, hither he retreats after all, and
here he keeps as in chains his miſerable Captive.<note place="margin">Mark 16. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
not, ſhall be damned.</hi> And what is Faith but a going out of
a Mans ſelf to Chriſt for Life and Righteouſneſs, as a poor
wretched and miſerable Sinner? But theſe Men now ſee not
themſelves to be in ſuch a State.</p>
               <p>Earthly Hypocriſy, it appears from the whole which hath been ſaid,
is another of thoſe evil Spirits that is entered into this Man.</p>
               <p>Hypocriſy is oppoſed to that inward Simplicity of the Heart,
and all counterfeit Profeſſors are guilty of it, though all do not
act the part of an Hypocrite with an Intention, <hi>i. e.</hi> are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
they are Hypocrites: ſome deceive their own Hearts,
they are the groſſer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſort; others their Hearts deceive them,
theſe are moſt to be pitied; a Man may doubtleſs be an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
and he may not know it, he may go on in a way of Duty,
and do all things, as he thinks, exactly according to the Letter of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59960:24"/>
the Word, and in Uprightneſs as he may judg, and yet be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound;
certainly thus it was with the fooliſh Virgins.<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Hypocrites may be nevertheleſs diſcerned; our Saviour
hath given the Character of them.</p>
               <p>1. They are commonly moſt zealous from the leſſer things of
Religion,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> for <hi>paying Tithes of Mint, Aniſe, and Cummin, but
neglect the weightier things of the Law, Judgment, Mercy, Faith,
and the Love of God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 11. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſtrain at a Knat, and ſwallow a Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel.</hi>
They make a ſtir about external Rights, Obſervation of
Days and Meats, but to the Power of Religion and Godlineſs
are Strangers, and experience nothing of a Divine change on
their Souls.</p>
               <p>2. As they lay the greateſt ſtreſs upon the leaſt things, ſo they
are commonly partial in their pretended Obedience; they lay
hard things,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 4.</note> or <hi>heavy Burdens upon others, but they themſelves will
not touch them with one of their Fingers:</hi> What they preach and
preſs on others, they do not themſelves, they will not obey
Chriſt, nor follow him in the hardeſt things, nor do they obey
in Love, or always.</p>
               <p>3. They are commonly finding Faults in other Men,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>can
ſpy the Mote in their Brother's Eye, but cannot ſee the Beam that
is in their own.</hi> As it is a Sign of notorious Hypocriſy and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,
to cenſure and judg others for thoſe Sins which Men
live in themſelves; ſo it is a Sign of like Hypocriſy, to ſpy
Faults in others, and reproach them for thoſe Faults, and yet
the Perſon is guilty of worſe himſelf. What they preach and
preſs on others, they do not themſelves; they will not follow
Chriſt in the moſt hard and difficult things of Religion, but pick
and chuſe; will do ſome things that they like of, and not only
neglect others, but quarrel with them who contend for it, and
faithfully ſubject to Chriſt in it. And as they are not univerſal in
their Obedience, ſo they do not obey in Love, nor do they obey
always as ſincere Chriſtians do, as <hi>David</hi> intimateth.</p>
               <p>4. They are generally very confident touching the Goodneſs
of their own Condition, not queſtioning their Salvation; thus
were the Phariſees, they judged others were in a damnable
State, but as touching themſelves, did not doubt but they were
the only People; and bleſſed God they were not as other Men:
whereas a true Chriſtian is full of Fear, and doubts about the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59960:25"/>
Truth of Grace received, and Goodneſs of his Condition.</p>
               <p>5. They are vain-glorious, do what they do to be ſeen of
Men;<note place="margin">John 12. 43.</note> like the Phariſees, <hi>They love the Praiſe of Men, more than
the Praiſe of God:</hi> their Hearts are kept up by the good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
others have of them; they, like their Predeceſſors, <hi>love
greetings in the Markets,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>and uppermoſt Rooms in Feaſts, and to be
called of Men Rabbi:</hi> they alſo are ſubject to Envy, or have
their Hearts riſe againſt ſuch who they hear out-do them; and
would be looked upon as the chiefeſt of Men, in Learning,
Parts and Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>6. They are commonly very zealous to make Men Proſelytes
to their own Notions of Religion, though may be falſe and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Notions: but if they can but bring a Perſon to receive
their Principles and external Ordinances, then they glory, tho
hereby he is made twofold (perhaps ſevenfold) more the Child
of Hell than before;<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 15.</note> the poor deceived Wretch thinking this
change of Religion is a true Converſion, and ſo never looks out
for any other, but ſpeaking Peace to his own Soul, judging all is
well within. They doubt not but they have Religion enough
when it doth commend them to Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and are taken for Saints
by Saints; their greateſt Labor is to keep up their Name and
Credit in Religion; ſo that if they may paſs unſuſpected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
their Fellow-Creatures, or have the Approbation of
Men, and that if none can charge them juſtly with any immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Actions, they reſt ſatiſfied; whereas the greateſt Care of a
true Child of God is ſo to walk and labour, that he may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of God, and have his Approbation.</p>
               <p>7. Self is commonly in the bottom. In all they do, they aim
not at the Glory of God, but have a carnal Deſign, Self-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
or Self-Applauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This moves and quickens them,
and animates them in all they perform in religious Services;
and if they miſs of their end, be it what it will, they ſoon are
weary, and grow cold and flat in their Spirits, and become
quarrelſome, and ſeek Offences, and diſturb the Peace of the
Church to whom they belong.</p>
               <p>8. Moreover, they are not the ſame at Home, which they are
Abroad; not in Private, what they ſeem to be in Publick;
may be ſeldom pray, either in their Family, or Cloſet; or if
they do, 'tis with little Zeal, Enlargedneſs, or Affection to
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59960:25"/>
There are divers other Marks and Characters of Hypocrites,
and of theſe falſe Profeſſors, which I muſt paſs by, becauſe I
would ſpeak a word or two of Application.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place; The latter State of theſe Men is worſe
than the firſt. 1. Becauſe God oftentimes leaves them to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
Blindneſs, and to the hardneſs of their own Hearts:
<hi>According as it is written,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>God hath given them the Spirit of Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Eyes that they ſhould not ſee, and Ears that they ſhould not
hear, unto this day.</hi> Even thus, as God dealt with the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<hi>Jews,</hi> or the People of that Generation, ſo I ſay he often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
deals with other formal Hypocrites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſame Cauſe. Doubtleſs it was for thoſe Spiritual Sins, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
and Hypocriſy, the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and other People of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
were rejected and caſt off. And O what Wrath were they laid
under! the <hi>Wrath of God</hi> (is ſaid) <hi>to come upon them to the
uttermoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, ſome of theſe falſe and counterfeit Profeſſors,
alſo fall into the very ſame Sins and horrid Abominations they
were guilty of before they made any profeſſion of Religion;
nay, and they prove more vile and notorious in Wickedneſs
than ever: It hath often been ſeen, that this ſort of Men who
forſake the Ways of God, which they ſeemed to own and
profeſs, have at laſt appeared more impudent in Sin than the
vileſt Men, being ring-leaders to all lewd and curſed Practices
and Deeds of Darkneſs; ſo that the ſame unclean Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth
into ſome of them in the ſame ſhape alſo; though I
cannot ſee any ground to believe it happens ſo to them all; for
doubtleſs many of them retain their ſeeming Zeal, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Profeſſion of Religion and outward Holineſs, until they
die. Evident it is, our Saviour applies this direful Doom on
the People of that Generation, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> particularly to
the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> ſee the <hi>38th</hi> verſe. Yet certain it is,
many of them never turned to open Prophaneneſs, but died in
their Unbelief whilſt they abode proud and zealous <hi>Phariſees.</hi>
Yet I ſee no reaſon to queſtion but this returning Devil, and
thoſe ſeven other Spirits more wicked, is applied to them as well
as to others, who fell away from their ſeeming Piety and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
But of ſome of them eſpecially it hath happened ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>For if after they have eſcaped
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59960:26"/>
the Pollutions of the World through the Knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt,
and are again overcome, the latter end of that Man is worſe than
the firſt;</hi> that is, ſuch a knowledg of Chriſt as brings with it,
or doth produce, an outward reformation of Life. For as the
Elect cannot be deceived, ſo they cannot fall finally, having
the ſeed remaining in them, cannot ſin unto Death, they are ſaid
to have <hi>eternal Life abiding in them;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 15.</note> Becauſe (saith Chriſt) <hi>I live,

                  <hi>They are paſſed from Death unto
Life, and ſhall not come into condemnation.</hi> But as to theſe falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
or hypocritical Perſons, it happeneth to them (that is,
to ſome of them) according to the true Proverb, <hi>The Dog is
turned to his own Vomit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Sow that was waſhed to her wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Mire.</hi> The Apoſtle comparing them to Dogs and
Swine, ſhews what fort they were, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch who never paſſed
under an effectual change of Heart, but were, whilſt they
made a great or high profeſſion, like unclean Beaſts. A reſtraint
may be put on an evil Beaſt, or on a filthy and unclean
Nature; where there is not a change of nature, 'tis one thing
to have the Life waſhed or cleanſed, and another to have the
Heart cleanſed.</p>
               <p>Furthermore; Some of this ſort who have received thoſe
high, though common Illuminations of the Spirit, even to
ſuch a degree as they are ſaid to be <hi>inlightned, and to have taſted

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6.4.</note>

&amp;c.</hi> that is, in the common Gifts and Graces thereof; and yet
after all, they fall away, nay, and ſo fall, that they can <hi>never

are they who ſin the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, that
ſhall never be forgiven. Prophane Perſons doubtleſs do not ſin
this Sin, nor can true Chriſtians commit it; they cannot ſin
unto Death. No, no, theſe are thoſe miſerable Souls, thoſe
curſed Apoſtates, who are liable and in danger to ſin the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
Sin. Nay, and obſervable it is, that the Lord Jeſus
in the verſes before he ſpake this Parable, intimates, that
thoſe very <hi>Phariſees,</hi> &amp;c. were guilty of, or in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
charged with this Sin, ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. they ſhewed ſo much
Malice againſt our bleſſed Saviour, as to charge him with a
Devil,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 24, 28.</note> and that he caſt out Devils by <hi>Beelzebub. But when the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59960:26"/>
Phariſees heard it, they ſaid, This Fellow doth not caſt out Devils
but by</hi> Beelzebub <hi>the Prince of the Devils.</hi> And from hence he
ſaid, <hi>All manner of Sin and Blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven to Men,
but the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto Men.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 31.</note>
And therefore he bids them to make the Tree good, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
whilſt the Heart was evil, and under diabolical Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,

2. There is alſo it appears Malice againſt Chriſt and his Spirit

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 6.</note> becauſe God is
withdrawn from them, and hath left them for ever, ſo that
no Means uſed can do them any good. As God will not renew
them again, ſo none elſe can do it: they ſin therefore without

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59960:27"/>
yet if they never come to be ſavingly wrought upon, or to paſs

ſo that every way their State, and the State of all of
them, is and will be at the laſt miſerable.</p>
               <p>And from the whole we may note,</p>
               <p>That the State of the Self-righteous and Phariſaical Perſons,<note place="margin">Obs. 1.</note> is far
worſe than the State of groſs and prophane Sinners.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſick, and know it not; wounded, but ſee no need
of a Phyſician; Sinners, but ſee no want of a Chriſt: They
may conclude they are converted, and therefore ſeek not after
Converſion. We always think his State is ſad, who, though
mortally wounded, yet feels no pain. Some Sinners are ſaid to
be paſt feeling; their Enemy is hid in them, they think he is
gone, when 'tis no ſuch thing, for he another way has faſter

               <p>'Tis a hard and difficult thing to bring a Phariſaical Perſon,<note place="margin">Obs. 2.</note> one

               <p>This may inform us of the Cauſe and Reaſon there is ſo great<note place="margin">Informat. 1.</note>
Reproach brought upon Religion, and on the Ways of God,
and on the People of God, by ſome who profeſs the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
Alas, many of them who are called Saints, we may
juſtly fear are but counterfeit Chriſtians, ſuch who never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
a true Work of Grace; they may have knowing
Heads, but unſanctified Hearts. And from hence it is there are
ſo many proud Perſons in many Congregations, who with brazen
Foreheads will brave it out, with impudent Faces, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Chriſt's faithful Miniſters; and though reproved, and
told of their curſed Pride and abominable Dreſſes, high and
ſhameful Towers, hateful to God and good Men, yet reform not,
will not deny themſelves of their filthy Luſts, tho the Name of God
and Religion is expoſed to great Reproach and Contempt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and the Hearts of ſincere Chriſtians wounded, and mourn for it
bitterly before the Lord. If they had but a ſpark of true Grace,
could they ever ſtand it out thus againſt the Gun-shot of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
How fearleſs do they ſeem under the ratling Peals of the
Thunder of Heaven? They regard not the whetted Sword of the
Almighty, nor the bending of his dreadful Bow; nor mind the
Arrows that are juſt upon the String, who is ready to ſend forth
his Anger with Fury, and his Rebukes in Flames of Fire.</p>
               <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">Informat. 2.</note> from hence it is alſo there are ſo many covetous,
earthly, and hard-hearted Profeſſors and Members in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
Alas, you may tell them of this abominable Sin a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times over, and all to no purpoſe, their Hearts ('tis to
be feared) are ſet upon their Covetouſneſs, they love the
World more than the Word, nay, more than God or Jeſus
Chriſt; and yet, under a Cloak of Religion, ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as if all was well, and they good Chriſtians: And becauſe
they covet no Man's Goods but their own, and ſo are not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Theft, they conclude they are not chargeable with this
Sin of Covetouſneſs; though Chriſt's poor Members are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
the Naked are not clothed,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> nor the Hungry fed, nor
the Sick viſited. They will give ſomething 'tis true, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Need and Neceſſity of the Poor, nor according
to their Ability: nor is it out of Love to Chriſt, nor to his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59960:28"/>
poor Saints neither, they give what they do give, may be to
free themſelves from Reproach, or to quiet their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.
And hence it is likewiſe there are ſo many Whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
Tatlers and Backbiters in Congregations, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſo much trouble and diſorder in our Churches. Tho
Godly Chriſtians may be guilty of great Diſorders and many
Infirmities, yet I am perſwaded, were there not many falſe
and deceitful, carnal and hypocritical Profeſſors, it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be as it is. What makes the beſt Deſign that ever was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, for the promoting the Intereſt of Chriſt, and good
of the Churches, ſo neglected, and like to ſink in the Bud, but
the great diſcouragement theſe ſort of People lay it under?
They have no mind to ſuch a good and great Work, they are
for enriching themſelves, and to lay into their own Coffers and
Treaſuries, but not to caſt into Chriſt's Treaſury. And this
evil Example of theirs, lays a Temptation on ſincere and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Men and Women. What do ſuch and ſuch do? they are
far richer than I, and they will do nothing. To theſe let me
ſpeak one word: Why, will you do no more for God, becauſe
ſome who love him not will do nothing? Alas, you had need
do the more: I am perſwaded you would not willingly be found
fooliſh Virgins in the Day of Chriſt. How do you know but
theſe very Men ſhall be found to be ſuch who value the gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a baſe Luſt, above the diſcharging a holy and acceptable
Duty to Chriſt? who give more to deck and adorn their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and pleaſe the baſe Luſt of their Children, than they will
give to promote the Goſpel, and recover the languiſhing Intereſt
of Jeſus Chriſt that is in our hands. And may not this be the
reaſon our Aſſemblies are ſo thin on Lecture-days? is it not
becauſe the Hearts of People are not right with God? Can god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Chriſtians be always under the ſame Temptation? Can Sin
predominate in them, and they act thus habitually to the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of their ſacred Religion? Can Sin be in the Affections of
Saints, becauſe there are ſome Infirmities in their Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
Is not a true Child of God quickly convinced of his Fault?
and doth he not ſtraitway reform? But this is a conſtant
courſe of evil, and wilfully perſisting in: nay, and ye ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
their diſpleasure perhaps if you deal plainly with them. Sure
Chriſt is at the Door. Now the Kingdom of Heaven may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59960:28"/>
be compared to ten Virgins, five wiſe, and as many foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh:
read the latter end of <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. and the beginning of the
<hi>25th</hi> Chapter. Multitudes of Fooliſh Virgins, 'tis to be feared,
are now got into the Church, as Chriſt ſignifies it would be a
little before his Coming, whoſe latter end will be worſe than
the firſt.</p>
               <p>This alſo reproves thoſe who foment ſuch Notions,<note place="margin">Reproof 1.</note> and ſtrive
to diſtil them into the Minds of People that are abſurd, and
tend to blind and ruin their Souls, telling them they are in the
Covenant of Grace, and Church-Members, by their Parents
Faith, and have the Seal of the Covenant; yet I could never
learn what it doth ſeal or make firm to them. For a Seal, all
know, uſually makes ſure all that is contained in the ſaid Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.

ſaving Faith to Jeſus Chriſt. Can it ſeal, and not ſeal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Mercies

by a Prieſt's ſcattering a little Water on their Faces when
Babes, tho they live in all manner of horrid Sins, and are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Life and Power of Godlineſs? This is a way of
making Chriſtians which Chriſt and his Apoſtles never taught;

off from ſeeking after Grace and true Regeneration; for if

Heart. For the Lord's ſake take heed what you do, if you would be
pure from the Blood of all Men. We too often ſee when People
are got into Churches, they conclude all is well; and when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
is preached, they do not think it concerns them, but others
who are openly prophane: and thus they come to be blinded,
may be to their own Deſtruction; and if their Blood do not lie
at ſome of your Doors, it will be well. I am afraid ſome now

little eſteem amongſt the Saints? Can you ſtay your Souls upon God, though
in Darkneſs, having no Light? Is all the ſtreſs of your Juſtification and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
built upon Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Conſider of theſe few Queſtions, and do not doubt but that your Hearts are
ſincere, when you can give a comfortable Anſwer to them, though it be with
ſome fear and doubts that ſtill may ariſe in you. A true Chriſtian is ready to
miſtake his Portion, and take that to be his, that belongs to an Hypocrite; as
an Hypocrite on the other hand, miſtakes that which belongs to him, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
that to himſelf, which is the Portion of ſincere Chriſtians: but Grace is
like a ſmall Seed at firſt, that cannot be ſoon eſpied in the Houſe, <hi>i.e.</hi> the Heart,
eſpecially when there is much Smoak and Darkneſs yet remaining.</p>
               <p>But may be ſome may ſay,<note place="margin">Object.</note> What you have ſaid, tends to take us off of Holy Duties
and Obedience.</p>
               <p>God forbid:<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> for though we would not have you reſt or depend upon your
Duties and Obedience; yet let me tell you, a godly Man, or he that is a true
Chriſtian,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 20.</note> hath ſuch Righteouſneſs wrought in him, and by him, <hi>that exceeds the
Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees;</hi> if he had not, <hi>he could in no wiſe enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. His Obedience and Righteouſneſs flows from a Principle of Divine or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Life, or from a Principle of ſaving Grace, or elſe they would be all but
dead Works; and from thence he acts and doth all that he performs Godward.</p>
               <p>2. He acts from a Principle of Faith, his Obedience flows from thence, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf juſtified and accepted only in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59960:31"/>
3. He acts from a Principle of Love to Chriſt, and is alſo always the ſame,
and for the hardeſt part of Religion, as well as for the eaſiest part of it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
he is as careful to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eep a good Conſcience towards God, as to keep a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
void of Offence, towards Men; he takes up all the Duties of Religion in
Point of Performance, though he lays them all down in Point of Dependance.
He is as careful of his Heart and Ways, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y pleaſe God, and glorify
him as much, as a Man can be that expects to merit God's Favour thereby; he
knows he muſt attend upon the means of Salvation, as well as to expect Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it ſelf. 4. He exceeds all others in his end, which is the Honour and Glory
of God, or to live to God on Earth, as well as to live with God in Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly;</hi> How ſeverely doth what we have ſaid look upon all Self-righteous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
and thoſe proud People that boaſt of their Holineſs and Perfection, that
think they need no Repentance,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quakers condemned.</hi> Acts 4. 11. John 8. 24.</note> O that they would conſider it, and tremble
before it is too late, and they periſh eternally, for rejecting the chief Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.
Remember, unleſs ye believe that Chriſt is <hi>he,</hi> ye ſhall die in your Sins.
Alſo it looks ſeverely on all formal and carnal Chriſtians who have nothing but a
Name. Alas Sirs! If the painted Hypocrite, he that is ſo gloriouſly garniſhed
with many great Gifts, Parts, Wiſdom, Learning, and ſeeming Piety, is in a
damnable Condition, what will become of you? Mourn O <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> what a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of filthy, debauched, treacherous, proud, drunken, ſwearing and unclean
Chriſtians (as they are called) haſt thou in the Bowels of thee? they ſhew
their Sin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and hide it not, and yet glory as if they were the only Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God. Awake Sinners, before God's Judgments are poured out upon you,
for certainly great Wrath is at the Door. God hath wrought Wonders for the
Deliverance of this Nation, but ye ſlight and contemn them: Neither Judgments
nor Mercy will humble you; what would you have, ſince nothing God doth,
pleaſes you? Certainly the Almighty will not bear with you much longer, if
you repent not.</p>
               <p>But ye who are truly pious and ſincere ones,<note place="margin">Comfort.</note> rejoice, you who mourn
for your own Sins, and for the Sins of the Land; you are ſecured from the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
Lion, your Day is coming, the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt is near, your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
is at hand; lift up your Heads, and praiſe God for ever.</p>
