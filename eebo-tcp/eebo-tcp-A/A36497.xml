            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Envoy Extraordinary</hi> of His Moſt Sacred <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> &amp;c. having lately ſeen a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Paper entituled, [<hi>An Extract out of the Regiſter of the Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the High and Mighty Lords Eſtates General of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, upon the Memorial of Sir</hi> George Downing <hi>Envoy Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary from the King of</hi> Great Britain] did not at all think it fit for him to take any notice thereof, but to paſs it by as a <hi>Pamphlet</hi> (of which ſort there come out too many here every day); in regard that no ſuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102935:3"/>
had been communicated to <hi>Him</hi> by their <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> not any one word given him in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> to his ſaid <hi>Memorial:</hi> And he had accordingly paſt it by, without taking any notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, had he not ſince by accident been informed by ſeveral <hi>Publick Miniſters</hi> reſiding here, That the ſaid pretended <hi>Reſolution</hi> had been brought to them by the <hi>Agent de Heyde:</hi> Whereupon he now holds himſelf obliged to <hi>Complain</hi> in moſt ſerious terms to their <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> the <hi>Eſtates General</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> of this ſtrange and irregular way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; That while he is Reſiding here on the behalf of the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter,</hi> Papers, in form of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers</hi> to his <hi>Memorials,</hi> ſhould be given to <hi>other Publick Miniſters, here</hi> and <hi>elſewhere,</hi> and ſent all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the world, and yet concealed from <hi>Him;</hi> and thereby neither opportunity of being convinced,

if any thing of reaſon ſhould have been ſaid therein, nor on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of vindicating the Honour and Juſtice of the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> in what he is therein unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged and defamed withal.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe that he the ſaid <hi>Envoy Extraordinary</hi> ſhould have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in that manner, and have given the <hi>Memorial</hi> (to which the ſaid Paper is a Reply) to all <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Miniſters</hi> reſiding here; and ſent it to all Courts abroad, and ſhould have <hi>Printed</hi> and expoſed it to the view of the world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving it to their <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> what would they have thought thereof? and what might have been expected that they would have ſaid to it? Can their <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> imagine that this way of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth tend any way to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying of their <hi>Cauſe,</hi> as to the working of better impreſſions concerning the ſame in the minds of thoſe <hi>Publick Miniſters,</hi> or their

               <hi>Maſters?</hi> Or rather, that they muſt be exeeedingly ſcandalized there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, as looking more like a <hi>Surpriſe</hi> of them and their Judgments, than otherwiſe; and conſidering that they may to morrow be dealt with in like manner, in relation to any Paper they may give in; and ſee the Affairs of their Maſters traduced and defamed, without any opportunity or poſſibility of clearing the ſame.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Matter</hi> of the ſaid Paper. Is it enough to ſay in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms, <hi>That the ſaid</hi> Memorial <hi>was ill, graunded, or abuſively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,</hi> without particularizing at all <hi>how,</hi> or <hi>wherein;</hi> or ſo much as excepting againſt any one word thereof, much leſs diſproving the ſame?</p>
            <p>And again; If the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are charged therein, be <hi>true</hi> (as they both are, and muſt now be taken by all men to be, ſince nothing is made out by their

               <hi>Lordſhips</hi> to the contrary) To what purpoſe is the whole ſequel of the ſaid Paper? If it be true (as it is) That the <hi>Royal Maſter</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Envoy</hi> was no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to His Kingdoms, but that He was immediately, and from day to day, troubled and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned with a Crowd of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of His Subjects againſt thoſe of this Countrey; all which notwithſtanding, His Majeſty did not grant any one <hi>Letter of Marque,</hi> nor betake himſelf to any way of <hi>force</hi> for the obtaining of their reparation and ſatisfaction; But inſtead thereof, for an everlaſting memorial of his great kindneſs and good-will towards this Countrey, and for the facilitating of the bringing to a Concluſion the late <hi>Treaty</hi> with them (finding the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints</hi> and <hi>Pretenſions</hi> of His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to be ſo numerous and great) was pleaſed after all to ſuffer very many of them, and thoſe to a vaſt

            <p>To take away a mans life without the courſe of Juſtice, though it be with the greateſt civility, and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of death imaginable, is a crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon crime, and which God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Murder, and will puniſh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; but to heighten, and multiply a death, withall the previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

            <p>There hapning ſome differences in the <hi>Indies,</hi> between the Suppoſts of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Companies, a Treaty was agreed on in <hi>London</hi> in the Year 1613. Another at the <hi>Hague</hi> 1615. But neither effected any thing to purpoſe; however 1619. There was a ſolemn compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102935:21"/>
of all thoſe differences, and a Method laid down for their future proceeding, as well in Trade as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; but in conſideration of the blood and coſt (as was pretended) the <hi>Hollander</hi> was at, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugalls</hi> out of the Iſles of the <hi>Moluccoes,</hi> &amp;c. And for the building Forts for the ſuture ſecurity of the ſame, it was agreed on, that they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy two Thirds of the Trade, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the Third, and that the ſaid Forts ſhould be maintained by Taxes leavied on the Merchandize: their cheif Fort was at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had planted five Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the head of all the reſt; a place of conſiderable ſtrength, for it had four Bulwarks, with their Curtains; and upon each of theſe Points, ſix great Peices of Ordnance mounted, moſt Braſs, the one ſide thereof is waſhed with the Sea, and the other divided from the Land, with a Ditch of five Fathom broad, very deep, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102935:21"/>
filled with the Sea; in this Fort there were two hundred <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers, and a Company of free <hi>Burghers,</hi> beſides four hundred <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dikers,</hi> (as they call them) in the Town ready to ſerve this Fort or Caſtle at an hours warning; they having withall, ſeveral tall Ships in the Harbour, for Traffick, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> had here in this Town, an houſe of their own, in which they lived under the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Caſtle, for two Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Treaty, and in reſpect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in amity on their ſides with the <hi>Dutch.</hi> But after this time ſeveral debates aroſe, and by reaſon of the treacherous and unjuſt proceedings of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the juſt and miſerable complaints of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacht away to <hi>Jaccatra,</hi> now called <hi>Nova Battavia,</hi> where their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances being not heard, they were ſent into <hi>England,</hi> and diſcuſſed with <hi>Holland,</hi> but no favorable reſult
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102935:22"/>
hence accrewed. Hereupon the differences encreaſing, a ſword was found by the <hi>Hollander</hi> to cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what their tedious diſputes could not untie. On the eleventh of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 1622. In the Fort, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel ſecured upon ſuſpicion an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive <hi>Japoner,</hi> who was put to the Torture, and thereupon he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that He, and ſeveral of his Country-men, had plotted the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing of the Caſtle: upon this, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Japoners</hi> were tortured and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, who confeſſed the like; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of this Torture, which was four daies, ſeveral of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> went to the Caſtle, partly to do buſineſs, and partly to ſee theſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Malefactors, not dreaming they were in the leaſt concerned, having never had any converſe with any of theſe Priſoners.</p>
            <p>There was at the ſame time in the Caſtle, a debauched Engliſh-man, who for offering to ſet a Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans houſe a fire, was confined, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102935:22"/>
him they ſhewd the grievouſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured <hi>Japoners,</hi> telling him withall, that they had conſeſſed that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were joyn'd with them, in this confederacy; aſſuring him, if he would not confeſs the like, he ſhould be worſe ſerved; upon the Torture he confeſſed, as the reſt had done: hereupon they inſtantly ſent for what <hi>Engliſh</hi> there was in <hi>Amboyna</hi> to come immediately to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who obeyed the Summons; but they were no ſooner entered the Caſtle, but ſecured, and ſharply charged by the Governour, with this conſpiracie, having ſo done, they ſeized the Merchandize of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-company,</hi> into their own cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with all their Books and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; nor did they omit ſecuring the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the reſt of the Factories, whom they all threatned with the Torture, if they would not confeſs, what ever the Governour and the Fiſcal would have them, the Major part being fully reſolved to ſtand to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102935:23"/>
the truth, received their Helliſh Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the puniſhment was to great for man to bear, and ſo by their confeſſions helped the <hi>Dutch</hi> to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves, as well as their poor innocent Country-men. Judge you by the manner following of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable Torture, whether theſe poor Souls would not ſay any thing, nay dye willingly to be freed from it; thus they uſed them, firſt they hoiſed the Priſoner up by the hands with a cord, on a large door, where they made him faſt with two ſtaples of Iron fixt on both ſides, on the top of the door poſts, extending his hands one from the other, as wide as they could ſtretch them; being thus made faſt, his feet hung about two foot from the ground, which having extended as wide as they could, they faſtned them to the Door Trees on each ſide; then they bound a cloath about his neck and face, ſo cloſe no water ſhould paſs by; that done, they poured the water ſoſtly on his head,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102935:23"/>
until the cloath was full up to the mouth, and noſtrils, and ſomewhat higher; ſo that he could not draw breath, but muſt withall ſuck in the water, which being ſtill continued to be poured in ſoftly, forced all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts, ſo that the water came out of his Noſe, Ears, and Eyes; and often, as it were ſtifling and choaking him, at length taking away his breath, he falls into a ſwound; then taking him down quickly, they make him vomit up his water: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little recovered, they triced him up again, and poured in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, taking him down thus five or ſix times, as often as they ſaw him faint: by this means his Body would ſwell twice or thrice as big as before, his Cheeks like great Bladders, and his Eyes ſtaring and ſtrutting out beyond his Fore-head; after this, as they found him obſtinate in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of the truth, they would trice him up again, and with lighted Candles burn him in the bottoms of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102935:24"/>
the Feet, until the Fat thereof dropt out the Candles, yet for all that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply freſh Candles; burning him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Elbows, and in the palms of the Hands, as alſo under the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, until his inwards might be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen.</p>
            <p>Having by their extorted and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced confeſſions, accuſed one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they were all thrown into a loathſome Dungeon, where having lain a while, they were brought to the Caſtle-yard, where they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sentence of Death; before their ſuffering, they deſired to take the Sacrament in Teſtimony of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, but it was denyed them; however, they all Unanimouſly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Men and Angels to witneſs, they dyed innocent of that Conſpiracy was laid to their charge.</p>
            <p>As I wiſh the occaſion of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this at firſt had never been, ſo I wiſh Juſtice once had, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance hereof may be for ever bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. But this breach being Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102935:24"/>
and to this day but in part ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied (by ſome ſignal Victories ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained over them, before and ſince his Majeſties happy Reſtauration) and the blood there and elſewhere by them ſpilt, no doubt ſtill crying loud, it had been injuſt in the firſt publiſher to have buried it in ſilence; and a great ſin of forgetfulneſs in not reviving the remembrance; for as the beginning of theſe torments were from a cauſeleſs and ſlight ſuſpition of an improbable and ineffective plot, ſo by that means were we forced from our poſſeſſions in thoſe parts, and the injury became complicated both againſt Juſtice and Intereſt.</p>
            <p>I cannot but add unto their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the extream malice they bore to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in thoſe parts; <hi>Polaroon,</hi> one of the Iſlands of <hi>Banda,</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> notwithſtanding according to the Treaty 1619. they knew it was to remain in the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but knowing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that it muſt be reſtored again,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102935:25"/>
they exerciſe all the Malice in that Iſland, Hells conſiſtory could aſſiſt them with: they firſt take all courſes to make the Iſland little or nothing worth: they demoliſh and deface the Buildings, tranſplant the Nutmeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, plucking them up by the roots, and carrying them into their own Iſlands, of <hi>Nera</hi> and <hi>Poloway,</hi> burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Trees they thought unfit for Tranſplantations; nay, at laſt they found away to diſpeople the Iſland, and to leave it ſo, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might make no uſe of it, worth their charge of keeping it. To effect which, they entertain a Run-away, the Son of an <hi>Orankey</hi> or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Polaroon,</hi> who having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome notorious fact, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved death, fled to the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Nera,</hi> acquainting the Governour, that the <hi>Polaroons</hi> had a deſign with the help of the People of <hi>Serran</hi> in their <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricurries,</hi> to maſſacree all the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>Polaroon,</hi> and <hi>Polaway.</hi> Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the <hi>indicium</hi> of this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102935:25"/>
Malefactor, the Governour ſent for the <hi>Orankes</hi> to him, of whom ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty came, which he ſecured, they knowing nothing of his deſign; and preſently ſent two hundred Men to <hi>Polaroon</hi> to ſecure the reſt; having taken them Priſoners and brought to the Caſtle at <hi>Nera,</hi> they were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured with water and fire, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe of <hi>Amboyna</hi> were; two dyed on the Torture, and the reſt, which were one Hundred and ſixty, upon their own forced confeſſions, were condemned and executed; the Women were forthwith removed from <hi>Palaroon,</hi> and diſtributed into other Iſlands, ſubject to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> leaving that place deſtitute of the help of the Country people, without whom, neither the <hi>Dutch</hi> nor <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> can maintain their Trade in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither did their Treacheries, Wrongs, and Abuſes, center here only, but ſtrecht themſelves out from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102935:26"/>
and perpetrating ſuch inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and injuries, as are not fit for Chriſtians to nominate. For inſtance, be pleaſed to obſerve, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of <hi>New-England,</hi> conſiſting of ſeveral Governments, have the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſetled on the <hi>South-weſt</hi> of them, at the <hi>Manatha</hi>'s or the <hi>New-Netherlands;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> to the <hi>North-eaſt,</hi> along the great River of <hi>Canada,</hi> who till of late have held a Friendly correſpondence, and have afforded each other a mutual aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance againſt the common Enemy, the barbarous <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the Year 1646. the <hi>Dutch</hi> being reduced to a great exigence, and ſtrait, by the <hi>Indians:</hi> implored the <hi>Engliſh</hi> aid and aſſiſtance, which immediately was ſent them, under the command of one Captain <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhil,</hi> a Gentleman of excellent Courage, Prudence, and Conduct, who prizing Chriſtian blood, beyond <hi>Indian</hi> Wealth and Treaſure, (being proffered an Hog ſhead of their <hi>Wam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam</hi>

               <hi>Pege, Indian</hi> Money, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces,) ſlighted their offer, and fell on thoſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> in vindication of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> cutting off in one night, fourteen hundred of them, not without the loſs of <hi>Engliſh blood</hi> conſiderably, and all to reſettle (with the Aſſiſtance of the Almighty,) the <hi>Hollander</hi> in Peace and Safety.</p>
            <p>But Ingratitude over-clouding theſe Heroick Actions, and their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Treacherous, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Cruelty, extending it ſelf from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> running in its proper Channel of <hi>Dutch</hi> infidelity, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſought out their Neighbours, their noble Friends and Defenders, the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> and nothing would ſerve the turn, but that they muſt return Deſtruction, for being the happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of their then and former preſervation; this their unworthy inequality of retribution (without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the ballance their former and latter inexpreſſible ingratitudes) is

enough to Chronicle the <hi>Hollander,</hi> Perfidious, Ungrateful, Bloody, and Cruel.</p>

complaining of this behaviour, after two years ſollicitation, obtained an Order for the performance of theſe Articles, but Commiſſioners being ſent, and two Ships to bring our Men away, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their former practiſes, ſent private Orders contradictory to theſe they had owned in publick, whereby our Commiſſioners journy thither, was to no other effect, then to bring away the poorer ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the prayers and cries of the wealthier for releif out of that cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.

            <p>It is not to be wondred that they

Self, but the ſafety of our Trade, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the wealth and proſperity of <hi>England</hi> depends, the preſervation of his people abroad from violence and oppreſſion: and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> daring to affront us, almoſt within our very Ports, which move his juſt indignation againſt them; and what <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> will not be aſſiſting with his life and eſtate, in ſo juſt a cauſe, wherein the honour of his King, and the welfare and ſafety of all his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral concerns conſiſt: ſurely if we have left any thing of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſpirit, we cannot but be herein active, and as <hi>England</hi> never wanted men of courage, ſo I hope ſhe will not want power (if confidence may be put in the Arm of fleſh) to chaſtiſe the Inſolencies of our Enemies.</p>
            <p>Who would have thought they durſt have diſputed the right of the Flag, a Prerogative ſo Ancient; it was one of the firſt of his Majeſties Predeceſſors, and ought to be the laſt from which this Kingdome

            <p>Beſides they have an hundred Dager-boats, one hundred and fifty tuns a peice, or thereabouts; ſeven hundred Pinds and Well-boats, from ſixty to an hundred tuns a peice, which altogether fiſh upon the Sea of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> for <hi>Cod</hi> and <hi>Ling</hi> only, and theſe too for the moſt employ other Ships, to bring them Salt, and carry the Fiſh home, making in all ſixteen hundred Ships, which maintain and imploy at leaſt four thouſand Perſons of all ſorts. For the <hi>Herring</hi> ſeaſon, they have at leaſt ſixteen hundred Buſſes, all of them only fiſhing on our Coaſts, and every one of theſe maketh work for three other Ships which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102935:38"/>
attend her; the one to bring in Salt from forrein parts, the other to carry that Salt and Cask to the Buſſes, and to bring back the <hi>Herrings,</hi> and the third to tranſport the ſaid Fiſh into forreign Countries: ſo that the total number plying the Herring-fiſhing, is ſix thouſand four hundred.</p>
            <p>Moreover, they have four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Veſſels at leaſt, that take Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and there ſell them for ready-money: ſo that the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> (beſides their three hundred Ships fiſhing on their Coaſts) have at leaſt eight thouſand and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ships only maintained by the Seas of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> by the which means principally, <hi>Holland</hi> being not ſo big, as one of our Shires in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> conteining not above twenty eight miles in length, and twenty three in bredth, have increaſed the number of their Shipping, to at leaſt ten thouſand ſail, and to that number they add in a manner daily, although the Country it ſelf affords them
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102935:38"/>
neither Materials, nor Victuals, nor Merchandiſe to be accounted of, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their ſetting forth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let us conſider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their Mariners, from the number of their Ships, fiſhing on our Coaſts, which as we ſaid before, were eight thouſand four hundred, we muſt allow more hands to the fiſhing concern, then for bare ſailing; if ſuppoſe ten men to every ſhip, one with another, the total of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners and Fiſhers, will amount to fourſcore and four thouſand; out of which number, they continually furniſh their longer Voyages, to all parts of the World; for by this they are not only inabled to brook the Sea, and to know the uſe of the Tackle and Compaſs, but are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inſtructed in Trade, and in the Principles of Navigation and Pilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; inſomuch as their chiefeſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators, have had from home their education and breeding: and hence they are become, as skilful and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102935:39"/>
knowing in all the Sands, Sholes, Creeks and Channels belonging to our Coaſts, as the beſt of our Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots.</p>
            <p>Thirdly by reaſon of thoſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Ships and Mariners, they have extended their Trade to all parts of the world, and therein (to ſpeak the truth,) have out-thrown all ever yet have uſed the Sea, many Bars length, exporting in moſt of their Voyages, Herring and other Fiſh, returning in exchange, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral commodities of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Southern</hi> parts, as <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> for our Herrings, they return Oyl, Wine, Prunes, Hony, Wool, Grain, with ſtore of forraign coyn; from the <hi>Streights,</hi> Velvets, Sattins, and all ſorts of Silk, Allom, Currants, all Grocery ware, with much Money.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Eaſt</hi> Country, for our Herrings, they bring home Corn, Wax, Flax, Hemph, Pitch, Tar,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102935:39"/>
Soap-aſhes, Iron, Copper, Steel, Clap-board, Wainſcoate, Maſts, Timber, Deal-boards, <hi>Poliſh</hi>-dollars, and <hi>Hungary</hi>-gilders. From <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> for Herrings, and other Salt-fiſh; Iron, Steel, Glaſs, Mill-ſtones, Rheniſh-wines, Battery-plate, for Armour, with other munitions; alſo Silk, Velvets, Raſhes, Fuſtians, Poratoes, and ſuch like <hi>Frankfort</hi> Commodities, with ſtore of <hi>Rix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dollars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Brabant,</hi> they return for the moſt part ready-Money, with ſome Tapeſtries, Sayes and Hull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: yea, ſome of our Herrings are carried as far as <hi>Braſile;</hi> and that which is more ſtrange, and much to our ſhame, above four hundred of their Ships, fiſh with ours at <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> within Ken of land, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trould, making us pay ready-money for our fiſh, caught by them on our ſhores.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, by this their large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Trade, (originally derived
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102935:40"/>
from the benefits they have received from the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi>) they are become as it were Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the whole World, whereby they have within a Century or more of years, ſo enlarged their Towns, that the major part of them, are as big again as they were before; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>Amſterdam, Leyden,</hi> and <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-borough,</hi> having been lately above twice enlarged, and their Streets and Buildings ſo orderly ſet forth, that for Beauty and Strength, they may compare with moſt, upon which they beſtow infinite ſums of Money, all originally flowing from the bounty of our Seas; from whence, by their labor and induſtry, they derive the beginnings of all their Wealth and Greatneſs, and particularly for the Havens of the aforeſaid Towns, whereof ſome of them coſt Forty, Fifty, or an Hundred Thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, by reaſon of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Shipping, and Mariners,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102935:40"/>
and ſo great a Trade occaſioned by fiſhing principally, they have not only ſtrengthned and fortyfied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at home, to repell any further Polemick attempts of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> but have likewiſe ſtretched their power to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> in many places whereof they are Lords of the Sea-coaſts, and have likewiſe fortified on the Main, where the King and People are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their devotion, and our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> lying open to all the out-rages, a cruel and imult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tyrant can inflict upon them. So formidable they are both by Sea, and Land, that none but a <hi>Carolus a Carolo,</hi> knows how to lore their top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of their inſufferable Pride, and bring by the Lee, their matchleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, how mightily the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Revenue and Cuſtomes of the State are increaſed, by their fiſhing, may appear in that about forty or fifty years ſince, over and above the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102935:41"/>
Cuſtomes of the Merchandize, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, Licenſes, Waftage and Laſtage, there was paid to the State for Cuſtom of Herrings, and other Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, and Cask paid for Waftage, which cometh at leaſt to as much more: beſides a great part of their Fiſh ſold in forraign parts for ready money, for which they commonly export for the fineſt Gold and Silver; and coming home recoyn it of a baſer allay, under their own ſtamp, (witneſs the ſcarcity of our old Gold) which is no ſmall means to augment their Treaſure.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, as touching their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate wealth, it will appear by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Herring, and other fiſh by them taken. For inſtance, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the War between the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Hollander,</hi> the <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirkkers,</hi> by taking, ſpoyling, and burning the Buſſes of <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſetting great ranſome on the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, enforced them to compound for great Sumns of Money, that they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102935:41"/>
might fiſh quietly one year, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the next year after the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men among themſelves were to pay a dollar upon every laſt of Herrings, towards the maintenance of certain Ships of War, to convoy and ſecure them in their fiſhing; by reaſon whereof, there was a Record kept of the ſeveral laſt of Herrings taken that year, and it appeared thereby, that in one half year, there was taken three hundred thouſand laſt of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which being at twelve pound <hi>per</hi> laſt, amounteth to three Millions and ſix hundred thouſand pounds; whereas at ſixteen, twenty and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pounds they are ſold in other Countries.</p>
            <p>This great Trade of fiſhing, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying ſo many ſhips at Sea, muſt conſequently maintain a very great number of Tradeſmen, and Artizens at land; as Spinſters, and Hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winders for Cables, Cordage, Yarn, Twine for Nets, and Lines, Weavers to make Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloaths, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102935:42"/>
Packers, Dreſſers, Tacklers, Coopers, Blocks, and Bowl-makers for ſhips, Keelmen and Labourers, for removing and carrying fiſh, Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers for planks, Carpenters, Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights, Boat-men, Brewers, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and a number of others, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a great part may be maimed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and unfit to be otherwiſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, beſides the maintenance of all their ſeveral Wives, Chidren and Families; and further, every man or maid-ſervant, or Orphan, having any poor ſtock, may venture the ſame in their fiſhing voyages, which affords them ordinarily great increaſe, and is duly paid according to the proportion of their gain; this makes them have ſo few Beggars amongſt them, and we ſo many, in not finding out ſuch like means, to imploy the poorer ſort of people; the appurtenances hereunto belonging, will coſt us no more than theirs did; and ſince we have the propriety of the ſeas, we want only induſtry to effect this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:102935:42"/>Laſtly, <hi>Holland</hi> is ſo poor of it ſelf, that it yieldeth little, ſaving ſome few Hops, Madder, Butter and Cheeſe; yet notwithſtanding, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Art of fiſhing, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth plentifully in all manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, as well for Life as Luxury, nay for defence too; all which they not only have in competent propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their own uſe, but are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe able from their ſeveral Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines, to ſupply other Countries.</p>
            <p>The premiſes conſidered, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth much to the ignomy and ſhame of this Kingdom, that God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture offering us ſo rich a Treaſure, even to our own doors, we notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding neglect the benefit thereof, and by paying money to the ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Hollander,</hi> for the fiſh of our own Seas, impoveriſh our ſelves to inrich them.</p>
            <p>But thanks to Almighty God, that hath put it into his Majeſties heart to put a ſtop to their further proceedings herein, and do not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102935:43"/>
doubt but he will once more make them acknowledg, that the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Narrow Seas belong to him alone, his Majeſties Prerogative by immemorable preſcription, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all uſage and poſſeſſion, the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of all Neighbours, States, and the Municipal Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that unto him (by reaſon of the ſaid Soveraignty,) the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream command and jurisdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the paſſage and fiſhing in the ſame rightfully appertaineth.</p>
            <p>Why may not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> then make the ſame advantages of theſe Seas, as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> whom we are now chaſtiſeing, not for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry therein, but for their ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, incivility, and rag-manners? The task will not be very difficult, if this method may be obſerved as followeth.</p>
            <p>By erecting two hundred and fifty Buſſes, of reaſonable ſtrength and bigneſſ, there will be employment found for a thouſand Ships, and for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102935:43"/>
at leaſt twenty thouſand Fiſhermen and Mariners at Sea, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for as many Laborers, and Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at Land. The Herrings taken by thoſe Buſſes, will afford the King twenty thouſand pound Cuſtom out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and for Cuſtomes returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, three hundred thouſand pound and more.</p>
            <p>We have Timber ſufficient, and at reaſonable rates, growing in this Kingdom, for the building theſe Buſſes, and every Shire affordeth men of able and hardy bodies, fit for ſuch employment, who now live poorly and idlely at home; Proviſion we have cheap enough, and great plenty thereof, and our Shores and Harbours are near thoſe places, where the Fiſh do haunt; for drying our Nets, Salting and Packing our Fiſh, and for ſuccour in ſtreſs of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we may bring our fiſh to Land, Salt and Pack it, and from ſome parts of this Kingdome, be at our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> before
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102935:44"/>
the <hi>Hollander</hi> can get home.</p>
            <p>But this we ſhall the better and ſooner do, if we conſider and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reforme certain wants, and abuſes, which heretofore hath hindred us, from effecting this good and great work, whereof theſe that follow, are none of the leaſt.</p>
            <p>The non-obſervance, (or but ſlightly) of the old Cuſtom, and the Statute Laws, for obſerving fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, from whence ſcarcity of fleſh proceedeth: Thus fiſh being not bought ſo frequently as it ought to be, the want of ſale decayeth the Trade thereof.</p>
            <p>Want of order and direction in our fiſhing, every man being left to himſelf, and every man fiſhing as liketh him beſt. Whereas amongſt the <hi>Hollander,</hi> two of the beſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Fiſhermen are appointed to guide the reſt of the Fleet, and the reſt are bound to follow them, and ſo caſt their lines according to their diſcretion. Again, the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:102935:44"/>
ſet forth in <hi>June,</hi> to find the ſhoal of fiſh; and having found it, dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt it till <hi>November;</hi> whereas We ſtay till the Herrings come home to us, and ſomtimes ſuffer them to paſs by us, ere we look out, our Herring fiſhing continuing only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven weeks at moſt, and theirs twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> Buſſes are great and ſtrong, and able to brook foul weather, whereas our Cobbles, Crayes, and Boats, being ſmall and thin-ſided, are eaſily ſwallowed by a rough Sea, not daring to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture far in fair weather.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> are induſtrious, and no ſooner are diſcharged of their lading, but preſently put forth for more; whereas our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> after they have been once at Sea, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly never return again, till their money taken for their fiſh be ſpent, and they in debt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> do retain the Merchants, who during the Herring
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102935:45"/>
ſeaſon, doe duly come to the places where the Buſſes arrive, and by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in ſeveral Companies, do preſently agree for the lading of forty Buſſes at once; and ſo being diſcharged, they may return ſpeedily to their former fiſhing; whereas our Fiſhermen, uncertain of their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are forced to ſpend much time in putting off their fiſh by parcels.</p>
            <p>What elſe may be conſidered in this particular, I will leave to the ſerious thoughts of better Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peices than my own.</p>
            <p>Thus as I have given you a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary account of the vaſt advantages, which will accrue unto us, by the regular, orderly, and induſtrious fiſhing on our own Coaſts, ſo I have briefly related how highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted the <hi>Hollander</hi> is to the King of <hi>England,</hi> for his wealthy fiſhing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Trade; yet they are ſo far from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging any debt, that inſtead thereof, they have moſt unworthily thrown dirt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his Majeſties face, a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102935:45"/>
Gracious Prince, who hath indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by kindneſſes, to charm theſe ſwarming Frogs, who are now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to become an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Plague, by croaking againſt him, in his own Waters. They ſay <hi>Hollands</hi> opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and wealthy Citty <hi>Amſterdam</hi> was founded on Herring-bones. For all my juſt animoſity againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> I cannot but be ſomewhat afflicted, to ſee the <hi>Dutch</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Have you not had liberty to trade, and to become Deniſons; nay ſo graciouſly you have been uſed by his Sacred Majeſty, and his Royal Father, even to admiration, that you had power to buy and purchaſe Land

               <p>And notwithſtanding the preſent juſt War his Majeſty hath proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the States General of the United Provinces, he hath merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for the aforeſaid <hi>Dutch-Inmates,</hi> and all ſuch who are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to withdraw their Perſons and Eſtates out of thoſe Countries: nay, obſerve his Majeſties ſpecial care of your people inhabiting this his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in his own words: <hi>And becauſe</hi>

Principles may teach Subjects to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Princes, and be no loſers by the bargain; which (by the way) hath rendred you unpleaſant or unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to all Neighbor Monarchs, fearing by your practices you will furniſh their ſubjects with pretences upon all occaſions of advantage to do the like.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

            <p>IT is eaſie to be proved by the Ancient Interpreters of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, That the Sea is no whit leſs capable of private Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, than the Land. In <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> you ſhall find it expreſly written, <hi>And let your borders be the Great Sea;</hi> that is (as the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102935:56"/>
comment on the place) the Main Ocean and its Iſlands.</p>
            <p>You may read, that <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, being Admiral of a great Navy, had a Commiſſion given him by the Senate, as abſolute Lord of the Sea; nay, many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians have called the Sea their Sea, becauſe it was in ſubjection to, being wholly ſubdued by, the <hi>Roman</hi> Power. <hi>Thy borders are in the midst or heart of the Sea,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> of the <hi>Tyrians:</hi> and it is affirmed in ancient Hiſtory, That the City of <hi>Tyre</hi> built by <hi>Agenor,</hi> made not only the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring-Sea, but what Seas ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her Ships ſailed in, to be of her Dominion.</p>
            <p>There was an ancient Cuſtom uſed in the Eaſt, That when Great Kings had a deſign to bring any
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102935:56"/>
Nation under their power, they commanded Water and Earth, the pledges of Empire and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be delivered unto them; conceiving that the Command of the Sea, as well as of the Land, was ſignified by ſuch a Token.</p>
            <p>And if we take a view of theſe late times, as to the Rights and Cuſtoms of Forreign Nations, we ſhall find, that the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> hath enjoyed the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Adriatique-Sea</hi> for many Ages. The <hi>Tuſcans</hi> to this day have an Abſolute Dominion in the <hi>Tyrhene-Sea;</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Genoa,</hi> in the <hi>Lyguſtick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude: That the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Sea is admitted amongſt thoſe things that are lawful, and received into the Cuſtoms of Nations, is ſo far from contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that nothing at all can be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102935:57"/>
found to controul it in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of our later times, unleſs it be by the Encroaching-<hi>Hollander,</hi> who bordering ſo near our ſhores, hath done, and doth endeavour to violate the Right of His Moſt Sacred Majeſty, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Civil Community. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is moſt evident from the Cuſtom of all Times, That Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and free Paſſage hath ever been ſo limited by Princes in their Territories; that is, either grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or denied, according to the various concernments of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good. Princes are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be wary and careful, that they admit no ſuch Strangers, or Forreign Commerce, where the Commonwealth may receive any damage thereby.</p>
            <p>Some Oppugners to the <hi>Mare Clauſum</hi> introduce this Argument, That the Water is open to All, and therefore by Law it muſt be open at all times to all men. What
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102935:57"/>
a trifle is this? Before the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of things, there was no Land which did not lie open to All, before it came under particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar poſſeſſion. If the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſhould object this Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Dominion over the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Seas; I would ask them the reaſon of their Cuſtom in <hi>Delph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> called <hi>Jus Grutae,</hi> which hath ever been under the care of thoſe Officers called in <hi>Dutch, Pluym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven,</hi> whereby the Beer-Brewers are obliged to pay the hundredth part for the uſe of thoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>Having thus in general given you an account, That almoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all Nations there hath been allowed a private Dominion of the Sea: We ſhall now come nearer home, and inform you, That the ancient <hi>Britains</hi> did Enjoy and Poſſeſs the Sea as Lords thereof, before they were ſubjected to the <hi>Roman</hi> Power. We find no Hiſtory
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102935:58"/>
of <hi>Britain</hi> to which any credit ought to be given, elder than the time of <hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi> at whoſe coming we find the <hi>Britains</hi> uſed the Sea as their own for Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Fiſhing; and withal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted none beſides Merchants to ſail into the Iſland without their leave; nor any man at all to ſound or view their Sea-coaſts or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>Amongſt ſeveral Kings of old, that not only ruled this Land, but had alſo Dominion over the Sea, I find none more potent than King <hi>Edgar;</hi> who poſſeſſing an abſolute Dominion of the Seas, ſailed round it once a year, and ſecured it with a conſtant Guard of Ships, of which, as is reported, he had Four thouſand eight hundred ſtout ones; and what Dominion this was King <hi>Edgar</hi> had as Abſolute Lord of the Sea, appeareth in theſe words, <hi>I Edgar King of</hi> England, <hi>and of all the Kings of the Iſlands, and of all</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:102935:58"/>
               <hi>the Ocean lying about</hi> Britain, <hi>and of all the Nations that are included within the circuit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>After him, King <hi>Canutus</hi> left a teſtimony, whereby he moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſerteth the Sea to be a part of his Dominion: for placing himſelf by the Sea-ſide on <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton</hi> ſhore, he is reported to have made trial of the Seas obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in this manner: <hi>Thou, O Sea, art under my Dominion, as the Land alſo which I ſit upon is mine: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I command thee not to wet the feet or garments of thy Soveraign.</hi> Although the event did not anſwer his expectation, yet by this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf to be Soveraign of the Seas as well as of the Land.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more clear, than that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have been accuſtomed to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Governours, who had a charge to guard the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sea, and theſe were called <hi>Cuſtodes Maritimi.</hi> In this number you ſhall find in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102935:59"/>
Parliamentary Rolls of the 48 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. <hi>Thomas de Moleton,</hi> who is called Captain and Guardian of the Sea; this Title was afterwards changed into <hi>Admiral,</hi> in the days of <hi>Edward</hi> the third: The principal end of calling that Parliament, was concerning the preſervation of Peace both by Land and Sea; giving us to underſtand, that the Land and Sea together, made one entire Body of the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the Dominion of the Seas is properly in the Power and Juriſdiction of the King, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by thoſe Tributes and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms that were impoſed and payed for the guard and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thoſe Seas; and this was paid to the Reign of King <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen.</hi> Since, Subſidies have been demanded of the people in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament upon the ſame account.</p>
            <p>Neither was this impoſed only on the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but alſo upon the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102935:59"/>
ſhips of Forreigners, every Veſſel paying after the rate of ſix pence a Tun that paſſed by, ſuch ſhips only excepted that brought Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize out of <hi>Flanders.</hi> If a Veſſel were employed to fiſh for Herrings, it payed ſix pence a week for every Tun; if for other fiſh, ſo much was to be paid every three weeks; as they who brought Coles from <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> every three months. Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> that learned Antiquary affirmeth, That before a Court of Delegates in <hi>France,</hi> in expreſs terms it hath been acknowledged, That the King of <hi>England</hi> hath ever been Lord not only of the Sea, but of the Iſlands therein contained, upon the account of being King of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to give greater light to this truth, we may from ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords produce many teſtimonies, That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have given leave to Forreigners, upon
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102935:60"/>
requeſt, to paſs through their ſeas. There are innumerable Letters of ſafe conducts in the Records, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth and ſixth; and it is worthy of obſervation, that thoſe Letters were directed by thoſe Kings to their Governors, or Sea Admirals, Vice-Admirals, and Sea-Captains.</p>
            <p>And to clear all at once: The Kings of <hi>England</hi> have ſuch an abſolute Dominion in the Engliſh ſeas, that they have called the Sea it ſelf their Admiralty: and this we find in a Commiſſion of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, the Title whereof is <hi>de Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vibus Areſtandis &amp; Capiendis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as a freedom of Paſſage, ſo a liberty of Fiſhing, hath been obtained by Petition from the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> We read that <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth gave leave to the <hi>French,</hi> and other Forreigners, ſometimes for a year, ſometimes but for ſix months, to go and fiſh throughout his ſeas, provided that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102935:60"/>
the Fiſhing-boats and Buſſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not the burthen of thirty Tuns; and if any Forreigners whatever ſhould moleſt or diſturb any of the King's ſubjects as they were fiſhing, they were forthwith to loſe their Licenſe, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereof.</p>
            <p>In the Eaſtern Sea, which waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Coaſts of <hi>York ſhire,</hi> it hath been an ancient cuſtom for the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> to obtain leave by petitioning the Governour of <hi>Scarborough</hi>-Caſtle. <hi>It is worth the while</hi> (ſaith the Reverend Mr. <hi>Cambden) to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what an extraordinary gain the</hi> Hollanders <hi>do make of fiſhing on the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Seas, having firſt obtained leave from the Caſtle of</hi> Scarborough; <hi>for the</hi> Engliſh <hi>have ever granted them leave to fiſh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving always the Honour and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to themſelves, but through Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence reſigning the Profit to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi> King <hi>James</hi> took ſpecial care
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102935:61"/>
that no Forreigner ſhould fiſh on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſeas, without leave firſt obtained; and every year at the leaſt this leave was renewed by the Commiſſioners for that purpoſe at <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A remarkable Example of Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this nature we find in the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth. An Agreement was made between the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> That the ſubjects of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms might freely fiſh throughout part of that Sea which is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this ſide by the Ports of <hi>Scarborough</hi> and <hi>Southampton,</hi> and on the other ſide by the Coaſt of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the mouth of the River <hi>Seine;</hi> the time was alſo limited betwixt <hi>Autumn</hi> and the beginning of <hi>January.</hi> And that the <hi>French</hi> might ſecurely enjoy the benefit of this Agreement, the King of <hi>England</hi> ſent Letters to all his Sea-Captainsand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:102935:61"/>By this we may plainly ſee, that theſe Limits wholly excluded the <hi>French</hi> from that part of the Sea which lies towards the Weſt and South-weſt; as alſo, that which lieth North-eaſt of them, as being ſo limited by our <hi>Henry</hi> at his own pleaſure, as ſole Lord and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign of the Whole.</p>
            <p>There is amongſt the Records of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, an Inſcription <hi>pro Hominibus Hollandiae,</hi> &amp;c. for the men of <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Frieſland,</hi> to have leave to fiſh near <hi>Yarmouth;</hi> the King's Letter for their protection runneth in theſe words:</p>
            <p>The King to his beloved and truſty <hi>John de Butelarte,</hi> Warden of his Port of <hi>Iernemuth (now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Yarmouth) Greeting: For as much as we have been certified, that many men out of the parts of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Frieſland,</hi> who are in amity with us, intend now to come and fiſh in our Seas near
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102935:62"/>
unto <hi>Iernemuth;</hi> We command you, That publick Proclamation be made once or twice every week, that no perſon whatſoever employed abroad in our ſervice, preſume to cauſe any injury, trouble, damage, hindrance, or grievance, to be done unto them; but rather, when they ſtand in need, that you give them advice and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in ſuch manner, that they may fiſh and purſue their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage without any lett or impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In teſtimony whereof, we have cauſed theſe Letters to be made Patents, and to continue in force till after the Feaſt of St. <hi>Martins</hi> next enſuing.</p>
            <p>Here you ſee that the King granteth a Protection to fiſh; and he limits it within the ſpace of two months. He alone alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the Fiſher-men on the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Coaſt; nor might the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men uſe any other Veſſels than what were preſcribed by our Kings. Upon which accounts all
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102935:62"/>
kinds of fiſhing was ſometimes prohibited, and ſometimes admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; this reſtriction being added, That they ſhould fiſh only in ſuch Veſſels as were under the burden of thirty Tuns. And this appears by the Letters of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third concerning the Laws of fiſhing which were directed unto the Governours of ſeveral Ports and Towns on the Eaſtern ſhore: the words are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For as much as we have given leave and licenſe to the Fiſhermen of the Neighbouring-Ports, and to others who ſhall be willing to come unto them for the benefit of fiſhing, that they may fiſh and make their own advantage with Ships and Boats under the burden of Thirty Tuns, any Prohibition or Command of ours to the contrary notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. We command you to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Fiſhermen of the ſaid Towns and others who ſhall be willing to</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:102935:63"/>
               <hi>come to the ſaid places for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of fiſhing, to fiſh and make their own advantage with Ships and Boats under the burden of thirty Tun, without any lett or impediment; any Prohibitions or Commands of ours made to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in any wiſe notwithſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is evident alſo in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth; for he inveſted three perſons with Naval Power, whoſe Office it was to guard and protect the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men upon the Coaſts of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk;</hi> and the charges of the Guard were defrayed by the Fiſhermen of the ſaid Seas at the pleaſure of the King of <hi>England.</hi> Neither were any perſons admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Partnerſhip in this kind of Guard, except thoſe who were appointed by the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> leſt by this means perhaps it might derogate from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Right; which is a manifeſt ſign
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102935:63"/>
and evidence of their Dominion and Poſſeſſion of the place.</p>
            <p>And this may yet more clearly appear by the Limits and Laws uſually ſet by our King to ſuch Forreigners as were at enmity with each other, but with amity with the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> and to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is the Proclamation of <hi>King James;</hi> who having made peace with all Nations, did give equal Protection to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Netherlands,</hi> at that time exerciſing acts of great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility one againſt another: <hi>Our pleaſure</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to all our Officres and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by Sea and Land, That they ſhall prohibit as much as in them lieth, all hovering of Men of Warr of either</hi> Spaniard <hi>or</hi> Hollander <hi>near to the entry of any of our Coaſts or Havens: and that they ſhall reſcue and ſuccour all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and others that ſhall fall within the danger of any ſuch</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:102935:64"/>
               <hi>as ſhall await our Coaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is further to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that as our Kings have very often commanded, that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſons ſhould ceaſe from hoſtility throughout all the places extended into their Territories by ſea: ſo they indulged the like priviledg for ever throughout the more Neighbouring-coaſts of the <hi>French</hi> ſhore, That all manner of perſons, though enemies one to another, ſhould ſecurely ſail to and fro, as it were under the wings of an Arbitrator or Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of the Sea; and alſo ſhould freely uſe the Sea, according to ſuch ſpaces and limits as they were pleaſed at firſt to appoint; which, without doubt, is a clear evidence of Dominion.</p>
            <p>In the next place I ſhall cite ſome of the Publick Records kept in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> in which the Dominion of the Seas is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102935:64"/>
aſſerted, as belonging to the Kings of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read that <hi>Edward</hi> the third, in his Commiſſions given to <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry de Say,</hi> Governour or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Southern and We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Seas, and to <hi>John de Norwich</hi> of the Northern; expreſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in theſe following words:</p>
            <q>
               <p>We calling to mind that our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before theſe times been Lords of the Engliſh Sea on every ſide, yea, and Defenders thereof againſt the Invaſions of Enemies; do ſtrictly require and charge you by the Duty and Allegiance wherein you ſtand bound, That you ſet forth to Sea with the ſhips of the Ports, and the other ſhips that are ready; and that you arreſt the other ſhips un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Command; and that with all diligence you make ſearch after the Gallies and Ships of Warr that are abroad againſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102935:65"/>
ſtoutly and manfully you ſet upon them, if they ſhall preſume to bend their courſe to any part of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, or the Coaſts of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </q>
            <p>We read alſo in the Reign of the ſaid King, in the preferring a certain Bill in Parliament (which is the voice of the State of the Realm) that he was uſually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted King or Soveraign of the Seas by all Nations; written in <hi>French,</hi> and thus tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>The Nation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ever in the Ages paſt, renowned for Sea-Affairs in all Countries near the Seas: and they had alſo ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous a Navy, that the people of all Countreys eſteemed and called the King of <hi>Edgland,</hi> the King or Soveraign of the Sea.</p>
            </q>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:102935:65"/>
            <p>Another Teſtimony to the ſame effect we read in the Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Records of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, where the tenour of the Bill runs after this manner:</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Commons do pray, That ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Soveraign Lord the King, and his illuſtrious Progenitors, have ever been Lords of the Sea; and now ſeeing through God's grace it is now come to paſs, that our Lord the King is Lord of the ſhores on both ſides the Sea, ſuch a Tribute may be impoſed on all Strangers paſſing through the ſaid Sea, for the benefit and advantage of our ſaid Lord the King, as may ſeem agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Reaſon for the ſafeguard of the ſaid Sea. </q>The Anſwer ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Bill was,<hi> Soit aviſe par le Roy: </hi>for the King at that time reſided in<hi> France, </hi>being Lord of that Countrey as well by Conqueſt as Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Many other Teſtimonies in this
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102935:66"/>
nature may be produced, which to avoid prolixity I muſt omit.</p>
            <p>Neither hath the High Court of Parliament only given this atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Kings as Supream and Soveraign of the Seas; but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, all the Judges of the Land were conſulted herein, and all jointly averred, That the King's Sea-Dominion, which they called the Ancient Superiority of the Sea, was a matter out of queſtion his Right.</p>
            <p>Neither is this Truth confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by our Laws, but by our Medals. There hath been a piece of Gold often coined by our Kings, called a <hi>Roſe-Noble,</hi> upon the one ſide whereof was ſtamped a Ship floating in the Sea, and a King armed with a Sword and Shield, ſitting in the Ship it ſelf as in a Throne.</p>
            <p>But what need we labour to produce ſo many Teſtimonies at home, from our Records in the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102935:66"/>
Tower, and other places, from our High Courts of Parliament, from our Laws, from our Coyn, and from our Hiſtories, to prove this Truth, ſince it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged even by Forreigners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whom it moſt concerneth, by ſtriking ſail according to the ancient cuſtom, by every ſhip of any forreign Nation whatſoever, to any King's Man of War, which is done not only in Honour to the King of <hi>England,</hi> but alſo in acknowledgment of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and Dominion at ſea. The Antiquity of this Cuſtom, and that it hath been in uſe above theſe four hundred years, may appear by this following Teſtimony:</p>
            <p>At <hi>Haſtings,</hi> a Town ſcituate on the ſhore of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by King <hi>John,</hi> and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of his Peers, in the ſecond year of his reign, That if the Governour or Commander of the King's Navy, in his Naval-Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102935:67"/>
ſhall meet with any ſhips whatſoever at ſea laden or empty, that ſhall refuſe to ſtrike their ſails at the command of the King's Governour or Admiral, they are to be looked on as Enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe called <hi>Mare Clauſum,</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any ſhip whatſoever had not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Dominion of the King of</hi> England <hi>in his own ſea, by ſtriking ſail, they were not to be protected on any account of Amity, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties were appointed by the Kings of</hi> England <hi>in the ſame manner, as if mention were made concerning a crime committed in ſome Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of his Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But above all that yet hath been ſaid, There cannot be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a more convincing Argument than the acknowledgment of the Sea-Dominion of the King of <hi>England</hi> by very many of our Neighbouring-Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:102935:67"/>At what time the Agreement was made between <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Fair</hi> of <hi>France, Reyner Grimbald</hi> Governour of the <hi>French</hi> Navy, intercepted and ſpoiled on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seas the Goods of many Merchants that were going to <hi>Flanders;</hi> and not contented with the depredation of their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, he impriſoned their Perſons: Hereupon a Bill was exhibited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſaid <hi>Reyner Grimbald,</hi> and managed by Procurators on the behalf of the Peers and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; with theſe were joined the Procurators of moſt Nations bordering upon the Sea throughout <hi>Europe;</hi> all theſe inſtituted a Complaint; and all theſe Complainants in their Bill do jointly affirm, That the King of <hi>England</hi> and his Predeceſſors have time out of mind, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controverſie, enjoyed the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and Dominion of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102935:68"/>
               <hi>Engliſh Seas,</hi> and the Iſles belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame, by right of their Realm of <hi>England:</hi> alſo, that they have had, and have the Soveraign Guard thereof, with all manner of Cognizance and Juriſdiction, in doing Right and Juſtice according to the ſaid Laws, Ordinances, and Prohibitions, with all other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which may concern the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Soveraign Dominion in the ſaid places.</p>
            <p>But more particularly, We do find an acknowledgment of the Sea-Dominion of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> made by the <hi>Flemmings</hi> themſelves in the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond; the Records of the Parliament ſpeak it thus:</p>
            <p>In the fourteenth year of the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, there appeared certain Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> to treat about the reformation of ſome injuries they received: and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102935:68"/>
as ſoon as the ſaid Ambaſſadors had been admitted by our Lord the King to treat of the ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, amongſt other particulars they required, That the ſaid Lord the King would at his own ſuit by vertue of his Royal Authority, cauſe enquiry to be made, and do juſtice about a depredation by the ſubjects of <hi>England</hi> upon the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> ſeas, taking Wines and other Commodities from certain Merchants of <hi>Flanders;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that the ſaid Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes taken from the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> were brought within the Realm and Juriſdiction of the King; and that it belonged to the King to ſee Juſtice done, in regard that <hi>He is Lord of the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſeventh year of King <hi>James,</hi> this Right was very ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly aſſerted by Proclamation, and all perſons excluded from the uſe of the ſeas upon our Coaſts, without particular Licenſe; but

                  <p>Firſt, We hold it a Principle not to be denied, That the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> is a Monarch at Land and Sea, to the full extent of His Dominions; and that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth Him as much to maintain His Soveraignty in all the <hi>Brittiſh Seas,</hi> as within His Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; becauſe without that, theſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102935:71"/>
cannot be kept ſafe, nor He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve His Honour and due reſpects with other Nations. But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Seas, He may cauſe His Neighbours, and all other Countries, to ſtand upon their guard whenſoever He thinks fit. And this cannot be doubted, that whoſoever will encroach on Him by Sea, will do it by Land alſo, when they ſee their time. To ſuch preſumption <hi>Mare Liberum</hi> gave the Warning-piece, which muſt be anſwered with a defence of <hi>Mare Clauſum;</hi> not ſo much by Diſcourſes, as by the louder lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a powerful Navy, to be better underſtood, when over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained Patience ſeeth no hope of preſerving her Right by any other means.</p>
                  <p>The degrees by which His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Dominion at Sea hath of later years been firſt impeached, and then queſtioned, are as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable as notorious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:102935:72"/>Firſt, To cheriſh, and as it were to nouriſh our unthankful Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. We gave them leave to gather Wealth and Strength upon our Coaſts, in our Ports, by our Trade, and by our People. Then they were glad to invite our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants reſidence with what Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges they deſired. Then they offered us even the Soveraignty of their Eſtates; and then they ſued for Licenſe to fiſh on our Coaſts, and obtained it under the Great Seal of <hi>Scotland</hi> which now they ſuppreſs; and when thus by leave or by connivence they had poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves of our Fiſhings not only in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> and by our Staple had raiſed a great ſtock of Trade; by theſe means they ſo encreaſed their Shipping and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at Sea, that now they endure not to be kept at any diſtance: nay, they are grown to that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to keep Guards on our Seas;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102935:72"/>
then to project an Office and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Aſſurance for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Trade; and withal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit us free commerce even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our own Seas; and take our ſhips and goods, if they conform not to their Placarts.</p>
                  <p>What Inſolencies and Cruelties they have committed againſt us heretofore, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in the <hi>Indies,</hi> is too well known to all the world. In all which, though our Sufferings and their Wrongs may ſeem forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; yet the great Intereſt of His Majeſties Honour is ſtill the ſame, and will refreſh their memories as there ſhall be cauſe. For, though Charity muſt remit Wrongs done to private perſons, yet the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on the Publick may make it a greater Charity to do Juſtice on crying Crimes. All this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, you are not to conceive that the work of this Fleet is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Revenge or Execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102935:73"/>
for theſe great offences paſt; but chiefly for the future to ſtop the violent Current of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, whereby the Men of Warr and Free-booters of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (abuſing the favour of His Majeſties peaceable and gracious Government, whereby he hath permitted all His Friends &amp; Allies to make uſe of His Seas and Ports in a reaſonable and free manner, and according to his Treaties) have taken upon them the boldneſs not only to come confidently at all times into all his Ports and Rivers, but to convey their Merchants ſhips as high as his chief City, and then to caſt Anchor cloſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Magazines, and to contemn the Commands of His Officers when they required a farther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>But, which is more intolerable, have aſſaulted and taken one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within His Majeſties Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and within his River, to the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102935:73"/>
ſcorn and contempt of His Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Power. And this being of late years an ordinary practice which we have endeavoured in vain to reform by the ways of Juſtice, and Treaties; the World I think will now be ſatisfied, that we have reaſon to look about us. And no wiſe man will doubt, that it is high time to put our ſelves in this Equipage on the Seas, and not to ſuffer the Stage of Action to be taken from Us for want of Our appearance.</p>
                  <p>So you ſee the general ground upon which our Counſels ſtand. In particular you may take notice, and publiſh as cauſe requires. That His Majeſty by this Fleet intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not a rupture with any Prince or State, nor to infringe any point of His Treaties; but reſolveth to continue and maintain that happy Peace wherewith God hath bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed His Kingdom and to which all His Actions and Negotiations have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102935:74"/>
hitherto tended, as by your own Inſtructions you may fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. But withal, conſidering that Peace muſt be maintained by the Arm of Power, which only keeps down Warr by keeping up Dominion; His Majeſty thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, finds it neceſſary, even for His own defence and ſafety, to reaſſume and keep his ancient and undoubted Right in the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Seas, and to ſuffer no other Prince or State to encroach upon Him, thereby aſſuming to themſelves or their Admirals any Soveraign Command; but to force them to perform due homage to His Admirals and Ships, and to pay them acknowledgments, as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times they did.</p>
                  <p>He will alſo ſet open and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the free Trade of his Subjects and Allies, and give them ſuch ſafe Conduct and Convoy as they ſhall reaſonably require. He will ſuffer no other Fleets or Men of Warr
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102935:74"/>
to keep any Guard upon theſe Seas, or there to offer violence, or take Prizes or Booties, or to give interruption to any lawful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. In a word, His Majeſty is reſolved, as to do no wrong, ſo to do Juſtice both to His Subjects and Friends within the limits of His Seas. And this is the Real and Royal Deſign of this Fleet.</p>

            <p>Nay farthermore, you may ſee the Dominion of His Majeſty in His <hi>Brittiſh Seas,</hi> clearly repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, aſſerted, and fully proved, by that Propriety of Title and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of Power which the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> exerciſeth on the <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Sea,</hi> if you will conſult Mr. <hi>Howel</hi> in his <hi>Commonwealth of Venice,</hi> which by the manner of Preſcription, the Conſent of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102935:75"/>
and even by the Confeſſion of their Adverſaries themſelves, is almoſt the ſame with his Majeſties of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> But his Majeſty hath one Title more above all theirs, which is the Title of <hi>Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Inheritance;</hi> confirmed as well by the Law of Nature, as of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and is ſo much the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, in regard of the infinite advantages of the Profits of it, as the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Ocean in its latitude and circumference exceedeth the ſmall boundaries of the Gulph of <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet ſo it is, that the Indulgence of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to their Neighbouring-Nations, eſpecially to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> by giving them too much liberty, hath encouraged them to aſſume a liberty to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and what at the firſt was but a Licenſe, they improve into a Cuſtom, and make that Cuſtom their Authority; inſomuch, that ſome of the moſt buſie of them
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102935:75"/>
have openly declar'd againſt the King's Propriety on the <hi>Brittiſh Seas:</hi> Amongſt theſe is one <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> a Gentleman of great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, but in this particular ſo inclined to obey the importunities and ſerve the intereſts of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men, that he diſobliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and moreover (to ſpeak the truth) of his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it ſelf: for if you look into his <hi>Sylvae,</hi> upon the firſt Inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of King <hi>James,</hi> he is pleaſed to expreſs himſelf in theſe words, <hi>Tria Sceptra Profundi in Magnum cojere Ducem;</hi> which is, that the Rights of the <hi>Engliſh, Scottiſh,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh Seas,</hi> are united under one Scepter: neither is he ſatisfied with this bare profeſſion; <hi>Sume animos a Rege tuo, quis det jura Mari,</hi> Take courage from the King, who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Laws unto the Seas. In the ſame Book in the contemplation of ſo great a Power, he concludeth, <hi>Finis hic eſt, qui fine caret,</hi> &amp;c. This
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102935:76"/>
is an End beyond an End, a bound that knoweth no bound, which even the Winds and the Waves muſt ſubmit unto.</p>
            <p>But with what Ingratitude have the <hi>Dutch</hi> anſwered the many Royal Favours which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have almoſt perpetually conferred on them! If there be no Monſter greater than Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, what Monſters are theſe men, who of late are ſo far from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging their thankfulneſs, that (like Vipers) they would feed upon and conſume thoſe bowels which did afford them life and ſpirit.</p>
            <p>We may obſerve, that in their loweſt condition (which is moſt ſuitable to the name of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, called the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi>) they petitioned to the Majeſty of the Queen of <hi>England;</hi> whoſe Royal Heart and Hand being always open to thoſe that were <hi>Diſtreſſed</hi> (eſpecially thoſe that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102935:76"/>
were her Neighbours) upon the account of Religion; ſhe ſent them Threeſcore thouſand pound in the year 1572; and preſently after, there followed Four Regiments of Foot, and after them the Warr encreaſing, there were ſent over Col. <hi>North,</hi> Col. <hi>Cotton,</hi> Col. <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh,</hi> and Col. <hi>Norris,</hi> with other Perſons of Quality; who for the Honour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, made in that Warr excellent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of their Valour, and redeem'd the <hi>Dutch</hi> from the Power of thoſe who otherwiſe would have brought them to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtanding of their duties.</p>
            <p>At the laſt the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> being ſlain, preſently after the death of the Duke of <hi>Alanſon</hi> (Brother to <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of <hi>France</hi>) the Queen of <hi>England</hi> ſent over to them <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> with great proviſion both of Men and Money, accompanied with divers of the Nobility and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102935:77"/>
Gentry of good account; and although the ſaid Earl not long afterwards returned into <hi>England,</hi> and the affairs of the <hi>Hollander</hi> were doubtful till the fatal battel at <hi>Newport;</hi> yet Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of ever bleſſed memory, out of her unſpeakable goodneſs to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed,</hi> and to thoſe that ſuffered for Religion, did (as long as ſhe lived) aſſiſt the <hi>Hollanders</hi> both with Men and Moneys; ſhe gave them hope in deſpair, gave them ſtrength when weak; and with the charity of Her Princely Hand did ſupport them when fallen. And although the <hi>Hollanders</hi> do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully alledg, <hi>That it was a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit great enough for the Engliſh to aſſiſt them in Reaſon of State, becauſe by ſo doing they kept out a War from their own Countrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is moſt certain, that at that time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had no cauſe to fear a War at all, but only for their <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and for <hi>the taking their parts:</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:102935:77"/>
for it was for their Cauſe that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the year 1571, had ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon the ſum of Six hundred thouſand Ducats on the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> being the Money deſigned from <hi>Spain</hi> to the <hi>Duke d'Alva,</hi> for the advancement of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intereſts in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although the <hi>Hollanders</hi> do further alledg in their own excuſe, <hi>That they were ſo grateful, as that they offered unto the Queen of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>the Soveraignty of the</hi> Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, <hi>which ſhe would not accept; and therefore none of their fault that She obtained it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is in reaſon truly anſwered, That the Queen of <hi>England</hi> well knowing that ſhe was in danger to draw a perpetual War on her Self and her Succeſſors by the accepting ſuch a Gift to which She had no right, did wiſely refuſe their Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; and yet for all that, She continued to aid them without that chargeable obligation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:102935:78"/>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> do further al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, <hi>That the Queen of</hi> England <hi>had the Cautionary Towns of the</hi> Brill <hi>and</hi> Fluſhing, <hi>with other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, delivered into her hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, She had ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by only enjoyed the benefit of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the greater expence of Men and Money. But pray take notice, that moſt certain it is, That the <hi>Hollander</hi> had no ſooner made a <hi>Truce</hi> with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Arch-Duke <hi>Albertus,</hi> but he began preſently to ſet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at naught, and take the Bridle out of their hands; whereupon imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately enſued the bringing of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Clothes died and dreſſed, into <hi>Holland,</hi> and the adjoining Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, without ever making the King of <hi>England,</hi> or his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Leiger at the <hi>Hague,</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith.</p>
            <p>And to make amends for this their ſawcy and inſolent affront, in a more high and peremptory way
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102935:78"/>
they demeaned themſelves to King <hi>James</hi> himſelf. For whereas the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> as Admiral of <hi>Scotland,</hi> had by order from the Majeſty of King <hi>James,</hi> in the year 1616, ſent one Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> (then fiſhing on the Coaſts of <hi>Scotland</hi>) a certain ancient Duty called <hi>Size Herring:</hi> they began to conteſt with him about it; and after a long diſputation, they paid it as in former times it had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed; but not without ſome affronting terms, <hi>That it was the laſt time it ſhould be paid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is moſt certain, that the ſame Gentleman coming the year following with the ſame Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Commandment with one only Ship of His Majeſty's to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Duty aforeſaid, but by them he was denied it, who as plainly as peremptorily told him, <hi>That they were commanded by the States of</hi> Holland <hi>to pay it no more</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:102935:79"/>
               <hi>to the King of</hi> England. Of which he took witneſs, according to his Order from His Majeſty. This ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of witneſs did ſo ſtartle them, that without any more ado they pretended an Order to arreſt him; and ſo they carried him into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where a while he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</p>
            <p>Nay, a little while after, ſuch was their inſufferable abuſe, that when Mr. <hi>Archibald Ranthim,</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentleman, and reſiding at <hi>Stockholm</hi> in <hi>Sweden,</hi> where he ſollicited for ſome ſums of money due to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants; at the ſame time in the ſame City was one <hi>Vandyke</hi> lying there as an Agent for the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> who ſaid unto ſome principal perſons of the <hi>Swedes, That they need not be ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty in paying any moneys to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the King of</hi> England, <hi>or to give them any high reſpect, becauſe the ſaid Kings Promiſes were not to be believed, nor his threatnings</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:102935:79"/>
               <hi>to be feared.</hi> For which vile and inſolent ſpeeches being afterwards challenged by Mr. <hi>Ranthim,</hi> he had no better excuſe than to ſay, He was drunk when he ſpake thoſe words: And by this means his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of playing the Beaſt, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him from playing the Man.</p>
            <p>Now from theſe inſolent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts by words, let us proceed, and come to what they have done by deeds, more than what I have already declared in my preceding Diſcourſe; where, in the firſt place, we may obſerve their rude demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to out <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation in the Northern Seas, on the Coaſts of <hi>Greenland,</hi> and thoſe parts about the fiſhing for Whales, and the Commodity of Trayn-oyl; where violently they have offered unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable abuſes in an hoſtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, driving the <hi>Engliſh</hi> away to their great loſs and prejudice. Their pride of heart was ſo high, that it would not give their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102935:80"/>
leave to apprehend, That Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Sea is free for every man, where it is not upon the Coaſt of any Countrey unto which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Sea belongeth by ancient Prerogative.</p>
            <p>And yet all this is but inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in regard of their uſage of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> where in open Hoſtility they have as fiercely ſet upon them, as if they had been moſt mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, having in ſeveral Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſlain many of our Men, and ſunk ſundry of our Ships; and when they had taken our men Priſoners, they would uſe them in the ſight of the <hi>Indians</hi> in ſuch a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and diſdainful manner, as if it at their own home, and all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces elſe, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in reſpect of them were but a ſordid and ſlaviſh Nation, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were either their Superiors, and might uſe them at their own pleaſure; or the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſo ſpiritleſs, or ſo
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102935:80"/>
unpowerful that they durſt not be revenged, but quietly muſt put up all the Affronts and Injuries which they received at their hands.</p>
            <p>And as for the commodious and profitable Trade which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have had in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> for above theſe fourſcore years, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countreys that lye upon the Eaſt and North, which the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> have now gotten quite out of their hands, to the great grief and prejudice of ſeveral Merchants in <hi>London;</hi> What ſhall we ſay, ſeeing not long ſince they have been act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame again with our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants in <hi>Turkey?</hi> And it is a practice ſo uſual with them to ſpoil the Trade of other Nations, that when they cannot find any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to do it, they will ſhow a nature ſo wretchedly barbarous, that they will not ſtick to ſpoil one another. And yet all this proceedeth out of an ignoble and ſordid ſpirit; for let them arrive to what wealth they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102935:81"/>
will, they can never be the Maſters of a Noble and Generous Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>Had it not been for their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nation of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they had never arrived to the liberty of a free State; yet ſo ingrateful have they been, that they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to forget all the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Humanity, and have digged into the very bowels of thoſe who did preſerve them. So many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this nature may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced, that I am forced to omit them for want of room. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs and Ingratitude of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> may be traced all along ever ſince they ſhook off their obedience to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> even unto this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time. But we will paſs from their Hypocriſie and Cruelty pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed abroad, and look on their actions at home.</p>
            <p>How, almoſt but the other day, did they labour to impoſe upon His
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102935:81"/>
Majeſty, and Sir <hi>George Downing</hi> his <hi>Envoy Extraordinary,</hi> by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Papers to many publick Miniſters of State at the <hi>Hague;</hi> as if his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and his <hi>Envoy</hi> had been pre-poſſeſſed with them, when they had not the leaſt notice of any ſuch thing?</p>
            <p>How have they ſeemed to be moſt deſirous of Peace, when at the ſame time they have omitted no days, even thoſe appropriated for holy duties, to drive on their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for Warr? How have they ſtood in defence of their violent and unjuſt proceedings; and inſtead of redreſſing their Injuries, they have encreaſed them?</p>
            <p>About the year 1662, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a <hi>Treaty</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and having engaged, <hi>That better order ſhould for the future be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;</hi> they have ſince heaped new Injuries, endeavouring the utter overthrow of all the Trade of his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s ſubjects in the <hi>Eaſt</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:102935:82"/>
and <hi>Weſt Indies;</hi> witneſs our ſhips the <hi>Hopewell, Leopard,</hi> and ſome others in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> and the <hi>Charles,</hi> the <hi>James,</hi> the <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the <hi>Hopeful Adventurer,</hi> and the <hi>Speedwell,</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Africa.</hi>

            <p>And after all theſe Acts of the higheſt Injuſtice, and their utmoſt endeavours for driving on a War, they have done and would ſtill make the world believe, <hi>That His Majeſty is the firſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker of it:</hi> who from his own mouth to their Ambaſſador in <hi>England,</hi> and by his Injunctions to Sir <hi>George Downing</hi> his Miniſter in <hi>Holland,</hi> hath given ſo many and ſuch remarkable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations to the contrary.</p>
            <p>What can they ſay to the<hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial </hi>of the Complaints which Sir<hi> George Downing </hi>exhibited to the<hi> States General, </hi>importing,<hi> That in the ſpace of a very few years, almoſt twenty </hi>Engliſh,<hi> with their whole Lading, to a very great value,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102935:82"/>
have been ſeized upon in a very hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible manner, and the men in them moſt barbarouſly and moſt inhumanly treated, being put into ſtinking and moſt naſty Dungeons and Holes at </hi>Caſteldelmina,<hi> where they did lye bedded and bathed in their own excrements, having nothing but bread and water given them, and not enough of that neither to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain Nature (their bodies being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fury of exquiſite and horrid torments); and when any of them dyed, the living and the dead were left together; and ſuch as outliv'd that Cruelty, were expoſed in the Woods to Famine, or to the mercy of wild beaſts in thoſe deſolate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or to be carried into captivity by the Natives, by which means ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hundreds of his Majeſties good Subjects have periſhed and been deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this hour, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſollicitations and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of his Majeſties Envoy, not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102935:83"/>
one penny of ſatisfaction can be had either for the loſs of the ſhips, or the perſons concerned in any of them; but to the contrary, they have ever ſince hindred, and ſhot at the Engliſh ſhips that have anchored by them.</p>
            <p>How inhumanly and treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly was one Captain <hi>Jordan</hi> butcher'd by them, who ſailing from <hi>Bantam</hi> with two ſhips, the one called the <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and the other the <hi>Hound,</hi> to the great Iſlands of <hi>Burnew,</hi> he diſcovered three or four <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhips ſtanding in for the ſame Port; and being confident that they intended no good to him, he gave order to prepare for the Encounter; fully reſolving to fight it out to the laſt man, rather than to yeild himſelf to the unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful hands of his inſulting and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Enemies. The <hi>Dutch</hi> ſummoned to deliver the ſhips upon fair Quarter; but Captain <hi>Jordan</hi> (who had a great heart in a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102935:83"/>
little body) abſolutely refuſed to yeild upon any condition whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The <hi>Dutch</hi> pretending to be unwilling to ſhed blood, called out to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and told them, That they knew well enough that little Captain <hi>Jordan</hi> was there; and deſired them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to parley with them: The Captain being informed of it, refuſed to have any conference with them: whereupon they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that he would but ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the Quarter-Deck, that by a fair compliance they might ſtop the effuſion of blood, which otherwiſe muſt follow. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Capt. <hi>Jordan</hi> (thinking that to ſpeak with them could not much prejudice him) did ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the Quarter-deck; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the exchange of ſome few words, told them, That he knew the Juſtice of his Cauſe, and the Injuſtice of theirs; and was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to fight it out: The <hi>Hollander</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:102935:84"/>
alledging, That their ſtrength was far greater than his; and it was rather Deſperateneſs than true Valour to fight upon ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage. This prevailed nothing with Capt. <hi>Jordan,</hi> who told them, He was reſolved to fight it out, and leave the ſucceſs to God. The <hi>Dutch</hi> finding him untractable to their demands, held him ſtill in diſcourſe, until a Muſquet-bullet from one of their ſhips laid him dead on the Quarter-deck as he was in parley with them. At that very inſtant of time, whether by Treachery, or by Accident, it is uncertain; a part of the other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, called the <hi>Hound,</hi> was blown up, and many of her men mortally hurt: The amazement was ſo great, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were enforced to yeild; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken them, did inſtantly lade them with bolts, and did not allow them ſo much favour as they ſhowed to the <hi>Heathen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:102935:84"/>Thus may we obſerve what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and Wrong we have all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſuſtained by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have got many of thoſe Iſlands where now they have ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by Cruelty and Bloodſhed, and by murthering the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and their Friends. Theſe indeed are ſad Relations; and though diſmal in themſelves, they are but the Prologues to their more bloody Tragedies.</p>
            <p>But to give further proof of their Confidence and Ambition, they have publiſhed a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein they aſſume and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to themſelves a Right to that whole Coaſt, to the excluſion of all other Nations; although by Order from his Majeſty, Sir <hi>George Downing</hi> both in publick confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with the Deputies of the <hi>Lords General,</hi> as alſo with thoſe of <hi>Holland</hi> in particular, hath at large remonſtrated his Majeſties Right and Intereſt in ſome part therein,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102935:85"/>
having by his Subjects bought the ground of the King of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey for a valuable Conſideration, and built a Factory thereon; and yet for all this, ſome of the <hi>Dutch Weſt-India Company</hi> by fraud and treachery have got into the place, and no hopes of the reſtitution of it; for they are reſolved to keep that by Violence which they have obtained by Deceit.</p>
            <p>Moreover, What can they ſay for themſelves concerning their ſtirring up the King of <hi>Fantin</hi> by rewards and ſums of money, and ſupplying him with all manner of Arms and Ammunition, for the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing of his Majeſties Caſtle at <hi>Cormantin</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> ſo that an abſolute neceſſity is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon his Majeſty and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, either of loſing all that have been actually taken from them, and abandoning for ever that Trade it ſelf, or of betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſome other way for relief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:102935:85"/>The Iſland of <hi>Polleroon</hi> hath been ſurrendring back to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> ever ſince the year 1622; at which time by a ſolemn and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Treaty it was promiſed to be done; and again, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Treaty in the year 1654; and by an Order of the <hi>States General,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indie-Company</hi> of that Nation, in the year 1661; and again by another Treaty in the year following: and yet to this day there is not the leaſt mention of any thing Reſtored.</p>
            <p>And ſhould any man then think it ſtrange, that his Majeſty after ſo long an experience of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs and Deceitfulneſs of that Nation, that he now endeavours to re-poſſeſs his ſubjects of thoſe places which by the hand of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Oppreſſion the <hi>Dutch</hi> have forced from them?</p>
            <p>Now as for the buſineſs of the <hi>New-Netherlands</hi> (as they call it by I know not what Authority)
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102935:86"/>
it hath been abundantly elſewhere proved, That the ſaid Land is part of the Poſſeſſion of his Majeſties ſubjects in <hi>New-England,</hi> which their Charter plainly and preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth and expreſſeth; and thoſe few <hi>Dutch</hi> who lived there heretofore, have lived there meerly upon the connivence and ſufferance of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> which hath been permitted them ſo to do, ſo long as they demeaned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves peaceably and quietly. But the <hi>Dutch</hi> not contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therewith, have encroached more and more upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> impoſing their Laws and Cuſtoms, and endeavouring to raiſe Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions and Exciſes on them, and in thoſe places where the <hi>Dutch</hi> had never been; whereupon they have been ſeveral times neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſend Soldiers for the repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them.</p>
            <p>Since the Concluſion of the late Treaty, the <hi>Dutch</hi> have made
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102935:86"/>
new Incurſions upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and given them many new provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and have ordained a Trial of Cauſes among themſelves, and a Proceeding by force of arms, without any appealing into <hi>Europe</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>And can any Prince then think it ſtrange, if his Majeſty of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſuffer his ſubjects to reſcue themſelves from ſuch continual Vexations? His moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in the year 1665, was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to order his ſubjects to re-poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs themſelves by force of arms of a certain place called <hi>Cayen,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> alledged had been wrongfully kept from them, and detained by the <hi>West-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the <hi>Netherlanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We might in the next place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg <hi>De Ruyter</hi>'s leaving the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, when with united Counſels and Forces they were to act againſt their common Enemies the Pyrates and Barbarians in the <hi>Midland-Seas,</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:102935:87"/>
according to the Treaty ſoon after his Majeſties happy Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>We may alledg their Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given to <hi>Van Campen</hi> in the year 1664, at what time his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty entertained not any open War againſt them; which Inſtructions was in down-right terms, <hi>To attack and fall upon his Majeſties Subjects in the Weſt-Indies, and to carve out their own Satisfaction and Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Their refuſing to ſtrike, and denying his Majeſty the Right of the Flag, even in his own Seas: Witneſs Sir <hi>Robert Holmes</hi> late meeting with Eight <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War convoying their <hi>Smyrna</hi>-Fleet homewards, which had no doubt come ſhort of home, had not that brave Commander been overpower'd with Numbers: In which ſhort, but ſharp Conflict, as there was not an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man which gave not large proof and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102935:87"/>
of his Courage; ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Oſſery,</hi> acted wonders that day, almoſt baffling the belief of their eyes who were Spectators of his incredible Valour.</p>
            <p>Thus I have in part drawn to the knowledg of all, the Cruelties, Ingratitudes, Injuries, and Wrongs, done unto the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous <hi>Dutch;</hi> yet not one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred part of what they are; and for their hainouſneſs, deſerve only a Pen of Steel to record them in the wrinkled brow of <hi>Time,</hi> there to remain to poſterity. And if all the Premiſes aforeſaid be not cauſe enough to provoke his Majeſty to maintain the Juſtice of his <hi>Cauſe</hi> by the Force of Arms, we will leave to the World, and to his Enemies themſelves to judg: And ſurely that Sword is to be feared, that ſtriketh with the Hand of <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
