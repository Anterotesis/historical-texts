         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO The High and Mighty Emperour, RVDOLPHVS the II. The Preface of the Heyres to <hi>TYCHO BRAHE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N Orphant Worke (moſt mighty Emperour) we doe now preſent unto the view of your Sacred Maieſty, and doe dedicate it to your renowned name, being the Aſtronomicall exerciſes of our Parent of late approved memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which by the leyſurable ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Author are increaſed to ſo large a volume, that ſo they may be more commodious to Poſterity, than the bare title of Exerciſes doth promiſe. For if ever <hi>HORACES</hi> Law were obſerved, it is in this Booke, which commeth forth after Three times nine yeares are expired. For when our Parent at the firſt, had onely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to treat in this Booke of that wonderfull new Starre, which was ſeene in the yeare of ſeventy two, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to examine the opinions of others concerning the ſame, and had begun to print it at <hi>Vraniburg,</hi> (all things go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:25151:4"/>
forward according to his owne deſire) it happened in the mean time, that he began to make a new and exact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the courſe of the Sunne, and to aſſigne and point out the ſeverall places of the fixed Starres, even to halfe a minute, according to their Latitude and Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and laſtly to ſearch out the intricate motions of the Moone, all which at length be performed, and hate heere added to this Volume; ſo that we may truly affirme, that this Booke in reſpect of the worthineſſe of the matter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth a more famous title, than to be called Aſtronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call exerciſes. How difficult it was to performe, in reſpect that things lay deeply hidden, and therefore required the more labour to find out, having beene before in paine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by others in former ages, I leave to their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that have any the least knowledge in Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Now this incomparable labour, which is above the envy of malevolent perſons, ſeeing that our Parent in the laſt yeares of his life, together with his other ſtudies, hath devoted to your ſacred Maieſtie, we therefore his ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heyres, having Printed it after his deceaſe, doe now moſt humbly offer it to your Highneſſe: Which wee have done to the end, that we might give an account of his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the chiefe Monarch of the Chriſtian world, and might take away all occaſion of detraction from the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, whom eyther their owne malitious natures have ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up againſt him, or their evill diſpoſitions and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance have ſo corrupted and blinded their iudgments, that they ſhould thinke it all loſt, which was beſtowed on theſe royall Sciences; which was very little, in reſpect of that which was neceſſary, and in regard of the honour and glory which redoundeth from thence. But in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, the moſt learned and excellent men of all ages, may
<pb facs="tcp:25151:4"/>
beare us co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, who were envyed while they lived. Since no age hath wanted ſome who with <hi>ARISTIPPVS</hi> and <hi>EPICVRVS,</hi> have diſdained Mathematicall learning as vaine and idle, and have hated the Profeſſors thereof with more than barbarous malice. Nevertheleſſe, moſt mighty Emperor, we being held up and ſuſtained by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of your Imperiall Maieſty, who are placed on the higheſt Pinacle of honour, have no reaſon to regard the envy of others. But have cauſe not to diſpiſe ſuch idle cenſures, and call to minde the examples of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties Anceſtors; namely, <hi>ALPHONSVS</hi> King of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> and <hi>Caſtell, ALBERTVS</hi> of <hi>Auſtria, FREDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICK, CHARLES</hi> the <hi>fifth,</hi> and the like, who were all favourers of this noble ſtudy, and did extend their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and bounty to the profeſſors thereof. For (that I may inſtance one of many) who could be more magnificent than <hi>ALPHONSVS,</hi> who out of his owne praiſe-worthy and memorable bounty, did beſtow upon the Tables of the Coeleſtiall motions, above fodre hundred thouſand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats. Notwithſtanding the <hi>Ariſtippuſſes</hi> of our time, doe thinke it might better have beene beſtowed on ſports and idle pleaſures. But yet theſe men doe not conſider that <hi>ALPHONSVS</hi> by this meanes hath gotten to himſelfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting glory, while the fame of other Kings is buried in obſcurity. But yet how lame and defective are theſe coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tables! And not to be compared with the labours of our Parent. Becauſe they never made any obſervation from the Heavens, but by comparing the obſervations of the ancients, and noting the Progreſſe of the Starres, they have pacthed up this bundle of Tables. This defect di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers learned men have endeavoured to ſupply, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the moſt famous <hi>COPERNICVS,</hi> who yet was
<pb facs="tcp:25151:5"/>
much hindred by wanting fit Inſtruments, ſo that hee could not attaine to his deſire, although he hath more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly rectified the motions than any of his Predeceſſors. Wherefore with conſident modeſty we dare affirme, that our. Parene hath excelled all the Aſtronomers of former ages, in the accurate reſtoring of the motions, and that neyther any King or Prince except <hi>ALPHONSVS,</hi> hath beſtowed ſo much upon Aſtronomy, ſo that he did not onely employ his whole Revenewes, ariſing from his Lands and offices which he held under the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> but alſo of his owne proper ſtocke, he layd out aboue a hundred thouſand Thaleri. But when after the death of this praiſe-worthy King, the charges grew ſo great, that he was almoſt tyred therwith, being ſent for out of his Country by your Maieſties command, he endeavored to make the Tables of the Coeleſtiall motions dedicated to <hi>RVDOLPHVS,</hi> to exceed the Tables of <hi>ALPHONSVS</hi> and <hi>COPERNICVS,</hi> that ſo your Maieſty (having promiſed to helpe him in the charges thereof Aſtronomy might live by your Maieſties liberality, and your Maieſties name might live eternally by Aſtronomy. When having thus intended to doe, God tooke him away both in the middle of his age and Worke, to the great hinderance of Learning, and the loſſe of us his heyres. Now therefore, that we may benefit Poſterity, whereof we ought to have eſpeciall regard, we beſeech your Maiesty by the holy rites of <hi>Vrania</hi> the heavenly Muſe, that you would not in theſe trouble ſome times of Warre, neglect the opportunity of gaining eternall praiſe, by finiſhing thoſe I ables, which albeit they require ſome charge, yet it is a worke that may well beſeeme your Imperiall Maieſty. For as the Poet ſaid, <hi>Sint Maejenates, non dierunt, Flacce, Marones.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:25151:5"/>
So we may ſay, that if we could have ſuch Patrons as <hi>AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTVS, FREDERICK,</hi> and <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Great, there will not be wanting ſuch, who will cheerefully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this labour, and finiſh that which remaineth. Whereby we dare promiſe, that your Maieſtie by rectifying the ſtudy of Aſtronomy, ſhall gaine perpetuall fame and glory, which ſhall continue as long as the Starres endure. And ſo to conclude this our Dedication, wee commend your moſt ſacred Maieſty to the Protection of Almighty God, and our ſelves as beeing the heyres of <hi>TYCHO BRAHE</hi> to your Maieſties protection.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which I intended to deliver to poſterity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the New and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Starre which appeared in the yeare 1572. in the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> and neare unto the Conſtellation of <hi>Caſsiopeae,</hi> I have now finiſhed, and by Gods aſſiſtance (from whom wee acknowledge all things to bee received) brought it to a deſired end. And I thinke that in thoſe things which I have propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and explained, no materiall point is omitted, having taken ſuch paines in finding out the truth and clearing it from the pollutions of error, that all thoſe who underſtand the <hi>Mathematickes,</hi> and will
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:25151:8"/>
conſider of things with a ſincere judgment, ſhall find no occaſion eyther to doubt or contradict.</p>
            <p>But yet to the end that thoſe things which I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to divulge concerning this ſtrange and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull <hi>Starre,</hi> being written according to the Rules of Aſtronomy, and compared with other mens opinions, might attaine to the greater perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; I thought it meet in the former part of this Booke, to intreat of ſome things in generall, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to lay a ground-worke, not onely to the Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this <hi>Starre,</hi> but alſo to the whole Science of <hi>Aſtronomy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore in the firſt two Chapters, we have handled all matters appertaining to the exact rectify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and renewing of the courſe of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>Moone</hi> his Siſter, according to their own motions in the <hi>Heavens.</hi> After this, I have deſcribed no leſſe than eight hundred of the fixed <hi>Starres,</hi> and have aſſigned them their ſeverall places, according to their Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude and Latitude. For by that amiable bright morning and evening <hi>Starre</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> wee have ſet forth by many approved trials, the limits of the fixed <hi>Starres,</hi> in reſpect of the Aequinoctiall points and have added to theſe all the other chiefe <hi>Starres,</hi> which doe appeare neare the <hi>Zodiacke:</hi> and ſo at laſt we diſcended to the rectification of the <hi>Starres</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Conſtellation of <hi>Caſſiopea,</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof, we knew would availe much to our preſent purpoſe. And now albeit, the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance hereof in due manner required more ſtudy and labour, then the unexperienced can judge, who are ready to alledge that I have tooke more paines
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:25151:8"/>
in ſearching out and declaring the nature of this <hi>Starre</hi> according to the fundamentall Rules of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomie,</hi> then indeed was neceſſary. Yet to the end, that ſome ſolid and certaine truth might bee knowne concerning this unuſuall appearance, I thought fit to lay a ſound and firme foundation to build upon, which could not be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the rectification of the courſe of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and the fixed <hi>Starres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that I doubt not, but I ſhall obtaine pardon of thoſe which will conſider things with an equall and favorable judgement; But if I ſeeme to have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped divers matters together, in more ample manner, than the proper attributes of this <hi>Starre</hi> did require, I have done it to that end, that ſo I might profit the whole Art of <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> and might vindicate it from divers faults as occaſion was offered; for which I hope I ſhall rather deſerve thankes, than the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie of thoſe which are ſtudious of this Sublime Science. And moreover this <hi>Starre,</hi> of which I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed chiefly to intreat, albeit it were aſcitious and chanceable; yet becauſe it ſhined forth moſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly, and contrary to the Lawes of Nature, even in the higheſt Firmament, like to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Naturall <hi>Starres,</hi> and ſtood there fixed and immoveable for the ſpace of a whole yeare and more, it ſeemed fit that ſome diligent paines ſhould be taken, in conſidering and unfolding the circumſtances belonging thereunto.</p>
            <p>Beſides, we ſhall alwayes gratefully acknowledge the labour of <hi>Hypparchus;</hi> who with great diligence hath noted out unto us, the places of all the Starres
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:25151:9"/>
which are ſeene in the Eight Sphaere, which hee hath left unto us by his Will, by the occaſion one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of one new Starre which was ſeene in his time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is likely that it was not to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared with that which appeared in our dayes, neither in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, nor ſhining brightneſſe, not yet in the duration, and continuance thereof.</p>
            <p>For albeit, it ſhined without a taile or any ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered beames, (for then it had beene a Comet) yet nevertheleſſe it might be likened to ſome of thoſe appearances, which are beheld in the forme of obſcure ſtarres without any ſtreaming beard at all, and ſo doe exerciſe ſome proper motion, as that did which was ſeene in the yeare 1585. But howſoever, it doth not repent us of our labour which we have beſtowed, according as our time and leyſure would permit us; in aſmuch as we truſt that thoſe things which we have delivered will be much availeable, not onely to point out the due place and poſition of this novell Starre, but alſo of all the other ſtarres in the firmament, and likewiſe for the exact meaſuring of the courſe of the Planets. For if our Anceſtors had uſed that diligence which they ought to have done, in decyphering the motions of the Sunne, and in rectifying the true places of the fixed ſtarres ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Longitude and Latitude, we might then have ſpared that labour, which we beſtowed in the two firſt Chapters, and might preſently have declared thoſe things which concerned the Starre it ſelfe, whoſe deſcription we had undertaken. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I thought it fit to prefixe ſome obſervations concerning the Sunne, the Moone, and the fixed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25151:9"/>
ſtarres; becauſe we ſhall have occaſion to mention them hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now in the other part of this Booke, I have faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and accurately exhibited out of our owne ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, theſe things which properly appertaine to this new Starre, and after that I had declared theſe obſervations which could be gathered eyther by ocular animadverſion, or by the extrinſecall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts thereunto belonging, I have alſo ſet downe the forme and uſe of thoſe Inſtruments, that ſo the certainty thereof might appeare. After this, I demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the very place of the Starre, in reſpect of the Eclipticke, and Equator, and by working of the ſmall diviſions, at laſt reduc'd them into whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And ſo paſſing to the unfolding of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax, I have cleerely prooved by divers invincible reaſons that it had none at all, and that it was exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not onely above the Elementary Region, and the confines of the Moone, but farre beyond the Orbes of the Planets, even to the higheſt Spheare of the fixed ſtarres, and ſo at laſt I have meaſured his true magnitude, and that I might the more truly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it both to the Earth, and to the Celeſtial bodies, I have alſo preſcribed the orders, and quantities of the Planets, and fixed ſtarres, according as they are placed in the Heavens, though ſomewhat different from my Predeceſſors in the ſame kinde.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, in the third Partition, I have compared the opinions of other men concerning this matter, and have examined them by the Touchſtone of truth.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I have ſhewed their conſents, who in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:25151:10"/>
this did agree with us, that this Starre did admit of no Particular; and next their aſſertions, who did attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute unto it ſome diverſitie of aſpect, yet not ſo great as to make it ſublunary. In the third place, I have ſearched out their ſuppoſitions, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined nothing Mathematically concerning it, but have brought in ſome abſurd coniectures farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the truth; namely, that it was not a new Starre, but that it received an accidentall light from ſome of the old Starres, while ſome againe indeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thruſt it out of the Heavens, and to place it nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the Moone, have drawne it downe to the Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall Element. And ſo in the three laſt Chapters, I have weighed their opinions who have eyther come neere unto the truth, or wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it concerning this new Starre, which I have done, that ſo the truth might appeare and ſhine forth, more clearely, and not by flattery to obtaine the favour of any one, by reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their opinions, who have iudged ſomewhat neare the matter, nor yet to enveigh againſt thoſe who have produced ſtrange conceits very wide from the purpoſe; but I have onely tooke care, that the truth might not be violated in any thing, but have endeavoured to ſuppreſſe their boaſting endeavours, who eyther through ignorance, or wilfulneſſe have oppoſed themſelves againſt it, and have openly reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and confuted their erronious opinions. For ſo the truth ſhall bee more eaſily brought to light, not onely by inducing probable conceits, but alſo by removing contrary and erronious ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:25151:10"/>But when I conſider with my ſelfe, how many vaine opinions there have beene concerning this Starre, both in reſpect of his ſcituation and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Earth (when yet they were more eaſie to be found out, in regard of the immobilitie of the Starre, and in that it appeared alwayes aboue the Horizon, than in Commets which are alotted ſome motion) I doe not ſo much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it, ſeeing not onely the motions of the Starres are not hitherto declared in ſuch an accurate manner as is fitting; but alſo, that there doe ſo many queſtions and controverſies ariſe in Philoſophy and Divinity.</p>
            <p>For if that which plainely appeared to the ſight, and might eaſily be meaſured and demonſtrated Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometrically by fit Inſtruments, was yet ſubject to ſo great variety and difference of Iudgements: how much more thoſe things which are not diſcernable by the ſenſes, nor ſubject to humaine induſtry, but are ſo full of doubts and perplexities, that truth (which is alwayes but one, as the center in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie) is very hardly or never found out. Hence ariſes ſo great a confuſion of opinions in every Science, and divers ſeverall queſtions are diſcuſſed, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in naturall Philoſophy, but alſo in Divine and Morall matters, that it is hard to find out, and firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to eſtabliſh any certainty, which may bee equall to Geometricall demonſtrations, or which cannot bee contradicted. Such are the blind apprehenſion of mans nature, and in ſuch a darkneſſe of error doe we ſpend our dayes heere on Earth. And therefore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:25151:11"/>
moved by theſe conſiderations, I have illuſtrated and diſcovered whatſoever I thought did belong to the conſideration of the unuſuall Starre, both by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the true nature thereof, as alſo by detecting the errours of divers and ſundry Writers: Now there remaineth yet two other queſtions to bee unfolded, whereof the one is Phyſicall, concerning the matter and procreation of this Starre; the other Aſtrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, concerning the effects and ſignification thereof, whereof I purpoſed not to intreat ſeriouſly, or by way of iudiciall divination to ſet downe any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this preſent Worke, in as much as they are not ſubiect to the ſenſes nor to any Geometriall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, but are onely grounded upon probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures, and not on Mathematicall Principles: Yet nevertheleſſe, becauſe many doe deſire a Phyſicall and Prognoſticall explanation of this Starre, and are very deſirous to ſee them ſet forth, eſpecially, the latter: therefore for the ſatisfaction of their minds, I will declare my opinion concerning this Starre, but yet with this caution; that thoſe things which I ſhall diſcloſe are not to be compared in reſpect of their indubitable certainty, with that which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded demonſtratively in the former part of my Booke; for theſe Prognoſtick matters are grounded onely upon conjecturall probabilitie. Therefore I will not inſiſt long upon them, but ſpeake of them as briefely as I may; and for this purpoſe I have reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to be handled here in the concluſion of my whole Booke, that ſo I might the more ſparingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of them.</p>
            <p>Therefore, concerning the matter of this adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:25151:11"/>
Starre, that I may firſt give you my opinion, I thinke it was Coeleſtiall, not differing from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the other Starres, but yet in this it did admit of ſome diverſitie, that it was not exalted to ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, nor ſolid compoſition of the parts, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the everlaſting and continuing Starres: and therefore it had no perpetuall duration, as theſe have, but was ſubiect in proceſſe of time to diſſolution; foraſmuch as this Starre could not conſiſt of any ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary matter, ſith that cannot be carried into the higheſt part of the ayre, nor can obtaine there any firme place of abiding. Beſides, this Starre did at the firſt in his magnitude exceed the whole Globe of the Earth, and was three hundred times bigger then the whole circumference thereof, and therefore what ſublunary matter could be ſufficient to the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it?</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, how or whence could it bee framed of Coeleſtiall matter; I anſwere that the Heavens did afford it themſelves, in like manner as the Earth the Sea, and the Ayre; if at any time they exhibite ſome ſtrange ſight, doe produce it out of their owne proper ſubſtance. For although the Heaven it ſelfe be thinne and pervious, giving way to the motion of the Starres without any hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet it is not altogether incorporeall, for then it ſhould be infinite and without place. Therefore the very matter of Heaven, though it be ſubtile, and poſſible to the courſes of the Planets, yet being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted and condenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted into one Globe, and being illuſtrated by the light of the Sunne, might give forme and faſhion to this Starre. Which becauſe it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:25151:12"/>
had not his beginning from the common order of nature, therefore it could not have a continuall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration equall to the reſt; as in like manner, new and monſtrous generations ariſing and compounded out of the Elements cannot long endure. And albeit the large vaſtneſſe of the Coeleſtiall world may afford ſufficient matter for the conformation of any adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Starre, yet there is no where more plenty then neere unto <hi>Vialactea</hi> or the Milkie way, which I ſuppoſe to be a certaine heavenly ſubſtance not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the matter of the other Starres, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, and ſpread abroad, yet not diſtinctly conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in one body, as the Starres are: and hence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture it came to paſſe, that this Starre appeared in the edge of the milkie way, and had the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as the Galaxia hath. Beſides, there is diſcerned a certain marke or ſcarre as it were in that part of the Galaxia, wherein this Starre was ſeated, as in a cleare night when the milkie way is not vailed with cloudes we may eaſily perceive. Which marke or ſcarre I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw before this Starre did ariſe, neither did I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reade of it. But howſoever, the ſubſtance of the milkie Zone is able to ſupply matter for the framing of this Starre, which becauſe it had not attained ſo excellent a conſummation, and ſolid exiſtence, as the genuine and naturall Starres have, therefore it was ſubiect to diſſolution and diſſipation, eyther by its owne nature, or by the multiplicitie of the beames of the Sunne and other Starres.</p>
            <p>Neither is <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> here to be allowed of, who diſapproving of the opinions of others, doth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe bring in no leſſe abſurdities, while hee maketh
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:25151:12"/>
the Galaxia to be a certaine ſublunary concretion attracted and formed out of the Starres which are above it; ſo that it becommeth a Meteor, in the higheſt part of the Ayre, not unlike to the Comets, which he (grounding one abſurdity upon another) ſuppoſeth to be generated there. For if it were ſo, the Milkie way would not have continued in the ſame forme, place, and Magnitude, as it hath done from the beginning of the world. And beſides, other Starres would attaine unto the like Luminous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; And moreover, this Galaxia of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> would then admit of a Paralax, and according to the opticke conſideration, by the ſhining of the fixed Starres through it, it would beget a ſtrange refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, differing from that which is occaſion'd by the vapors that are ſeene about the Horizon, which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome riſeth to the twentieth degree of Altitude, when this proceeding from the <hi>Via lactea</hi> would reach to the greateſt height. All which, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gueſted at, grounding it upon coniecture rather than on the doctrine of the Mathematicks &amp; opticks; and therefore it is no marvell, if he hath endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to baniſh thoſe ſeldome appearing Cornets out of the heaven, and to equall them to ſublunary Meteors, whereby he hath thruſt downe the Galaxi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> beneath the Moone, and hath made it participant of a ſublunary nature. Hence it is, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philoſophers, have ioyned the deſcription and explication of the Galaxia, together with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, becauſe they knew not, the affinity which is betweene, having onely learned by experience, or by the relation of ancient writers, that theſe beamy Starrs
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:25151:13"/>
have their originall and beginning neere to the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie way. Neither can it be a Solaeciſine, in that I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that this new Starre was framed of Coeleſtiall matter, being the ſame whereof the Galaxia and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Starres doe conſiſt, yet not ſo well compacted; when we may diſcerne the like productions in the Earth, which bringeth forth mettals and precious ſtones. Yet though all mettals and Iems have one and the ſame matter, yet all are not concocted and brought to the ſame ſubtility, and maturity by the powerfull working of nature; hence it is, that ſome are ſooner corrupted; others very hardly; ſo that pure gold and ſilver, in reſpect of the homogemly and perfection of their parts, are able to reſiſt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of the fire, without any loſſe or detriment at all, when more imperfect mettals, as Lead and Tinne, are ſoone calcinated into aſhes, or elſe vaniſh into ſmoake; In like manner, this Starre might bee framed of Coeleſtiall marter, although it had not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to ſuch a perfect exiſtence as the naturall Starres; and therefore, it could not with them be able to endure the beames of the Sunne and Starres, and the motion of the Heaven, and with all it was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to a ſucceſſiue alteration, untill at laſt it was quite diſſolu'd. But why this Starre although it had the ſame matter with the Galaxia, which is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to corruption, yet was in time extinct, I wil declare ſome reaſons hereafter. Wherfore having ſpoken ſufficiently of the firſt part, namely of the Phyſicall nature of this Starre, I will now diſcend to give you my coniecturall opinion, concerning the ſignification of this Starre as it did betoken ſome thing that was to come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:25151:13"/>I know there were ſome (otherwiſe learned men) who did hold, that theſe new appearances which are ſometimes ſeene in the Heavens, have no effectuall operation, or ſignification, being (it may be) led un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that opinion, becauſe thoſe things which Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers foretell concerning the effects of ſuch adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious <hi>Starres,</hi> are full of vanity, and doe ſeldome come to paſſe, or prove true in the end. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in my opinion, we ſhould not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all power of Divination, from ſuch admirable and ſtrange appearances, becauſe Aſtrologers cannot by evident demonſtration preſage of their events. But rather, ſuch are to be taxed, who raſhly deliver their uncertaine conjectures; and the weakneſſe of mans judgment, which is ready to wander from the truth is to be pardoned, but we ought not to imagine that God and Nature doth vainely mocke us, with ſuch new formed bodies, which doe preſage nothing to the world. Yet truly the Prognoſtication and fore-knowledge of and concerning ſuch ſtrange ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances in the heavens, is very hard to finde out, and doth oftentimes delude the underſtanding of man, ſeeing we doe not certainly know the influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the other Starres. Whence it may come to paſſe, that <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> which entreateth of the effects of the Starres, may deliver that which is true, as well as <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> which onely declareth their motions and appearances, ſince the cauſe cannot want an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, whether it is to be knowne or not. Neither hath humaine induſtry beene able to ſearch out the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Starres, although they are moſt certain. So that it is leſſe marvaile, that their effects which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:25151:14"/>
are not obvious to the ſenſe ſhould lye ſo deeply hidden, and oftentimes deceive mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>For if there were ever any difficulty in diſcerning, and foretelling the ſignifications of the <hi>Starres,</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this new Starre, which appeared in our age for a whole yeare together, doth require much labour and diligence, in revealing the Portent thereof, and in ſhewing what it might ſignifie.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially, ſince there were never any appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons like unto it, from whence any knowledge might be gathered by the likeneſſe of events, for Arts of divination are not grounded on any Principles, but upon experimentall obſervation. But no apparition like this was ever teſtified by any monument of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, to have beene ſeene and beheld of men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that which <hi>Pliny</hi> mentioneth to have beene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by <hi>Hypparchus,</hi> which in regard it had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion (as wee may gather from the words of <hi>Pliny</hi>) cannot be compared with this new <hi>Star,</hi> which alwayes ſtood fixed in one place. Yet it is probable, that as the <hi>Starre</hi> which <hi>Hypparchus</hi> beheld, did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignifie the declining of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy, and the enlarging of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. So farre, that the whole world ſhould be in ſubjection to this one Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo likewiſe, ſome ſtrange alteration in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like government of Eſtates and Commmon-weales, ſhall enſue in the following yeares. For, as this was a rare and wonderfull <hi>Starre,</hi> ſhining forth in the heavens unexpectedly, ſo it is likely and probable, that it will produce ſtrange, great, and wonderfull effects, but what they ſhall be in particular, I thinke
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:25151:14"/>
no mortall man is able to gueſſe, being as farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from our knowledge, as the riſing of this <hi>Starre</hi> was before it did appeare.</p>
            <p>Yet the forme of it, when it ſhewed it ſelfe from the beginning, ſhining forth with a joviall, cleere, and bright luſtre, doth ſeeme to fore-ſhew a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>able eſtate of humane affaires; but yet the Martiall fiery gliſtering thereof, doth foreſignifie that ſome violence and trouble ſhall be intermingled with it. And beſides, by this joviall figure, it ſeemeth to portend, a great alteration, if not an utter ſubverſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Religion; ſo that thoſe devices which by outward ſhewes and Phariſaicall Hypocriſie, have long time bewitched ignorant people, ſhall now come to their full point and end: and even as this new falſe <hi>Starre</hi> ſhined foorth at the beginning, with a cleare and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable aſpect, but yet at laſt did change in colour, and leſſen in proportion, untill at length it vaniſhed quite away: So thoſe falſe Planets, which by an outward plausible appearance, doe ſeduce and leade men from the light of the truth, ſhall be quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. Alſo, it is worthy of conſideration, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this Starre was ſo neare to the Semicircle of the Colure, that his beames almoſt touched it, yet his whole body was ſeated toward the Vernall Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in reſpect of the Poles of the world, in the middle of the firſt degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> which may ſeeme to declare, that ſome great Light is now at hand, which ſhall enlighten and by degrees expell the former darkneſſe; as the Sunne having paſſed the Vernall poynt of the Aequinoctiall, doth make the day longer than the night, which before had
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:25151:15"/>
the advantage of the day. And as this <hi>Starre</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the higheſt heavens, to the view of the whole world, ſo it is credible, that there ſhall happen a great Cataſtrophe and univerſall change throughout all the chiefe Nations of the Earth, eſpecially thoſe which are ſcituated Northward from the Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall.</p>
            <p>Moreover, foraſmuch as this Starre was placed in the eight Spheare, above the Orbes of the Planets, it ſeemeth that the predictions iſſuing from it, do not only concerne one peculiar tract of Land, but all the Nations of the world; and therefore it will bee the longer before the effects will be declared by ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding events. Which, as they ſhall not begin, untill ſome yeares after the apparition, ſo they ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for a long time afterward. And if wee may take leave to conjecture by Aſtrologicall computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time, concerning the firſt beginning of that which is portended, we may gueſſe it will be nine yeares after the great conjunction, whereof this <hi>Starre</hi> was the <hi>Prodromus</hi> or fore-runner. If therefore wee frame our Aſtrologicall direction by the place of this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>junction which was in the one and twentieth degree of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> the events of this Starre ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſhew themſelves, nine yeares after this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. And when this is finiſhed, in the yeare of Chriſt 1583. and in the latter end of the Moneth of Aprill, the confirmation and end of this Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all progreſſion to the place of the new Starre, will fall out in the yeare 1592. when the third Septinary of yeares after the firſt appearing of the <hi>Starre</hi> ſhall be accompliſhed. And thoſe Noble <hi>Heroes</hi> which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:25151:15"/>
ſhall happen to be borne at the firſt riſing of this <hi>Starre,</hi> being ordained to be the Authors and atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of thoſe great mutations, ſhall about that time come to full ripeneſſe of age, that they may be fit and able for the performance of ſuch great enterpriſes, and for the reducing of theſe Predictions into act. And in the fourth Septenary of yeares, when they have attained to their chiefe ſtrength, they ſhall make the truth of theſe conjectures appeare moſt plainly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if we take our direction by comparing the place of this Conjunction from the Zodiacke, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the Eclipticke, unto the place of this new <hi>Starre,</hi> then it is likely that the force and influence of this <hi>Starre,</hi> will chiefly ſhew it ſelfe in the yeare of our Lord 1632. for all the ſignifications of this <hi>Star</hi> doe depend on the Trigonall revolution and tanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of the Planets. And therefore if this rbee the ſeventh revolution of the Planets, the firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was in the dayes of <hi>Enoch,</hi> the ſecond in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, and at the Vniverſall Deluge, the third in the dayes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the people were freed from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſervitude, the fourth in the dayes of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the fift in the time of <hi>Christs</hi> Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was at the higheſt, and the ſixt in the dayes of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, when the Empire was tranſlated to the <hi>Germanes,</hi> this laſt and ſeventh, is as it were the Sabbath to all the reſt, and doth foreſhew ſomething of greater conſequence than all the former, wherein it is worthy of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that all the trigonall revolutions, as the firſt, third, and fift, were very profitable and advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the world; and ſo it is not unlikely that this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:25151:16"/>
ſeventh revolution being an unequall number, doth point out and fore-ſignifie the happy eſtate of things which is to come. Neyther doth this conjecture dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Propheſies of wiſe men which were illuminated with divine knowledge, who have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that before the univerſall conſummation &amp; end of all things, there ſhall be a peaceable and quiet age, wherein the divers formes of Religions and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike government, ſhall be changed and be made agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and conformable to the will of God. Which aſſertion we may collect out of the Prophets, who did fore-tell, that at laſt there ſhould be a golden age; In which <hi>they ſhall breake their ſwords into Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their ſpeares into pruning-hookes, Nation ſhall not life up a ſword against Nation, neither ſhall they learne Warre any more: But they ſhall ſit every man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Vine, and vnder his Fig-tree, and none ſhall make them afraid:</hi> As the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> hath it. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. And <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> 11. doth foretell of it, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>The Woolfe alſo ſhall dwell with the Lambe, and the Leopard ſhall lye downe with the Kid, and the Calfe and the young Lyon, and the Fatling together, and a little Childe ſhall leade them, and the Cow and the Beare ſhall feed; their young ones ſhall lye downe together: and the Lyon ſhall eate ſtraw like an Oxe. And the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king child ſhall play on the hole of the Aſpe, and the weaned child ſhall put his hand on the Cockatrice Den, they ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy mountaine: for the Earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo, in the ſixty Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſpeaking of the myſticall Hieruſalem, and perfect ſtate of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:25151:16"/>
he ſaith, <hi>For braſſe I will bring gold, and for yron I will bring ſilver, and for wood braſſe, and for ſtones yron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will alſo make thy Officers peace, and thine exactor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Righteouſneſſe: Violence ſhall no more be heard in thy land, waſting nor deſtruction within thy borders, but thou ſhalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates praiſe;</hi> &amp; at length he concluded thus; for, <hi>I the Lord will haſten it in his time.</hi> Beſides, many other places are found both in the Prophets, and the Revelation, which doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe this unexpected happineſſe. Therefore that this Propheſie may be fulfilled, which was delivered by divine inſpiration, it muſt needs come to paſſe, even before the end and conſummation of the world. But ſeeing the event of theſe things ſhall come to paſſe in the new revolution of the Planets, before which this Starre appeared, ſome doe ſuppoſe, that the light of Religion doth now ſhine out cleerely having over come the darknes of Error; but if it were ſo, whence are then thoſe Controverſies, and varieties of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are defended by Learned men; inſomuch that the warre of Pennes, is more dangerous than that of Swords. Truely, it is rather to bee feared, leaſt wee take this dawning and breake of day, to be the cleere noone-light. Therefore, I ſuppoſe that this Starre doth ſignifie, that there ſhall be a new change both in Religion, and the eſtate of humaine affaires. <hi>Ventum ad ſupremum est patientur ſumma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ruinam, qui Deus in Coelis regit &amp; reget omnia terris.</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>Wee are come now to the higheſt perfection, the power of Antichriſt and the Pope ſhall decay and bee brought to ruine, and GOD who ruleth in Heaven ſhall rule all thinges on Earth.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:25151:17"/>But if any doe obiect, that the end of the world is at hand, and that therefore there will not be ſufficient time to bring about a new Change. I anſwere, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth aſſure us, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed into the Church, before the finall conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the world, which (by humaine coniecture) muſt needs require ſome time before, they being ſcattered over the whole face of the Earth, ſhall be gathered into one Nation. Yet I thinke it not unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to admoniſh and ſtirre up the mindes of men to thinke upon the end of the world, that ſo they may remember the Eternity which ſhall follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. But yet it is impoſſible to limit and ſet forth a certaine time for the conſummation of the world, which only dependeth upon the good-will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, and is not reuealed to the Angels, and therfore ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be knowne by any humain preſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if ſome doe ſuppoſe, that the tract of Hand to which this Starre was verticall, is ominous aboue the reſt, as if from thence the occaſion and author of ſo great mutations are to bee expected, we muſt then chuſe out thoſe parts of the Earth, which had the new Starre in their Meridian at the time of the new Moone next following, which fel out, accounting the time by our Meridian, upon the fifteenth of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſeaven houres, thirteene minutes ⅔. in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone; to which if we apply, the latitude or diſtance from the Equinoctiall agreeable to the declination of the Starre which was in 61. ¾. ſo that the place on the Earth anſwerable thereunto, muſt needs be <hi>Ruſsia</hi> or <hi>Moſchovia,</hi> eſpecially that part thereof which is ioyned unto <hi>Finland;</hi> for in that tract of Earth this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:25151:17"/>
new Starre in the new Moone following, was in their Zenith, and iuſt over their heads, where it ſtood equally diſtant from the Horizon, and with a right angled aſpect beheld this Countrey. Therefore, if this poſition of the Starre doe point out the place of the Earth, from whence theſe events ſhall ariſe, <hi>Moſchovia</hi> ſeemes eſpecially to be deſigned, before any other Regions, which are ſcituated towards the North, to whom this new Starre was every day Verticall. Whither therefore, the firſt occaſions of ſo great diſturbances and mutations ſhall ariſe from hence which afterward ſhall be ſowed and diſperſed into other parts of the world, I leave it to be decided by others. Truely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Gogus,</hi> whereof mention is made in the eight and thirtieth Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and to whom <hi>Eſay</hi> Chapter 17. 56. and <hi>Micha</hi> Chap. 5. doe allude, and with whom <hi>Magog</hi> is named in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> Chap. 20. may be rightly underſtood of the <hi>Mſochovite,</hi> as <hi>Caſtellio</hi> hath interpreted it in the 38. and 39. of <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> That <hi>Gog</hi> ſhould be the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> and <hi>Iberians,</hi> becauſe the old tranſlation reades it, that he ſhould <hi>be the Prince of Moſoch; and Thubal.</hi> For ſeeing the Hebrewes reade it <hi>Meſech,</hi> and the Greekes and Latine interpreters doe reade it <hi>Moſoch,</hi> it is probable that the <hi>Moſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> are ſignified heereby; or elſe by this name, the whole Northerne tract of Earth is included. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very likely, that <hi>Moſchovia</hi> is principally denoted by this Starre, and <hi>Gogus</hi> the leader of the <hi>Moſchovites,</hi> of whom it is foretold in the Prophets and the Revelation, who having made great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Europe, hee at laſt with his whole army ſhall
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:25151:18"/>
be overthrowne, and ſo the Earth ſhall be disburthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of her wicked inhabitants. For it is probable, that there muſt be a great clenſing and extirpation of all Earthly impurities, before that peaceable and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie age (whereof the Prophets have ſpoken) ſhall come, but to ſhew the particular manner thereof is above humaine knowledge; wee purpoſe onely to make ſome coniectures in generall, for the event will ſhew it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Moreover, becauſe a certaine ancient Propheſie of Sibylla <hi>Tiburtina,</hi> which was found in the yeare 1520. in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> engraven in a Marble ſtone in old latine Characters, which was diſcovered by the force of the water waſhing away the earth, may be fitly applyed to this Starre, I will heere inſert it and ioyne it to our coniectures, for it is worthy of obſervation, beeing recited by <hi>Cornelius Gemma</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>Supernaturall Apparitions,</hi> in theſe words.</p>

            <p>There were divers expoſitions of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, at that time when it was firſt found out, ſome interpreting it of CHARLES the Fift, others drew the meaning of it to PHILIP King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and ſome thought that the King of <hi>France</hi> was meant thereby; but I thinke, that it doth rather point out thoſe <hi>Iberi,</hi> which inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite Northward toward <hi>Moſchovia.</hi> So that this Oracle of <hi>Sibilla Tiburtina,</hi> did not denote the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but thoſe <hi>Iberians,</hi> which are neare unto the <hi>Moſchovites;</hi> eſpecially, when ſhe uſeth theſe words; <hi>Supra Iberos ad magnam Septen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trionis domum:</hi> Over the <hi>Iberi</hi> at the great houſe of the North.

the North.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, ſome of the other <hi>Sybils,</hi> have propheſied concerning <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> who ſhould come in the latter times, and have expreſly foretold of the riſing of this <hi>Starre,</hi> and among the reſt <hi>Sybil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Babilonica,</hi> thus ſaith:</p>

            <p>What can be more evident, concerning this cleere Starre which was beheld in our time, for that was more bright and ſhining than any of the reſt, and was round in forme like unto a Crowne, having no beames right ſhooting from it as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets have, beſides it continued for a whole yeare and kept his Station in the Firmament with the other <hi>Starres.</hi> And therefore, this <hi>Sybilline</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, doth fitly deſcribe the forme, light, ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, duration, and conſumption of this Starre, as if it had beene then ſeene.

            <p>Behold, how iuſtly we doth limit out the time betweene the apparition of this new Starre, and the Comet following; for there were almoſt foure yeares betweene the vaniſhing of this new Starre and the riſing of the Comet which follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. And by the Sea ſhore, meaneth the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne Ocean, for in this part of the world, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the ſetting of the Sunne, this Comet was ſeene; thoſe who would know more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe predictions, let them reade the bookes of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> in which it doth appeare, that there ſhall bea Cataſtrophe and change of things before the vniverſall conſummation of the world. Yet in what order things ſhall come to paſſe, it is hard to gueſſe, either by the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Starre, or by the Sybilline Oracles, or by Divine Propheſies. But yet is likely, that thoſe happy times ſhall not preceed, but follow after a more troubleſome time; even as this Starre at the firſt, did ſhine with a bright and cleare

luſtre and with a Ioviall light, but afterward did aſſume a Martiall ſparkling colour, as may bee gathered out of the words of the ſame <hi>Sybilla.</hi>

               <l>And God who dwelleth in the Heavens ſhall then</l>
               <l>Save the remainder of the Sonnes of men,</l>
               <l>Then Peace and knowledge of the truth ſhall flouriſh</l>
               <l>The Earth her plentious fruits ſhall likewiſe cheriſh</l>
               <l>It ſhall not bee devided as before</l>
               <l>Nor to the plough be ſubiect any more.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Which alſo, the holy Prophets doe ſeeme to intimate, who foretell that the happy &amp; peaceable eſtate of the Church, ſhall be after the deſtruction of this <hi>Gogus.</hi> But I thinke it not fit, to proceed any further in unfolding theſe myſteries, having promiſed to handle them ſparingly; as alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that theſe Propheſies, are not to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by humaine coniecture, neither can be Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricially demonſtrated, as thoſe matters which belong to the knowledge of <hi>Aſtronomie.</hi> And ſo leaving theſe my coniectures, to the conſideration of the Reader: I will heere leave of to entreat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further concerning this Starre.</p>
