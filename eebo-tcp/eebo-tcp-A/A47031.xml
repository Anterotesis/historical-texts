            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Matth. ix. xxxvi, xxxvii, xxxviii.</bibl>
               <q>When Jeſus ſaw the Multitudes, he was moved with Compaſſion
on them, becauſe they fainted, and were ſcattered abroad, as
Sheep having no Shepherd. Then ſaith he unto his Diſciples,
the Harveſt truly is Plenteous, but the Labourers are Few.
Pray ye therefore the Lord of the Harvest, that he will
ſend forth Labourers into his Harveſt.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>NExt Lords-day is Ordination-day, That Day upon
which Learned and Religious Men are to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
Prieſts and Deacons; And next Week is Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-week;
That Week which is Emphatically called
a Week of Embers or Aſhes. For, theſe two Words do only
ſignifie one and the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>And the Reaſon why this Week is thus called, is this, The
Church hath commanded us to Faſt and to Pray upon three
days in this Week, <hi>That God would be pleaſed to give us ſuch
Ministers, as are both Willing and Able, both by their Life and
Doctrine, to ſet forth his Glory, and to ſet forward the Salvation
of all Men.</hi> And theſe three Days have been heretofore ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kept by holy Men and Women, that they covered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with Sackcloath and Aſhes, and ate nothing till Night,
nor then neither, ſave only a Cake baked under the Embers;
which was therefore called Ember-bread. And from this ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſeverity which was formerly uſed upon the three
Faſting-days in this Week, the whole Week came to be called
Ember-week.</p>
            <p>And the Reaſon of all this ſtrictneſs and ſeverity upon this
Occaſion, is this, When men do Faſt from Meat, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95052:5"/>
themſelves to be Unworthy of the leaſt Crumb of that
Meat they Faſt from. And when they do, in the time of their
Faſting, cover themſelves with Sackcloath, they acknowledge
That to be far better than they deſerve. They call to mind,
that their Cloathing is only the effect of their Nakedneſs; and
that their Nakedneſs is only the effect of their Sin: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they are reſolved not to be Proud of thoſe Cloaths, which
ought to Humble them with the thoughts of their firſt Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
and to put them in mind of thoſe tatter'd Rags they are
Now Cloathed with, inſtead of that Glorious Robe of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
which they Once had in Paradiſe. When men do caſt
Embers, and ſprinkle Aſhes upon their Heads, they publickly
tell God, that their Sins are ſo Many, and ſo great, that they
deſerve nothing, but Death; they deſerve nothing, but to have
Thoſe dreadful Words, <hi>in the Office for the Burial of the Dead,</hi>
conſtantly ſounding in their Ears, <hi>Earth to Earth, Aſhes to
Aſhes, and Duſt to Duſt.</hi> And when men do thus Openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declare
their inward Sorrow of Heart, by theſe and the like
outward ſigns of Faſting and Mortification, they mightily move
both God and Man to have Mercy upon them. <hi>For, when the
Servants of Ben-hadad King of Syria, girded Sackcloath on their
Loins, and put Ropes on their Heads,</hi> and preſented themſelves
to <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in that humble and miſerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he could not chuſe but have Pity upon him, <hi>though
God had appointed him to utter Destruction, and though he and
his people were to loſe their Lives, for ſaving him and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from Death,</hi> 1 Kings 20. 32, 42. Yea, and that very ſame <hi>Ahab,
by Humbling himſelf with Faſting in Sackcloath and Aſhes,</hi> moved
God to take away from him one of the greateſt temporal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that ever was threatned againſt a mortal Man, 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
21, 17. with the following Verſes to the end of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>And here now, let no Proud Sinner, that deſpiſeth the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of God's Word, imagine, that the day appointed for
the Ordination of Prieſts and Deacons, is not of to great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to the Nation, that it ought to be kept with ſo much
Strictneſs and Solemnity: Let no Graceleſs Perſon think ſo ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95052:5"/>
of Ember-week and Ordination-day: <hi>For, the Apoſtles
thought themſelves bound, to Ordain no Elders in any Church,
without the Solemnity of a Faſt,</hi> Acts 14, 23. <hi>And Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
before he entered upon his Miniſterial Office, Faſted forty
days and forty nights,</hi> Matth. 4. 2, 17. And if Faſting, and
ſo long Faſting, was Neceſſary to fit and prepare Chriſt for the
Miniſtry, how much more Neceſſary is it to fit and prepare
Us for it, who are Infinitly ſhort of his Divine Perfections?</p>
            <p>And thus I have ſhewn you, what is meant by Ordination-day,
and what is meant by Ember-week. And that you may
all keep them, as they ought to be kept, I have purpoſely pitch'd
upon theſe Words, <hi>which are the Goſpel for the Ordination of Priests,</hi>
as being moſt proper for this Great Occaſion, and our moſt
Serious Meditation upon it. <hi>When Jeſus ſaw the Multitudes, he
was moved with Compaſſion on them, becauſe they fainted, and
were ſcattered abroad, as Sheep having no Shepherd. Then ſaith
he unto his Diſciples, The Harveſt truly is Plenteous, but the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
are Few: Pray ye therefore the Lord of the Harveſt,
that he will ſend forth Labourers into his Harvest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words there are ſeveral Doctrines: But I can, at
preſent, only Inſiſt upon this One.</p>
            <p>Though there be a great many Ministers in a City or Country;
yet, the Common People may be ready to Faint, and to Periſh for
want of Knowledge; for want of Plain, Affectionate, Practical, and
Scripture Preaching: Yea, and their Caſe may be ſo deſperately
Bad, that nothing but a Company of poor ſilly Sheep ſcatter'd abroad
without a Sheperd, can poſſibly repreſent their deplorable Condition.</p>
            <p>And the Reaſons, which prove this Doctrine, are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There were a great many Scribes, and Phariſees, and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
in our Saviour's time. For, he denounced more Woes, and
greater Curſes againſt Them, than againſt all others; becauſe
They were more againſt Him and his Goſpel, than all others
were, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. throughout the Chapter. And yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
there were ſo many Miniſters, and Doctors, and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of the Law at that time, the Text tells us, <hi>The Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
were Few.</hi> Few of them all would Labour in the Harveſt;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95052:6"/>
and Feed the Flock of the Lord. And therefore, <hi>The Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
Fainted.</hi> Or, as the Margine of the Bible has it, <hi>They
were Tired,</hi> by going ſo far to hear an Awakening Preacher,
and they <hi>Lay down</hi> for Wearineſs, <hi>and they were ſcattered abroad,
as Sheep having no Shepherd.</hi> And what was their Caſe then, may,
for any thing we know, be the Caſe of ſeveral Thouſands and
Millions at this preſent time: For, <hi>The thing that hath been, it
is that which ſhall be; and that which is done, is that which
ſhall be done: And there is no New thing under the Sun,</hi> Eccl. 1. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Scripture tells us of ſome, <hi>who ought to be
Teachers,</hi> but in Truth, <hi>have need to be Taught themſelves the
very first Principles of the Oracles of God,</hi> Heb. 5. 12. They
ſet up for Preachers, before they well underſtand their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm;
<hi>That Form of Doctrine, that Form of Sound Words,
and that Form of Knowledge and Truth,</hi> which they ought to be
firſt Inſtructed in. For ſays the Prophet, <hi>Iſa. 56. 10. 11. His
Watchmen and his Shepherds are Blind; they are all Ignorant;
they are all Dumb Dogs; they cannot Bark, they cannot Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</hi>
And if poor Ignorant people have ſuch an <hi>Ignorant</hi> Man
for their Miniſter, muſt they not, without a Miracle, neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Periſh for want of Knowledge? For, how can the Blind
lead the Blind? Or how can the Dumb ſpeak to the Deaf?
Or how can the Ignorant Guide Teach his people Knowledge?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Scripture tells us of others, who, though they
are Learned enough, and Able enough to Preach to their People;
yet, they are not <hi>Willing</hi> enough to do it. They are Idle and
Lazy; <hi>they put their Candle under a Buſhel; they hide their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in a Napkin;</hi> and they keep their Learning to themſelves,
as a ſtingy Miſer does his Gold, and no man is ever the better
for it. For ſays the Prophet, <hi>Iſai. 56. 10. They Sleep, they Lie
down, they love to Slumber.</hi> And this Character did not only
belong to ſome few of them: For, it is there ſaid, they <hi>All</hi> did
ſo: That is, the Generality and the greateſt part of them did
ſo. And if poor Ignorant people have ſuch an <hi>Idle</hi> Man for
their Miniſter, muſt they not, without a Miracle, Neceſſarily
Periſh for want of Knowledge? For, what matter is it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95052:6"/>
a Man ſtarve for want of Money to buy him Meat, or for
want of a Heart to uſe his Money for his neceſſary Support?
And, what Matter is it, whether a mans Guide be <hi>Ignorant and
cannot;</hi> or whether he be <hi>Learned, and will not</hi> ſhew him the
way to Heaven?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Scripture tells us of others, who, though they
are neither Ignorant nor Idle; but, very Learned, and very La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious:
Yet they are <hi>Covetous</hi> and <hi>Voluptuous.</hi> They uſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Learning nor their Labour in Preaching to their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but in ſeeking what they have, and in getting it away
from them. They ſeek not Them, but Theirs; not their Souls,
but their Riches. Their whole Buſineſs is only, <hi>to Devour
Widows Houſes, and to Turn the Houſe of God into a Den of
Thieves.</hi> For ſays the Prophet, <hi>Iſa. 56. 11. They are Greedy
Dogs, which can never have enough; they all look to their own
Way, every one for his Gain from his Quarter.</hi> And that you
may know, what they do with all that they thus <hi>Covetouſly</hi>
ſcrape together, their <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> follows in the next words;
they beſtow it all upon their Luſts, upon their filthy Pleaſure.
For, it is there ſaid of them, <hi>verſe 12. Come ye, ſay they, I will
fetch Wine, and we will fill our ſelves with Strong drink, and to
Morrow ſhall be as this Day, and much more abundant.</hi> And that
you may not think, that this one Prophet only met with bad
Miniſters, hear what is written, <hi>Ezek. 34. 2, 3, 4. Woe be to
the Shepherds of Iſrael, that feed themſelves, that eat the Fat,
and cloath them with the Wool, and kill them that are Fed; but,
Feed not the Flock, but Rule them with Force and Cruelty.</hi> And
that you may not think, that this was only the Character of
ſome few of them, it is there added, <hi>ver. 5, 6. There was no
Shepherd; but, all the Sheep, and all the Flocks, were ſcattered
upon all the Face of the Earth: And None,</hi> mark it, not One,
<hi>did Search or Seek after them.</hi> And therefore, this dreadful
Curſe is denounced againſt them, <hi>Zech. 11. 17. Woe to the Idol
Shepherd.</hi> That is, that Man who pretends to be a Shepherd,
but is no more a Shepherd, than an Idol, which pretends to be
God, is God. <hi>Woe to the Idol Shepherd, that leaveth the Flock</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95052:7"/>
to the Care of a Hireling: <hi>The Sword ſhall be upon his Arm, and
upon his right Eye; his Arm ſhall be clean dryed up, and his right
Eye ſhall be utterly darkned.</hi> Mark this as long as you live.
<hi>A Miniſter that does not look after his Pariſh in his own Perſon,
but leaves it to the Care of a Hireling, is not really a Miniſter;
but, he is an Idol.</hi> For, he has a <hi>Mouth</hi> indeed; but, <hi>he ſpeaks
not a Word in Seaſon</hi> to the Souls of his People: He has <hi>Eyes;</hi>
but, he <hi>Sees</hi> not their Straits and Neceſſities: He has <hi>Ears;</hi>
but, he <hi>Hears not</hi> their Groans and Complaints for Bread: And
he has <hi>Feet;</hi> but, he <hi>Walks not</hi> to Viſit them upon their Sick
or Death-Beds: And his Puniſhment for this is very Severe
and Terrible. For, <hi>the Sword ſhall be upon his Arm, and upon
his right Eye: His Arm ſhall be clean dryed up, and his right
Eye ſhall be utterly darkned.</hi> And when all this is come upon
thee; what? Oh what wilt thou be the better for all that thou
haſt gotten by thy <hi>Pluralities</hi> and <hi>Non-Reſidence!</hi> What! Oh
what will thy Money then avail thee, when <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>It</hi> muſt
periſh both together! And if poor Ignorant People have ſuch
a <hi>Covetous</hi> and <hi>Voluptuous</hi> Man for their Miniſter, muſt they
not, without a Miracle, neceſſarily periſh for want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?
For, how can a <hi>Covetous</hi> Man, whoſe God is his Gold,
Preach againſt <hi>the Love of Money, which is the Root of all Evil?</hi>
Or how can a <hi>Voluptuous</hi> Man, <hi>whoſe God is his Belly,</hi> Preach
for Faſting, Self-denial and Mortification? Or if he does; yet,
how can any one that hears him, believe a word of what he
ſays, when that may be juſtly ſaid to him, which was unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Numb. 16. 14. <hi>Wilt thou put out the Eyes of
theſe Men,</hi> by Preaching that to them, which thou thy Self
wilt not practice; and by <hi>binding heavy Burthens, and grievous
to be born, and laying them on their Shoulders, but thou thy ſelf
wilt not move them with one of thy Fingers? Matth.</hi> 23. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Scripture tells us of others, who, though they
are neither Ignorant, nor Idle, nor Covetous, nor Voluptuous;
yet, they are <hi>Proud. They love the Praiſe of Men, more than the
Praiſe of God; they love to be called Rabbi; they love the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Rooms at Feaſts, and the chief Seats in the Synagogues, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95052:7"/>
Greetings in the Markets.</hi> They ſcorn ſuch a poor place, as
<hi>Nazareth</hi> or <hi>Galilee;</hi> they muſt needs be at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and
preach at Court, where they may be moſt ſeen of Men. They
think it below them to Feed God's Lambs, to Catechize little
Children, to Conceal their Learning, and to ſpeak ſo plain, that
the moſt Ignorant Men and Women may underſtand and profit
by them. They think that preaching the Law, which is to
<hi>Convince Men of Sin, and to humble them for it,</hi> can never work
upon Gentlemen, which are only to be wrought upon by eaſier
and gentler Methods. That is, in plain Engliſh, by <hi>ſmooth and
flattering Words.</hi> They think that preaching of <hi>Election, Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Juſtification, Adoption and Sanctification,</hi> is nothing elſe but
ſo much <hi>Spiritual Cant.</hi> And indeed, <hi>They think no Preaching
is good for any thing, but that which is really good for nothing:
That which is High and Lofty, Quaint or Witty, Scholaſtical or
Controverſial, and above the Reach of ordinary Capacities.</hi> And
therefore, our Saviour makes it as great a Miracle, and as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Sign of the True <hi>Meſſias, that the Poor had the Goſpel
preached unto them,</hi> as that the Blind ſaw, the Lame walked,
the Deaf heard, the Lepers were cleanſed, and the Dead were
raiſed up from Death to Life, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 5. And if poor Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
People have ſuch a <hi>Proud</hi> Man for their Miniſter, muſt
they not, without a Miracle, neceſſarily periſh for want of
Knowledge? For, if an Archer does always ſhoot above the Mark,
can he ever Hit it? And if a Miniſter does always preach above
the Capacity of his Hearers, can he ever Teach them Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?
Is it not all one, as if he ſpoke to them in an <hi>Vnknown
Tongue,</hi> and were altogether a <hi>Barbarian</hi> unto them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Scripture tells us of others, who, though they
are neither Ignorant, nor Idle, nor Covetous, nor Voluptuous,
nor Proud: Yet, they are <hi>Deceitful; They handle the Word of
God deceitfully;</hi> they Deceive God's people, by preaching that
to them for God's Word, which is not really <hi>His,</hi> but their
<hi>Own;</hi> they preach to them the <hi>Inticing Words of Mans Wiſdom,</hi>
inſtead of the <hi>Sincere Milk of the Word;</hi> they ſhew them the
<hi>Form,</hi> and not the <hi>Power of Godlineſs;</hi> they Feed them with Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95052:8"/>
and Shadows, inſtead of Subſtantial and Fundamental
Truths; <hi>They puff them up with Science falſly ſo called,</hi> inſtead of
<hi>the Simplicity of the Goſpel; they ſpoil them thro' Phyloſophy and
vain Deceit, after the Tradition of Men, after the Rudiments of
the World, and not after Chriſt; They Teach them for Doctrines
the Commandments of Men; yea, they Teach them the very Doctrines
of Devils, Matth.</hi> 15. 9. compared with <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 8. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4. 1. And by this means, all true Goſpel-preaching is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places much neglected; and in ſome places it is almoſt
wholly loſt. And if poor Ignorant people have ſuch a <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Handler and Corrupter of God's Word</hi> for their Miniſter, muſt
they not, without a Miracle, neceſſarily periſh for want of
Knowledge? For, how can a Man poſſibly ſubſiſt, if he has
only a Stone for Bread, a Scorpion for an Egg, and a Cup of
poiſon for the Blood of the Grape?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The Scripture tells us of Others, who, tho' they
are neither Ignorant, nor Idle, nor Covetous, nor Voluptuous,
nor Proud, nor Deceitful; yet, they are <hi>far Worſe</hi> than all theſe.
For ſays our Saviour, <hi>Matt. 23. 13. Wo unto you Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,
Hypocrites. For, ye ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven against
Men. Ye neither go into it your ſelves, neither ſuffer ye them that are
entring to go in.</hi> And then it follows, <hi>ver. 15. Ye compaſs Sea
and Land to make one Proſelyte, and when he is made, ye make
him twofold more the Child of Hell than your ſelves.</hi> They would
neither be good Themſelves, nor ſuffer Others to be ſo. They
would neither Preach Themſelves, nor ſuffer Chriſt and his
Apoſtles to Preach to the People, that were ready to Periſh
for want of a Plain and a Searching Preacher. They were like
thoſe two Prieſts, <hi>Hophni and Phinehas,</hi> who would neither be
Chaſt Themſelves, nor ſuffer Others to be ſo, but <hi>lay with the
Women that Aſſembled at the Door of the Tabernacle of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi>
1 Sam. 2. 22. They were like <hi>Ahab and Zedekiah,</hi>
thoſe two other Prieſts, who would neither be Chaſt Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
nor ſuffer Others to be ſo, but <hi>were Roasted in the Fire
by the King of Babylon, for committing Adultery with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Wives,</hi> Jerem. 29. 22, 23. And they were like thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95052:8"/>
Ungodly Prieſts and people of the Jews, who <hi>Perſecuted
St. Paul, and forbid him to Preach to the Gentiles, that they might
be Saved, to fill up their Sins alway. For, the Wrath of God is
come upon them to the uttermost,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 15, 16. Mark this
all of you as long as you Live: <hi>If a Miniſter refuſes to Preach
himſelf, and forbids others to Preach; it is a certain Sign, that he
is come to the Height of Wickedneſs, and has filled up the full
meaſure of all his Sins, and the Wrath of God is come upon him
to the uttermost.</hi> And yet, there were not only ſome few of
the Clergy, that were then thus Notoriouſly Wicked. For
our Saviour lays it to the Charge of all the Scribes, and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,
and Preachers of the Law in his time. And they all
were ſo far from Denying that Charge, that they Gloried, and
Boaſted in it. For ſay they to the Officers, that would not be
ſo bad as they would have them be, by Apprehending Chriſt,
and bringing him Bound to them, <hi>Are ye alſo Deceived? Have
any of the Rulers, or of Phariſees believed on him? But, this People,
who knoweth not the Law, are Curſed,</hi> John 7. 47, 48, 49. And
if poor Ignorant people have ſuch men as theſe for their
Miniſters, muſt they not, without a Miracle, Neceſſarily periſh
for want of Knowledge? For, how can they poſſibly learn any
True and Saving Knowledge, <hi>when their Ministers Curſe them
for believing on Chriſt,</hi> and Damn them to the pit of Hell, for
refuſing to be as Bad as they would make them? That is,
<hi>twofold more the Children of Hell than themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus I have Proved out of God's own Word,</hi> without any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of my own Head; <hi>by plain and expreſs Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that,</hi> Though there be a great many Miniſters in a City or
Country; yet, the Common People may be ready to Faint and to
Periſh for want of Knowledge; for want of Plain, Affectionate,
Practical, and Scripture-Preaching: Yea, and their Caſe may be
ſo deſperately. Bad, that nothing, but a Company of poor Silly Sheep
ſcattered abroad without a Shepherd, can poſſibly repreſent their
deplorable Condition. <hi>And that is the Doctrine with its Proof.
The Uſe of it is this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:95052:9"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Holy Ghoſt has Cauſed the Faults of God's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
to be written in Scripture: And therefore, We that are
the Preachers of God's Word, are bound in Conſcience to
preach againſt thoſe Miniſterial Faults, in our Sermons before
the Clergy: Eſpecially, upon ſuch publick Occaſions, as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-week
and Ordination-day; that ſo, we may all be called
upon, and ſtirred up to the better Performance of our Duty.
For, thus did the Prophets in the Old Teſtament, as is plain
from <hi>Mal. 2. 1, 2. O ye Prieſts, this Commandment is for You: If
ye will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give Glory
unto my Name, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts; I will even ſend a Curſe
upon you, and I will Curſe your Bleſſings: Yea, I have Curſed them
already, becauſe Ye do not lay it to heart.</hi> And thus did Chriſt
himſelf in the New Teſtament, as is plain from <hi>Matthew</hi> 23.
throughout the Chapter; Where he does Rebuke the
Faults of the Jewiſh Clergy ſo ſharply, and does denounce ſo
many Woes and Curſes againſt them, as are enough to make
a Man's Heart to ake, and to break in pieces, when he only
hears them Read. And therefore, if there be a Miniſter here
preſent, that Hates him that tells him of his Faults, <hi>in God's
Name, out of God's Word, and by God's Authority:</hi> Then, thou
Hateſt the Holy Ghoſt, that commands him to do ſo: Thou
Hateſt the Prophets, that did ſo: Thou Hateſt Chriſt himſelf,
that did ſo too: And Thou Hateſt good Old <hi>Eli,</hi> that ſtrictly
charged and commanded <hi>Samuel</hi> to do ſo to him, upon pain
of Damnation, 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 3. 17. If there be a Miniſter here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
that Hates him that Thus tells him of his Faults; Then
thou art worſe than the common People, that deſir'd St. <hi>John
Baptiſt</hi> to do ſo to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 10. Thou art worſe than the
common Souldiers, that deſir'd him to do ſo to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.
Thou art worſe than the Publicans and Sinners, that deſir'd him
to do ſo to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Thou art worſe than a Heathen, an
Infidel, a <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> that highly rewarded the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi>
for doing ſo to him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 25. with the following Verſes.
Yea, and in one word, Thou art worſe than the very brute
Beaſts that Periſh. And therefore, the Holy Ghoſt calls thee a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95052:9"/>
               <hi>Bruitiſh Paſtor, Jerem.</hi> 10. 21. And he gives thee the Reaſon
for it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 1. Becauſe, <hi>He that Hateth Reproof is Brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh.</hi>
For, he does like a Bruit, that <hi>kicks againſt the Pricks, and
kicks against the Goad,</hi> that ſtrikes him. He hates to be Reprov'd,
and he flies into his Reprovers Face, and he does him a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
if he can. And how then canſt Thou pretend to be a
Miniſter, <hi>when thou Hateſt the Holy Ghost, Hatest the Prophets,
Hateſt good old</hi> Eli, <hi>and Hateſt</hi> Chriſt <hi>himſelf?</hi> How canſt Thou
pretend to be a Man, a Learned Man, a Chriſtian Man, and a
Clergy-man; <hi>when thou art worſe than the common People, worſe
than the common Souldiers, worſe than the Publicans and Sinners,
worſe than the Heathens and Infidels; yea, and worſe than the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Bruits themſelves?</hi> And yet, This, and only This is thy
Name in the Judgement of God, <hi>whatever Men judge of Thee,</hi>
if thou Hateſt him that tells thee of thy Faults, <hi>in God's Name,
out of God's Word, and by God's Authority.</hi> But, my Beloved
in the Lord, <hi>We are perſwaded better things of you, and things
that accompany Salvation, though we thus ſpeak,</hi> Heb. 6. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Holy Ghoſt has cauſed the Faults of God's
Miniſters to be written in Scripture. And the ſame Holy Ghoſt
aſſures us, <hi>that whatever is written in Scripture, is written for
our Instruction.</hi> And therefore, let every Miniſter here preſent
lay his Hand to his Heart, and Examine his own Soul ſtrictly
and impartially, as he will anſwer for it before God at the Day
of Judgment: Let him, I ſay, thus try and ſearch himſelf,
whether he is not guilty of thoſe Faults, which the Miniſters
of former Ages are Recorded in Scripture to have been guilty
of: That ſo, he may ſpeedily and effectually Repent of them
in this World, and avoid that everlaſting Deſtruction, that is
due to him for them in the world to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First of all,</hi> Haſt thou Entred upon the Miniſtry, when thou
wert <hi>Ignorant</hi> of the Miniſterial Office? <hi>Hast thou Ran before
God ſent thee? and Propheſyed to others, before the Lord had
ſpoken to thee? Jerem.</hi> 23. 21. Haſt thou ſet upon the Study of
Divinity, before thou haſt ſcarce Read, and much leſs digeſted
a Sound Courſe of Philoſophy? Haſt thou ſet up for a Preacher,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95052:10"/>
before thou haſt ever Read thy Bible <hi>Thoroughly and to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?</hi>
Or doſt thou even yet know and underſtand the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
which thy Bible was Originally writ in? And haſt
thou taken upon thy ſelf the Cure of Souls, before thou wert
Learned enough, or perhaps <hi>of Age,</hi> to undertake it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If thou art Learned enough; yet, art thou <hi>Willing</hi>
enough to Diſcharge ſo great a Cure? Art thou not idle? Doſt
thou Read Prayers in thy Pariſh Church every Day in the
Week, both Morning and Evening? Doſt thou Preach every
Lords-day in the Forenoon, and Catechize in the Afternoon?
Doſt thou Catechize and Read a Homily every Holy-day, <hi>as
the Rubrick commands thee? Dost thou go from Houſe to Houſe</hi>
in the Week-days, and ſee whether thy People do Pray, and
perform all other Chriſtian Duties in their Families? <hi>Acts</hi>
20. 20. And doſt thou do all this thy Self, and in thy own Perſon?
Or doſt thou only employ a Mercenary Hireling, who is neither
Able nor Willing to do it for thee, but only goes to thy Church
on the Lords-day, and never minds thy people all the Week
after?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If thou art neither Ignorant, nor Idle; but Learned
enough, and Laborious enough: Yet, art thou not <hi>Covetous</hi> and <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous?</hi>
Art thou not given to filthy Lucre, and filthy Pleaſure?
<hi>Does not Whoredom, and wine, and Strong Drink, take away thy
Heart;</hi> and take up that Time, which thou oughteſt to ſpend
in hard Study, bitter Weeping, fervent Prayer, and frequent
Faſting? <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 11. Does not a Stingy, a Sordid, and an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
Love of the World make thee <hi>to joyn Houſe to Houſe,
and to lay Field to Field,</hi> and to heap up Preferment upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
<hi>till there be no Place</hi> for thy poor Brethren, <hi>that thou
mayeſt be placed Alone in the midſt of the Earth? Iſa.</hi> 5. 8. And
when thou haſt gotten all this together, does there not ſome
<hi>Secret Curſe</hi> go along with it, and make it all to be Bitter unto
thee; yea, and make thee to be Bitter and <hi>Cruel to thine own
Bowels,</hi> and hinder thee from being Charitable and Hoſpitable
unto Others, and alſo from being Juſt to thy Self, whom thou
in a manner ſtarveſt for want of Neceſſaries? Does not thy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95052:10"/>
Living overthrow thy Preaching? And does not thy Practice
make all thy Sermons of no Effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If thou art neither Ignorant, nor Idle, nor Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
nor Voluptuous; yet, art thou not <hi>Proud?</hi> Doſt thou
not ſcorn to be ſo Plain in thy Sermons, as be counted a <hi>Fool
for Chriſt his Sake?</hi> Doſt thou not ſcorn to quit thy Humane
Learning, for <hi>the Fooliſhneſs</hi> of Preaching? Doſt thou not ſcorn
to uſe a Familiar and a Popular way of Preaching, when thou
<hi>Thinkeſt</hi> thou canſt <hi>ſpeak with the Tongues of Men and Angels?</hi>
Doſt thou not ſcorn to Quote any <hi>Texts of Scripture</hi> in thy
Sermons, and to uſe <hi>Scripture Expreſſions, Scripture Proofs, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Similitudes, Scripture Examples, and Scripture Applications,</hi>
as if they were all <hi>too Courſe</hi> and <hi>Homely</hi> for the <hi>Itching Ears</hi>
of this Adulterous Age? Doſt thou not diſdain the very Name
of a Country-Parſon, and wholly Set up for a Higher, a Richer,
and an Eaſier Office? Doſt thou not diſdain to go and Viſit
poor people, <hi>to ſeek that which was loſt, to bring again that which
was driven away, to bind up that which was broken, and to ſtrengthen
that which was Sick?</hi> Ezek. 34. 16. Doſt thou not chuſe to be
the Author of a New Notion, tho' it be Falſe, rather than to
Preach and to Preſs an Old Known Truth upon the Hearts of
thy Hearers? <hi>Doſt thou not chuſe to Introduce three Gods into
the World, rather than be content with the Old and True way
of Expreſſing the Trinity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If thou art neither Ignorant, nor Idle, nor Covetous,
nor Voluptuous, nor Proud; yet, art thou not <hi>Deceitful? Art
thou not a Deceitful Handler and Corrupter of Gods Word?</hi>
Doſt thou not hold that <hi>Original Sin,</hi> is not <hi>Properly</hi> a Sin;
or if it be ſo; it is but the <hi>Leaſt</hi> of all Sins? Doſt thou not
hold the <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrines, inſtead of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
and <hi>Homilies</hi> of our Church? Doſt thou not ſay, that
our Articles are only Articles of <hi>Peace,</hi> and not Articles of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi>
Doſt thou not ſay, that our Homilies do only contain ſuch
Doctrines, as were Neceſſary for the Time they were <hi>Writ</hi>
in, but not for the Time we now <hi>Live</hi> in? Doſt thou not
Adore <hi>Free-will</hi> ſo far, as to make an <hi>Idol</hi> of it; yea; and to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95052:11"/>
make God himſelf to Wait upon its <hi>Choice,</hi> in the Almighty
Work of thy Converſion? Doſt thou not make God to be
in a manner an <hi>Idle Spectator,</hi> and thy Free-will to be the
<hi>Onely Agent</hi> in thy Salvation? Doſt thou not Attribute ſo much
to <hi>Natural Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Moral Suaſion,</hi> that the <hi>Powerful,</hi> and
<hi>Effectual,</hi> and <hi>Irreſiſtible, working of Gods Spirit,</hi> is wholly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by thee as a meer Dream, and an Idle Fancy? Doſt
thou not Extol thine <hi>Own Strength</hi> ſo far, as to Fruſtrate the
<hi>Grace of Christ?</hi> Doſt not <hi>Thou,</hi> and not <hi>God,</hi> make Thee to
<hi>Differ</hi> from another, which is directly contrary to <hi>St. Pauls</hi>
Doctrine? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. Doſt thou not lay ſo great a Streſs
upon <hi>Little</hi> things, as to neglect the <hi>Weightier</hi> matters of the
Law? Doſt thou not make a Conſcience of <hi>Bowing</hi> at the <hi>Name</hi>
of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and doſt thou make any Conſcience at all of <hi>Curſing</hi>
and <hi>Swearing</hi> by his <hi>Name,</hi> by his <hi>Blood,</hi> and by his <hi>Wounds?</hi>
Doſt thou not not make a Conſcience of <hi>Signing</hi> a Child with
the <hi>Sign of the Croſs</hi> in Baptiſm; and doſt thou make any
Conſcience at all of <hi>Catechizing</hi> that Child in the <hi>Doctrine of
the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> tho' both the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> and the <hi>59th. Canon</hi>
command thee to do ſo, <hi>every Lords-day and Holy day in the
After-noon,</hi> upon pain of <hi>Sharp Reproof</hi> for the firſt Fault, <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion</hi>
for the ſecond, and <hi>Excommunication</hi> for the third?
Doſt thou not cry out mightily againſt thoſe that Sacrilegiouſly
rob the <hi>Church</hi> of its <hi>Patrimony;</hi> and doſt thou at all cry out
againſt thy Self and Others, that rob <hi>Christ</hi> of thoſe <hi>Souls,</hi>
which he has purchaſed with his Blood, by Suffering them
to Periſh for want of True and Saving Knowledge? Doſt thou
not cry out mightily againſt thoſe people, that rob thee of
the Leaſt of thy <hi>Tithes</hi> and <hi>Offerings;</hi> and doſt thou at all
cry out againſt thy Self and Others, that rob thoſe very
people of <hi>their Heart's Blood, their Lives, their Souls, and their
Salvation,</hi> by Suffering them to be Damned for want of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing
and Preaching? Doſt thou not cry out mightily againſt
the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for feeding their Communicants with meer <hi>Species
and Accidents,</hi> inſtead of Subſtantial Bread and Wine, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
the Body and Blood of Chriſt; and doſt not thou
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95052:11"/>
Thy ſelf at the ſame time Serve thy Hearers juſt at the ſame
Rate, whilſt thou Contendeſt ſo <hi>Much,</hi> and ſo <hi>Earneſtly</hi> for the
<hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and ſo Little, <hi>if at all,</hi> for the <hi>Doctrines</hi>
of our Church?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> If thou art neither Ignorant, nor Idle, nor Covetous,
nor Voluptuous, nor Proud, nor Deceitful; yet art thou not
<hi>far Worſe</hi> than all theſe? For, doſt thou not refuſe to be Good
Thy ſelf, and hinder Others to be ſo? Doſt thou not refuſe
to Faſt upon Ember-week Thy ſelf, and hinder Others to do
ſo, and Reproach them for it? Doſt thou not refuſe to Preach
Thy ſelf, and hinder Others to do ſo, if thou thinkeſt they
will <hi>Dare</hi> to Preach againſt thy Great, and Crying, and Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Damning Sins? <hi>Thy Pluralities, thy Non-Reſidence,
thy Arminianiſm, and thy Shameful Neglect of Catechizing, and
Daily Prayers in thy Church and Family?</hi> Doſt thou not get
as many Church-Preferments, as thou poſſibly canſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to Preach in them All Thy ſelf, and thereby hinder all
others, that are both Learned and Laborious; both Able and
Willing to Preach in them in their own Perſons? Doſt thou
not <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Hate</hi> a good <hi>Orthodox</hi> Miniſter, in thy very Heart
and Soul; and ſay of him, as the Scribes and Phariſees did of
Chriſt; <hi>He hath a Devil, and is Mad, why hear ye Him?</hi>
John 10. 20. Yea, and to Compleat thy Character; <hi>Doſt thou
not reckon it a Greater fault for a Man, to Tell thee of theſe thy
Faults, than it is for thee and others to be Guilty of them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have endeavoured to Examine every Miniſter
here preſent, out of Gods own Word, whether he be really
guilty of thoſe Sins, which the Miniſters of former Ages,
are Recorded in Scripture to have been guilty of. I neither
<hi>Accuſe</hi> you of, nor <hi>Condemn</hi> you for, any one of all theſe Sins.
But, I wiſh with all my Heart and Soul, that both God and
your own Conſciences may <hi>Acquit</hi> and <hi>Abſolve</hi> you from them
all. For, I call Heaven and Earth to Record, <hi>That I do not ſay
theſe things to Shame you; but, as my Beloved Brethren, I Warn
you,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 14. <hi>I Warn you all in Gods Name, and in Chriſt's
Name,</hi> that you do not think your ſelves <hi>Altogether</hi> Free from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95052:12"/>
               <hi>All,</hi> or from any <hi>One</hi> of all theſe Sins. For, <hi>Original Sin,</hi> which
has in its ſelf the <hi>Seed</hi> of every Sin whatever, is not <hi>Wholly</hi>
Mortified in the <hi>Beſt</hi> of you all: And therefore, it may make
you to fall into the very <hi>Worst</hi> of all theſe Sins; as it made
<hi>St. Peter</hi> to Deny Chriſt with Curſing and Swearing; and
<hi>Hazael</hi> to do ſuch Barbarous things, as he thought None but
a <hi>Dog</hi> could ever have done; 2 <hi>Kings, 8. 13. I Warn you all
in Gods Name, and in Chriſt's Name,</hi> that, as you value the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of your own Souls, and of them that hear you; ſo
be ye Sure, not to find fault with the Holy Ghoſt, who
has commanded me, upon pain of Damnation, to Warn you all
againſt all theſe Sins: Nor yet to find fault with Me, who,
<hi>according to the meaſure of Grace and Faithfulneſs He has given
me,</hi> have Conſcienciouſly obey'd his command, and incurr'd your
Diſpleaſure for the Good of your Souls: But, lay all the fault,
<hi>if you are guilty of any fault,</hi> where it only ought to be laid,
even upon your own ſelves. And reſolve, reſolve immediately
upon a full and perfect Amendment of Life, from this very Day,
from this very Hour, from this very Moment. For, we do not
know, whether any of us ſhall Live one Moment longer. We
do not know, whether You or I ſhall Live to go out of this
Church, or ever to come into it again, to be told of, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up to, the conſciencious diſcharge of our Miniſterial Office,
thus <hi>Plainly,</hi> thus <hi>Impartially,</hi> thus <hi>Convincingly;</hi> and I heartily
Pray to God, <hi>Effectually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh my Beloved Brethren, do not think that I am <hi>too earneſt,</hi>
ot <hi>too much concerned</hi> for you and your peoples Immortal Souls:
For, I know, I know, that your Souls have coſt Chriſt very
dear; they have coſt him his <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arts Blood,</hi> they have coſt him
his <hi>Life.</hi> And can I be <hi>too much</hi> Concerned, or can I ever be
Concerned <hi>enough,</hi> for the Salvation of thoſe Souls, which have
coſt my Lord, my God, and my Saviour; which have coſt
Chriſt Crucified ſo much?</p>
            <p>Oh thoſe Emphatical Words of His to <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſounding in my Ears, and deeply Rooted in my very
Heart and Soul. <hi>Loveſt thou Me? Feed my Lambs. Loveſt thou
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95052:12"/>
Me? Feed my Sheep. Loveſt thou Me? Feed my Sheep,</hi> John
21. 15, 16, 17. And does Chriſt repeat this <hi>Thrice,</hi> that it
may make the <hi>Deeper</hi> Impreſſion upon us? And are we ſo <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible,</hi>
and ſo <hi>Seared,</hi> and ſo <hi>Judicially Hardned,</hi> as not to
take the <hi>Leaſt</hi> Notice of it? Does Chriſt <hi>here</hi> try a Miniſters
Love to him, <hi>Onely</hi> by <hi>Catechizing his Lambs, and Preaching to
his Sheep?</hi> And can I pretend to Love Chriſt, when I neither
Catechize nor Preach <hi>in my own Pariſh,</hi> all the <hi>Year,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
all my <hi>Life</hi> long? Or can I ever be <hi>too ſtrict</hi> in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
theſe Duties, wherein my Love to Chriſt does <hi>Onely</hi>
conſiſt? My Love to Chriſt, <hi>who Loved Me, and gave himſelf
for Me, when I was Dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, Gal.</hi> 2. 20, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
            <p>Oh theſe Eyes of mine, theſe Eyes of mine, have ſeen, how
poor Country - people, <hi>do Sit in Darkneſs and the Shadow of
Death,</hi> and are as Ignorant of Chriſtianity, as if Chriſt had ſcarce
ever been Preached to them! And I am verily perſwaded, that
if You, who have Great and Rich Places in the Countrey,
would but do as Chriſt did; <hi>would but Go and See,</hi> how the
<hi>Multitudes</hi> committed to your Charge, <hi>do Faint, and are Tired,
and Wearied, and lie down, and are ſcattered abroad, as Sheep
having no Shepherd;</hi> you could not poſſibly chuſe, but be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with Pity and Compaſſion on them; unleſs your <hi>Hearts
are all Stone, and your Bowels are all Braſs, and You your ſelves
are more Barbarous than the Sea Monſters, which draw out the
Breaſt, and give ſuck to their Young Ones,</hi> Lam. 4. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh my Beloved Brethren, do not think that I am</hi> too earneſt,
or too much concerned <hi>for your and your peoples Immortal Souls.
For,</hi> whether we be beſides our ſelves, it is to God; or, whether
we be ſober, it is for your cauſe: For, the Love of Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth
us, becauſe we thus judge, that if One died for all, then
were all dead; and that he died for all, that they which live,
ſhould not henceforth live unto Themſelves, but unto Him, which
died for them, and Roſe again, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Holy Ghoſt has cauſed the Faults of God's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
to be written in Scripture. And the ſame Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95052:13"/>
aſſures us, that the Faults of us Miniſters are the Cauſe, why
our People do not Repent of their Sins, and Reform their Lives.
For ſays the Lord, <hi>Jerem. 23. 22. If the Prophets had ſtood in
my Counſel, and had cauſed my People to hear my Words; then,
they ſhould have turned from their evil Way, and from the evil of
their Doings.</hi> Where you ſee, that the Cauſe, and indeed, the
<hi>Onely Cauſe,</hi> here mentioned, why <hi>the People did not turn from
their evil Way, and their evil Doings,</hi> is, becauſe <hi>the Prophets
had not ſtood in the Counſel of the Lord, and had not cauſed them
to hear his Words.</hi> And if you will turn to <hi>Malachi</hi> 2. 6. You
will there find, that the great Succeſs of <hi>Levi's</hi> Miniſtry, in the
Converſion of Souls unto God, is <hi>Onely</hi> attributed to his Holy
Preaching and Holy Living. For, <hi>the Law of Truth was in his
Mouth, and Iniquity was not found in his Lips; he walked with
God in Peace and Equity; and therefore, he did turn many away
from Iniquity.</hi> And if thy Bad Life be the Cauſe, and the <hi>Onely</hi>
Cauſe here mentioned, why thy Pariſhioners are ſo Bad; Good
God, what will become of thy poor Soul? Is not thine own
Badneſs enough to Damn thee, but thou muſt alſo Add all the
Badneſs of thy whole Pariſh to make thy Damnation the more
Intolerable? Can not thine own Sins ſink thee deep enough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Hell, but thou muſt alſo Add all the Sins of all thy people, to
ſink thee deeper and deeper into the bottomleſs Pit, and the Gulf
impaſſable? Oh thou haſt Sins enough of thine own to anſwer
for, <hi>though thou art the beſt Man upon Earth;</hi> and therefore, <hi>be
not thou Partaker of other Mens Sins,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Holy Ghoſt has cauſed the Faults of Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
to be written in Scripture: And the ſame Holy Ghoſt
aſſures us, that the Faults of us Miniſters are the true and the
<hi>Onely</hi> Cauſe, <hi>Why God does curſe our very Bleſſings, and corrupt
our Seed, and ſpread Dung upon our Faces, even the Dung of our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Feaſts, and make us Contemptible and Baſe before all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
Malachi 2. 2, 3, 9. Where you ſee, that all the <hi>Seed</hi> both of
your <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Ground,</hi> all your Eſtate, all your Land, all your
Money, all your Cattle, and all your other temporal Bleſſings,
are Curſed by God himſelf, becauſe you do not perform the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95052:13"/>
Work of your Miniſtry <hi>without Fear or Favour;</hi> but, are <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>
in the Law of the moſt High, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. You either <hi>Fear</hi> ſuch
a Mans Perſon, and <hi>Dare not;</hi> or you <hi>Admire</hi> ſuch a Mans Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and <hi>Will not,</hi> tell him of his Sins, in Hope of getting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from him, by your baſe and cowardly Silence. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you are thus <hi>Partial in Gods Law, having Mens Perſons in
Admiration becauſe of Advantage, and Preferring one before another;</hi>
therefore, <hi>God will certainly curſe all your Bleſſings;</hi> yea, <hi>and he
has curſed them already,</hi> ver. 2. And therefore, if the common
Obſervation, that is in every ones Mouth, be really True: <hi>I do
not ſay, It is True:</hi> But, if it be really True: That Clergy-mens
Children are more Vnfortunate than other Mens; then
One Great Cauſe of it is this. Their Fathers do not faithfully
diſcharge their Miniſterial Office. And therefore, God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Threatning, does <hi>corrupt</hi> all the <hi>Seed</hi> both of their
<hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Ground,</hi> and <hi>lays</hi> a dreadful <hi>Curſe</hi> upon all their <hi>Bleſſings</hi>
and <hi>Eſtates.</hi> And thoſe <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>God's Curſe</hi> are Entailed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
upon their Children; as the Leproſy and Eſtate of <hi>Gehazi</hi>
deſcended together upon his Poſterity, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 27. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>the Meat, Drink, Cloaths, Portions, and all other things,
which the Children of ſuch ungodly Miniſters have, are curſed with
the Curſe of God.</hi> And how then can ſuch Children poſſibly
<hi>Thrive</hi> and <hi>Proſper</hi> in the World? For, <hi>if the Bleſſing of God makes
a Man Rich,</hi> the Curſe of God muſt needs make him Poor,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 22.</p>
            <p>And here in our Church, no Man can be received into the
Miniſtry, but he muſt firſt make a <hi>Solemn Subſcription,</hi> that he
acknowledgeth the <hi>Articles</hi> and the <hi>Common-prayer Book</hi> to be
Agreeable to God's Word, and that he will uſe <hi>That,</hi> and <hi>No
other</hi> Form, in publick Prayer and Adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And no Man that is thus ſolemnly received into the
Miniſtry, can be Lawfully admitted into any Eccleſiaſtical Place,
<hi>With</hi> or <hi>Without</hi> Cure of Souls, but he muſt alſo <hi>Take a most
Strict and Severe Oath againſt Simony.</hi> And if it were poſſible
for us to know, how many have broken this <hi>Oath,</hi> and are
guilty of <hi>Perjury;</hi> and have broken their <hi>Subſcription</hi> to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95052:14"/>
               <hi>Common-prayer Book,</hi> which they pretend to Magnifie and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
ſo much, <hi>by neglecting to Catechize, and to Read the Daily
Prayers and Homilies;</hi> and have broken their <hi>Subſcription</hi> to
the <hi>Articles, by private Diſputing, publick Preaching and Printing
againſt them:</hi> If, I ſay, it were poſſible for us to know, how
many are guilty of theſe things; it would make us All, <hi>if we
have but the leaſt Senſe of their miſerable State,</hi> to quake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Think of their Numbers. And yet, all theſe men have
all their Bleſſings, and all their Eſtates, <hi>thus unlawfully gotten,</hi>
curſed with the Curſe of God. And they can not poſſibly leave
them to their Children, but they muſt alſo at the ſame time
neceſſarily leave the Curſe of God along with them. And how
then can ſuch Children, <hi>while they Keep and Live upon theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
things, without making any Reſtitution of them to the Right
Owners:</hi> How can they, I ſay, poſſibly <hi>Thrive</hi> and <hi>Proſper</hi> in
the World, unleſs God will ſuffer them to do ſo <hi>on Purpoſe,</hi> that
<hi>their Proſperity may deſtroy them,</hi> and make their Deſtruction the
more Intolerable, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 32.</p>
            <p>And indeed, if a Man ſeriouſly conſiders the Proceedings of
God in this Particular, without all <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Partiality,</hi> he
will preſently find them to be moſt highly Reaſonable. For, all
people committed to a Miniſters Charge, are, or at leaſt he is
to endeavour to make them, <hi>his Children according to the Spirit,
begotten again, through his Miniſtry, to a lively Hope, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead,</hi> Galat. 4. 19. compared
with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. And if a Miniſter, that does not Catechize and
Preach in his own Pariſh-Church, does Force <hi>his Children accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Spirit,</hi> to go from Pariſh to Pariſh, and from Church
to Church, to beg a little ſpiritual Food for their Souls, that
are ready to Starve for Hunger and Thirſt; then, is it not moſt
highly reaſonable, that <hi>his Children according to the Fleſh,</hi> ſhould
be forced to go from Houſe to Houſe, and to beg their Bread
from Door to Door? And if a Miniſter forces his <hi>Spiritual Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
to ſtarve for want of the Body and Blood of Chriſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Adminiſtred to them in the Bleſſed Sacrament; then,
is it not moſt highly reaſonable, that his <hi>Natural Children,</hi> ſhould
be forced to Starve for want of Meat and Drink?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:95052:14"/>
Sure I am, <hi>whatever you think of this Now,</hi> God has long
ſince Threatned it, and he will certainly bring it to paſs. For
ſays the Lord, <hi>Hoſ. 4. 6, 7. My people are deſtroyed for lack of
Knowledge; becauſe thou haſt rejected Knowledge, I will alſo reject
thee, that thou ſhalt be no Priest to me; ſeeing thou haſt forgotten
the Law of thy God, I will alſo forget thy Children, and change
their Glory into Shame: And the Priests eat up the Sin of my
people, and they ſet their Heart on their Iniquity.</hi> That is,
they Eat and Feaſt upon the Sacrifices, which my people of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for their Sins; and they are heartily glad, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
ſo many Sins, and do not at all endeavour to Reclaim 'em,
leſt their Gain ſhould be loſt. And then it follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.
<hi>They ſhall eat,</hi> of thoſe Sacrifices unlawfully gotten, <hi>and they
ſhall not have enough; they ſhall commit Whoredom,</hi> thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to increaſe their Children, <hi>and they ſhall not Increaſe; becauſe
they have left off to take heed to the Lord.</hi> Where you ſee, that
the Sins of the Prieſts are Threatned with <hi>Scarcity of Bread,</hi>
and they Affect and Reach their <hi>Children as well as Themſelves.</hi>
And you alſo ſee, that every Morſel you eat, and every Draught
you drink, and every Rag of Cloaths you and your Children
wear, <hi>are the Price of the Blood and Souls of thoſe poor People,</hi>
which are Starved on Earth, and Damned in Hell, for want of
your Catechizing and Preaching. Every <hi>Glaſs of Wine</hi> you
drink, is <hi>Bought</hi> with the <hi>Price,</hi> and <hi>Mingled</hi> with the <hi>Blood,</hi> of
thoſe poor People, which Periſh through your Neglect. <hi>You
Grind the Faces of the poor;</hi> and then, as the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> elegantly
expreſſeth it, <hi>You eat them up for Bread,</hi> whenever you Feed your
ſelves with the <hi>Tithes and Offerings</hi> of thoſe people, who are
ready to periſh everlaſtingly, becauſe of your <hi>ſhameful Abſence</hi>
from them all the Year long. And by this means, <hi>Ye cover the
Altar of the Lord with the Tears, the Weeping, and the Crying out</hi>
of thoſe Poor, Starved, and Damned Souls; <hi>Inſomuch that the
Lord regardeth not your Offering any more, nor receiveth it with
good will at your Hands,</hi> Mal. 2. 13.</p>
            <p>And how then can you ever expect, that your Eſtates, <hi>thus
Damnably gotten,</hi> ſhould ever <hi>Thrive</hi> or <hi>Proſper</hi> with You or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95052:15"/>
your Children? And therefore, though you have no Regard to
your own Souls, nor to the Souls of your people, nor to the
Blood of Chriſt, which was Shed for the Redemption both of
your and their Souls; yet however, have ſome little Regard to
the Bodies and Souls of your poor Children. Oh do not make
them <hi>a Generation of God's Wrath!</hi> Do not make them the Heirs
of your Vices as well as your Eſtates. Do not make them to
Inherit your Curſes as well as your Bleſſings. Oh remember
what a dreadful Legacy <hi>Joab</hi> left to his Children, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 29.
One of them was to have an <hi>Iſſue,</hi> another a <hi>Leproſy,</hi> another
<hi>to lean on his Staff</hi> for Lameneſs, another <hi>to fall on the Sword,</hi>
and another <hi>to lack Bread.</hi> And canſt thou find in thy Heart
to leave thy Children no better; yea, <hi>far worſe</hi> Legacies than
theſe are? Canſt thou find in thy Heart to leave thy <hi>Ignorance</hi>
and <hi>Idleneſs</hi> to one, thy <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
thy <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> to another, and thy <hi>Neglect of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing,
Preaching, and daily Prayers in thy Church and Family</hi>
to another of thy Children? Canſt thou find in thy Heart
to leave thy Children no better Legacies than theſe are? Canſt
thou pretend to Love thy Children, and yet leave them No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to Live upon, but thy <hi>Vices</hi> and thy <hi>Curſes,</hi> the <hi>Tears</hi>
of the <hi>Living,</hi> and the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Dead?</hi> And canſt thou
ſtill expect, that they ſhould <hi>Thrive</hi> and <hi>Proſper</hi> in the World,
when this is all the <hi>Portion,</hi> and all the <hi>Stock,</hi> thou giveſt
them, to begin the World, and to ſet up with?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There was heretofore a Generation of Men, who
cried up, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, The
Temple of the Lord,</hi> Jerem. 7. 4. And yet, thoſe very Men
were the greateſt Enemies to that Temple. For, it is there
expreſly ſaid of them, <hi>verſe 6. 9. That they would oppreſs the
Poor, the Fatherleſs, and the Widow; they would ſhed innocent
Blood, Steal, Murder, commit Adultery, Swear falſly, burn Incenſe
to</hi> Baal, <hi>and walk after other Gods.</hi> And have not We juſt ſuch
another ſort of Men now adays, who cry up, <hi>The Church, The
Church, The Church;</hi> and yet, will do Nothing for the Church,
but <hi>Drink,</hi> and <hi>Swear,</hi> and <hi>Whore, and take away the Church-Land,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:95052:15"/>
and <hi>Call</hi> the <hi>Beſt</hi> Men of its Communion, the <hi>Soundest
Preachers</hi> and the <hi>Strictest Livers,</hi> a Company of <hi>Puritans and
Phanaticks?</hi> And theſe Men, I know very well, will preſently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a great deal of Zeal, and will find Fault with thoſe Texts
of Scripture, which I have Quoted out of God's own Word for
the Proof of my Doctrine: And to theſe Men I will only ſay
thus much, <hi>A chaſt Virgin,</hi> or a <hi>chaſt Wife,</hi> does not at all think
her ſelf abuſed, when ſhe hears a <hi>Whore</hi> or an <hi>Adultreſs</hi> ſet
forth in her proper Colours: And a <hi>Learned</hi> and a <hi>Laborious</hi>
Miniſter, does not at all think Himſelf, or the Miniſterial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
abuſed; when an <hi>Ignorant,</hi> an <hi>Idle,</hi> a <hi>Covetous,</hi> a <hi>Wanton,</hi>
and a <hi>Proud</hi> Phariſee is deſcribed to the Life. If any Man here
preſent finds himſelf <hi>Touch'd;</hi> in God's Name, let him Reform
and Amend: And if not, why does he then find Fault? Let
him rather Bleſs God that he ſtands, and <hi>take heed that he do
not fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we thus <hi>lay the Axe to the Root of the Tree, and begin,</hi>
where God's Judgments uſually do, <hi>with God's own Houſe firſt,
and deal impartially with our ſelves;</hi> then, our Hearers will think
we are in <hi>good Earneſt,</hi> when we do not ſpare our ſelves; they
will think we have the ſame Bleſſed Spirit that <hi>Moſes</hi> had, who
did not <hi>Spare</hi> either Himſelf, or his Brother <hi>Aaron,</hi> or his Siſter
<hi>Miriam;</hi> but Plainly and Publickly recorded their Faults in
Scripture, as well as others; and they will never be able to
be <hi>Angry</hi> with us, for telling them of their Sins roundly and
ſmartly to their Face. And indeed, to tell you my Mind
freely; it is not our Priviledge, <hi>Onely</hi> to tell other Men of
their Sins, and never to be told of our own. It is not our
Prerogative, <hi>Onely</hi> to declaim againſt other Mens Vices, and
to <hi>Live</hi> and to <hi>Reign</hi> in our own without Controul. No,
No, <hi>If ever the Church be Reformed, We Church-Men, and We
Clergy-Men, must firſt Reform our ſelves.</hi> For, <hi>We are the Salt
of the Earth;</hi> and therefore, we are to ſpend our ſelves, <hi>as
Salt is ſpent,</hi> to Seaſon others, and to keep them from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;
and how can we do ſo, if we our ſelves have loſt
our Savour? <hi>We are the light of the World;</hi> and therefore,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95052:16"/>
we are to ſpend our ſelves; <hi>as a Candle is ſpent,</hi> to enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
others; and how can we do ſo, if we our ſelves are all
Darkneſs? <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> If it be a diſmal Sight to ſee ſeveral Thouſands of
poor people, Fainting, and ready to Periſh for want of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Meat and Drink to feed their Bodies; then, is it not a <hi>far
worſe</hi> Sight to ſee ſeveral Thouſands of poor people, Fainting,
and ready to Periſh for want of good Catechizing and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to feed their Souls? For, though a Man's Body ſtarve
for want of Meat and Drink; yet, his Soul may go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
notwithſtanding; as is plain from what is recorded of
<hi>Lazarus, Luke</hi> 16. 21, 22. But if a Man's Soul ſtarve for want
of Catechizing and Preaching, both his Body and his Soul, <hi>in
the Ordinary Way of God's Providence,</hi> muſt needs go to Hell.
A Famine of Bread is bad; but, a Famine of the Word is
far Worſe. For, the Soul that feeds upon the Word, is far
better than the Body that feeds upon Bread. For ſays the
Prophet, <hi>Iſa. 30. 20. Though the Lord give you the Bread of
Adverſity, and the Water of Affliction; yet ſhall not thy Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
be removed into a Corner any more.</hi> Where you ſee, that
though a Man be fed with <hi>the Bread of Adverſity, and the
Water of Affliction;</hi> that is, ſuch courſe Fare, as is ſcarce able
to keep Body and Soul together; yet, as long as he has his
<hi>Teachers</hi> left him, and he may both <hi>See and Hear them;</hi>
he has that which is far better. For, <hi>It is better to be a
Beggar with the Goſpel, than to be a King without it.</hi> For ſays
the Holy K. <hi>David, It is better to be a Door-keeper in the Houſe
of the Lord, than to dwell in the Tents of Vngodlineſs,</hi> Pſalm
84. 10. And therefore, it is a ſhrewd Sign, that God is
extreme Angry with a People, when he takes away a good
Miniſter from them. For, <hi>When God took away</hi> Lot, <hi>the Preacher
of Righteouſneſs, from</hi> Sodom; <hi>he preſently rained upon it Fire
and Brimſtone from Heaven,</hi> Gen. 19. 22, 24. It is a ſhrewd
Sign, that God is extreme Angry with a people, when he
ſends them a bad Miniſter: For, <hi>when God ſets a Lyon, a
Wolf, or a Leopard, to Watch over a City,</hi> has he not a mind
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95052:16"/>
to Deſtroy it? <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 5. 6. And, <hi>when God put a lying
Spirit into the Mouth of all</hi> Ahab's <hi>Prophets, to perſwade
him to go up to</hi> Ramoth-Gilead, had he not fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
that Place for his Deſtruction? 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 23. And
therefore, you may all aſſure your ſelves, <hi>that God has
not many People to Save in that Pariſh, where he does not
Settle a good Minister.</hi> For, if God has any Harveſt in
a Pariſh, he will certainly Send a good Labourer, to reap
it down, to gather it up, and to put it into his Barn.</p>
            <p>If God has any Sheep in a Pariſh, he will certainly
Send a good Shepherd to look after them. For, if God
<hi>has much People at</hi> Corinth, or any where elſe, he always
Sends them a <hi>Paul,</hi> or ſome other able Miniſter, to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
them in the Faith of Chriſt, <hi>Act</hi> 18. 9, 10. For,
the Harveſt, the Sheep, and the People of God, <hi>are the
Jewels of the Lord of Hosts,</hi> and they ſhall all be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<hi>made up,</hi> and ſafely kept by that watchful Keeper
of <hi>Iſrael, that never Slumbers nor Sleeps,</hi> Malachi 3. 17.
compared with <hi>Pſalm</hi> 121. 4. For, that God, who takes
care of every Sparrow, and numbreth the Hairs of your
Head, and ſuffers not ſo much as a Tear you ſhed in
Secret to be loſt, but <hi>puts it in his Bottle, and notes
it in his Book;</hi> that good God, who does all this, will
never ſuffer the Souls of his People to be loſt, for want
of a good Miniſter to look after them; unleſs you think
that your Souls, <hi>which are his Jewels, and for which
Chriſt died,</hi> are not worth ſo much as a <hi>Sparrow,</hi> a <hi>Hair</hi>
of your Head, or a <hi>Tear</hi> that falls down your Cheeks,
when you weep for your Sins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If our Fore-Fathers Suffer'd ſo great a Famine
of the Word, that they were ready to Faint and to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
for want of a Preaching Miniſter; then, let us have
a great Care, that we do not Provoke God to take away
this Ineſtimable Bleſſing from us. For, at preſent, <hi>bleſſed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95052:17"/>
be God for it,</hi> We have the <hi>Bible in our own Tongue,</hi> that
we may Read it at Home; and we have ſome <hi>Few</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
that <hi>Catechize</hi> as well as <hi>Preach</hi> out of it, that we
may be Edified when we are in Church. <hi>And God increaſe
their Number for Chriſt his Sake.</hi> But, if we make Light
of this Unſpeakable Mercy, we can not poſſibly have it
long. For, <hi>If we do not heartily Repent of all our Sins,
our Candlestick will Quickly be removed from us,</hi> Rev. 2. 5.
<hi>And if we do not bring forth Fruit meet for Repentance, the
Kingdom of God will ſhortly be taken away from us, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to a Nation bringing forth the Fruit thereof,</hi> Matthew
21. 43.</p>
            <p>Nay further: If we come to Church, and do not come
there with our <hi>Souls</hi> as well as our <hi>Bodies: Mark this as
long as you live:</hi> If our <hi>Souls</hi> do not <hi>Think</hi> upon what the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
Says to us out of Gods Word; but, do <hi>Think</hi> of our
<hi>Studies,</hi> our <hi>Shops,</hi> our <hi>Fields;</hi> or Such a <hi>Man,</hi> or Such a
<hi>Woman,</hi> or the like: <hi>If our Souls be Wandering and Roving
abroad, while the Minister is Reading, Praying, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing,
or Preaching:</hi> Then, we Provoke God to take away
the Goſpel from us: Yea, and God himſelf has long Since
Threatned to do So for this very fault, <hi>as Little as you take
it to be.</hi> For, thus Saith the Lord, <hi>Iſai. 29. 13, 14. For as
much as this people draw near me with their Mouth, and with
their Lips do honour me; but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have removed their Heart far
from me: Therefore, Behold, I will proceed to do a Marvellous
work among this people, even a Marvellous work, and a
Wonder. For, the Wiſdom of their Wiſe Men ſhall Periſh, and
the Vnderstanding of their Prudent Men ſhall be Hid.</hi> And
therefore, when ever you come to Church with your <hi>Mouths</hi>
and with your <hi>Lips;</hi> but, leave your <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> at
Home, or Suffer them to <hi>Wander</hi> and to <hi>Rove</hi> abroad, and to
Mind any thing, Save <hi>onely</hi> what Gods Miniſter ſays to you
out of God's own Word: Then, have a Care, have a great
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95052:17"/>
Care, <hi>That the Wiſdom of your Wiſe Men do not Periſh, and the
Vnderſtanding of your Prudent Men be not Hid:</hi> And the
Goſpel, which is <hi>the Word of Life;</hi> the Goſpel, which is <hi>the
Word of Salvation;</hi> the Goſpel; which is <hi>the Word of God, be
not taken away from You for ever, and given to Others, that will
make a better Vſe of it.</hi> From which dreadful Judgement,
good Lord, deliver us all for Chriſt his Sake. <hi>Amen. Amen.</hi>
