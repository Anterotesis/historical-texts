            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

how (when thinking on the glorious
misteries of Christ) can I haue sorrow
for my sinnes, and in his dolorous
and painefull passage, ioy, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
contentment? Wherto I answer
two thinges: the first, that it cannot
be denied, but that some Mysteries
are more to the purpose then others,
to gather the fruit of some vertues
more then they be for others. Let vs
put an example: In the birth of the
child Iesus, who doubteth but that
the humility &amp; pouerty which Christ
there did practise and experience in
his owne perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, do shine most bright,
and are most eminent in that mistery.
In the crowning with thornes, the
contempt of worldly honour. In the
whipping at the piller, the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the flesh: and in the mystery
of the Crosse, the humility, patience,
and obedience which Christ exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
suffering himselfe to be nayled
thereunto.</p>
                     <p>The second thing is, and that
of much importance to be knowne,
that vpon whatsoeuer point or my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery

that the disposition and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration

best preparations wherewith all may
come to receaue aboundant grace,
willbe retiring themselues, first to
consider well some one point of the
sixe, which are set downe in the two
ensuing meditations, vvhich are of
the Feare and Loue of God, because
these two vertues vnite the soule with
God, &amp; are the two armes vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

which do instruct and teach her what
God is, and what she is. For Feare
causeth in the soule humility and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence:
Loue, confidence &amp; deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Feare discouereth the greatnes
of God, and thy basenes: Loue, his
goodnes and clemency: Feare his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
