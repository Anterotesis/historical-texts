            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Not to goe higher then the Reigne of our now dread Soveraigne, how have both Church and State beene exerciſed by thoſe factious Spirits, <hi>Layton,</hi> and <hi>Prynne,</hi> and <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> the <hi>Triumviri</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with <hi>H. Burton</hi> the <hi>Dictator,</hi> what noiſe and clamours have they raiſed;

And thereby turned thoſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons on their Mothers Children, which might have beene employed more fitly on the common Enemie.</p>
            <p>But when thoſe of the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> had received their judgement, <hi>Layton</hi> and <hi>Prynne</hi> in the <hi>Starre-chamber,</hi> &amp; <hi>Baſtwick</hi> in the <hi>high Commiſſion,</hi> the greateſt comfort of the cauſe, did ſeeme to be intruſted to <hi>Dictator Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>: <gap reason="foreign">

down thoſe hopes, he could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt. That which hath heretofore made ſo many <hi>Hereticks,</hi> occaſioned his firſt diſlike of the holy <hi>Hierarchy.</hi> When once <hi>Aerius</hi> loſt his hopes of being made a Biſhop, as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us;<note place="margin">De hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ. c. 23.</note> he ſet on foot this peeviſh doctrine, <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ab Epiſcopo nulla ratione debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re diſcerni,</hi> that by no meanes there was a difference to be made, betweene <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Biſhops.</hi> And that once broached, there followed next, <hi>non celebranda eſſe jejunia ſtatuta, ſed cum quiſque voluerit jejunandum?</hi> that no ſet faſts were to be kept, but every man might faſt when he would himſelfe. This was the very Caſe of our Grand <hi>Dictator.</hi> He had beene a ſervant in the Cloſet to His Sacred Majeſtie, then <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi>: and queſtionleſſe being in the
<pb facs="tcp:4205:5"/>
               <hi>Aſcendent,</hi> he thought to <hi>Culminate.</hi> But when he ſaw thoſe hopes had failed him, and that by reaſon of his violent and factious carriage, he was commanded to depart the Court, he thought it then high time to <hi>Court</hi> the people; that he might get in the hundreds, what he loſt in the Countie. This pincheth him it ſeemes, to this very day; and he is ſo ingenious, (which I wonder at) as to let us know it. For in the Epiſtle to His Majeſtie before his Sermon (if at the leaſt a ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſeditious declamation may be called a Sermon) he ſtiles himſelfe His <hi>Majeſties old and faithfull ſervant:</hi> and in the other to His Majeſtie before the <hi>Apologie</hi> he bemoanes himſelfe, as an <hi>old out-caſt Courtier, worne out of all favour and friends there. Hinc illae lachrymae;</hi> Hence the opinion of
<pb facs="tcp:4205:5"/>
theſe quarrells. Here he declares moſt plainly where his griefe doth lye; what made him firſt flie out, and bend his thoughts, to foſter and foment a faction: Such is the humour of moſt men, whom the <hi>Court caſts out;</hi> that they doe labour what they can, to <hi>out-caſt the Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus entred and ingaged, hee found it neceſſary to acquaint himſelfe with ſuch as were affected like himſelfe, and in their ſeverall profeſsions might beſt aide and helpe him: this made him picke out Maſter <hi>Prynne,</hi> an <hi>utter Barriſter of Lincolns Inne,</hi> for his <hi>learned Counſaile: Layton</hi> and <hi>Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke,</hi> two that had the name of Doctors, to be <hi>Phyſitians</hi> to his perſon: His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors finding by ſome <hi>Symptomes,</hi> which they had obſerved, that he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

fretfull, and full of Choller, perſwaded with him, either by preaching, or by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to vent that humour: which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for want of vent, would ſoone burne him up: his <hi>learned Counſaile</hi> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding by, and promiſing that whatſoever he ſhould write or ſay, hee would finde <hi>Law</hi> for it.

to raiſe combuſtions in the ſtate: and like <hi>Eroſtratus</hi> of old, ſeeing hee could grow famous by no other meanes, to burn downe the <hi>Temple.</hi> The <hi>Pulpit,</hi> firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected onely for <hi>preaching of the word of God,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:4205:8"/>
thus to diſgorge his ſtomacke, of purpoſe to excite his audience againſt their ſuperiors, and ſtartle them with dreadfull feares, as if hoth <hi>tyranny</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> were likely in ſhort time to be thruſt upon them: that was an undertaking fit for private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe gifts might be confined to one place or <hi>Pariſh</hi>: For his part, he was now the generall <hi>Superintendent</hi> of all the Churches, the forlorne hope, the <hi>Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell perdue</hi> of the whole brother-hood: and therefore the most choyce and materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all poynts of the Declamation, (like the <hi>Enclyclicall</hi> Epiſtles of the elder times) muſt briefely be ſummed up, and ſcattered all abroad the Kingdome, as <hi>Newes from Ipſwich</hi>: Nay, leſt one title of his word ſhould fall to ground, the <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> preſently muſt become a Libell,<note place="margin">Ep. to the King.</note> and was by him thought fit <hi>to have been

            <p>Two things there were eſpecially which did embolden him thus to preach and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his owne perſonall quarrells, as the <hi>truth of God</hi>: Firſt an opinion of ſome <hi>extraordinary calling</hi> from above, the ſame perhaps that <hi>Hacket</hi> was poſſeſſed with in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reigne: This he avoweth in his Epiſtle to the King.
<q>I heartily thanke my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath accounted mee faithful, &amp; called me forth to ſtand
<pb facs="tcp:4205:9"/>
in his caſe, and to witneſſe it before the World, by publiſhing my ſaid Sermons in Print, &amp;c.</q>
And in that directed to the <hi>true-hearted Nobility,</hi> where he ſpeaks more plainly
<q>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am one of the watch-men of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> (though the meaneſt) yet one that hath obtained mercy to bee faithful. Nor have I inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or raſhly ruſhed upon this buſineſſe, but have been by a ſtrong hand drawn into it. Yea my Lords, know aſſuredly that Chriſt himſelfe my great Lord &amp; Maſter, hath called me forth, to be a publike witneſſe of this great cauſe, who will certainly maintaine both it and me, againſt all the Adverſaries of God and the King.</q>
The ſecond was a confidence, that no man durſt to
<pb facs="tcp:4205:10"/>
queſtion ſo great a <hi>prophet,</hi> greater then which, was never raiſed up from the dead, to <hi>preach to Dives</hi> and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. And this he lets us know in his <hi>Apologie, p. 7.</hi>
               <q>I never ſo much as once dreamed (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) that impiety and impudencie it ſelfe, in ſuch a Chriſtian ſtate as this is, and under ſuch a gratious Prince, durſt ever thus publikely have called me in queſtion, and that upon the open ſtage, &amp;c.</q>
No marvell if ſo ſtrange a calling, ſeconded by ſo ſtrong a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſpurred him bravely on; and made him lift up both his voice and hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what ever <hi>is called God:</hi> and how know wee, but that in ſome of his ſpirituall raptures, he might faine an hope, that his dread name ſhould be as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the ſtories of ſucceeding times, as
<pb facs="tcp:4205:10"/>
               <hi>Muntzers,</hi> or King <hi>John of Leidens.</hi> But theſe imaginations failed him too, as his Court-hopes did. For contrary to what he dreamt (ſuch <hi>filthy dreamers, S. Jude</hi> ſpeakes of) <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Third of <hi>December</hi> next enſuing, a <hi>Purſuivant</hi> (as he tells the ſtorie) ſerved him with letters miſſive from the <hi>high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> to appeare before Doctor <hi>Duck</hi> at <hi>Cheſwick,</hi> then and there to take his oath to anſwere to ſuch Articles as were laid againſt him. Bold men, that durſt lay hands upon a Prophet of ſuch an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> calling, who if his power had been according to his ſpirit, would have commanded <hi>fire from heaven,</hi> to have burnt them all, or ſent them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off with a <hi>noli me tangere.</hi> But caught or not caught, all was one. For though it was no time to move the Court
<pb facs="tcp:4205:11"/>
for a Prohibition, being out of Terme, yet he bethought himſelfe of another way to elude his Judges: and that was by a ſtrange <hi>Appeale,</hi> being neither <hi>a grava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> nor <hi>a ſententia,</hi> to decline that Court; and put the cauſe immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Majeſties hands, where he might be, he thought, both a <hi>defendant</hi> and <hi>complainant,</hi> as he ſaith himſelfe. <hi>p. 1.</hi> of the <hi>Apologie.</hi> A fine invention doubtleſſe, but more ſine then fortunate. For on a new Contempt, as himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes us, he was ſuſpended by the <hi>high-Commiſſioners,</hi> both from his <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> and <hi>Office,</hi> and the ſuſpenſion pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed (as he now complaines) in his own Pariſh Church, to his intolerable diſgrace and ſcandall. <hi>Indignum facinus.</hi> Therfore that all the World might know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:4205:11"/>
and on what ſuſpended, <hi>Lo a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> (ſo he ſaith) <hi>is laid upon him,</hi> as formerly to Preach, now to Print his Sermon (for Sermon he will have it called, whoſoever ſaith nay.) And prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the laſt it was, as before was ſaid, and therewithall was printed alſo an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie</hi> for the ſaid <hi>Appeale,</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall addreſſes to the Kings moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majeſtie, to <hi>all the true-hearted Nobilitie</hi> of His Majeſties moſt hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Privie Counſell; and to the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Learned Judges</hi>: the Copies of them both being ſpread abroad, for the greater conſolation of the Brethren, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>This is the ſubſtance of the ſtorie, which I have here laid downe together
<pb facs="tcp:4205:12"/>
by way of <hi>preface,</hi> that with leſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption I might ply the Argument preſented to us, both in the <hi>Sermon</hi> and <hi>Apologie.</hi> For howſoever neither of them be conſiderable in regard of the Author, who ſince his being thruſt out of the Court, hath beene an open and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemie of the Publicke Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet in relation to the Church and Rulers of it, whom he endeavoureth to expoſe to the common hatred; and next in reference to the people, whom he hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to poſſeſſe with falſe and ſiniſter conceits of the preſent ſtate; it hath beene thought convenient by <hi>authority,</hi> that an Anſwer ſhould be made unto them. The preſervation of Religion is a thing ſo Sacred, that we cannot prize it to the height: and therefore they that labour to preſerve it, are of
<pb facs="tcp:4205:12"/>
all men, the moſt to be eſteemed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. <hi>Proximus diis habetur, per quem deorum majeſtas vindicatur,</hi> as the Hiſtorian rightly noted. So that wee cannot blame poore men, if they are ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and affrighted at thoſe ſcandalous ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which are diffuſed and ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, to make them think that Religion is in no ſmall danger: or if they hold a Reverend eſteeme of thoſe, who ſeeme to them to have a principall care thereof, and the ſafety of it. Onely they are to be admoniſhed, not to be too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in matters of ſo high a nature, till they are throughly certified of the trueth thereof: that they conceive not ill of the Church, their mother, upon the light and falſe reports of every male contented ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; or thinke them Champions of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who are indeed the bane, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbers
<pb facs="tcp:4205:13"/>
of it: That Faction in the <hi>Church,</hi> which Maſt. <hi>Burton,</hi> and his Copeſmates, have ſo much laboured to promote: hath ſince the <hi>firſt</hi> beginning of it accuſed the Church of <hi>England</hi> of the ſelfe ſame <hi>crimes,</hi> whereof they now pronounce her guilty: nor haue they found any new matter wherewithall to <hi>charge</hi> her, than that which <hi>their</hi> fore-fathers had beene hammering on in the times before them: yet they <hi>cry</hi> out with no leſſe violence but <hi>farre more</hi> malice, than <hi>their</hi> fathers did; and fill the minds of iealous and diſtruſtfull people with doubts and <hi>feares</hi> of innovations, of and in the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God, &amp; the whole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Religion; as if the bankes were broken downe, and <hi>Popery</hi> were breaking in a maine upon us; onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they can no longer be permitted to
<pb facs="tcp:4205:13"/>
violate all the orders of Gods Church, here by Law eſtabliſhed. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> and theſe men, how different ſoever they may ſeeme to bee in other matters, have, as it were by joynt conſent, agreed in this, to charge this Church with <hi>novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and innovations: the one eſpecially in the poynts of Doctrine; the other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in matters of exteriour order, &amp; the ſervice of God. But as we ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the one, that in the reformation of this Church, we introduced no <hi>novelties</hi> into the ſame, but onely laboured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce her to that eſtate and quality, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe was in her originall beauty, and the Primitive times: ſo may we ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other, that all thoſe <hi>Innovations</hi> which they have charged upon the Church in their ſcandalous Pamphlets, are but a reſtitution of thoſe ancient
<pb facs="tcp:4205:14"/>
orders, which were eſtabliſhed heere at that Reformation. This that the world might ſee, and ſee how ſcandalouſly and ſeditiouſly they traduce the Church; I was <hi>commanded</hi> by <hi>authority</hi> to returne an Anſwer to all the challenges and charges, in the ſaid two <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Apology</hi> of Maſter <hi>Burton.</hi> For being it was the leading Libell, in reſpect of time, (the principall matters in the <hi>Newes from Ipſwich,</hi> being bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from Maſter <hi>Burtons</hi> Sermon) and that thoſe many which have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are but a repetition of, and a dilating on thoſe poynts which are there contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: it was conceived, that bee being anſwered, the reſt would periſh of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. On this <hi>command</hi> I ſet my ſelfe unto the Work; and though I knew no credit could bee gotten from ſuch an
<pb facs="tcp:4205:14"/>
Adverſary, <hi>Vbi &amp; vincere inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um eſt, &amp; atteri ſordidum;</hi> and that there are a ſort of men, <hi>who hate to be reformed</hi> in the Pſalmiſts Language: yet being ſo commanded, I obeyed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, &amp; cannot but account it an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall honour to mee, to bee <hi>commanded</hi> any thing in the <hi>Churches</hi> ſervice. Beſides J could not but be grieved, to ſee my deareſt Mother traduced ſo fowly in things whereof I knew her guiltleſſe; and it had argued in mee a great want of Piety, not to have undertaken her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence herein, being called unto it. From which two great and grievous crimes, defect of piety, and true affection to the Church our mother; and diſobedience to the commands and orders of the higher powers; no leſſe than from the <hi>Plague and Peſtilence, good Lord deliver

deale with you, as if <hi>Coram,</hi> in the ſecond Perſon, which I perſwade my ſelf will better ſort with your ambition; the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> (if you remember ſo much of your <hi>Accidens</hi>) being more <hi>worthy then the third.</hi> And firſt, I would faine know what mooved you to <hi>appeale</hi> unto His Majeſtie at your firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting, before you had juſt grievance, or an unjuſt ſentence. Your conſcience ſure accuſed you, and pronounced you guiltie, and told you what you ſhould expect in a legall triall: and on the other ſide your preſumption flattered you, that being an <hi>Old Courtier,</hi> though <hi>worn out of favour,</hi> you might have ſome friend there to promote your ſuite. Sir you forget it ſeemes, what is related in the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at <hi>Hampion Court,</hi> in the ſelf ſame caſe.
<q>My L. of <hi>London,</hi> moved his M<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>. that then was [K. <hi>James</hi> of B. memory] that <hi>Pulpits</hi> might not be made <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quils</hi> (Pray ſir mark this well) wherin every humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or diſcontented fellow might traduce his <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors.</hi> This the King very gratiouſly accepted, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly reproving that as a lewd cuſtom, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that if he ſhould but heare of ſuch a one in a <hi>Pulpit,</hi> He would make him an example: (this is juſt your caſe) And that if any thing were amiſſe in the Church Officers, not to make the <hi>Pulpit</hi> a place of perſonall reproofe, but to let His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie heare of it, yet by degrees. Firſt let com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint be made unto the <hi>Ordinarie</hi> of the place, from him to goe to the Archbiſhop; from him, to the Lords of the <hi>Counſell,</hi> and from them, if in all theſe places no remedie is found, to his own ſelf:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4205:18"/>
which Caveat His Majeſtie put in, for that the B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. of <hi>London</hi> had told him, that if he left himſelf open to admit of all complaints, neither His Majeſtie ſhould ever be quiet, nor his under Officers regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: ſeeing that now already, no fault can be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, but preſently the delinquent threatneth a complaint to the King.</q>
Here is a long gradation, and that after cenſure: but you will venter on the King, <hi>per ſaltem,</hi> not by faire degrees; and that not only before cenſure, but before any grievance to be complained of. The King would quickly have his hands full, were that courſe allowed of; and wee muſt needs conceive him God, as well by nature, as reſemblance: it being impoſſible he ſhould have any ſpare time left, either to eare, ſleepe, or refreſh his Spirits, or whatſoever other buſineſſe doth concern this life, or ſhew him mortall.</p>
            <p>But wee muſt needs conceive, there was ſome ſpeciall reaſon in it, which might induce you to cry out, before you were hurt; more then the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Articles</hi> which were read vnto you; or your own guiltie conſcience, which had precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned you. Yes ſure, for you except againſt as well the <hi>incompetencie of the Judges,</hi> as the <hi>illegall manner of proceedings in the high Commiſsion.</hi> The Judges you except againſt (excepting thoſe <hi>hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Nobles, Judges, Counſellers of ſtate, which are ſeldome there</hi>) as <hi>parties in the cauſe, and adverſaries to your perſon for the cauſes ſake</hi>; p. 6. <hi>parties,</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4205:19"/>
Suppoſe them parties, and what then? Then by the <hi>Lawes of God and nature,</hi> as alſo by the <hi>Common, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and Civill Lawes,</hi> they <hi>are prohibited from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judges.</hi> This is the firſt Crutch your <hi>Appeale</hi> halts with; and this will faile you. For howſoever it be true, in ordinary courſe, that no man can be Judge in his own cauſe, there where the cauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes himſelf in his own particular; yet it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in a body aggregate, or a publick perſon. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in time of <hi>Parliament,</hi> a man ſhould taxe that great aſſembly with ſome grievous crime, ſhould the whole body be diſabled from proceeding with him? Or that a man ſhould raiſe ſome odious ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall on my Lords the <hi>Judges,</hi> ſhould he eſcape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed becauſe there is none elſe to judge him? Or that ſome ſawcie fellow behaves himſelf audaciouſly and <hi>Contra bonos mores,</hi> before the <hi>Juſtices</hi> on the bench, at their <hi>Quarter Seſſions</hi>; ſhould not the Bench have power to bind him to his good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? Or that a man within the Liberties of <hi>London,</hi> ſhould ſay a fig for my Lord <hi>Major,</hi> might not my Lord <hi>Major</hi> clap him in the <hi>Counter</hi>? And yet the Parliament, and the Judges and the Juſtices, and the Lord <hi>Major</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> are aſmuch parties in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; as the Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Chancellors, and the reſt of the <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> are by you ſaid, and only ſaid, to be in the other. For that they are not parties, wee ſhall ſee anon, when wee ſhall come to cleere them of thoſe imputations, which in a furious zeal you have laid upon them.</p>

you leave to ſpeake the trueth, which is the Office of a <hi>Preacher</hi>; and fall upon Seditious, falſe and factious diſcourſes, to inflame the people, and bring them into ill opinion, both of their King, and thoſe to whom the goverment of the Church is by him intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; you are no more a <hi>Preacher,</hi> but a <hi>Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> a dangerous <hi>Boutefeu,</hi> and <hi>Incendiarie,</hi> as you have beene hitherto. That this is true, ſhall be moſt plainly manifeſted in the <hi>Anatomie</hi> of your Sermon, (for wee will call it ſo to pleaſe you) where the charge is preſſed.</p>
            <p>A ſecond reaſon which you have to prove them your <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> is that <hi>they have uſurped ſuch a title of juriſdiction, as cannot conſiſt with that title of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, which the Law of the Land hath annexed to the Crown Imperiall,</hi> p. 7.

But this being objected to them in that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4205:20"/>
alſo; we ſhall there meet with it. One thing I muſt take with me now, for feare I find it not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. You ſay the Biſhops exerciſe their Epiſcopall juriſdiction, in their own names and rights only, not in his Majeſties name and right, <hi>to the manifeſt breach of their oathes aforeſaid.</hi> Alas poore Prelates, caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your Rochets, and reſigne all to Brother <hi>B.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had indited you at the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> for uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation; and now he files a bill againſt you in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> as in caſe of perjurie.
For he aſſures us, that <q>the Statute, 1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. uniting all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall whatſoever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Imperiall Crowne of this Realme, enacteth the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and Allegeance <hi>eo nomine,</hi> to that very end and purpoſe, that none ſhould preſume to exerciſe any Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within this Realme, but by virtue of the Kings Letters Patents, and in the Kings Majeſties name and right</q> 
               <hi>Qui nunquam riſiſtis nunc ridete.</hi>
Here's ſuch a piece of learned ignorance, as would make <hi>Heraclitus</hi> laugh; It ſeemes you had no conference of late with your <hi>learned Counſell</hi>; who, had he ſeene this paſſage, might have marred the merriment; For pray you Sir, was the Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> enacted 1. of <hi>Elizabeth</hi>? Then certainly my books deceive me, in which it is reported to have been enacted 3. <hi>Jacobi,</hi> on the occaſion of the Gunpouder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And for the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> made indeed 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> was it enacted <hi>eo nomine,</hi> to that end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as you pleaſe to tell us? What? that no Biſhop might proceed in exerciſe of his ordinary Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4205:21"/>
Authoritie, without eſpeciall <hi>Letters Patents</hi>; and in the Queenes Majeſties Name and right on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Find you in all the Statute any mention of <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> more then in and for the erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and eſtabliſhment of the <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſe of that ſupreme, and higheſt juriſdiction of right inveſted in the Crowne? as for the Oath, look it well over once againe, if there be any one word which reflecteth that way, of ſuing out eſpeciall <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents</hi> by the Party ſworne, for the diſcharge of the authoritie committed to him; or that makes mention of the Queenes name to be uſed therein. Aſſuredly, learned ſir, that Oath was framed, to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the aboliſhment of all forreine power and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, ſuch as the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> had lately practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this Kingdom; and for no other end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Or if it were enacted, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> to that end and purpoſe, that none ſhould exerciſe any Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall juriſdiction within this Realme, but by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Kings (or Queenes) Letters Patents: then certainly it muſt be thought, that all, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Temporall Judge, Juſtice, Major, and other lay and temporall <hi>Officer</hi> or Miniſter; all that take wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the King in any of His dominions, thoſe that ſue out their Livery, or <hi>Ouſtre le maine</hi>; young Schollars in the Univerſitie, when they take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, or finally, whoſoever is required by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute to take that Oath; have in them a capacitie of Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall, but may not exerciſe the ſame without <hi>Letters Patents</hi>: or elſe muſt forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with take up armes againſt thoſe that doe. As for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4205:21"/>
that clauſe which followes after, <hi>And in the Kings Majeſties name and right,</hi> that's juſt like the reſt. It was indeed enacted ſo, in ſome certaine caſes. 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 2. but was repealed by Parliament, 1. <hi>Mar. c.</hi> 2. and ſtood repealed all the reigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and therefore could not be intended in the ſtatute 1<hi rend="sup">0</hi>. I ſee Sir, you are as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in the <hi>Law,</hi> as in the <hi>Goſpell:</hi> and marveile that you have not mooted all this while in ſome Inne of <hi>Chancery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lets on Sir to thoſe other Arguments which you have ſtudied, to prove the <hi>High Commiſsioners</hi> to be your <hi>adverſaries</hi>; and if we follow your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they are three in number: but <hi>ſtilo novo</hi> we ſhall finde but one, and that one worth nothing. Firſt, they <hi>who are adverſaries of God and the King, are your adverſaries, p.</hi> 9. Secondly, they <hi>which are Chriſts enemies are your enemies.</hi> And thirdly, they <hi>which are the Kings enemies are your enemies. p.</hi> 10. This is as good as <hi>handy dandy,</hi> pretty ſport for Children. I hope you will not divide <hi>Chriſt</hi> from God, and I am ſure you cannot divide the King from himſelfe. Let then your three argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments paſſe this once for one: and ſhew us how you meane to prove, that the Biſhops are the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of God and the King. That's made as cleare as all the reſt, by arguing a <hi>non-conceſsis pro conceſsis</hi>; by taking it for granted, becauſe you ſay it, that they are <hi>dangerous innovators, hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Goſpell, oppoſers of his Majeſties Lawes, Proclamations, and Declarations againſt all innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4205:22"/>
of religion, &amp;c.</hi> What proofe you have of this, more then your owne bare <hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> we ſhall ſee hereafter: and when we ſee it, we will anſwer to it as we ſee occaſion. Meane while, I would faine know how this concernes you, more then others: why any ſchiſmaticke or delinquent may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſelfe ſame reaſons, to decline the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Court, as well as you. Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> tels us of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that he was taken <hi>in conſorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um individuae Trinitatis</hi>; and doubtleſſe you deride him for it: yet in effect, you take as much unto your ſelfe. Gods cauſe and yours are ſo alike, of ſuch neere kinne to one another, that they are hard to be diſtinguiſhed. Our Saviour Chriſt hath no advantage of you, but that hee was the <hi>firſt-begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> and therefore is your <hi>elder brother</hi>: As for the King, according to the <hi>Puritan tenet,</hi> he's but a Miniſter of the State, onely a ſworne Bailiffe of the Common wealth, and to be called unto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt when the people pleaſe: the Saints, <hi>i. e.</hi> your ſelfe and ſuch as you, being kings indeed, to whom the earth belongs of right, and the fulneſſe of it; and at whoſe feete, in caſe the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline were once eſtabliſhed, all Kings and Princes of the world muſt lay downe their ſcepters, <hi>Huic diſciplinae omnes orbis Principes &amp; Monarchas faſces ſuos ſubmittere, &amp; parere neceſſe eſt.</hi> As your friend <hi>Travers</hi> ſtated it in his booke of <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> Yes marry Sir, now I perceive there's ſomewhat in it, why Gods cauſe, Chriſts, the King, and yours, are ſo linked together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:4205:22"/>So farre we have gone after you, or with you rather, to ſee how you could juſtifie your <hi>Appeale,</hi> as it related to the <hi>incompetencie of the Iudges</hi>: wee muſt next looke upon you whileſt you pleade your cauſe, as it reflects upon the <hi>illegality of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</hi> And this you branch into two parts alſo, (for you are excellent at making a <hi>diviſion</hi>:) the one generall which concernes their uſuall practiſe in all other caſes; the other particular, in your owne caſe, <hi>p.</hi> 11. It had beene fitter ſure you had left out the generall, and fallen on the particular onely: for in ſuch things, which are, you ſay, their <hi>uſuall practiſe,</hi> what cauſe have you to make <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale</hi> more then other men. And ſhould all other men take liberty to decline the Court, that would diſlike their courſe and manner of proceedings: his Majeſty might quickly call in the <hi>Commiſsion,</hi> as an vnneceſſary thing, of no uſe at all. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely was put in to beget an <hi>Odium</hi> to that Court, and buzze into the peoples heads (who if once ſeaſoned with your leaven, are apt to credit it) that the proceedings there are contrary to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>y, to law, to charity, and utterly againſt the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Kings good ſubjects. But being put in, we muſt doe what we can to raſe it out againe: and therefore ſpeake, what is it that you are agrieved at in their uſuall practiſe.
<q>Your firſt exception is againſt the oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> in which you ſay they doe tranſgreſſe in three particulars: firſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it is exacted of the delinquent, before a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of the Articles or Libell is exhibited unto
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4205:23"/>
him; and ſecondly in that the <hi>deponent</hi> is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to have a copy of the Articles, before he doth depoſe unto them, that he may anſwer to them by adviſe of <hi>Counſell</hi>: both which, you ſay, are contrary unto the practiſe of all the other Courts of Iuſtice. Thirdly, in that the oath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted is contrary both unto <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>charity</hi>; to <hi>faith,</hi> in that an oath ſo taken muſt needes be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a <hi>raſh oath,</hi> and ſo againſt the nine and thirtieth Article of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; to <hi>charity,</hi> in that it makes a man to accuſe his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and betray himſelfe, and ſo againſt that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall maxime, <hi>nemo tenetur prodere ſeipſum,</hi> p. 11. and 12.</q>
This is the ſumme of what you ſay, (for that which followes of putting in <hi>Additionals</hi> to the information, on the diſcovery of new matter, was not worth the ſaying:) and all this is no more, but <hi>quod dictum prius,</hi> that which hath formerly beene alledged, and already anſwered, your <hi>learned Counſell</hi> furniſhed you with theſe particulars, when you were both delinquents in that Court together: and he might doe it eaſily without much ſtudy. They were collected before hee was borne, and by ſome that had as evill will to the Church as he, and ſpred abroad amongſt that party in Queene <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeths</hi> time: but very learnedly refelled by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Coſin,</hi> then <hi>Deane of the Arches,</hi> to whom for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities ſake I might well referre you.</p>
            <p>Yet ſince your libell is made publicke, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed abroad, I will in briefe lay downe ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers as are made by him, to your ſeverall cavils;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4205:23"/>
adding a little of mine owne, and one thing ſpecially for your ſatisfaction which he could not know of. In anſwer to the firſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>part</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</note> he tels you (if you would have learned) that though the Articles or Libell, be not exhibed <hi>inſcriptis,</hi> before the oath, yet that the <hi>generall heads</hi> are ſignified and opened to the party criminall: which was obſerved, as you confeſſe, in your particular: For you informe us in the beginning of your Apologie, that <hi>the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of your Appeale was upon the reading of certaine Articles unto you, by the Regiſter of the Court before Doctor</hi> Duck, <hi>and by his appointment who thereupon tendred unto you an oath to anſwer to the ſaid Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> This was as much favour as could be ſhowne you, and more then needed. The reaſon why the Articles are not given <hi>in ſcriptis,</hi> is chiefely upon obſervation, that ſome of thoſe to whom that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour hath beene ſhowne, have uſed it onely as a meanes to inſtruct their confederates, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing or the diſguizing of the truth; (a thing of dangerous conſequence in puniſhment of <hi>Schiſmes, Hereſies,</hi> and ſuch other things which this Court takes notice of:) themſelves, upon peruſall of the Articles, remaining ſtill as obſtinate in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall of the oath, as they were before. Nor is it generally contrary to the practiſe of the Common-law, as it is pretended; the <hi>grand inqueſt</hi> taking an oath before the Iudges, that <hi>they ſhall diligently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and truely preſent all offenders againſt any ſuch point, as ſhall be given them in charge</hi>: and yet the charge not given till the oath be taken. As to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4205:24"/>
ſecond, touching the adviſe of <hi>Counſell</hi> to draw up the anſwer, that's univerſall neither in law nor pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. For on inditements at the <hi>common law</hi> upon life and death, there is no counſell given the party to draw up his anſwer. And in proceedings in the <hi>Starre-chamber, Chancery</hi> and <hi>Court of requeſts,</hi> however they commence ſuites there by bill and anſwer: yet when they come to <hi>interrogatories,</hi> the parties firſt take oath to anſwer truely to the points; and then the <hi>Interrogatories</hi> are propoſed unto them peece by peece, in the <hi>Examiners of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> Beſides that in ſuch <hi>Caſes,</hi> as principally doe concerne the high <hi>Commiſsion,</hi> it hath not beene thought ſit to admit of <hi>Counſell,</hi> for drawing up an anſwer unto the Articles objected; the better to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide delaies, and that foule palliating of <hi>ſchiſmes,</hi> and <hi>errors,</hi> which might thence ariſe.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt part of the third exception, it's true, that <hi>vaine and raſh ſwearing</hi> is condemned by the nine and thirtieth Article: but then it reſteth to be proved, that taking of an oath to anſwer to the points propoſed, doth come within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of raſh ſwearing. For howſoever men are ſworne aforehand, in the proceedings of that Court, to anſwere truely to the things objected, when they come to <hi>heare them</hi>; yet they are never ſworne to anſwer to them <hi>before they heare them.</hi> And for the breach of charity, and the old ſaid ſaw,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>part.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> 
               <hi>Nemo tenetur prodere ſeipſum,</hi> 'tis anſwered, that the oath is not exacted in things meerely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, which are left to God (for <hi>de occultis eccleſia
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4205:24"/>
non judicat,</hi> as the ſaying is,) but in ſuch caſes which are partly manifeſted, as by bruite or fame, and ſuch like <hi>indicia,</hi> in which the Church is to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. And in this caſe and ſuch as theſe the oath is tendred, not to betray the party whom it doth concerne, but rather, if it be poſſible to cleare his innocency; on both ſides to bring truth to light, which is a Iewell worth the finding.

               <hi>illegality of proceeding</hi> in it, you have no leſſe then tenne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; you might have ſpunne them out as you doe your <hi>uſes,</hi> to as many more. Theſe wee will ſumme up briefly, that the world may ſee them; and afterwards reply to ſuch as are conſiderable, though peradventure we may touch at all, for your ſatisfaction. Firſt, you except in reference to the matter charged upon, which was ſedition, and ſo belonging to the Civill Courts; and ſecondly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the manner of proceeding, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you to a private houſe, before one Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner alone; ſecondly, excluding your friends and neighbours that they might not heare; thirdly, in tendring you an oath in a matter, which if true concernd your life; fourthly, in calling for a copy of your Sermon to be delivered upon oath; fifthly, in that you were ſuſpended, being abſent; ſixthly, notwithſtanding your appeale; ſeventhly, and the ſuſpenſion publiſhed in your owne pariſh Church, to your intollerable diſgrace and ſcandall; eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in taxing you of ſedition in the ſaid ſuſpenſion; and ninthly, in denying you a <hi>Copy</hi> of the Articles, and other Acts of Court, whereby to perfect that appeale to his ſacred Majeſty. Of all theſe tenne, there are but two conſiderable, (the other eight
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4205:25"/>
being onely added to make up the tale:) to wit, of the matter charged upon you, which was ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and then the tendring of an oath in the ſaid matter, being a crime, which might if true, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne you, in point of life. For that you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented before <hi>one Commiſsioner</hi> alone, at his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſe is no rare matter; that his conventing of you being onely to tender you an oath, to make true anſwer to thoſe Articles which were read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: there being a particular clauſe in the very Commiſſion, that any one Commiſſioner may give the oath to party or witneſſe. And why you ſhould bring your friends and neighbours with you; or being there, why ſhould you thinke to have them preſent at your examination is beyond my reach: unleſſe perhaps you were deſirous to let them ſee how valiantly you durſt out-face autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. You cannot be ſo ignorant, having had bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe in that Court before, as not to know, that though the party cited doe for the moſt part take his oath in the open Court, to make true anſwer, whenſoever he is called unto it: Yet the <hi>examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are in <hi>private,</hi> in ſome other place.

and by the <hi>Vice-chancellours</hi> there done of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe. And it ſeemes wonderous ſtrange to me, you ſhould deny to give a private Copy of your <hi>Sermon,</hi> when it was required of you by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: and notwithſtanding publiſh it in Print a little after, being not required. As for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> (whoſe caſe you parallell with your owne upon all occaſions) who being demanded of his doctrine by the <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> made anſwer, <hi>that he ſpake openly in the Synagogue, and in the Temple, and ſaid nothing in ſecret, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they might aske the queſtion of thoſe that heard him</hi>: that makes nothing for you. And yet from hence you draw a moſt factious inference, that <hi>no Miniſter ought to be put ſo much as to give an anſwer, much leſſe a Copy of what he publickely preached in the Church p.</hi> 15.16. The caſe is very different between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and you, though you make it one: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded of his doctrine in the generall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out particulars, either time or place, or any matter charged upon him; you being queſtioned for a Sermon preached at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a place, containing ſuch and ſuch ſeditious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious paſſages, as were reade unto you. Leſſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have you to complaine of being ſuſpended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſent, becauſe being warned to be there, you refuſed to come: or that you were ſuſpended not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your appeale, to his ſacred Majeſty, ſince your ſuſpenſion, as you grant, was grounded on a new contempt, not the firſt refuſall of the oath. That the ſuſpenſion ſhould be publiſhed in your
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4205:26"/>
owne Pariſh Church, and that therein you ſhould be taxed of ſedition; was both juſt and neceſſary. For if you were convented firſt, becauſe of your ſeditious Sermon, and a ſeditious Sermon Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to your owne Pariſhioners: good reaſon that your cenſure ſhould be publiſhed there, where you committed your offence, that ſo the people might beware of the like falſe teachers. And for denying you a <hi>Copy of the Articles,</hi> and other <hi>Acts of Court,</hi> I ſee no cauſe at all why you ſhould demand them. For having at the firſt declined the judgement of that Court, by the refuſall of the oath, and your ſaid <hi>Appeale</hi>; and afterwards contemptuouſly neglected your appearance on the ſecond ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: what cauſe had you to expect any favour from them, or to conſult thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> which you cared not for; Eſpecially conſidering you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtill in your diſobedience, and deſired the <hi>Articles,</hi> not to anſwer to them, but thereby, as you ſay your ſelfe to perfect your <hi>Appeale</hi>; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as it may be thought, to ſcatter them abroad in imperfect copies, with ſuch falſe anſwers to them as you pleaſed to make. Your ſelfe and ſuch as you, have long uſed the art,<note place="margin">Tacit. in vica Agricolae.</note> of getting the firſt ſtart upon mens affections: <hi>non ignari inſtandum famae, &amp; prout prima ſucceſſerint fore vniverſa.</hi>

            <p>But come we now unto the maine of your <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale,</hi> in reference to the illegality of proceedings in your owne particular: for all that hath beene anſwered hitherto, was but the vantage as it were, which you caſt in out of your abundance, to make
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4205:27"/>
up the reckoning. It is pretended, that being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with <hi>ſedition,</hi> you were not bound to anſwer to it. And why? <hi>Becauſe ſedition is no eccleſiaſticall offence againſt the Church, but a civill againſt the King and State; and therefore to be tried onely in his Majeſties Courts of Civill Iuſtice, and not before the</hi> High Commiſſioners, <hi>who have no cognizance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> Your Enthimeme doth halt extreamely. For there are many matters puniſhable in either juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which ſince you are ignorant, I will name you ſome. <hi>Vſury,</hi> contrary to the ſtatute, 21. <hi>Iac. c.</hi> 17. is puniſhable at the <hi>Common-law,</hi> and it is alſo puniſhable in the <hi>Court Chriſtian</hi>; as in the 109. Canon. The ſelfe ſame Canon reckoneth <hi>drunkenneſſe and ſwearing,</hi> as puniſhable by the <hi>Ordinary</hi> upon preſentment: and yet are puniſhable by the <hi>Civill Magistrate,</hi> by vertue of two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtatutes, <hi>viz.</hi> 4. <hi>Iac.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Iac.</hi> and 21. <hi>Iac.</hi> 20. So for prohibited, either workes or recreations on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> the parties ſo offending are by the Statute 1 <hi>Car. c.</hi> 1. &amp; 3. <hi>Car. c.</hi> 1. to be convented and corrected by the <hi>Iuſtices of the Peace</hi>: and yet there is a <hi>ſalvo</hi> there, for the <hi>Eccleſiasticall</hi> juriſdiction to proceed as formerly.

But if you preach ſeditiouſly, and make the Houſe and Ordinance of God, onely a <hi>Pandar</hi> to your diſcontent or your ambition, I hope my Lords the <hi>Iudges</hi> will not be offended, if your <hi>Superiours in the Lord</hi> doe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe you for it, yet this, at laſt, you make a <hi>juſt gravamen,</hi> upon the which you might appeale. But had you thought indeed, as you ſay you doe, that the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Commſsioners,</hi> could take no cognizance of the crime objected to you: you might with better hopes have labored for a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, as formerly you did upon weaker grounds; then runne your ſelfe ſo haſtily on a new experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of making an <hi>Appeale,</hi> when you were not grieved.

               <hi>Whitgift</hi> in the conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> ſaying, as you report his words, <hi>that in matter of life, liberty, and ſcandall, it is not the courſe of that Court to require any ſuch oath:</hi> wherein you doe moſt ſhameleſſely miſreport the words of the ſaid Arch-Biſhop. All that he ſaid, is this, which will helpe you little, <hi>viz. If any Article did touch the party any way, either for life, liberty, or ſcandall, he might refuſe to anſwer, neither was he urged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</hi> He doth not ſay, as you make him ſay, that in thoſe caſes there recited, <hi>it was not the courſe of that Court, to require any ſuch oath,</hi> but that the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might refuſe to anſwer to thoſe Articles</hi> which did ſo concerne him. It is the cuſtome of the Court to give an oath unto the party, to anſwer truely to ſuch Articles as ſhall be propounded: and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of the Court, at the examination, that if the party will, he may chalenge any of them, as not being bound by law to anſwer to them; and his refuſall, if the law binde him not to anſwer, is to be allowed.</p>
            <p>You might then, ſubtile Sir, have tooke the oath; <hi>and yet demurred on any</hi> ſuch Article, when you came unto it.

A Text indeed well
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4205:29"/>
choſen but not well applyed. For had you looked upon your ſelfe and the Text together, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the direction which is therein given you, you had not ſo long hunted after <hi>Innovations,</hi> as for theſe many yeares it is knowne you have; and ſo might poſſibly have eſcaped that calamitie which is now like to fall upon you. But it's the nature of your humour, as of ſome diſeaſes, to turne all things unto the nouriſhment of the part that is ill affected: Meane while you make the Scriptures but a <hi>noſe of wax,</hi> as <hi>Pighius</hi> once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanly called it; by wreſting it maliciouſly to ſerve your turnes; and ſo confirme the vulgar <hi>Papiſts</hi> in contempt of that, which were it not for you, and ſuch as you, they might more eaſily bee induced both to heare and reverence. Now for the method of your <hi>Sermon</hi> (I meane to call it ſo no more) though you obſerve no method in it, but wander up and downe in repetitions and <hi>tautologies,</hi> as your cuſtome is: I muſt thus diſpoſe it. The paſſages therein, either of ſcandall or ſedition, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce eſpecially unto theſe two heads: thoſe which reflect upon the Kings moſt excellent Majeſtie, and thoſe which ſtrike directly againſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. That which reflects upon the King, either relates to his authoritie, or his actions. That which doth ſtrike againſt the Biſhops is to be conſidered as it is referred either unto their place, or to their perſons, or finally to their proceedings: and theſe proceedings are againe to bee conſidered, eyther in reference to their Courts, and behaviour there,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4205:30"/>
or to their government of and in the Church, and carriage in that weighty office, wherein you charge them with eight kinds of Innovations, moſt of the generall kinds being ſub-divided into ſeveral bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For a concluſion of the whole, I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto your ſelfe, by way of Corollarie, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultancie out of all the premiſſes, how farre you are or may prove guilty of ſedition, for that Pulpit paſquill of yours: and ſo commend you to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the grace of God. In ripping up where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as I ſhall keepe my ſelfe eſpecially to your <hi>Pulpit-Paſquill</hi>: ſo if I meete with any <hi>variae lectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> in your <hi>Apologie,</hi> or <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> or the <hi>Newes from Ipſwich,</hi> or your addreſſes to the Lords of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Councell, and my Lords the Iudges, I ſhall uſe them alſo either for <hi>explication</hi> or for <hi>application.</hi> Such your extravagancies, as cannot eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the former heads, I either ſhall paſſe over, or but touch in <hi>tranſitu.</hi> This is the order I ſhall uſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt for the King, you may remember what I told you was the <hi>Puritan tenet,</hi> that Kings are but the Miniſters of the Common-wealth, and that they have no more authority then what is given them by the people. This though you doe not ſay expreſly, and <hi>in terminis,</hi> yet you come very neare it, to a <hi>tantamont:</hi> finding great fault with that unlimited power which ſome give to Kings, and as alſo with that abſolute obedience which is exacted of the ſubject. One of your doctrines is, that <hi>all our obedience to Kings and princes and other
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4205:30"/>
ſuperiors muſt be regulated by our obedience to God.</hi> Your reaſon is, <hi>becauſe the King is Gods Miniſter and Vice-gerent,</hi> and <hi>commands as from God, ſo for God, and in God.</hi> Your doctrine and your reaſon, might become a right honeſt man. But whats your uſe?
<q>Your firſt uſe is, for reprehenſion or refutation of thoſe that ſo advance mans ordinances and commandements, as though they be contrary to Gods Law, and the fundamentall lawes of the State, yet ſo preſſe men to the obedience of them as they hold them for no better then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, and to deſerve to be hanged drawne and quartered that refuſe to obey them, pag. 77. So pag. 88. a ſecond ſort come here to be reproved, that on the other ſide ſeparate the feare of the King from the feare of the Lord: and thoſe are ſuch as attribute to Kings ſuch an unlimited power, as if he were God Almightie himſelfe; ſo as hereby they would ſeeme to aſcribe that omnipotency to the King which the <hi>Pope</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes, and his Paraſites aſcribe to his holineſſe. So pag. 89. Thus theſe men crying up, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting univerſall abſolute obedience to man, they doe hereby caſt the feare of God, and ſo his Throne, downe to the ground.</q>
               <q>Finally you reckon it amongſt the <hi>Innovations</hi> wherewith you charge the <hi>Prelats</hi> in point of <hi>doctrine,</hi> that they have laboured to make a change in the doctrine of <hi>obedience to ſuperiours,</hi> ſetting man ſo in Gods Throne, that all obedience to man muſt be abſolute without regard to God and <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:4205:31"/>
whoſe onely rule is the word of God, pag. 126.</q>
In all which paſſages, however you pretend the word of God, the fundamentall Lawes of ſtate, and conſcience: yet clearely you expreſſe your diſaffection unto the ſoveraignty of Princes, and in effect leave them no greater power then every private man ſhall thinke fit to give them. Beſides there is a tacite implication alſo, that the King exerciſes an unlimited power, which cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conſiſt with the ſubjects conſcience, the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall lawes of the Kingdome, or the word of God. It had beene very well done of you to have told the people, what were the fundamentall lawes of State, which were ſo carefully to be preſerved; within what bounds and limits the authority of Kings is to be confined, and to have given them a more ſpeciall knowledge of the rule of conſcience. For dealing thus in generalls onely, (<hi>Doloſus verſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in generalibus,</hi> you know who ſayd it) you have preſented to the people a moſt excellent ground, not onely to diſpute, but to diſobey the Kings commands.</p>
            <p>Now Sir I pray you what are you, or by what ſpirit are you guided, that you ſhould finde your ſelfe agreeved at unlimited power, which ſome of better underſtanding then your ſelfe have given to Kings: or thinke it any Innovation in point of doctrine, in caſe the doctrine of obedience to our ſuperiours bee preſſed more home of late then it hath beene formerly. Surely you have lately ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died <hi>Buchannan dejure regni,</hi> or the <hi>vindiciae</hi> writ
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4205:31"/>
by <hi>Beza</hi> under the name of <hi>Iunius Brutus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Rom. cap. 13. Inſtitut. lib. 4. c. ult.</note> or elſe perhaps you went no further then <hi>Paraeus,</hi> where the inferiour Magiſtrates, or <hi>Calvin,</hi> where the three eſtates have an authority to controule, and correct the King. And ſhould the King be limited within thoſe narrow bounds which you would preſcribe him, had you power; he would in little time be like the antient Kings of <hi>Sparta,</hi> in which the <hi>Ephori,</hi> or the now Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> in which the Senate beare the greateſt ſtroke: himſelfe meane time, being a bare ſound, and an emptie name, <hi>Stet magni nominis umbra,</hi> in the Poets language.<note place="margin">Lucan.</note> Alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy you have layd ſuch grounds, by which each private man may not alone diſpute but diſobey the Kings commandements. For if the Subject ſhall conceive that the Kings command is contrary to Gods word, though indeede it be not; or to the fundamentall lawes of ſtate, although hee cannot tell which be fundamentall; or if he finde no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of the like commands in holy Scripture, which you have made to be the onely rule of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:</hi> in all theſe caſes it is lawfull not to yeeld <hi>obedience.</hi> Your ſelfe have given us one caſe in your Margin, pag. 77. we will put the other.
<q>Your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion is of thoſe, that ſo advance mans ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and commandements, as though they be contrary to Gods Law, and the fundamentall lawes of ſtate, yet preſſe men to obedience to them,</q>
               <q>your inſtance is of one which was ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatned (how true that is we meane to tell the world hereafter) for refuſing to doe that which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4205:32"/>
was not agreeable to the word of God, <hi>viz.</hi> for refuſing to read the booke of ſports, as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it in the Margin, pag. 26. whether you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre us.</q>
So then the caſe is this. The King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his people honeſt recreations on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> according as had beene accuſtomed, till you and your accomplices had cryed it downe: with order to the Biſhops to ſee <hi>his declaration pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the Churches of their ſeverall dioceſſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively.</hi> This <hi>publication</hi> you conceive to bee repugnant to Gods word, (though none but a few factious ſpirits ever ſo conceived it, and that your doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> be contrary to all antiquity and moderne Churches:) and therefore by your rule they doe very well that refuſe to publiſh it. It's true indeed, in things that are directly contrary to the law of God, &amp; ſuch as carry in them a plaine and manifeſt impietie; there is no queſtion to be made, but it is <hi>better to obey God then man.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 4.</note> But when the matter chiefly reſteth either in miſapplying, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding the word of God, (a fault too incide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ignorant &amp; unſtable men, &amp; to none more then to your diſciples &amp; their teachers too) or that the word of God be made a <hi>property</hi> like the <hi>Phariſees Corban,</hi> to juſtifie your diſobedience unto Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: your rule is then as falſe, as your action faulty. So for your ſecond limitation, that's but little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and leaves a ſtarting hole to malicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, from whence to worke on the affections of the common people. For put the caſe, the King in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and emergent cauſes, touching the ſafety
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4205:32"/>
of his empire, demand the preſent ayde of all his ſubjects; and any <hi>Tribunitian</hi> ſpirit ſhould informe them, that this demand is contrary unto the <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall lawes of ſtate</hi>: according to your rule, the ſubject is not bound to obey the king, nay he might refuſe it, although the buſines doth concerne eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his owne preſervation. But your third limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that of <hi>conſcience,</hi> is the worſt of all. For where you make the word of God to be the onely rule of <hi>conſcience,</hi> you doe thereby conclude ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely that neither Eccleſiaſticall or Civill ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances doe binde the conſcience: and therein over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Apoſtles doctrine, who would have <hi>Every ſoule be ſubject to the higher powers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.5.</note> 
               <hi>not for wrath onely but for conſcience ſake.</hi> So that in caſe the king command us any thing, for which we finde not ſome plaine precept or particular warrant in the word of God; as if the King command all <hi>Lecturers</hi> to read the ſervice of the Church in their <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oodes and ſurplices,</hi> before their <hi>Lectures</hi>; ſuch his command is plainely againſt <hi>conſcience,</hi> at leaſt the <hi>Lecturers</hi> are not bound in <hi>conſcience</hi> to ſubmit unto it, becauſe there is no ſpeciall precept for it in holy Scripture. And certainely this plea of conſcience, is the moſt dangerous buckler againſt authoritie, which in theſe latter ages hath beene taken up. So dangerous that were the plea allowed, and all the judgements of the king <hi>in banco,</hi> permitted to bee ſcanned and traverſed in this <hi>Court of Conſcience</hi>; there were a preſent end of all obedience. <hi>Si ubi jubeantur, quaerere ſingulis liceat, peunte obſequio,</hi>

I hope you would not call a <hi>Conſiſtorie</hi> and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4205:34"/>
convent him there; or arme the people to aſſert their pretended liberties: though as before I ſaid, the <hi>Puritan tenet</hi> is, that you may doe both. Your learned Councell might have told you out of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton,</hi> an ancient Lawyer of this kingdome, <hi>omnem eſſe ſub Rege &amp; ipſum ſub nullo, ſed tantum ſub Deo</hi>; And <hi>Horace</hi> could have told you, that kings are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der none but God. <hi>Reges in ipſos imperium eſt Iovis,</hi> as he there hath it. You may moreover pleaſe to know, what <hi>Gregorie</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> ſaid once to a king of <hi>France; Si quis e nobis, O Rex, juſtitiae tramites tranſcendere voluerit, a te corripi poteſt; ſi vero tu exceſſeris quis te corripiet? &amp;c.</hi>
               <q>If any of us, O king, offend againſt the rules of juſtice, thou haſt power to puniſh him, but if thou breake thoſe rules, who hath power to doe it? We tell you of it, and when you liſt, you pleaſe to heare us, but when you will not, who ſhall judge you, but he that tels us of himſelfe, that he is juſtice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was you ſee the ancient doctrine, touching the power and right of kings, not onely amongſt <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> but in heathen ſtates: what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver new opinion of a limited power, you have pleaſed to raiſe.</p>
            <p>But you goe further yet, and tell us of ſome things the king cannot do, and that there is a power which the king hath not; what is it, ſay you, that the king cannot doe?
<q>Marry you ſay he cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute new rites and ceremonies, with the adviſe of his Commiſſioners Eccleſiaſticall, or the Metropolitan, according as ſome pleade from
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4205:34"/>
the Act of Parliament before the Communion booke, <hi>pag.</hi> 65.</q>
Why ſo? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> according to your law, <hi>this clauſe of the Act is limited to</hi> Queene <hi>Elizabeth, and not extended to her ſucceſſours of the Crowne.</hi> This you affirme indeede, but you bring no proofe: onely it ſeemes you heard ſo from your <hi>learned councell.</hi> You are I ſee of <hi>Calvins</hi> minde, who tels us in his Commentarie on the 7 of <hi>Amos,</hi> what had beene ſayd by Doctor <hi>Gardiner,</hi> after Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and then Ambaſſadour in <hi>Germany,</hi> touching the <hi>headſhip</hi> or <hi>Supremacie</hi> of the king his maſter: and cloſeth up the ſtorie with this ſhort note, <hi>inconſiderati homines ſunt, qui faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt eos nimis ſpirituales,</hi> that it was unadviſedly done, to give kings ſuch authority in ſpirituall matters. But ſir I hope you may afford the king that power, which you take your ſelves, or which your brethren at the leaſt have tooke before you: who in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time had their <hi>Claſsicall</hi> meetings without leave or licence, and therein did ordeine new rites, new Canons, and new formes of ſervice. This you may doe, it ſeemes, though the kings hands are bound that he may not doe it. And theres a power too, as you tell us, that the king neither hath nor may give to others. Not give to others certainely, if he have it not; for <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo dat quod non habet,</hi> as the ſaying is. But what is this? you firſt ſuppoſe and take for granted, that the <hi>Biſhops make foule havocke in the Church of God,</hi> and <hi>perſecute his faithfull ſervants</hi>: and <hi>then ſuppoſe, which yet you ſay is not to be ſuppoſed, that they have
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4205:35"/>
procured a grant from the king to doe all thoſe things which of late they have done, tending to the utter overthrow of religion by law eſtabliſhed.</hi> And on theſe ſuppoſitions you doe thus proceede.
<q>Yet whatſoever colour, pretext or ſhew they make for this, the king (to ſpeake with all humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence) cannot give that power to others, which hee hath not himſelfe. For the power that is in the king is given him by God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the lawes of the kingdome. Now neither God in his law, nor the lawes of the land, doe allow the king a power to alter the ſtate of religion, or to oppreſſe and ſuppreſſe the faithfull miniſters of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> againſt both law and conſcience.</q>
For kings are the miniſters of God for the good of his people, as wee ſhewed before. <hi>p.</hi> 72.73. So you, and it was bravely ſaid, like a valiant man. The <hi>Brethren</hi> now may follow after their owne inventions, with a full ſecuritie: for ſince you have proclaimed them to be <hi>faithfull miniſters,</hi> no king nor <hi>Keiſar</hi> dares ſuppreſſe them; or if he ſhould, the lawes of God, and the law of the land to boote, would riſe in judgement to condemne him, for uſurpation of a power which they have not given him.

               </hi> and I perhaps may tell you ſomewhat that is worth your knowledge. And I will tell you ſir if you pleaſe to hearken, that whatſoever power is in the king, is from God alone, and founded on the law of nature. The <hi>poſitive lawes</hi> of the land as they conferre none on him, ſo they confirme none
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4205:35"/>
to him. Rather the kings of <hi>England</hi> have parted with their native royalties for the peoples good: which being by their owne conſent, eſtabliſhed for a <hi>poſitive law,</hi> are now become the greateſt part of the ſubjects liberties. So that the liberties, poſſeſſions, and eſtates of the kings leige people, are, if you will, confirmed by the lawes of the land; not the <hi>kings authoritie.</hi> As for the power of kings which is given by God, and founded on the law of nature, how farre it may extend in the true latitude thereof, we have ſaid already: Whether to alter the ſtate of religion, none but a moſt ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſpirit, ſuch as yours would put unto the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: his majeſties pietie and zeale, being too well knowne to give occaſion to ſuch <hi>quaeres.</hi> Onely I needes muſt tell you, that you tye up the kings hands too much, in caſe he may not meddle with a company of <hi>Schiſmatickes,</hi> and refractarie perſons to all power and order, onely becauſe you have pronounced them to be <hi>faithfull ministers of the Goſpell.</hi> Such faithfull miniſters of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> as you and yours, muſt bee ſuppreſſed, or elſe there never will be peace and unitie in the Citie of God. And yet I ſee you have ſome ſcripture for it, more than I ſuppoſed: kings being, as you tell us from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the <hi>ministers of God for the good of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and no more then ſo?

            <p>I muſt goe forwards with you yet from the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie</hi> of the <hi>king,</hi> to the <hi>obedience</hi> of the <hi>ſubject</hi>; which you doe preſſe indeede, but on ſuch falſe grounds, as in concluſion overthrow the whole frame of government. The <hi>abſolute obedience</hi> of the ſubject you have daſhed alreadie, and reckon it amongſt thoſe <hi>Innovations</hi> in point of doctrine, which you have charged upon the <hi>Prelates</hi>: and in the place thereof bring in a limited or conditionall obedience, of your owne deviſing; Your firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or limitation rather, is, <hi>viz.</hi> that our <hi>ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto the king, is to be regulated as by Gods law, the rule of univerſall obedience to God and man, ſo by the good laws of the king. p.</hi> 38. the king as you informe us <hi>p.</hi> 42. <hi>having entred into ſolemne and ſacred cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with all his people, to demaund of them no other obedience, but what the good lawes of the kingdome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe &amp; require:</hi> as on the other ſide, <hi>the people ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no other obedience to the king than according to his just lawes, pag.</hi> 39. and 40. In which reſtraint, there are two things to be obſerved, firſt that wee are to obey the king no farther than there is law for it, and ſecondly no farther than that law ſeemes good; So that in caſe the king commands his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple any thing for which he hath no poſitive law to warrant his command; and of this ſort are many
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4205:36"/>
               <hi>Proclamations, orders, decrees, injunctions,</hi> ſet out from time to time by the kings authoritie, and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> royall, by brother <hi>Burtons</hi> rule the people are at liberty to obey or not. And on the other ſide, in caſe the ſaid command bee grounded on ſome <hi>poſitive law</hi> which they like not of, whether it be a Penall ſtatute, or ſome old Act of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> almoſt out of uſe, by the reviving of the which they may be prejudiced in <hi>purſe</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: this is no good law in their judgement, and ſo no more to be obeyed than if the kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand were founded on no law at all. But your next limitation is farre worſe than this, though this bad enough.
<q>For in the next place you have grounded all obedience on the peoples part, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>mutuall ſtipulation</hi> which the king and his ſubjects make at his Coronation. Where the king takes an <hi>explicite ſolemne oath</hi> to mainteine the antient lawes and liberties of the kingdome, and ſo to rule and governe all his people accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thoſe lawes eſtabliſhed; <hi>conſequently and implicitely</hi> all the people of the land doe ſweare fealtie, allegiance, ſubjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their king, and that according to his juſt lawes, <hi>pag.</hi> 39. your inference from hence is this, that if the king ſo ſolemnely by ſacred oath, ratified againe in Parliament under his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hand, doe bind himſelfe to maintaine the lawes of his kingdome, and therein the rights and liberties of his ſubjects, then how much are the people bound to yeeld all ſubjection and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4205:37"/>
obedience to the king, according to his juſt lawes, <hi>p.</hi> 40.</q>
So that according to your doctrine, the people is no longer to obey the king, than the king keepes promiſe with the people. Nay of the two the people have the better bargaine; the king being ſworne <hi>explicitely</hi> and <hi>ſolemnely</hi> to maintaine their liberties; the people onely <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> and <hi>implicitely</hi> to yeeld him ſubjection. Is not this excellent doctrine think you? or could the moſt <hi>ſeditious perſon</hi> in a ſtate have thought upon a ſhorter cut to bring all to <hi>Anarchie</hi>; for if the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject pleaſe to miſinterpret the kings proceedings, and thinke though falſely, that he hath not kept his promiſe with them: they are releaſed <hi>ipſo facto</hi> from all obedience and ſubjection, and that by a more eaſie way, then ſuing out a <hi>diſpenſation</hi> in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> You tell us, <hi>p.</hi> 129. of the kings <hi>free ſubjects</hi>; and here you have found out a way to make them ſo: a way to make the <hi>ſubject free,</hi> and the king a <hi>ſubject</hi>; and hard it is to ſay whether of the two be the greater <hi>Contradiction</hi> in <hi>adjecto.</hi> I have before heard of a <hi>free people,</hi> and of <hi>free ſtates,</hi> but never till of late of a <hi>free ſubject</hi>: nor know I anyway to create <hi>free ſubjects,</hi> but by releaſing them of all obedience to their Princes. And I have read too of <hi>Eleuthero Cilices,</hi> which were thoſe people of <hi>Cilicia</hi> that were not under the command of any king: but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reade of an <hi>Eleuthero Britannus,</hi> nor I hope never ſhall. I will but aske you one queſtion, and ſo end this point. You preſſe the kings oath very much about maintaining of the lawes of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4205:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Kingdom, as pag. 39.40. and 42. before recited, as alſo, pag. 72. againe and againe, and finally in your addreſſe to my LL. the Judges: is it by way of <hi>Commemoration</hi> or of <hi>Exprobration?</hi> if of <hi>Commemoration,</hi> you forget the Rule; <hi>memorem immemorem facit, qui monet quae memor meminit.</hi> But if of <hi>Exprobration,</hi> what meant you, when you needed not to tell us, that in a point of Civill Government, it is a dangerous thing to change a Kingdom ſetled on good lawes into a tyranny; and preſently thereon to adde a certaine ſpeech of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus, Viz.</hi> That <hi>Citizens ought to fight no leſſe for their Lawes, then for their walls.</hi> I only aſke the queſtion, take you time to anſwere it.</p>

Beſides Sir, you may pleaſe to know, that your caſe was not altogether ſuch as thoſe which were complained of in the ſaid <hi>Petition,</hi> there being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a great difference made between a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> and a <hi>Civill</hi> crime; <hi>And I will</hi> tell you ſomewhat which reflects this way. It appeares in the <hi>Diarie</hi> of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> 4. H. 4. what time, the Statute 28. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. mentioned in the <hi>Petition</hi> (which you call) <hi>of right,</hi> was in force and practiſe, how that the <hi>Commons</hi> exhibited a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that <hi>Lollards arreſted by the Statute.</hi> 2· H. 4. ſhould be bayled, <hi>and that none ſhould arreſt but the Sheriffe, and other lawfull Officers:</hi> and that the King did anſwer to it, <hi>Le Roys' adviſera.</hi> This I am bold to let you know; take it as you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Next for His Majeſties <hi>Declarations,</hi> you deale with Him in them, as in the <hi>Petition,</hi> if not ſomwhat worſe. His Majeſtie finding by good tokens, that ſome ſuch wretched inſtrument as your ſelfe, had ſpread a jealouſie amongſt the <hi>Commons</hi> in that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> that there was no ſmall feare of an <hi>Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi>: as alſo, that by the intemperate handling of ſome <hi>unneceſſary queſtions,</hi> a faction might ariſe both in the Church &amp; Commonwealth:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4205:40"/>
thought fit to manifeſt himſelf in two <hi>Declarations.</hi>
               <q>Of theſe, the firſt related unto the <hi>Articles</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in this Church eſtabliſhed, wherein His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie hath commanded that <hi>in thoſe</hi> curious and unhappy differences, which were then on foote, no man ſhould put his owne ſenſe or Comment to be the meaning of the Article, but take it in the literall and Grammaticall ſenſe: ſhutting up thoſe diſputes in Gods promiſes, as they be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſet forth to us in holy Scriptures; and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall meaning of the Articles according to them.</q>
               <q>The ſecond did containe the cauſes which moved His Majeſtie to diſſolve the Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1628. wherin his Majeſtie proteſteth, that <hi>he will</hi> never give way to the authoriſing of any thing, wherby any <hi>Innnovation</hi> may ſteale or creepe into the Church, but preſerve that unitie of Doctrine and Diſcipline eſtabliſhed in the time of <hi>Queene Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</hi>
               </q>
So farre his Majeſtie. And thoſe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties <hi>Declarations,</hi> are by you either peeviſhly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, in defence of your diſobedience; or facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly retorted on his Majeſtie, as if not obſerved; or ſcandalouſly interpreted, as if intended principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſuppreſſion of Gods trueth. I will begin firſt with that particular mentioned laſt, of which you tel us plainly, that
<q>
                  <hi>Contzen</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> in his <hi>Politicks</hi> preſcribes this rule of ſilencing Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, as an excellent way for the reſtoring of their <hi>Roman Catholik</hi> Religion in the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches. p. 114. As alſo from the <hi>Centuries</hi> that the Authors of corruptions and errours do labour
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4205:40"/>
to compoſe all differences with an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or ſilencing of all Diſputes; that by ſuch counſells the Emperor <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being a favourer of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> hereſy, was moved to burie the principall heads of Controverſie in an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and finally, that the <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhops did the like in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> called by <hi>Conſtantius</hi> an <hi>Arian</hi> Emperor, who did therein ſuppreſſe by perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>Amneſtie</hi> the mention of <hi>Homouſios</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiouſios,</hi> that ſo they might coine a new faith, and utterly extinguiſh that of the Councell of <hi>Nice.</hi> p 115.</q>
This you aſcribe indeed unto the <hi>Prelates,</hi> as an <hi>Art</hi> of theirs; but you muſt needs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it of the <hi>King,</hi> whoſe <hi>Act</hi> it was.</p>
            <p>Nor doe you only miſinterpret his Majeſties moſt pious Act, in an undutifull &amp; ſcandalous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but you pervert both this and the other alſo to ſerve your turne, and ſometimes factiouſly retort them on His Majeſtie, as if not obſerved. What e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thing you challenge, or except againſt, that is forthwith proclaimed to be againſt his Majeſties <hi>Declarations,</hi> ſo ſolemnly ſet out and publiſhed for ſatisfaction of his people: as <hi>Viz.</hi> in your two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles to his Sacred Majeſtie; in your <hi>Apology</hi> p. 6. in your addreſſe to the Nobility. p. 23.24. and to the Judges. p. 28.30.31. and in your <hi>Pulpit Paſquill</hi> p. 51.52.54.64.65.67.72.146. and finally, no leſſe then thrice in the <hi>Newes</hi> from <hi>Ipſwich.</hi> As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. His Majeſtie intended by the firſt, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Articles,</hi> to ſilence thoſe diſputes which might nouriſh faction; and in the other, to nouriſh
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4205:41"/>
in his Subjects a good opinion of his conſtancie to the Religion here eſtabliſhed: but you, and ſuch as you, will abuſe them both. You were convented, as you tell us, unto <hi>London</hi> houſe, for Preaching on the point of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and there it was objected to you, that you had done therein contrary to his Majeſties Declaration, pag. 51. which in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin there, you affirme to be <hi>A dangerous and falſe charge laid upon the King.</hi>
               <q>And thereupon you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that you never took the Kings Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be by him intended for the ſuppreſſing of any part of Gods trueth, nor durſt you ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a thought ſo diſhonourable to the King, as to think him to be an inſtrument of ſuppreſſing Gods trueth.</q>
No doubt you had good ground for ſo quick an anſwere; and what was that? His Majeſtie in his <hi>Declaration about the Parliament,</hi> had profeſt as much. p. 52. Here is the King againſt the King, one Declaration againſt another, both by you abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, both made to ſerve your turne, as occaſion is. But why do you thus conſtrue his Majeſties words? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſay you, <hi>it was no part of his Majeſties mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to prohibit Miniſters, to Preach of the ſaving Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Grace and Salvation, without the which, the very Goſpel is deſtroyed.</hi> p. 51. <hi>the miniſtery of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel overthrowne, and nothing but orations of morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be taught the people.</hi> And doth the whole mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of the Goſpel, the ſaving doctrines of Grace and Salvation, depend alone upon thoſe difficult and dangerous points of Gods ſecret counſells? Are all the Doctrines of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> matters of meere mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie;

<q>Be the Kings purpoſes never ſo ſincere and pious, yet you are bold to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with his <hi>Declaration,</hi> and to cry out vnto the people, that the Doctrines of Gods Grace, and mans ſalvation are huſht, and baniſhed out of Citie and Countrie; and that there's not a Miniſter, one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a thouſand, that dare cleerely and plainly according to the word of God, and the Articles of our Church, preach of theſe moſt comfortable doctrines to Gods people, and ſo ſoundly and roundly confute the <hi>Arminian</hi> hereſies (as you call them) repugnant thereunto. p. 116.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But ſo you will not leave the King, he muſt heare
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4205:42"/>
more yet. His <hi>Declaration</hi> about lawfull recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> is the next you quarell with. In this you fall more fowly on him then you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, more then a civill honeſt man would, or could probably have done upon his equall; and yet you ground this too on his <hi>Declaration.</hi> For thus you ſay.
<q>No wiſe and honeſt man can ever imagine that the king would ever intend to command that which mainly tendeth to the diſhonor of God and his word, to the violation and annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Commandement touching the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and to the alteration of the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> How ſo? Becauſe, ſay you, this were againſt all thoſe ſolemne Royall proteſtations of the King, &amp;c. p. 56.</q>
Stay here a little I beſeech you. How doth this buſineſſe of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> touch the <hi>Declaration</hi> about diſſolving of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which is cited by you. Yes, in a very high degree, <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſay you, <hi>it is a mighty Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the doctrine of the Sabbath, which hath beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince the Reformation, and ſo from the Reigne of Queene Elizabeth of famous memory, conſtantly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, and unanimouſly maintained in the Church of England,</hi> pag. 57. <hi>Qui ſemel verecundiae limites, &amp;c.</hi> And if you proceed on a little, you will ſhortly bluſh at nothing. For the point in hand: Men of farre more credit, then I trow you are, aſſure us, that your new doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> was never known in <hi>England,</hi> untill the yeere, 1596; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made known then, not before, was neither uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, nor unanimouſly received, as you informe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4205:42"/>
as. For had it beene a Doctrine conſtantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ever ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as you falſly ſay, aſſuredly Arch- B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> had never called in thoſe Books which maintained that argument, as it's well knowne he did in his viſitation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1599. nor had Judge <hi>Popham</hi> done the like at the Aſſiſes in Saint <hi>Edmonds bury,</hi> in the yeere 600. You muſt tell like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier tales then this, or all the old wives in your Pariſh will beſhrew you for it: who cannot but remember with what harmeleſſe freedom they uſed to behave themſelves, that day, in their yonger times.
<q>You ſtay not here, but as before you ſet the King againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, one Declaration of the Kings againſt another; ſo next, you ſet the King againſt the Parliament: and tell us, that the prophanation of the <hi>Sabbath or Lords day,</hi> which the Books ſeemes to give allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to, as in ſundry ſports here ſpecified, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto the Statute 1. <hi>Caroli,</hi> in which all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Exerciſes and Paſtimes are prohibited upon that day; and therefore <hi>dauncing, leaping,</hi> and the reſt, which the Book alowes of p. 57.</q>
For this you are beholding to your learned Counſell, the firſt that ever ſo interpreted that Statute: and thereby ſet the Statute and the Declaration at an endleſſe odds. But herein you goe farre beyond him, for he only quarrelled with the living, who had power to right themſelves: You lay a ſcandal on the dead, who are now laid to ſleepe in the bed of peace: and tell us of that Prince of bleſſed memory, King <hi>James,</hi> that the ſaid Booke for Sports, <hi>was procured, compiled, and publiſhed in the time of his progreſſe into
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4205:43"/>
Scotland, when he was more then ordinarily merrily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed.</hi> p. 58. When he was more then ordinarily merrily diſpoſed? Good Sir, your meaning. Dare you conceive a baſe and diſloyall thought, and not ſpeake it out, for all that <hi>Parrheſia</hi> which you ſo commend againſt Kings and Princes: p. 26. Leave you ſo faire a face with ſo foule a ſcarre: and make that peereles Prince, whom you and yours did blaſt with daily Libells when he was alive; the object of your <hi>Puritanicall,</hi> I and uncharitable ſcoffes now he is deceaſed. Unworthy wretch, whoſe greateſt and moſt pure devotions, had never ſo much heaven in it, as his greateſt mirth. I could purſue you further, were you worth my labor, or rather, if to Apologize for ſo great a Prince, <hi>non eſſet injuria virtutum,</hi> as he in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> were not too great an injurie to his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent virtues; and therfore I ſhall leave your diſloyal ſpeeches of the King deceaſed, to take a further view of thoſe diſloyall paſſages, which doe ſo neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerne the King, our now Royall Soveraigne. For leſt the people ſhould continue in their duty to him, being the thing you feare above all things elſe; you labour what you can to take them off: at leſt to terrify his Majeſty with a feare to loſe them.
<q>For you aſſure us on your word, becauſe you would have it ſo. p. 64. that <hi>preſſing</hi> of that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> with ſuch curſed rigour (as you call it) both without and againſt all Law, and all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and that alſo in the Kings name, is very dangerous, to breed in peoples mindes, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well acquainted with His Majeſties either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4205:43"/>
or proteſtations (ſtill you bring in that) I know not what ſtrange ſcruples or feares, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to ſtagger in their good opinion of his <hi>Majeſtie.</hi>
               </q>
And in the Apologie, <hi>giving diſtaſt to cal your Majeſties loyall ſubject who hereupon grow jealous of ſome dangerous plot.</hi> p. 6. You would faine have it ſo, elſe you would not ſay it. <hi>Quod minus miſeri volunt, hoc facile credunt.</hi> But hereof, and how you encourage men to ſtand it out, wee have more to come.</p>
            <p>A man would think that you had ſaid enough againſt your Soveraigne, charging him with ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent violating of his proteſtations, and taxing in ſuch impudent manner his <hi>Declaration</hi> about <hi>ſports,</hi> as <hi>tending mainly to the diſhonour of God,</hi> the <hi>propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Sabbath,</hi> the <hi>annihilation of the fourth Commandement, and the alteration of the doctrine of the Church of</hi> England. Yet that which followes next is of farre worſe nature; no leſſe a crime, then pulling down of preaching, and ſetting up Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: pretty <hi>Peccadillo's.</hi> For <hi>Preaching</hi> firſt, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſacred Majeſtie out of a tender care of his peoples ſafety, to ordaine a <hi>faſt,</hi> by his Royall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to provide, that in infected pariſhes there ſhould be no Sermon, the better to avoid the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpreading of the Sickneſſe, which in a generall confluxe of people, as in ſome Churches, to ſome Preachers, might bee ſoone occaſioned. This his moſt royall care you except againſt as <hi>an Innovation contrary to his Majeſties publick Declarations,</hi> p. 146. and in the Newes from <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> you tell us alſo that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4205:44"/>
it is <hi>a meanes to inhibit preaching,</hi> and <hi>conſequently to bring Gods wrath upon us to the uttermoſt.</hi> p. 147. You call it ſcornfully a <hi>mock-faſt,</hi> p. 148. a <hi>mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and a dumb-faſt diſtaſtfull to all ſorts of people,</hi> in the <hi>Ipſwich</hi> newes: and in plaine language tell the King, that <hi>this reſtraint, with other innovations which you have</hi> charged upon the Prelates, <hi>do fill the peoples minds with jealouſies and fears of an univerſal alteration of religion,</hi> p. 147. What peoples minds are filled ſo I beſeech you ſir, but thoſe whom you and ſuch as you have ſo poſſeſſed? I trow you have not had the people to confeſſion lately, that you ſhould know their minds and feares ſo well, as you ſeeme to do. But know, or not know, that's no matter; the King is bound to take it upon your word; eſpecially conſidering that the reſtraint of preaching in dangerous and infected places, and on the day of faſt, when men come empty to the Church, and ſo are farre more apt to take infection then at other times; is ſuch an Innovation, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the like was never heard of in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or any of the former ages; and withall ſo directly contrary unto his Majeſties ſolemne Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations made unto his people. Here's a great cry indeed, but a little wooll. For how may wee be ſure, that the holy Scripture and all former ages have preſcribed preaching as a neceſſary part of a publike faſt, yea <hi>as the very life and ſoule of a faſt,</hi> as you pleaſe to phraſe it, both in your Pulpit Paſquill, p. 144. and the newes from <hi>Ipſwich.</hi> That ſo it was in holy Scripture, you cite good ſtore, as viz. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:4205:44"/>
6.28.29.30. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.17.14. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.6. to 10. <hi>Ioel.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.1.2.3. all in the margin of the Newes book. Of all which texts, if there be one that ſpeakes of preaching, let the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge. The Scripture being ſilent in it, how ſhall we know it was the cuſtome in all former ages? For that you tell us, in the ſame <hi>margine</hi> of the Newes book, that ſo it was 1. <hi>Iacobi &amp; Caroli.</hi> Moſt fairly proved. I never knew till now, but that the world was older then I ſee it is. Men talk of certain thouſands that the world hath laſted: but we muſt come to you for a new <hi>Chronologie.</hi> The world, my maſters, and all former ages, (which comes both to one) contain but 34 yeares full, not a minute more. An excellent Antiquarie. No marvell if his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty be taxed with innovations, changing, as he hath done, the doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> firſt ſet on foor <hi>Anno</hi> 1596, and the right way of celebrating a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faſt, for which you have no precedent before the yeare 1603. Nor can I blame the people, if they feare an alteration of religion, when once they ſee ſuch dreadfull Innovations break in upon them; and all his Majeſties ſolemne proteſtations ſo ſoon forgotten &amp; neglected. Yet let me tell you ſir, that <hi>faſt and pray</hi> was the old rule, which both Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the Church have commended to us; as in the texts by you remembred, and that delivered by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Oratio jejunium ſanctificat, jejunium orationem roborat,</hi> was the Fathers <hi>Maxime.</hi> I never read of <hi>Faſt and preach,</hi> till you made the Canon; at leaſt till you firſt brought it hither, if
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4205:45"/>
you made it not. And yet becauſe of this, and ſuch like terrible Innovations as this, you flie out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely.
<q>Firſt unto Gods moſt ſecret Counſailes, affirming moſt unchriſtianly, and withall moſt ſhameleſly, that this reſtraint of preaching (in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected places) was the occaſion that the plague in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, double to any weeke ſince the Sickneſſe beganne p. 144. that it brought with it a double increaſe of the plague, p. 50. an extraordinary increaſe the very firſt week of the faſt, together with moſt hideous ſtormes, &amp;c. p. 148.</q>
Sir, you forget that which was taught you by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Abſcondita, Domino Deo noſtro</hi>; that ſecret things belong to God: and wee may aske this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of you out of holy Scripture, <hi>What man hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller?</hi> Surely, untill you uſurped that honor by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that extraordinary calling which you ſo much brag of, no man ever did. Yet ſince you are ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the ſearch of cauſes, &amp; wil needs tell us what occaſioned ſo great a ſicknes; look in the laſt words of the ſecond homily of Obedience, and you will find that nothing drawes down greater <hi>plagues</hi> from almighty God, then murmuring &amp; rebellion againſt Gods Annointed. Next you fall foule upon his Majeſty, and tell him plainly in effect, but cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as you imagine, that if he look not better to his <hi>Proteſtations, the beauty of his royall name will bee blaſted in the Annals delivered to poſterity,</hi> and that in them it will be ſaid, <hi>This King had no regard to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred vowes, and ſolemne proteſtations.</hi> I ſee what
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4205:45"/>
Chronicles we ſhall have when you come to write them, <hi>Caeſarum contumeliis referta</hi>;<note place="margin">Tacit. Annal.</note> there's no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of it.</p>
            <p>From pulling downe of <hi>Preaching,</hi> proceed wee next to ſetting up <hi>Idolatry</hi>; which how you charge the King withall, muſt next be ſhewed. You tell us, that the Prelates to juſtifie themſelves in thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, which you unjuſtly lay upon them, do plead <hi>the whole equipage, furniture, and faſhion of the Kings Chappell, as a pattern for all Churches: in which there is an Altar, and bowing towards it; Crucifixes, Jmages, and other guiſes. And why ſhould Subjects be wiſer then their King?</hi> p. 165. To this you anſwer, that <hi>the worſhip and ſervice of God and of Chriſt</hi> (you wil needs ſeparate Chriſt from God do I what I can) <hi>is not bee regulated by humane examples, but by the divine rule of the Scriptures. In vaine do they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me, teaching for doctrines the commandements of men.</hi> p. 165. Well ſaid! the ſervice in the Kings <hi>Chappell,</hi> and that which is conforme unto it, is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aine worſhip in the firſt place: And what follows next. <hi>The three Children would not bow to the Kings goodly golden Image.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4205:46"/>
'twas you meant, when you extoll'd ſo highly that <hi>Parrheſia,</hi> which you conceive ſo neceſſary in a child of God; p. 26.27. inſtancing there, as here, in the three Children, <hi>Who feared neither the Kings big looks, nor furious threats</hi>; and <hi>Maris</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon, who comming before Julian the Apoſtata, called him Atheiſt, Apoſtata, and a deſertor of the faith:</hi> As in <hi>Elias,</hi> when he <hi>retorted King Ahabs words upon him,</hi> and the ſtout anſwer which <hi>Eliſha</hi> made to the King of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> adding for cloſe of all, that <hi>it were endleſſe to recite examples in this kind, except to convince the cowardice of theſe times.</hi> You would have every man, it ſeemes, as bold a <hi>Bravo</hi> as your ſelfe; to bid defiance to the King, at leaſt to ſtand it out againſt all authority. For, for the proof of that brave <hi>Parrhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> which you ſo extoll, you inſtance chiefly in ſuch oppoſition: as was made to Kings, and therefore all your uſes muſt be conſtrued to reflect that way: now your fourth uſe is this.
<q>This makes for exceeding conſolation to the Church of God, eſpecially in declining times of <hi>Apoſtacie,</hi> (in theſe dayes of lukewarmneſſe and <hi>Apoſtacie,</hi> in the propoſall of your uſes, <hi>p.</hi> 128.) and when the truth is openly perſecuted and oppreſſed, and idolatry and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition obtruded in ſtead thereof: when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we ſee many Miniſters of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> to ſtand ſtoutly to their tacklings, and rather then they will betray any part of Gods truth, and a good conſcience, they will part with their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, liberty, lively-hood, and life too, if need were. This is that which keeps <hi>Chriſts</hi> cauſe in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4205:46"/>
life. This gives Gods people cauſe of rejoycing, that they ſee their Captains to keep their ground, and not to flie the field, or forſake their colours, or baſely yeeld themſelves to the enemie, &amp;c. p. 31.</q>
They are your own words, one of the <hi>pious uſes</hi> which you make of your ſo celebrated <hi>Parrheſia,</hi> that freedome and liberty of ſpeech againſt Kings and Princes, or whatſoever is called God, which you ſo ſpecially commend unto your diſciples. Well then, here's <hi>ſuperſtition and idolatry,</hi> but is there not a feare of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> alſo. Sure it ſeemes there is. For thus you cloſe your anſwer, touching the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page (as you call it) of the Kings chappell, the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and furniture thereof. <hi>Laſtly ſuppoſe, (which we truſt never to ſee, and which our hearts abhorre once to imagine) Maſſe were ſet up in the Kings Chappell; is this a good argument why it ſhould be admitted in all the Churches throughout the Realm of England?</hi> p. 166 Why how now zealous ſir; what? Suppoſitions, Ifs &amp; Ands, in ſuch an odious intimation as ſetting up of <hi>Maſſe</hi> in the Kings Chappell? I will not tell you any thing of my opinion in this place, but keepe it till I meet you at the halfe turne in the cloſe of all. Onely I needs muſt tell you here, you might have dealt more curteouſly with your <hi>Soveraigne and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,</hi> as you ſtile him, had you the leaſt part of that piety which you pretend to: ſeeing ſo manifeſtly that (in <hi>Seneca's</hi> words, <hi>Jllius vigilia omnium domos, illius labor omnium otia, illius induſtria omnium de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licias, illius occupatio omnium vacationem tueatur.</hi> The Kings great care to keepe his people in <hi>wealth,

<q>Firſt then, you quarrell with the calling, and ſtomack it exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſome of them ſhould ſay in the <hi>High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> being put unto it by your Brother <hi>Baſtwick, that they had</hi> their Epiſcopal authority from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and if they could not prove it, they would caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Rochets. <hi>And ſo,</hi> ſay you, <hi>they might their Capps too, for any ſuch proofe they can bring for it.</hi> p. 68.

Ibid.</hi> Well then, what hurt of this! Thus you ſee our Prelates have no other claime for their <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> then the Popes of Rome have and doe make, which all our Divines ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, till yeſterday, have diſclaimed, and our Prelates cannot otherwiſe aſſume, but by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelves they very limbes of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and ſo our Church a member of that Synagogue of <hi>Rome.</hi> And this you ſay, becauſe it is affirmed by D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
                  <hi>Pocklington,</hi> that we are able lineally to ſet

downe the ſucceſſion of our Biſhops from Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> and from to our firſt Archbiſhop Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Apoſtle, downwards to his <hi>Grace</hi> that now ſits in the chaire, &amp;c. p. 69.</q>

And not long after, you beſtow a gentle touch on D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Pocklington,</hi> calling the Prelates, as your uſe is, the <hi>true-bred ſonnes of the Roman Antichriſt, from whom</hi> D. Pocklington <hi>boaſts they are lineally deſcended.</hi> But whatſoever be the claime from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; you have found out a fitter Author of the holy Hierarchie; <hi>even the ſpirit that beares rule in the aire,</hi> the devill.
<q>Who doth not only haunt the Pallaces of Prelates (perhaps he went ſometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your occaſions) but hath infuſed ſuch a poiſon into the chaire of this Hierarchie, as that man, who ſits in it, had need to be ſtrongly fortified with Preſervatives and Antidotes of <hi>true Reall Grace,</hi> (not <hi>nominall</hi> and <hi>titular</hi>) that is able to overcom the infection of it. p. 106.</q>
This is the ſumme of what you ſay, or repeat rather with a <hi>nil dictum quod</hi>; and this is hardly worth the ſaying by ſo great a <hi>Rabbin,</hi> the anſwere being made before the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4205:49"/>
yet ſince you ſay it, ſomething muſt bee ſayd about it, and ſo <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Your firſt exception is, that the Epiſcopall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is claimed from <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and that ſome of the Biſhops ſaid in the High Commiſſion, that if they could not prove it they would caſt away their <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets.</hi>
               <q>This is no more then what had formerly beene ſaid in the conference at <hi>Hampton Court</hi>; when on occaſion of Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> ſaying, that a Biſhop was not <hi>divinae ordinationis:</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> (D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bancroft</hi>) interpoſed, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee could prove his ordination lawfull out of the Scriptures, he would not be a Biſhop foure houres.</q>
You ſee then this is no new ſaying devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but yeſterday, and contrary to what hath beene the judgement of all our Divines ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as you pleaſe to tell us. The learned workes of Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> entituled <hi>The Perpetuall government of Chriſts Church,</hi> and thoſe of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Adrian Saravia</hi> againſt your Patriarke <hi>Theodore Beza, de diverſis miniſterii gradibus</hi>; with many others of thoſe times: ſhew manifeſtly that you are an impudent <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> and care not what you ſay, ſo you make a noiſe. And yet I cry you mercy, I may miſtake you; not knowing exactly what you meane by your <hi>Our Divines</hi>: For if by your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, you meane the <hi>Genevian</hi> Doctors, <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza, Viret</hi> and <hi>Farellus, Bucan, Vrſinus,</hi> and thoſe others of forreine Churches, whom you eſteeme the onely Orthodox profeſſours: you may affirme it very ſafely, that the derivation of Epiſcopall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4205:49"/>
from our Saviour Chriſt, is utterly diſclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>your Divines. Calvin</hi> had never elſe inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> nor with ſuch violence obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it on all the <hi>reformed Churches:</hi> neither had <hi>Beza</hi> divided <hi>Epiſcopatum,</hi> into <hi>Divinum, humanum,</hi> and <hi>Satanicum,</hi> as you know he doth. But if by <hi>our Divines,</hi> you meane thoſe worthies of the Church, who have ſtood up in maintenance of the holy <hi>Hierarchie</hi> againſt the clamours and contentions of the <hi>Puritan</hi> faction; or ſuch as are conformable unto the Articles and orders of the Church of <hi>England</hi>: you do moſt ſhameleſſely traduce them, as your cuſtome is, and make them Patrons of that Tenet, which they moſt oppoſed. For tell me of a truth, who is it, which of <hi>our Divines,</hi> that holds Epiſcopall authority to be derived from any other fountaine then that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles?</hi> and that conceive their ordination is not <hi>de jure divino,</hi> grounded and founded on the Scriptures, and thence deduced by neceſſary evident and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able illation? if any ſuch there be, hee is one of <hi>yours, Travers,</hi> and <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and the reſt of your Predeceſſours; men never owned for hers by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Of whom wee may affirme, what the hiſtorian ſaith of the <hi>Athenians,</hi>

               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:4205:50"/>
or how the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in their owne perſons exerciſed authority over other <hi>Paſtors</hi>; or how they ſetled ſeverall Biſhops in convenient places, as <hi>Timothy</hi> in <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Crete,</hi> with power of ordination, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. and power of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall cenſure, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. or finally what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours they left behind them, in thoſe particular Sees where they moſt reſided. This were but <hi>actum agere,</hi> to ſing our old ſongs over, as you uſe to doe: and therefore I referre you to the writings of thoſe worthies before remembred, <hi>our Divines</hi> indeed. Nor had I ſaid thus much, but to let you ſee, that neither the claime is new, deviſed but yeſterday; nor by all <hi>our Divines</hi> diſclaimed ſince the <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:</hi> both which with ſhame enough you are bold to ſay.</p>
            <p>The next thing that offends you, and you cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of, is that they claime a viſible and perpetuall ſucceſſion, downe from S. <hi>Peter</hi> to Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> from him by <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monke, firſt Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> unto his <hi>Grace</hi> now being, and <hi>Sic de coeteris.</hi> For by this meanes, you ſay, they make themſelves the very limbes of the Pope, the true-bred ſonnes of the <hi>Roman Antichriſt</hi>: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently our Church a member of that <hi>Romiſh Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue.</hi> Who would have thought but this had pleaſed you. For if the Biſhops bee the ſonnes of the <hi>Roman Antichriſt,</hi> and the Church a member of the <hi>Romiſh Synagogue</hi>; then are you acquitted: and all your clamours, raylings, and oppoſition, aſwell againſt the one, as the other, may be fairely
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4205:50"/>
juſtified. But let your inference alone till another time, what is it that you quarrell in the ground thereof. Is it that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> or was Biſhop there, (whether for 25. yeares as <hi>Euſebius</hi> tell's us, we will not diſpute) you may remember it is granted, or rather not denyed by <hi>Calvin.</hi> HOw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his minde ſerved him to have made a queſtion of it; yet, <hi>propter Scriptorum conſenſum non pugno,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Inſtitut. l. 4. Sect. 15.</note> the evidence was ſo ſtrong hee could not deny it. Is it that <hi>Gregory</hi> Pope of Rome, ſirnamed <hi>Magnus,</hi> after a long deſcent ſucceeded him? The Tables of ſucceſſion in the Church of Rome make that cleare enough:<note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 3.</note> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> brings downe the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion till his owne time; during which time, the lineall ſucceſſion in that Church, by reaſon of the many perſecutions under which it ſuffered, might be made moſt queſtionable. That <hi>Gregory</hi> ſent this <hi>Auſtin</hi> into <hi>England</hi> to convert the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and made him (having before beene conſecrated by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Arles</hi>) the firſt Archbiſhop of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; is generally delivered by all our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, from <hi>Venerable Bede</hi> to theſe preſent times; as by thoſe alſo which have writ the life of the ſayd Pope <hi>Gregory.</hi> Finally that my Lord the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop that now is, is lineally deſcended, in a moſt faire and conſtant tenour of ſucceſſion you ſhall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily finde, if you conſult the learned labours of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Francis Maſon, de miniſterio, Ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſince you challenge D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Pockling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> for the ſucceſſion of the Biſhops in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I will ſend you to him for three inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which might have ſatisfied you in that point, if you will be ſatisfied: the firſt from <hi>Irenaeus, l.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3, 4, 5. the ſecond from <hi>Tertullian, de praeſcript. cap.</hi> 11. and the laſt from S. <hi>Auſtin, contra Petil. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 51. In all of which it is apparant, (and ſee them you muſt needs, being the occaſion of his inſtance in the Church of <hi>England</hi>) that the ſucceſſion of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in their ſeverall Churches, <hi>ita ut primus ſit aliquis ex Apoſtolis,</hi> beginning their diſcent from ſome one or other of the holy <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> hath beene a ſpeciall meanes to confound thoſe hereticks, which tooke up armes againſt the Church, as ſome men doe now.</p>
            <p>Now for your inſtance, you pleade, that if this rule of ſucceſſion hold, our Biſhops are the <hi>true-bred ſonnes of the Roman Antichriſt</hi>; and tell me then I pray you Sir, whoſe ſonne are you, that had your ordination, and received your Miniſtrie from thoſe Biſhops which were ſo diſcended, you muſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4205:51"/>
needes be a limb of the Pope alſo; like it as you liſt: But never feare it Sir, there is no ſuch danger as you dreame of, either that any Prieſt or Prelate in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould therefore bee a ſonne of the <hi>Roman Antichriſt</hi>; or that the Church ſhould be a member of that <hi>Romiſh Synagogue:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee claime by and from them, a viſible ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of and in the ſacred <hi>Hierarchie.</hi> Wee may receive our orders from them and chalenge a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion by them, from the bleſſed <hi>Apoſtles</hi>; and yet not bee partakers with them in their corruptions. When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> purged the temple, and ſet all things right, which had beene formerly amiſſe in the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Church: thinke you that the <hi>High-Prieſts</hi> which followed after, thought it a ſhame to fetch their <hi>Pedegree</hi> from <hi>Aaron</hi>? Or doe you finde it was objected againſt them that did, that becauſe ſome of thoſe from and by whom they claimed it, had misbehaved themſelves in ſo great an office, and poſſibly advanced Idolatry in that tottering ſtate, therefore all thoſe that followed them and deſcended from them, were alſo guilty of the ſame crimes? Or to come nearer to your ſelfe, thinke you your miniſtery the worſe, becauſe you did receive it from the hands of them, whom you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for true borne ſonnes of the <hi>Roman Antichriſt:</hi> and that your brethren in <hi>New England</hi> will not thinke themſelves the pureſt and moſt perfect Church in the Chriſtian world, although they once were members of that here eſtabliſhed which they have forſaken. T'was not the purpoſe of thoſe

holy men in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time to make a new Church, but reforme the old; and onely to pare off thoſe ſuperfluities, which had in tract of time beene added to Gods publicke ſervice.

<q>Theſe we have told you of before goe on then.

All this ſir in your <hi>Pulpit-paſquill.</hi> So alſo in your Apologie, <hi>Ieſuited Polypragmaticks,</hi> and ſonnes of <hi>Belial</hi>: and in the newes from <hi>Ipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> Luciferian Lord Biſhops, Execrable traytors, devouring wolves, with many other odious names not fit to be uſed by <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Finally in your Pulpit libell, you ſeriouſly profeſſe that you are aſhamed that ever it ſhould bee ſayd, you have lived a miniſter under ſuch a Prelacie, <hi>p.</hi> 49. Great pittie ſir, you had not lived a little in king <hi>Edgars</hi> time, amongſt whoſe Lawes it was ordeined, that that mans tongue ſhould be cut out which did ſpeake any ſlanderous or infamous words, tending to the reproach of others.</p>
            <p>Hitherto for the generalls. And there are ſome particulars, on which you ſpend your malice more than all the reſt; you deſcant trimmely, as you thinke, in the Newes from <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> on my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with your Arch-pietie, Arch-chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if <hi>Belzebub</hi> himſelfe had beene <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:4205:54"/>
Arch-Agent for the devill, and ſuch like to thoſe. A moſt triumphant Arch indeed to adorne your victories. His coſtly and magnificent entertein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the king at <hi>Oxford,</hi> you cry out againſt in your ſayd Pulpit libell, for a ſcurrilous enterlude, made in diſgrace of that which is the greateſt beauty of our religion, to wit true pietie, and learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will him in this ſhrift to confeſſe, how unſeemely it was for him, that pretendeth to ſucceed the Apoſtles, <hi>p.</hi> 49. You taxe a certaine ſpeech of his as moſt audacious and preſumptuous, ſetting his proud foote on the kings lawes, as once the Pope did on the Emperours necke <hi>p.</hi> 54. in <hi>marg.</hi> and tell him that the beſt Apologie hee can make, is that his tongue did runne before his wit, and that in the flames of his paſſion he had ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his beſt reaſon and loyaltie. <hi>p.</hi> 55. You tell us alſo that the republiſhing of the booke [for ſports] with ſome addition, was the firſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing which was done preſently after the Lord of <hi>Cant.</hi> did take poſſeſſion of his Grace-ſhippe, <hi>pag.</hi> 59. that with his right hand hee is able to ſweepe downe the third part of the ſtarres in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>p.</hi> 121. Having a Papall infallibility of ſpirit, whereby as by a divine oracle, all queſtions in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are finally determined <hi>pag.</hi> 132. However in your generall charges, I left you to runne riot, and diſperſe your follies, according as you would your ſelfe: yet now you are fallen on a particular, and a particular as eminent in vertue as hee is in place; you may perhaps expect a particular an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4205:54"/>
And leſt your expectation ſhould be fruſtrate, I will ſee you ſatisfied. Firſt for your language ſuch it is, as one may thence conjecture eaſily what foule heart it comes from. They that have pure hearts cannot poſſibly have ſo impure a mouth: for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>out of the abundance of the heart it is that the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> And though your rayling accuſation doth deſerve no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, than <hi>the Lord rebuke thee</hi>: yet I muſt tell you now, being thus put to it, that you are much miſtaken in the man you drive at. And you had come more neere unto him, and the trueth it ſelfe, had you beſtowed that character on him, which <hi>Poſsidonius</hi> gives you of S. <hi>Auſtin, viz. Profactibus &amp; ſtudiis favens erat, &amp; exultans bononum omnium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In vit. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtini. c.8.</note> 
               <hi>indiſciplinationem pie &amp; ſancte tolenans fratrum, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemiſcens que de iniquitatibus malorum, ſive eorum qui intra eccleſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſive eorum qui extra eccleſiam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituti ſunt, dominicis lucris ſemper gaudens, &amp; damnis moerens,</hi> which may thus be <hi>Engliſhed</hi>; He was a favorer of learning a friend of goodneſſe and good men, and ſuffered with great both patience and pietie, the inconformable averſeneſſe of his brethren from the publicke diſcipline, and grieved at the iniquitie of ill men, whether they were within the pale of the Church, or without the ſame; as one that alwayes was affected with the ſucceſſes of Gods Church, according as it gained, or loſt, as it thrived or faded. This character if your malice will not ſuffer you to apply unto him, give me leave to doe it; and diſproove any of it if
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4205:55"/>
you can. And I will adde withall, though you grieve to heare it, that both for the ſinceritie of his converſation, as a private man, and for the pietie of his endeavours as a publicke perſon, you would be ſhrewdly troubled to finde his equall in this Church, ſince the firſt reformation of religion in K. <hi>Edwards</hi> time. And for a witneſſe hereunto I dare call your ſelfe; who making all the ſearch you could into him, and that with a malicious eye, which commonly is wont to ſpie the ſmalleſt errour; you have not yet detected him of any perſonall default as a private man. And as for thoſe particular charges which you lay unto him, as a publicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they are ſo poore (more than the clamour that they make) that they are hardly worth the anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Next for your charges, which that you may the better ſee, I meane to take them all as they lye in order, and ſpeake as briefely to them, as you would deſire. Firſt for the enterteinment, of his Majeſtie at the univerſitie, tell me I pray you of all loves, how would you have contrived it better, had you beene <hi>master of the Ceremonies</hi> for that place and time? Would you have had a ſermon? Why the king had one. Would you have fitted him with <hi>Academicall</hi> exerciſes? there was as little want of that: <hi>Orations</hi> in the fields, the Church, the Colledges, the Convocation, and the Library. Would you have left out playes? When did you ever know an Academicall enterteinment of the king without them. Would you have had the playes in Latine? Conſider that the Queene
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4205:55"/>
was a principall gueſt, and they were commanded to be in Engliſh. But ſir conceale your griefe no longer. I know what tis that troubles you, and makes you call it ſcurrillous enterlude, and ſay that it was <hi>made in diſgrace of pietie.</hi> All that offends you is, that <hi>Melancholico,</hi> a <hi>Puritan</hi> paſſion in one of the commedies, was in concluſion marryed to <hi>Concupiſcentia</hi>; In caſe you doe not like the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, why did you not come thither to forbid the banes. The <hi>Spartans</hi> uſed to ſhew their drunken ſlaves unto their children, the better to deterre them from ſo baſe a vice. And how know you but that the repreſenting of that humour on the open ſtage, may let men ſee the follies of it, and ſo weane them from it. But however the perſon you ſo groſſely abuſe, could not poſſibly have leiſure, farther than in the generall to command all things ſhould be without offence, which he moſt carefully did. That which you next except againſt, is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datious &amp; preſumptuous ſpeech that you ſo much talke of. And what was that? Aſſuredly no more, than that his Grace, then Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned your learned Counſell M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prinne,</hi> to lay him by the heeles for his too much ſawcineſſe. Not as you ſay, (and would have ſimple folke beleeve you) for bringing a <hi>Prohibition</hi> from the Courts of law; but for his inſolent and irreverent behaviour intendring it unto the Court of the <hi>high Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Your ſelfe Maſſ. <hi>Burton</hi> are not called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, for your preaching; but for your factious and ſeditious preaching: nor was hee threatned
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4205:56"/>
becauſe he tendred to the Court a <hi>Prohibition,</hi> but becauſe he tendred it in ſuch a malapert and ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious manner. This makes a difference in the caſe. Had he behaved himſelfe <hi>contra bonos mores,</hi> before an Ordinary Iuſtice, he muſt have either found out ſuerties for his good behaviour; or beene commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his fault; no remedy. And will you not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Court of <hi>high-Commiſsion,</hi> or any Prelate in the ſame, as much if not a little more authority, then a <hi>common Iuſtice</hi>? Perhaps you thinke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Maſs. Prinne</hi> is of a factious <hi>Tribunitian</hi> ſpirit; he muſt be <hi>Sancroſanct</hi> and uncontrolable as the <hi>Tribunes</hi> were. When you can proove his calling to ſo high a place; you may doe well to chalenge the prerogatives belonging to it. In the meane time ſuffer him to be taken up and cenſured as hee hath deſerved. Next for his Majeſties declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about lawfull ſports, you have no reaſon to charge that on my Lord Archbiſhop, as if it were a matter of his procuring: or if it were, to reckon it amongſt his faults.</p>
            <p>His ſacred Majeſty treading in the ſteps of his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Father, thought fit to ſuffer his good Subjects to enjoy that innocent freedome, which before they did; in uſing moderate and lawfull recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Sunday, after the divine and publicke Offices of the Church were ended, both for mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the which, they had been more deprived in theſe latter dayes, then before they were. And it was more then time, perhaps, that ſomewhat ſhould be done to repreſſe your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4205:56"/>
who under a pretence of hindering recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon that day, had in ſome parts, put downe all <hi>feaſts of dedications,</hi> of the Churches commonly called Wakes, which they which did it, did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all authority. A pious and a Princely Act, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you and ſuch as you, traduce it every day in your ſcandalous pamphlets. Nor doth it more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a Chriſtian King, to keepe the holy dayes by the Church eſtabliſhed, whereof that is one, from being prophaned by labour, and unlawfull pleaſures; then to preſerve them, <hi>quantum in ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis eſt,</hi> at leſt, from being overcome with <hi>Iudaiſme</hi> or ſuperſtition. And you might ſee how ſome out of your principles came to have as much if not more of them Iew, then the Chriſtian in them, about the time when the declaration came forth. All that my Lord the Archbiſhop had to doe therein, was to commit the publication of it to his ſuffragan Biſhops according to his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. juſt will and pleaſure: and if that be the thing you except againſt, your quarrell is not at his Act, but his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Laſt of all, where you ſay, that with his right hand he is able to ſweepe downe the third part of the ſtarres in heaven; and that hee hath a Papall infallibility of ſpirit, by which as by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Oracle all queſtions in religion are finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined: that onely is put in becauſe you have a minde to charge on him thoſe innovations, as you call them, that you complaine of in the Church. What innovations you have noted wee ſhall ſee hereafter; when they will prove to be no other
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4205:57"/>
then a ſicke mans dreame. I onely tell you now, that in all the Hierarchy, you could not poſſibly have pitched on one leſſe liable and obnoxious to the accuſation. For being <hi>vir antiquae fidei,</hi> and <hi>antiquiſsimi moris,</hi> take them both together: you may be ſure he neither will nor can doe any thing that tends to innovation either in faith or diſcipline. In caſe your ſelfe and ſuch as you, would ſuffer him in quiet, to reſtore this Church to its antient luſtre; and bring it unto that eſtate in which it was in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> firſt time, before your prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours in the faction had turned all decency and order out of the publicke ſervice of Almighty God: I dare preſume he would not trouble you nor them, by bringing in new ordinances of his owne deviſing. But this if he endeavour, as hee ought to doe, you charge him preſently for an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novator</hi>: not that he innovates any thing in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient formes of worſhip in this Church eſtabliſhed, but that he labours to ſuppreſſe thoſe <hi>innovations,</hi> which you and thoſe of your diſcent have introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the ſame. But one may ſee by that which followes, that it is malice to his perſon, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto the Church, that makes you picke out him to beare ſo great a ſhare in theſe impudent cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. For where his grace had tooke great care for inhibiting the ſale of bookes tending to <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme</hi>; and had therefore received thankes from the penne of a <hi>Ieſuite,</hi> as your ſelfe informes us: that his moſt pious care is by you calumniated, for <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting of ſuch bookes, as exalt the ſole authority of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4205:57"/>
Scripture for the onely rule of faith, p.</hi> 153. I ſee <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and his followers are beholding to you for your good opinion: and ſo you may cry downe the <hi>Prelates,</hi> you care not how you doe advance the reputation of ſuch deſperate <hi>heretickes.</hi> But it is now with him, and the other Prelates, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was with the Primitive Chriſtians. <hi>Tanti non eſt bonum, quanti eſt odium Chriſtianorum,</hi> as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> hath it.</p>
            <p>Nor ſtay you here. Other particulars there are which you have a fling at. You tell us of my Lord of <hi>Ely,</hi> whoſe bookes you are not fit to carry, that if he undertake an anſwer unto your doughty <hi>dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> betweene <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B. Surely he will ſacrifice all the remainder of his reaſon (if any be left in him) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</hi> Why ſo? For <hi>you are ſure he can neuer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it, except with rayling and perverting, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lyeth his principall faculty,</hi> (your owne you meane) <hi>in fighting againſt the truth, &amp;c. p.</hi> 127. Of my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> you give this <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> that it were <hi>ſtrange</hi> if <hi>ſuch a myſtery of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> (as you there complaine of) <hi>ſhould be found in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but a Prelate, and in this one by name, for a tryed champion of Rome,</hi> and <hi>ſo devout a votary to his Queene of Heaven, p.</hi> 126. My Lord of <hi>Norwich</hi> is entituled in the <hi>Newes from Ipſwich,</hi> by the name of <hi>little Pope Regulus,</hi> moſt exceeding prettily.
<q>And finally you tell us of thoſe Biſhops that attend the Court whom you include un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in their mouthes then declamations againſt the good Miniſters of the land, the Kings moſt loyall, dutifull, faithfull, obedient, peaceable ſubjects; whom they accuſe, you ſay, as facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſeditious, and turbulent perſons, diſſaffected to preſent government, enemies of the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and what not. <hi>p.</hi> 48.49.</q>
So you, but were it any thing materiall, I could tell you other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and make it manifeſt both to you and all the world, that thoſe whom you traduce moſt fouly, and againſt whom your ſtomacke riſeth in ſo vile a manner; are ſuch who both for their endeavours for this Churches honour, fidelity unto the ſervice of the King, and full abilities in learning, have had no equals in this Church, ſince the <hi>Reformation.</hi> This could I doe, if I conceived it proper to this place and time; and that I did not call to minde what <hi>Velleius</hi> taught me, <hi>viz. Vivorum ut magna admiratio, ita cenſura eſt difficilis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor doe you onely breath out malice, but you threaten ruine, you conjure all the kingdome to riſe up againſt them, and magnifie thoſe diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpirits, which hitherto have ſtood it out in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them: and ſeeme content, in caſe their lives might runne an hazard, to foregoe your owne. For likening them unto the builders of the Tower of Babel, <hi>p.</hi> 32. you doe thus proceede. But as then ſo now, the Lord is able by an uncouth way, which they never dreamed of, to confound them and their worke, to their eternall infamy. Even ſo O Lord. <hi>p.</hi> 33.
<q>And more then ſo, you tell us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

by what meanes it ſhall come to paſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that it ſhall riſe, as it were from beneath them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as their height ſeemes to ſecure them from all danger, as trampling all things under feete, &amp;c. yet by that which ſeemeth to them moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, ſhall they fall from that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, ſhall their calamity ariſe, <hi>p.</hi> 97.</q>
How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to make all things ſure, you ſtirre both hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth againſt them.
<q>You let the nobility to underſtand, that if we ſit downe thus and hide us under the hatches, whileſt the <hi>Romiſh Pirats</hi> doe ſurprize us and cut our throates, &amp;c.

               <q>What then adviſe you to be done? that in the name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> they rouze up their noble and chriſtian zeale, and magnanimous courage for the truth, and now ſticke cloſe to God and the King, in helping the Lord and his annointed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the mighty. <hi>p.</hi> 23.</q>
In your addreſſe unto the <hi>Iudges,</hi> you conjure them thus.
<q>For Gods ſake therefore, ſith his Majeſty hath committed unto you the ſword of Iuſtice, draw it forth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the lawes againſt ſuch <hi>innovators,</hi> who (as much as in them lieth) divide betweene the King and the people. <hi>p.</hi> 31.</q>

workers of iniquity, and to roote them out of the confines and limits of the Kingdome, &amp;c. applying ſo to them a paſſage in the booke of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for the Gunpowder day, intended by the Church againſt all ſuch as are ſo treacherouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, as thoſe traytors were.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is enough, a man would thinke, to effect the buſineſſe; yet this is not all. For ſhould there come a Parliament, you would adventure your owne life, to make ſure worke on't.
<q>Aſſuring us, that if it were a law in <hi>England,</hi> as once amongſt the <hi>Locrians,</hi> that whoſoever would propound a new law, ſhould come with an halter about his necke, that if it pleaſed not the <hi>Senate,</hi> the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was ready to doe his office; and that if op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſerved, you would come with an halter about your necke with this propoſition, that it would pleaſe the great Senate of this land to take into their ſad conſideration, whether upon ſuch woefull experience, it were not both more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable to the King, and more ſafe for his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome &amp;c. That the Lordly prelacy were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into ſuch a godly government, as might ſuite better with Gods word, and Chriſts ſweet yoke. <hi>p.</hi> 109.110.</q>
Nay ſo tranſcendent is your malice, that you propoſe a ſpeedy execution of them as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedy to divert Gods judgements, for thus you ſtate the queſtion in the newes from <hi>Ipſwich. Is, it not then high time for his Majeſty to hang up ſuch Arch traytors to our faith, Church, Religion, and ſuch true-bred ſonnes of the Romane Antichriſt?</hi> And
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4205:60"/>
anon after more expreſſely. <hi>Certainely till his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhall ſee theſe purgations rectified, ſuperſtition and idolatry removed, &amp;c. and hang up ſome of theſe</hi> Romiſh Prelates and inquiſitors <hi>before the Lord, as the</hi> Gibeonites <hi>once did the ſeaven ſonnes of</hi> Saul, <hi>wee can never hope to abate any of Gods Plagues, &amp;c.</hi>
And to the ſame effect, in your addreſſe to the nobility,
<q>All the world feele in what a diſtracted ſtate things do ſtand, what a cloud of divine diſpleaſure hangs over us, how ill wee thrive in our affaires, &amp;c. Certainely if ſuch be ſuffred to goe on thus as they doe, God muſt needes deſtroy us. <hi>p.</hi> 24.</q>
Finally, that you may ſeeme to ſhew ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on them, before the executioner doe his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, you thus invite them to repentance. <hi>Certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hell enlargeth her ſelfe for you, and your damnation ſleepeth not,</hi> if <hi>you ſpeedily repent not, p.</hi> 81. Of your <hi>Pulpit-libell.</hi> Hanging, and hell, and all too little to appeaſe your malice: which is advanced ſo high, that no chaſtizement of their perſons, but an utter abolition of the calling, will in fine content you.

duſt, and the whole government of the Church committed to the holy <hi>Elders,</hi> whereof you are chiefe. In caſe you cannot prove what you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, you are contented to ſubmit to the old Law amongſt the <hi>Locrians,</hi> &amp; let the Executioner do his office. I take you at your word, and expect your evidence: firſt that the Prelates have uſurped a power peculiar to his ſacred Majeſtie, which is the firſt part of your charge. How prove you that.
<q>Marry ſay you, becauſe of ſundry ſtatutes, as in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, and Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, which doe annex all Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction unto the Crowne of <hi>England</hi>; ſo as no Prelate or other perſon hath any power to viſit Eccleſiaſticall perſons, &amp;c. but he muſt have it immediatly from the King, and confirmed by Letters Patents under the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> pag. 68.</q>
So farre the tenor of the Law, if you tell us true; or rather if your learned Counſell rightly informed D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Baſtwicke</hi> in it, from whoſe mouth you tooke it.
<q>Now for the practiſe of our Prelates, you tell us that they neither have at any time, nor never ſought to have any the Kings Letters patents under the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> for their kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Courts and Viſitations. But doe all in their owne names, and under their owne Seales, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law in that behalfe, pag. 69.</q>
There be your <hi>Major</hi> and your <hi>Minor.</hi> The concluſion followes.
<q>So as being a power not derived from the King, as the immediate fountaine of it, it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4205:63"/>
proves to bee at leaſt a branch of that forreine power altogether excluded in the Statute, 1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. And it is flatly againſt the <hi>oath of ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie</hi> in the ſame ſtatute which all Prelates take, wherein they profeſſe and promiſe faith and true allegiance to the Queenes highneſſe, her heires and lawfull ſucceſſors, and to their power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all juriſdictions, priviledges, &amp;c. granted to the Queenes highneſſe, her heires, &amp;c. p. 70.71.</q>
In fine you bring them all in a <hi>premunire, &amp; leave them to the learned in the law</hi>: of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> if you were one, or that your <hi>learned Counſell</hi> might ſit <hi>Iudge,</hi> to decide the controverſie; <hi>Lord have mercy upon them.</hi>

            <p>For anſwer hereunto wee would faine know of you, where it is ſaid, what Law, what Statute ſo reſolves it, that no Prelate or other perſon hath any power to viſit Eccleſiaſticall perſons, &amp;c. but he muſt have it immediatly from the King and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Letters patents under the great Seale of <hi>England.</hi> None of the Acts of Parliament made by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt or Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſpeake one word that way.

If you ſhould bee ſo ſimple as ſo to thinke (as I have no great confidence either in your law or wiſedome) you may be pleaſed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that by the very ſelfe ſame ſtatute,
<q>
                  <hi>All Canons which be not contrariant nor repugnant to the Lawes, ſtatutes and cuſtomes of the Realme, nor to the damage or hurt of the Kings prerogative Royall, ſhall be now ſtill executed</hi> and uſed as they were before the making of that act, till the ſaid Canons ſhould be viewed by the 32.

So that for exerciſe of any <hi>Epiſcopall juriſdiction,</hi> founded upon the ſaid <hi>old Canons,</hi> or any of the new which have beene ſince confirmed by the King or his predeceſſours: there's no neceſſity of ſpeciall <hi>Letters Patents</hi> under the broad Seale of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4205:64"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> as you faine would have it. There was another Statute of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight <hi>concerning the Kings highneſſe to bee the ſupreame head of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and to have authority to reforme all errors, hereſies and abuſes in the ſame.</hi> But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever power was therein declared, as due and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the King, is not now materiall: the whole act being repealed <hi>A.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>Ph.</hi> and <hi>M. c.</hi> 8. and not reſtored in the reviver of Qu. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1. in which you inſtance in your Margin. [Nor can you finde much comfort by that Statute, 1. <hi>Eliz c.</hi> 1. wherein you inſtance, if you conſider it, and the intention of the ſame, as you ought to doe. You may conjecture by the title of it, what the meaning is; For it's intituled, <hi>An act reſtoring to the Crowne the antient juriſdiction over the ſtate Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall and ſpirituall, and aboliſhing all forreine power repugnant to the ſame.</hi> The preamble unto the act makes it yet more plaine.
<q>Where it is ſayd that in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, divers good Lawes, and Statutes were made and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, aſwell for the utter extinguiſhment and putting away of all uſurped and forreine powers and authorities out of this Realme, &amp;c. as alſo for the reſtoring and uniting to the imperiall Crowne thereof the antient juriſdictions, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, ſuperiorities and preheminences to the ſame of right belonging and apperteining: by meanes whereof the ſubjects were disburdened of divers great and intollerable charges and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions before that time unlawfully taken and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4205:65"/>
exacted by ſuch forreine power and authority, as before that was uſurped.</q>
Which makes it manifeſt that there was no intent in the <hi>Queene</hi> or <hi>Parliament,</hi> to alter any thing in the <hi>ordinary power Epiſcopall,</hi> which was then and had long before beene here eſtabliſhed: but to extinguiſh that uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and forreine power, which had before beene chalenged by the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was ſo burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome unto the ſubject. The body of the Act is moſt plaine of all.
<q>For preſently on the aboliſhment <hi>of all forreine power and juriſdiction, ſpirituall and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, heretofore uſed within this Realme,</hi> there followeth a declaration of <hi>all ſuch juriſdictions, &amp;c.</hi> as by any ſpirituall or Eccleſiaſticall power and authority hath heretofore or may lawfully be exerciſed or uſed for the viſitation of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall ſtate and perſons, and for reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, order and correction of the ſame, and of all manner errours, hereſies, ſchiſmes, &amp;c. to bee for ever united and annexed to the imperiall crowne of this Realme.</q>
Then in the next words followeth the eſtabliſhment of the <hi>High Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> it being then and there enacted that the
<q>Queenes highneſſe, her heires and ſucceſſours, ſhall have full power and authority by vertue of the ſaid act, by letters Patents under the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> to aſſigne, name and authoriſe, &amp;c. ſuch perſon or perſons being naturall borne ſubjects to her highneſſe, her heires and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, as her Majeſtie ſhall thinke meete to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, uſe, occupie and execute under her highneſſe,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4205:65"/>
her heires and ſucceſſours, all manner of Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, priviledges, and preheminences within theſe her Realmes of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> and to viſit, reforme, order, redreſſe, correct and amend all ſuch errours, hereſies, ſchiſmes, abuſes, offences; contempts &amp; enormities whatſoever, which by any manner Spirituall or Eccleſiaſticall power, authority or juriſdiction, can or may be lawfully reformed, &amp;c.</q>
Plainely in all this act there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to that <hi>ordinary juriſdiction,</hi> which is and hath beene claimed and exerciſed by <hi>Epiſcopall authority,</hi> in the Church of England: nothing at all which doth concerne the purchaſing or procuring of <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> for their keeping Courts, and Viſitations; as you ſeduced by your <hi>learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile,</hi> beare the world in hand. My reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatever juriſdiction was here declared to be annexed unto the crowne, is called a <hi>restoring</hi> of the antient juriſdiction unto the ſame: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, the <hi>ordinary Epiſcopall</hi> power, of <hi>ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, excommunication,</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> cenſures, were never in the crowne in <hi>fact,</hi> nor of <hi>right</hi> could be: and therefore could not be reſtored. And ſecondly becauſe whatever power is here declared to be in the Queene, her heires and uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours; ſhee is inabled to transferre upon ſuch <hi>Commiſsioners,</hi> as ſhee or they ſhall authoriſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> for execution of the ſame. Now we know well that there is no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the <hi>high Commiſsion</hi> (which is eſtabliſhed on this clauſe) derogating from the <hi>ordinary Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall</hi>

power; and therefore there was none ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the act it ſelfe, to be inveſted in the <hi>Queene</hi>: the ſaid Epiſcopall authority remaining as it did, and ſtanding on the ſelfe ſame grounds as it had done formerly. Which ſaid, the laſt part of the Argument touching the <hi>oath of ſupremacie,</hi> taken and to be taken by every Biſhop, that's already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the Premiſſes: the ſaid oath being onely framed, for the aboliſhment of all <hi>forreine</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> power; not for the altering of the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> and domeſticall juriſdiction, if I ſo may call it, in this Church eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>I hope the Prelates are now out of danger of the <hi>Premunire,</hi> which you threatned them; though you not out of danger of the <hi>Locrian</hi> law: And if K. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. helpe you not, I know no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but that according to your owne conditions, the executioner may be ſent for to doe his office. Now for K. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. the caſe ſtood thus. King <hi>Edward</hi> being a <hi>Minor</hi> about nine yeares old, at his firſt comming to the crowne; there was much heaving at the Church, by ſome great men which were about him, who purpoſed to inrich themſelves with the ſpoyles thereof. For the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of which purpoſe it was thought expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to leſſen the authoritie of thoſe Biſhops which were then in place; and make all thoſe that were to come, the more obnoxious to the Court; upon this ground there paſſed a ſtatute 1<hi rend="sup">0</hi> of this King conſiſting of two principall branches: whereof the firſt tooke off all manner of elections, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4205:66"/>
writs of <hi>Conge d'peſlier,</hi> formerly in uſe; the other did if not take off, yet very much abate the edge of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> cenſures.
<q>In the firſt branch it was enacted, that from thenceforth no writ of <hi>Conge d' peſlier</hi> be granted, nor election of any Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or Biſhop, by Deane and Chapter made; but that the king may by his letters Patents at all times, when any Arch-biſhopricke or Biſhopricke is voyde, conferre the ſame on any whom the king ſhall thinke meete.</q>
               <q>The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond clauſe concerned the manner of proceeding from that time to be uſed in ſpirituall courts, <hi>viz.</hi> that all ſummons, Citations, and other proceſſe Eccleſiaſticall in all ſuites and cauſes of inſtance, and all cauſes of correction, and all cauſes of baſtardie, or bigamie, or <hi>de jure patronatus,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of Teſtaments and Commiſſions of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of perſons deceaſed, &amp;c. be made with in the name and with the ſtile of the king, as it is in <hi>writs Originall</hi> or <hi>Iudiciall</hi> at the Common Law, &amp;c. As alſo that no manner of perſon or perſons who hath the exerciſe of Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction uſe other ſeale of juriſdiction but wherein his majeſties Armes bee ingraven, &amp;c. on penaltie of running in his Majeſties diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and indignation, and ſuffering impriſonment at his will and pleaſure.</q>
The reaſon of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is thus delivered in the Preamble.
<q>To the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond branch, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe that all authoritie of juriſdiction ſpirituall and temporall is derived and deducted from the kings Majeſtie, as <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4205:67"/>
head</hi> of theſe Churches, and Realmes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. and that all Courts Eccleſiaſticall within the ſaid two realmes, bee kept by no other power or authoritie, either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine, or within the Realme, but by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the kings moſt excellent Majeſtie.</q>
Which Act, with every branch and clauſe thereof was afterwards repealed, 1 of Queene <hi>Marie, cap.</hi> 2. and hath ſtood ſo repealed to this very time. For howſoever you pretend, and all your fellow libellers inſiſt upon it, that the ſaid ſtatute was revived in the firſt yeare of K. <hi>Iames</hi> of bleſſed memorie, and therefore that you are yet ſafe from the <hi>Locrian</hi> law: yet this pretence will little helpe you. That their aſſertion or pretences, if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined rightly will proove to be a very poore ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; invented onely by ſuch boutefeus as you and your Accomplices, to draw the Prelates into ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy with the common people, and make your Proſelytes beleeve that they uſurpe a power pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to his ſacred Majeſtie, it being poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by my Lords the Iudges, with an unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent, and ſo declared by my Lords chiefe Iuſtices in the Starre-chamber, the 14 of <hi>May</hi> now laſt paſt, that the ſayd Act of Repeale 1 of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> doth ſtill ſtand in force, as unto that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtatute by you ſo much preſſed; your deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate clamours unto the contrary notwithſtanding. Nor doth there want good reaſon why the ſaid Statute of K. <hi>Edward</hi> was at firſt repealed, or why the ſaid Repeale ſhould bee ſtill in force. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4205:67"/>
it was enacted in that Statute that from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth all Eccleſiaſticall proceſſe ſhould bee made in the kings name and ſtile, not onely in all ſuites or cauſes of inſtance, baſtardy, bigamie, Probates of Teſtaments, &amp;c. which have much in them of a civill, or a mixt nature at the leſt; but in all cauſes of <hi>correction</hi> alſo: it came to paſſe that excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and other cenſures of the Church, which are ſpirituall meerely, &amp; in no ſort civill, were ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by either quite aboliſhed, or of none effect. And it continued ſo all King <hi>Edwards</hi> reigne, to the no ſmall increaſe of vice, becauſe it nouriſhed a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of impunitie in the vicious perſon. This Father <hi>Latimer</hi> complaineth of in his ſermon prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before that King at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> Anno 1550. thus.
<q>Lecherie is uſed throughout <hi>England,</hi> and ſuch Lechery as is uſed in none other place of the world. And yet it is made a matter of ſport, a matter of nothing, a laughing matter and a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle not to be paſſed on, nor reformed, &amp;c. Well I truſt it will one day be amended, &amp;c. And here I will make a ſuite to your highneſſe, to reſtore unto the Church the diſcipline of Chriſt, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating ſuch as be notable offenders; nor never deviſe any other way, For no man is able to deviſe any better way, than that God hath done; with excommunication to put them from the congregation till they bee confounded. Therefore reſtore Chriſts diſcipline for excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. And that ſhall be a meane both to pacifie Gods wrath and indignation, and alſo that leſſe abomination ſhall be uſed, than in times
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4205:68"/>
paſt hath beene, and is at this day. I ſpeake this of a Conſcience, and I meane to move it of a will to your Grace and your Realme. Bring into the Church of <hi>England</hi> open diſcipline of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, that open ſinnes may be ſtricken withall.</q>
So farre Father <hi>Latimer.</hi> What thinke you ſir of this? See you not reaſon for it now, why your ſayd Statute was repealed, and why the ſayd repeale, ſhould continue ſtill. Put all that hath beene ſayd together, and I can ſee no hopes you have to ſcape the penaltie of the Law by your ſelfe propoſed; but that you cry <hi>peccavi,</hi> and repent your follies.</p>
            <p>So farre in anſwere to your Cavils, (for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I cannot call them) I have beene bold to juſtifie the proceedings of the Biſhops, in their Courts Epiſcopall: wherein there is not any thing that they uſurpe upon the King, or that authoritie which is inſeparably annexed to the Regall dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme.
<q>For granting that all authority of juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſpirituall is derived from the King, as <hi>ſupreme head</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (although that title by that name, be not now aſſumed in the ſtile Imperiall) and that all Courts Eccleſiaſticall within this Realme be kept by no other authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, either forreine or within this Realme, but by authority of the kings moſt excellent maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie; as is averred in the ſayd Preamble of King <hi>Edwards</hi> ſtatute: yet this if rightly underſtood, would never hurt the Biſhops, or advantage you.</q>
But my reaſon is, becauſe that whenſoever the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4205:68"/>
king grants out his <hi>Conge d' peſlier</hi> for the election of a Biſhop, and afterwards doth paſſe his <hi>royall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> to the ſaid election, &amp; ſend his <hi>Mandate</hi> to the Metropolitan for <hi>conſecration</hi> of the party which is ſo elected: he doth withall conferre upon him, a power to exerciſe that juriſdiction, which by his conſecration, done by the kings eſpeciall Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, he hath atteined to. And this may alſo ſerve for anſwere to your other cavill; but that Biſhops may not hold their courts or viſitations without letters Patents from the king. For were there ſuch a law, (as there is no ſuch) yet were the Prelates ſafe enough from your <hi>Praemunire</hi>: becauſe the <hi>Royall aſsent</hi> to the election, and <hi>Mandat</hi> for the conſecration, paſſing by broad ſeale, as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is; inable them once conſecrated to exerciſe what ever juriſdiction is by the <hi>Canon</hi> incident to <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> power. No neede of ſpeciall <hi>letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> for every Act of juriſdiction, as you idly dreame. No more than if a man being made a <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> under the broad ſeale of <hi>England,</hi> and having tooke his oath as the law requires; ſhould neede for every <hi>ſpeciall Act</hi> ſome <hi>ſpeciall warrant</hi>; or any other kinde of warrant than what was given him in the generall, when firſt made a <hi>Iuſtice.</hi> And yet I trow the King is the immediate fountaine alſo of all <hi>temporall</hi> power; and no man dare execute authority, but from and by him. Touching his Majeſties <hi>ſupremacie,</hi> more than in anſwere to your clamours, I ſhall ſay nothing at this preſent as neither of this place nor purpoſe. It is an Argument of great weight; fit rather for a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4205:69"/>
treatiſe, than an occaſionall replication. Only I will be bold to tell you, that if the <hi>kings ſupremacy</hi> were not more truely and ſincerely, (without any colour or diſſimulation) as the <hi>Canon</hi> hath it, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by my Lords the Biſhops, than by ſuch as you: it would be at a loſſe ere long, and ſetled on the veſtrie wherein you preſide. For wot you what King <hi>Iames</hi> replied on the like occaſion.
<q>When D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Reynolds</hi> in the Conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> came in unſeaſonably once or twice with the Kings <hi>Supremacie.</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Reynolds</hi> quoth the King, you have often ſpoken for my ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: and it is well. But know you any here, or any elſewhere, who like of the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Eccleſiaſticall, that finde fault or diſlike with my <hi>ſupremacie</hi>! And (ſhortly after) putting his hand unto his hat, his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> ſayd, My Lords the Biſhops I may thanke you, that theſe men doe thus pleade for my <hi>Supremacie.</hi> They thinke they cannot make their party good againſt you, but by appealing unto it, as if you or ſome that adhere unto you, were not well affected towards it. But if once you were out and they in place, I know what would become of my <hi>ſupremacie.</hi> No Biſhop, no King, as before I ſayd.</q>
How like you this Maſſ. <hi>Burton,</hi> is not this your caſe? <hi>Mutato nomine de ie fabula narratur.</hi> You plead indeed for the Kings ſupremacie; but intend your owne.</p>
            <p>The next great crime you have to charge upon the Biſhops, is that they doe oppreſſe the kings Leige people, againſt law and conſcience. How
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4205:69"/>
ſo. Becauſe, as you informe us, <hi>Prohibitions</hi> are not got ſo eaſily from the Courts of Iuſtice, as they have beene formerly: and being gotten, finde not ſuch entertainement and obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as before they did.
<q>This you conceive to be their fault: and charge them that by ſtopping the ordinary courſe of law, the Kings people are cut off from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Kings good lawes: ſo as it is become very geaſon and a rare matter to obteine a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition</hi> againſt their illegall practiſes, in vexing and oppreſſing the kings good ſubjects. Nay, they are growne ſo formidable of late, (as if they were ſome new generation of Giants) that the very motion of a <hi>Prohibition</hi> againſt a Prelate, or their proceedings in the <hi>high Commiſsion,</hi> makes the <hi>Courts of Iustice</hi> ſtartle; ſo as good cauſes are loſt, and Innocents condemned becauſe none dare pleade and judge their cauſe according to the Kings Lawes, whereby wee ought all to be governed, <hi>p.</hi> 69.70.</q>
My Maſters of the Law, and my Lords the Iudges, will conne you little thankes for ſo ſoule a ſlander, greater then which cannot be laid on the profeſſion, or the Courts of <hi>Iuſtice.</hi> What none dare pleade, nor none dare judge according to the Lawes? So you ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. And more then ſo, in your <hi>addreſſe</hi> unto the Iudges.
<q>What meane's, ſay you, that difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of obtaining <hi>prohibitions</hi> now adayes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Kings <hi>innocent</hi> Subjects (you are an <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> indeed, God helpe you) ſhould be relieved againſt their unjuſt moleſtations and oppreſſions
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4205:70"/>
in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and <hi>high Commiſsion?</hi> What meaneth that conſternation of ſpirit among <hi>Lawyers,</hi> that few or none can be found to pleade a cauſe be it never ſo juſt, againſt an oppreſſing Prelate, and are either menaced or impriſoned if they doe. <hi>p.</hi> 29.</q>
               <hi>Hoc eſt quod palles?</hi> Is this the thing that ſo offends you, that prohibitions are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, or not ſent out ſo frequently from the Courts of Law, as of late they were, to the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing if not annulling the authority of the <hi>Court Chriſtian?</hi> I trow you are the onely <hi>Clergie-man</hi> that complaines of this. Or if there be more ſuch, they be ſuch as you, who onely make a property of the civill Courts, by them to ſcape their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in the Eccleſiaſticall. Were you ſo <hi>innocent,</hi> as you would have us thinke, you rather ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce for the Churches ſake, that Prohibitions flie not out ſo thicke, as they have done formely, to the great oppreſſion of the Clergie in their ſuites and buſineſſes, eſpecially in thoſe which did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Patrimony of the Church, their tithes. And if my Lords the Iudges, are with more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty mooved, to ſend abroad their <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> then were their predeceſſours in the place before them; it is a pregnant evidence of their great love to juſtice: Nor can it but be counted an honour to them to leave every Court to that which is proper to it, and for the which it was eſtabliſhed. And God forbid the Church ſhould aske or doe any thing that ſhould incroach upon them, or invade any of their rights. What doth this greeve your
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4205:70"/>
conſcience alſo? Good Sir conſider with your ſelfe, what miſchiefes <hi>Clergie-men</hi> were put to, when they could ſcarce commence a ſuite, but <hi>prohibitione cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio eſt</hi>; a <hi>Prohibition</hi> was ſent out, to ſtop the courſe of his proceedings, or if he had a ſentence to reverſe that alſo. Or if you will not trouble your ſelfe in thinking of it, will you be pleaſed to heare what our late Soveraigne King <hi>James</hi> hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therein.
<q>If (ſaith he) <hi>Prohibitions</hi> ſhould raſhly, and headily be granted, then no man is the more ſecure of his owne, though he hath gotten a ſentence with him: for as good have no law or ſentence, as to have no execution thereof. A poore Miniſter with much labor and expence, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving exhauſted his poore meanes, and being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to forbeare his ſtudie, and to become <hi>non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> from his flocke, obtaines a ſentence; and then when he lookes to enjoy the fruites thereof, he is defrauded of all by a <hi>Prohibition:</hi> And ſo he is tortured like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> who when he hath his Apple at his mouth, &amp; that he is gaping to receive it, then muſt it be pulled from him by a <hi>Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and hee not ſuffered to taſte thereof.</q>
So farre the Royall Advocate hath <hi>pleaded</hi> the poore <hi>Clergies</hi> cauſe. And did he nothing as a Judge?
<q>Yes, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it to be his <hi>Office,</hi> to make every <hi>Court</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine himſelfe within his own limits; and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on admoniſhed all other Courts, that they ſhould be carefull, every of them, to containe themſelves within the bounds of their owne juriſdictions; the <hi>Courts of Common law,</hi> that they ſhould not be ſo
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4205:71"/>
forward and prodigall in multiplying their <hi>Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay perhaps, that your exception lieth againſt the ſtopping of the courſe of <hi>Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> not ſo much, if at all, in reall, as in perſonall actions: and that you are offended only, becauſe by this meanes the Kings <hi>Innocent</hi> Subjects, are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved (as you and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne</hi> once were) from the unjuſt oppreſſions of the <hi>Courts Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> and <hi>High Commiſſion.</hi> Why, what's the matter?
<q>There is, you tell us, a great perſecution in the Church, and many a faithfull godly Miniſter, hath beene of late ſuſpended from his miniſtery, and outed of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, by the Prelates, in the Courts aforeſaid: no remedy being to be had, as in former times from the <hi>Common Law.</hi> For as the common ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor goeth (at leaſt you make a rumour of it) the courſe of <hi>Juſtice</hi> is ſtopped in theſe caſes, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none dares open his mouth to pleade a cauſe againſt the Prelates.</q>
So you in your addreſſe to my Lords the Judges. p. 29.
<q>For an example of the which, as well the perſecution, as the want of Remedie, you inſtance in the Miniſters of <hi>Surrey,</hi> who are ſuſpended of their miniſterie, and outed of their meanes and freeholds againſt all law and conſcience: yet are ſo diſheartned and over-awed that they dare not contend in law againſt their Prelate, [the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Winton</hi>] for feare of further vexations, and are out of hope of any faire hearing in an ordinary legall way. p. 70. of your <hi>Paſquill.</hi>
               </q>
What want of remedie can you or they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4205:71"/>
complaine of, if they have not ſought it: or rather if their conſcience tell them, and thoſe with whom they have adviſed, advertiſe them, that in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as this is, the Judges cannot by the law, award a <hi>Prohibition,</hi> if they ſhould deſire it. Doe you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the caſe aright? If not, I will take leave to tell you; His Maieſtie having publiſhed his <hi>Declaration</hi> about <hi>lawfull paſtimes on the Sunday,</hi> gives order to his Biſhops that <hi>publication thereof be made in all their ſeverall dioceſſes, reſpectively.</hi> The Biſhops here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon appoint the <hi>Incumbent</hi> of every Church, to read the booke unto the people; that ſo the people might the better take notice of it: and finding op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the ſaid appointment; made by ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory perſons, of your owne condition, preſſe them to the performance of it by vertue of that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall</hi> obedience, which by their ſeverall oathes they were bound to yeeld unto their <hi>Ordinaries</hi>: But ſeeing nothing but contempt, and contempt upon contempt, after much patience and long-ſuffering, and expectation of conformitie to their ſaid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, ſome of the moſt pervers amongſt them, have in ſome places, beene ſuſpended, aſwell a <hi>beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio</hi> as <hi>officio,</hi> for an example to the reſt. No man deprived, or outed, as you ſay, of his meanes and livelihood, that I heare of yet? This is the Caſe. Which being meerly Eccleſiaſticall, as unto the ground, being a contempt of and againſt their <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie</hi>; and meerely Eccleſiaſticall, as unto the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which was ſuſpenſion: I cannot ſee what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie you can find for them amongſt the <hi>Lawyers,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:4205:72"/>
but that which every man might give them, good and wholſome <hi>Counſaile.</hi> And call you this a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? when a few refractarie perſons are juſtly puniſhed in a legall way, for their diſobedience? For howſoever they and you pretend, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was contrary to the Law of God, and could not be performed with a ſafe <hi>conſcience</hi>; yet this was onely a pretence: their reading of the booke (had the Contents thereof diſpleaſed them) being no more an Argument of their approbation of any thing therein contained; then when a <hi>Common Crier</hi> reades a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> which perhaps he likes not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It muſt be therefore ſome <hi>Aſſociation</hi> had and made amongſt them, to ſtand it out unto the laſt; and put ſome baffle or affront on that authoritie which had impoſed it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Such alſo is the perſecution doubtleſſe, which you ſo complaine of in the two whole Counties of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> and <hi>Suffolke,</hi> where in a very ſhort ſpace, (as you ſay) there hath beene the fouleſt havock of Miniſters, and their flocks, &amp;c. as ever our eyes have ſeene: there being already, as you tell us, 60 Miniſters ſuſpended, and betweene 60. and 80. more having had time given them till Chriſt-tide (take head of Chriſtmaſſe by all meanes, by which time, as you ſay, they muſt either bid their good conſcience fare-well, or elſe their pretious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and neceſſary meanes.

The ſame is alſo told
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4205:72"/>
us in the <hi>Newes</hi> from <hi>Ipſwich.</hi> Nay, more then ſo, you tell us how one or two godly Miniſters (ſome of your Aſſociates) were threatned by Docter <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi> Chancellor of that dioceſſe, with Piſtolling and hanging, and I know not what; becauſe they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to read His Majeſties Declaration about law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſports. In this you doe as ſhamefully belie the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> as you have done the Biſhop in all the reſt: of whoſe proceedings in that dioceſſe, I will preſent you with a ſhort account, that you may ſee how groſly you abuſe the world. And firſt, you may be pleaſed to know, that the Clergie of that Dioceſſe, comprehending all that are in ſpirituall dignitie or office, and all Parſons, Vicars, Curates and Schoole-maſters (taking in the Lecturers with all) amount unto the number of 1500. or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. So that in caſe there had beene 60. of that Fifteene hundred ſuſpended by the Biſhop, as you ſay there were; had this beene ſuch a terrible perſecution, as you give it out for? But yet it is not ſo as you tell us neither. For at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>November,</hi> when you Preached that <hi>Paſquil,</hi> of the Fifteene hundred, there were not twice fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, &amp; that's not halfe your number involved in any Eccleſiaſticall cenſure of what ſort ſoever; and not above ſixteene ſuſpended.

Now of the reſidue, there was one deprived, after notorious inconformitie for 12. yeeres together, and finall obſtinacie after ſundry ſeverall moniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: eight excommunicated for not appearing at the Court, and foure inhibited from preaching; of the which foure, one by his education, was a <hi>Draper,</hi> another was a <hi>Weaver,</hi> and the third was a <hi>Taylor.</hi> Where are the 60. now, that you ſo cry out of? I have the rather given you this in the particulars, (which were collected faithfully unto my hands, out of the Regiſterie of that Dioceſſe) that you, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men may ſee, your falſe and unjuſt clamours: the rather, becauſe it was related to me by a friend of mine in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> that it went current there amongſt your Brethren, that your ſaid 60. were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended for no other cauſe, then for repeating the <hi>doxologie</hi> at the end of the Lords Prayer. So for your other number betweene 60. and 80. ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon day till <hi>Chriſtmaſſe</hi> (or <hi>Chriſtide</hi> as you pleaſe to phraſe it) upon examination of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, there appeare but eight; and thoſe not all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended neither: two being Excommunicated for not appearing. Eighty and Eight doe come as neere in ſound, as Sixtie and Sixteene before: but differ more a great deale in the Calculation. And ſo much for the grand perſecution in the Dioceſſe of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich.</hi> How doe you find it pray you, in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?

alſo, in a moſt barbarous and furious manner, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended, excommunicated, outed of their livings, and deprived of all livelihood and means to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themſelves.</q>
How juſt ſoever the cauſe be on the Prelates part, and that there be no other means to bring things to right, there where the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church are ſo out of order, then by the exemplary puniſhment of the moſt pervers, to ſettle and reduce the reſt: yet perſecution it muſt be, if you pleaſe to call it ſo.

               <q>You call upon the Biſhops by the name of <hi>Ieſuiticall novell Doctors,</hi> to bluſh and be aſhamed, and tell them that they doe ſuſpend, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and perſecute with all fury Gods faithfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and all becauſe they will not, they may not, they dare not obey their wicked commands, which are repugnant to the lawes both of God and man. p. 81.</q>
If this be true, if thoſe that bee thus dealt with bee Gods faithfull miniſters, and the commands impoſed upon them ſo wicked
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4205:75"/>
as you ſay they are, contrary to the lawes both of God and man: and tending ſo notoriouſly to ſet up <hi>Popery</hi> againe: you have the better end of the ſtaffe, and will prevaile at laſt, no queſtion.
<q>Meane while you have good cauſe, as you pleaſe to tell us, to comfort your ſelfe, and bleſſe the name of God, in that he hath not left himſelfe without witneſſe, but hath raiſed up many zealous and couragious champions of his truth, I meane faithfull mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of his word, who chuſe rather to loſe all they have, then to ſubmit and proſtitute themſelves to the wicked, unjuſt, and baſe commands of uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping &amp; <hi>Antichriſtian muſhromes:</hi> their very not yeilding in this battel being a preſent victory. <hi>p.</hi> 83</q>
But on the other ſide, if the commands of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior be juſt and pious, agreeable to the orders of the Church, and all pure antiquity: then are your god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faithfull miniſters no better then factious and ſchiſmaticall perſons: and you your own deare ſelf a ſeditious <hi>Boutefeiu,</hi> ſo to incourage and applaud them for ſtanding out againſt authority. This we ſhall ſee the better, by looking on thoſe <hi>Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which as you ſay, <hi>The Prelates of later dayes have haled in by head and ſhoulders, being beſides and againſt the law of the land, and much more the law of God.</hi> p. 111. Theſe you reduce to theſe eight heads, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Innovation in doctrine. 2. in diſcipline, 3. in the worſhip of God, 4. in the Civill government, 5. in the altering of bookes, 6. in the meanes of knowledge, 7. in the rule of faith, and 8. in the Rule of manners. It is a merry world, mean-while,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4205:75"/>
when you and ſuch as you, the <hi>Innovators</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians</hi> of the preſent times, complaine of other men for that very fault, of which your ſelves are onely guilty. <hi>Quis tulerit Gracchos?</hi>

            <p>But to goe with you point <hi>per</hi> point, what <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> have you to complaine of in point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?
Marry, ſay you,
<q>There was an order procured from King <hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory to the Univerſities, that young Students ſhould not reade our moderne learned writers, as <hi>Calvin; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> and others of the reformed Churches, but the Fathers and School-men. p. 111.</q>
               <hi>Quid hoc ad Ithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cli boves?</hi> What have the Biſhops now alive to do with any act of King <hi>James</hi> his time: or how can this direction of that learned Prince bee brought within the compaſſe of <hi>Innovations</hi> in point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? Directions to young Students how to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſpoſe their ſtudies, are no points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: nor doe I finde it in the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Calvin</hi> or <hi>Beza</hi> are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> bee preferred before Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> or <hi>Aquinas.</hi> But doe you know the reaſon of the ſaid direction? or if you do not, will you learne? Then I will tell you. There was one <hi>Knight</hi> a young Divine that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched about that time at Saint <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and in his Sermon fell upon a dangerous point (though ſuch perhaps as you like well of) <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Magiſtrate had a lawfull power to order and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the King if he did amiſſe:</hi> uſing this ſpeech of <hi>Trajans</hi> unto the Captaine of his Guard, <hi>Accipe hunc gladium, quem pro me ſi bene imperavero diſtringes;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4205:76"/>
ſin minus contra me.</hi> For this being called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both in the Univerſity and before the King, he layed the fault of all upon ſome late Divines of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Churches, who had miſguided him in that point: eſpecially on <hi>Paraeus,</hi> who in his Comment on the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſo ſtated it, and in the which he found that ſaying of the Emperour <hi>Trajan.</hi> On this confeſſion <hi>Paraeus</hi> Comment on that Epiſtle was publickly and ſolemnly burnt at <hi>Oxford, Cambridge,</hi> and Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſſe <hi>London:</hi> And ſhortly after came out that order of King <hi>James,</hi> prohibiting young ungrounded Students to beginne their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in Divinity with ſuch books as thoſe, in whom there were ſuch dangerous poſitions, tending ſo manifeſtly to <hi>Anarchy</hi> and diſobedience: but that they ſhould beginne with the holy Scriptures, ſo <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendendo</hi> to the Fathers, and the School men, and by degrees to thoſe Divines you ſo much magnifie.

               </gap> hurt in this good ſir, but that it ſeemes, you are poſſeſſed with your old feare, that by this means the Kings may come to have an unlimited power: and abſolute obedience will be preſſed more throughly on the ſubjects conſcience. Beſides, you cannot but well know that generally thoſe divines of forraigne Churches are contrary in the point of diſcipline, unto the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> and rites of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> which ſome implicitely, and ſome explicitely, have oppoſed and quarrelled. Which as it is the onely reaſon why you would have them ſtudied in the firſt place, that ſo young ſtudents might be ſeaſoned with your <hi>Puritan</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4205:76"/>
ſo might it be another motive, why by the Kings direction they ſhould come in laſt; that Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents finding in the Fathers, Councels, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall hiſtorians, what was the true and ancient kinde of governement in the Church of Chriſt, might judge the better of the modernes when they came to reade them. Nor was this any new direction: neither it being ordered by the Canons of the yeere 1571. Cap. <hi>de Concionatoribus,</hi> that nothing ſhould bee preached unto the people, but what was conſonant unto the doctrine of the old and new Teſtament, <hi>quodque ex illa ipsâ doctrina Catholici Patres &amp; veteres Epiſcopi collegerint,</hi> and had beene thence collected by the Orthodox Fathers, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Biſhops.</p>
            <p>As for your dealing with the <hi>Fathers,</hi> of whom you ſay as <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaid of <hi>Ennius,</hi> that they which reade them muſt <hi>margaritas e Coeno legere,</hi> gather pearles out of the mud; p. 112. that's but a taſt of your good manners. Nor would you ſlight them ſo, I take it, but that the moſt of them were <hi>Biſhops.</hi> But whatſoever you thinke of them, a wiſer man then you hath told us, <hi>qui omnem Patribus adimit authoritatem, nullam relinquet ſibi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your ſecond Innovation in point of doctrine, is ſo like the firſt; that one would ſweare they were of one mans obſervation: and that is the procuring of another order in King <hi>James</hi> his na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4205:77"/>
hurt in this? Are thoſe deepe myſteries of Gods <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Counſailes,</hi> fit argument for young unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Preachers, wherein, <hi>calores juveniles excerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> to trie their manhood, and give the firſt aſſay of their abilities? or call you this an Innovacion in point of doctrine, when as for ought you have to ſay, the doctrine in thoſe points continued, as before it did: onely the handling of the ſame was limited and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to graver heads. The like complaint you make of his Majeſties <hi>Declaration</hi> before the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, by meanes whereof you ſay, the doctrins of the Goſpell muſt bee for ever huſht and laied aſleepe. p. 114. what Sir, are all the doctrines of the Goſpel huſht and laied aſleepe, becauſe you are inhibited to preach of predeſtination and that not abſolutely neither, but that you may not wreſt the Article in that point, as you were accuſtomed. This was the Devills plea to <hi>Eve,</hi> and from him you learnt it; that God had ſaid to our firſt father, <hi>hee ſhould not eate of every or any tree in the Garden of Eden</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he was reſtrained onely from the <hi>tree of knowledge of good and evill.</hi> But hereof wee have ſpoke alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and referre you thither.

For Doctor <hi>Coſens Private Devotions,</hi> that ſtill lieth heavy on your komacke, as not yet digeſted: though both your ſelfe and your <hi>learned Counſell</hi> diſgorged your ſelves upon him in a furious manner. <hi>Brownes</hi> prayer before his Sermon if you are agrieved at, you may finde the verie clauſe <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim</hi> in King <hi>Edwards</hi> firſt liturgie, Anno 1549. which in that verie act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> wherein the ſecond was confirmed, is ſaid to bee a <hi>very Godly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, agreeable to the word of God, and the Primitive Church.</hi> As for <hi>Franciſcus a S. clara,</hi> being the book is writ in latine; and printed in the parts beyond ſea; how can you charge the Biſhops with it: for that it hath beene printed in <hi>London,</hi> and preſented to the King by a <hi>Prelate,</hi> you dare not certainely affirme; but ſpeake it onely upon heere-ſay. p. 117. Or were it ſo, yet being written in the latine, it is meete for Schollers, and ſuch as underſtand that language: not as your pamphlets are, propoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the common people, either to misinforme them, or to inflame them. As for the booke intituled the <hi>Female glorie,</hi> you finde not in it, that I ſee by your collections, any thing poſitively or dogmatically delivered, contrarie unto any point of doctrine eſtabliſhed and received in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Some ſwelling language there is in it, and ſome <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophes,</hi>

I perceive by you, to the <hi>virgin Marie</hi>; which if you take for Invocations, you miſtake his meaning: who tells us plainly, as you cite him, p. 125. that <hi>the more wee aſcribe unto her, ſetting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation apart, the more gracious wee appeare in our Saviours ſight.</hi> No Innovation hitherto in point of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>From bookes ſet out by private men, proceed we to the opinions of ſome certaine <hi>Quidams,</hi> which you are diſpleaſed with: and were it ſo, as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, yet the opinions of ſome private men, prove not in my poore Logick an <hi>Innovation</hi> in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by the Church delivered, though contrary unto the Doctrine ſo delivered. To make an <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> in point of Doctrine, there muſt be an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous and general concurrence of minds and men, to ſet on foote the new, and deſert the old: not the particular fancie of one private man. And yet I think, you will not find me out that particular man, that hath defended any thing contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and paſſed uncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured. Yes that you can, you ſay, for certaine. For a great Prelate in the <hi>High Commiſſion</hi> Court, ſaid openly at the cenſure of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> that wee and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> differ not in <hi>fundamentalibus,</hi> but <hi>circa fundamentalia:</hi> as alſo that the ſame had beene affirmed by one <hi>Choune.</hi> p. 122. Suppoſe this true, and how comes this to be an <hi>Innovation</hi> in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Hath the Church any where determined, that wee, and thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> doe differ in the <hi>Fundamentalls</hi>: if not, why
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4205:78"/>
doe you make this ſaying an <hi>Innovation</hi> in the Churches Doctrine. The Church indeed hath told us in the Nineteenth Article, that the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath erred, not only in their living and manner of Ceremonies, but alſo in matters of Faith:</hi> it hath not told us that that Church hath erred in <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls.</hi> The learned <hi>Junius</hi> could have told you that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church, <hi>quoad eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi> according to the eſſence of a Church; <hi>lib. de Eccl. cap.</hi> 7. and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Whitakers,</hi> that there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (Baptiſme, the Miniſtery, and the Scriptures) <hi>quae ad veram eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am pertinent,</hi> which properly appertaine to a true Church? An argument that neither of them thought that Church had erred in Fundamentalls. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if that confeſſion of Saint <hi>Peter, Thou art Chriſt the Sonne of the living God,</hi> Matth. 16. <hi>be that Rocke, on which the Church of Chriſt is founded</hi>; as all our <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Divines affirme it is: the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> doth hold as faſt on that foundation, as you, or any <hi>Zealot</hi> of your acquaintance; and hath done more againſt the <hi>Hereticks</hi> of this Age, in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Divinitie of our Lord and Saviour, then you, or any one of your Divines, be hee who he will. But for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it is a true Church, and that wee doe not differ from them in fundamentalls, you may ſee further in a little booke called the <hi>Reconciler</hi> (doe not you remember it, and the occaſion of it too?) writ by the Biſhop of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> now being: and therein the opinion of ſome Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, to the ſelfe ſame purpoſe, and of ſome others

In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the firſt of which, I hope you doe not think in earneſt, that whatſoever point is ventilated, and diſcuſſed in the <hi>Publike Schooles,</hi> is preſently concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be a Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi>: or that there hath beene nothing handled in thoſe diſputations, but what is agreeable thereto. Many things there, both are, and may be handled and propounded pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematically, and argued <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> as the cuſtom is; as well for the diſcovery of the trueth, as the true iſſue of the queſtion betweene the parties. And if you pleaſe to caſt your eye upon thoſe queſtions, which have beene heretofore diſputed at thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne times: how many will you find amongſt them, and thoſe of your owne ſpeciall friends, in which the Church hath not determined: or not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined ſo, as they have then and there been ſtated, and yet no clamour raiſed about it. Nor doe you

truely relate the buſineſſe neither; <hi>Theſis</hi> not being ſo propoſed, as you informe us: <hi>Viz.</hi> That wee are Juſtified by Workes; but onely that good Workes are effectually neceſſary to Salvation: ſo that the principall part of our juſtification, was by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, then and there, aſcribed to faith; workes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comming in, as effectuall meanes to our ſalvation. For <hi>Shelfords</hi> Booke, what ever is in that maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſhould as little trouble you, if he aſcribe a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall eminencie unto Charitie, in ſome certaine things; it is no more then what was taught him by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who doth preferre it, as you cannot chuſe but know, before <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope.</hi> Nor doth hee attribute our juſtification thereunto in any other ſenſe, then what was taught him by Saint <hi>James.</hi> And here I purpoſed to have left you with theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of particular and private men, but that you tell us by the way, that by the Doctrine of our Church, in the <hi>Homilies</hi> and <hi>elſewhere,</hi> it is reſolved that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Your elſe-where I am ſure is no where, and that which you alledge from the booke of <hi>Homilies,</hi> is as good as nothing.
<q>The Second <hi>Homilie</hi> for <hi>Whitſunday,</hi> concludeth with a Prayer, that by the mighty power of the holy Ghoſt, the comfortable Doctrine of Chriſt may be truely preached, truely received, and truly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in all places, to the beating down of ſinne, death, the Pope, the Devill, and all the Kingdom of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
               </q>
Can you conclude from hence, that by the Doctrin of the Church, the Pope is <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi>? the Devill aſſone. For they are put there as
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4205:80"/>
diſtinct things, the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Devill,</hi> and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Antichriſt</hi>: and being put downe as diſtinct, you have no reaſon to conclude that it is reſolved by that <hi>Homilie,</hi> that the Pope is Antichriſt. Nor doth the 6 Homilie of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> ſay the Pope is <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
               <q>Though it ſaith ſomewhat of the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonicall</hi> beaſt of <hi>Rome.</hi> The whole clauſe is this. In King <hi>Johns</hi> time the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the bruite blindneſſe, ignorance of Gods word, and ſuperſtition of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and how much they were inclined to worſhip the <hi>Babylonicall beaſt of Rome,</hi> and to feare all his threatnings and cauſeleſſe curſes, hee abuſed them thus, &amp;c.</q>
Where certainely, the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> beaſt of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the ſame with the Biſhop or Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>; but rather the abuſed power of that then prevalent and predominant See. Or were it that the Pope is meant, yet not being ſpoken poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and dogmatically, that the Pope is, and is to be beleeved to be the <hi>Babylonicall beaſt of Rome</hi>; it is no more to bee accounted for a doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then that it <hi>was plaine Simony in the Prelates then to pay unto the Biſhop of Rome great ſummes of mony for their Bulls, and conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as is there affirmed, I have yet one thing more to ſay unto you in this point. Saint <hi>John</hi> hath given it for a rule, that <hi>every ſpirit that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not, that Jeſus Christ is come in the fleſh, is not of God, but is that Spirit of</hi> Antichriſt <hi>whereof you have heard</hi> &amp;c. So that unleſſe you can make good as I thinke you cannot, that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4205:80"/>
not that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is come in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> you have no reaſon to conclude that hee is that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto we have followed you to finde an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in point of doctrine; and are yet to ſeeke: and if wee finde it not in the next two inſtances both wee and you have loſt our labour. There you ſay ſomewhat doubtleſſe, and charge the Biſhop with two dangerous innovations; one in the doctrine of obedience to ſuperiors, the other in the doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Lords-day.</hi> Theſe wee have met withall alreadie, and therefore ſhall ſay little here.
<q>Onely I would faine learne, for I know not yet, where that conditionall obedience which you one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like of, is delivered to us by the Church; where there is any thing layed downe, for a publick do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, againſt that abſolute obedience, which you ſo diſlike, and reckon the inforcing of it, amongſt the Innovations made in point of doctrine! your brethren in the Conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> put in a ſcruple, <hi>how</hi> farre an ordinance of the Church was to binde them, without impeaching of their Chriſtian libertie: where at the King being much moved, anſwered, that it ſmelled very ranckely of <hi>Anabaptiſme</hi>; adding, I charge you never to ſpeak more to that point, (how farre you are bound to obey?) when the Church hath ordained it. What think you Sir.</q>
Heere is an abſolute obedience preached to the Churches Ordinances. I hope you cannot tender leſſe unto the Orders of the King. As for that other <hi>Innovation</hi> which you tell us of,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:4205:81"/>
about the doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>; there is indeed a mighty alteration in it, I could wiſh there were not: but it was made by you and yours, who litle more then 40. yeeres agone, firſt broached theſe <hi>Sabbath-ſpeculations</hi> in the Church of <hi>England</hi>; which now you preſſe uppon her for her antient doctrine. This hath beene ſhewne at large elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and therefore I will ſay nothing now. But where you ſay, that for the maintenance of that change which you lay upon them, their <hi>novell Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, have ſtrained the veines of their conſcience no leſſe then of their braines.</hi> p. 126. I am bold to tell you, that at the beſt you are a moſt uncharitable man, to <hi>judge the hearts of thoſe, whoſe face you know not.</hi> For my part, I can ſpeake for one, and take al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to witneſſe that in the part committed to mee, I have dealt with all ingenuitie and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and make this proteſtation before God and man, that if in all the ſcriptures, Fathers, Councells, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne writers, or whatſoever monument of the Church, I met within ſo long a ſearch, I had found any thing in favour of that doctrine, which you ſo approve; I would not have concealed it, to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a truth, for all the world. How ever you accuſe me, yet my conſcience doth not. <hi>Delectat ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men conſcientia quod estanimae pabulum, incredibili jucunditate perfuſum,</hi> in <hi>Lactantius</hi> language.</p>
            <p>Your Innovations in the points of <hi>Doctrin</hi> being blowne to nothing, let us ſee next what is it that you have to ſay for the change of <hi>diſcipline</hi>; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Innovation which you charge upon my Lords
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:4205:81"/>
the Biſhops.
<q>And here you ſay, that where of old the cenſures of the Church were to be inflicted upon diſordered and vicious perſons, as drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards adulterers, heretickes, Apoſtata's, falſe-tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and the like: now the ſharpe edge thereof is turned mainely againſt Gods people and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, even for their vertue and pietie, and becauſe they will not conforme to their impious orders p. 127.</q>
That Biſhops ſometimes turne the edge of their authoritie, on thoſe who you entitle Gods mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and people, is as true, as neceſſarie: but that they turne it on them even for their pietie and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is both falſe and ſcandalous. Iuſt ſo a Brother of yours, whom I ſpare to name, preached once at <hi>Oxford,</hi> that good and honeſt men were purpoſely excluded from preferments there, <hi>ob hoc ipſum quod pij, quod boni,</hi> onely becauſe they were inclined to pietie and vertue. But Sir, thoſe godly folke you ſpeake of, are Godly onely in your eye, and in ſuch as yours: and if the edge of authoritie be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them, it is becauſe they have too much of your ſpirit in them. The cenſures of the Church proceed no otherwiſe now then of old they did. Looke in the antient <hi>Canons,</hi> and you ſhall ſee with what ſeveritie the Church of old did puniſh <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks</hi> and <hi>Separatiſts</hi>: and tell mee if the Church now doth not deale more mercifully with you, then of old it did. And where you ſeeme to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that now the cenſures of the Church are not inflicted as of old, upon diſordered and vicious perſons: that's but your wonted art to traduce the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:4205:82"/>
Biſhops and make them odious to your followers. For looke unto the Articles for the Metropolitan viſitation, of my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> Anno 1635. and for the viſitation of my Lord of <hi>Norwich,</hi> Anno 1636. both which I am ſure you have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed, or any of the reſt which you meete next with. Looke on them well, and tell mee truely, if you can, whether there bee not ſpeciall order for the preſenting of all thoſe vicious and diſordered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of the kindes you mention: you could not chooſe but knowe this, having ſeene the Articles: and therefore doe belie them againſt your <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And ſo I leave you and this point of the Churches diſcipline: which if it bee not changed is no fault of yours, who have endeavored nothing more then to introduce a totall alteration of it.</p>
            <p>The third generall <hi>Innovation</hi> which you make complaint of, is in the worſhip of God, which (as you tell us) they goe about to turne inſide outward, placing the true worſhip which is in Spirit and truth, in a <hi>Will worſhip</hi> of mans deviſing. p. 128. Particularly, in bowing to the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> to the <hi>Communion table or rather Altar, praying with their faces towards the Eaſt, ſtanding at the reading of the Goſpell. As alſo reading their ſecond ſervice at the Altar,</hi> and the like. p. 129. You tell us alſo of their teaching, practiſing, and preaching new formes of worſhip, <hi>ſecundum uſum Sarum,</hi> and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them up againe in Churches, as <hi>Altar-worſhip, Ieſu-worſhip, Image-worſhip, Croſſe-worſhip,</hi> and the like: and make it a plaine evidence that they have
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:4205:82"/>
no feare of God in them. p. 15·
<q>As alſo, what an old heaving and ſhoving there is, to erect <hi>Altar-worſhip</hi> and <hi>Ieſu-worſhip,</hi> and other inventions of men; and that the end thereof is to ſet up <hi>Popery</hi> againe. p. 25.</q>
The like you tell us alſo, p. 32. and make thoſe rites you inſtance in, a degree to <hi>Popery.</hi>
               <q>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> ſay you, was not built in one day. And <hi>Rome</hi> being about to be rebuilt in this Land cannot be done all at once, but it muſt be by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; although the builders doe every day get ground, and the building goeth on a maine with incredible celority.</q>
Finally, that I preſſe you with no more particulars, you lay it home unto them, that all their actions tend to bring in the Maſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 105. And thus you marſhall the degrees.
<q>If, ſay you, our new refounders of <hi>Popery</hi> would ſet up the <hi>Maſſe-god</hi> in our Churches, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not effect it all at once. They muſt firſt downe with Tables, and up with <hi>Altars.</hi> For that cauſe all ſeates muſt downe at the end of the <hi>Chancell,</hi> that the <hi>Altar</hi> may ſtand cloſe to the wall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as their Oracle ſaith (Arch-Prelate of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the Margin) none muſt ſit above God Almightie. And if Miniſters be ſo ſtiffe as not to yeeld to this Innovation, at leaſt the table muſt be railed about that none touch it, as being more ſacred then Pulpit, Pewe, or Font. Then ſome Adoration as lowly bowing, muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to it. Then the ſecond ſervice, as dainties muſt be ſaid there, as being more holy then the Readers Pewe. What then? Surely a Prieſt is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:4205:83"/>
not farre off. But where is the ſacrifice? Stay a while, that ſervice comes at laſt, and all theſe are preparations to it, tending to uſher in the great God of the Hoſt, ſo ſoone as it is well baked, and the peoples ſtomacks fitted to digeſt ſo hard a bit.</q>
I have layed downe this place at large, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes a full diſcovery of your malicious thoughts and imaginations: as alſo of your full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to amate the people, and make them apt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſperate attempt, which you may put them to when occaſion ſerves. But theſe your wicked and uncharitable ſurmiſes will ſoone come to nought. For if it be made evident, that thoſe particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations wherewithall you charge them, are either falſely charged upon them, or no <hi>Innovations</hi>: then I preſume, that any charitable Reader, will finde that your ſurmiſes proceeded onely from <hi>envy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, malice, and all uncharitablenes,</hi> from which <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us good Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which you inſtance firſt in, is bowing to the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi>: and where finde you that? Who preſſeth you, or any els to bow unto the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> ſuppoſe it written on a wall, or where elſe you will? That, if it be an Innovation, is no mans but yours. The Church injoyneth us no ſuch matter. For bowing <hi>at the name</hi> of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> thats no <hi>Innovation,</hi> made by the Prelates of theſe times: but injoyned in the Canon of the yeare 1603, and there no otherwiſe enjoyned then it was before. For ſo the Canon hath appointed,<note place="margin">Can. 18.</note> that <hi>when in the time of divine ſervice the Lord Ieſus ſhall be mentioned,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:4205:83"/>
due and lowly reverence ſhall be done by all perſons preſent, as it hath beene accustomed.</hi> Can. 8. No <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation</hi> then good Sr. if ſo long ſince ordained by <hi>Canon</hi>; and an old cuſtome too before it. A <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> certainely as old as the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
               <q>For it is ſaid expreſſely in the <hi>Queenes Injunctions,</hi> that whenſoever the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> ſhall be in any Leſſon, Sermon, or otherwiſe in the Church pronounced, that due reverence be made of all perſons young and old, with lowneſſe of curteſie, and uncovering of heads of the men-kinde, as thereunto doth neceſſarily belong, and hath beene <hi>accuſtomed.</hi>
               </q>
It's almoſt foureſcore yeares agoe, ſince that <hi>Injunction</hi>; yet then it was an antient <hi>cuſtome:</hi> and more then <hi>custome</hi> too, conceived a neceſſary duty. I could informe you what is ſaid by B. <hi>Iewell</hi> in this point, did I conceiv't fit, to adde unto the publike order of the Church, the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a private though a learned man. Yet if you pleaſe to looke, you ſhall ſee his judgment, in his reply to <hi>Harding.</hi> Art. 8. Sect. 1. So that you ſee, that <hi>Ieſu-worſhip,</hi> as you call it, is no <hi>Innovation</hi>: or if it be, it is as old at leaſt in the Church of <hi>England</hi> at the <hi>reformation.</hi> Higher we neede not goe for your ſatisfaction, in this or any other of theſe <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> by you objected: ſuch men as you are not regarding what hath beene done in the moſt pure &amp; perfect times of the Chrſtian Church; but what was here obſerved and practiſed ſince the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as before was ſaid. Otherwiſe we could give you ſufficient evidence of this and all the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:4205:84"/>
uſages, by you termed <hi>Innovations,</hi> in the Church of Chriſt, out of the Fathers, Councells, &amp; other uncorrupted Monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of true antiquity.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond inſtance is of bowing to the Communion table, or <hi>Altar rather,</hi> as you pleaſe to correct your ſelfe: and praying with the face towards the <hi>East.</hi> Here you have <hi>to it,</hi> as before; but ther's no ſuch thing done, as <hi>to it. Towards</hi> it if you will, not <hi>to it,</hi> When you ſay Grace before the table, or ſaid your prayers in the laſt conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle you were at, at the bords end: I hope you prayed not <hi>to the</hi> table, nor ſaid Grace to it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe they bow <hi>to the</hi> Altar, or Communion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, call it which you pleaſe, which bow towards it. It was an antient cuſtome in the primitive times, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> notes in his <hi>Apologeticke, ad orientis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gronem precari,</hi> to turne themſelves unto the Eaſt when they ſaid their prayers; and hath continued ſo till this very time: moſt of our Churches, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome of late, being built accordingly. The Fathers tell you of it more then once or twice: but what care you or ſuch as you for the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Had <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaid as <hi>much,</hi> or <hi>Beza,</hi> then it had beene ſomewhat. The Fathers had their ſpots or <hi>naevi,</hi> and he that readeth them muſt <hi>margaritas e coeno legere,</hi> as you told us lately. Well Sir, upon this generall cuſtome of praying towards the Eaſt came in that <hi>adoratio verſus Altare,</hi> you complaine of, though not <hi>Altaris,</hi> as you charge it. When men firſt entred into the houſe of God, they uſed ſome lowly reverence to expreſſe or intimate that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:4205:84"/>
the place they ſtoode upon was holy ground: and becauſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diduſe to pray with their faces towards the Eaſt where the <hi>Altar</hi> ſtoode, they made their re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verence that way alſo. Why ſhould that offend you? Old people uſe it ſtill, both men and women; though now it be interpreted as a curteſie made unto the Miniſter. If bowing towards the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion table or before it be offenſive to you, at the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacrament: I would faine know upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what reaſons, or why you ſtomack it, that men ſhould uſe their greateſt reverence in ſo great an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? Thinke it you fit, the Prieſt ſhould take into his hands the holy myſteries, without lowly reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or that it is an <hi>Innovation</hi> ſo to doe? Then go to ſchoole to B. <hi>Iewell,</hi> and let him teach you. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> makes mention of ſome geſtures, which at that time the people uſed: as viz. ſtanding up at the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and at the preface of the Maſſe, bowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves downe &amp; adoring at the Sacrament; kneeling at other times, as when mercy &amp; p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On then good Sir, to the reſt that follow, and firſt of <hi>ſtanding</hi> up at the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and reading the <hi>ſecond ſervice</hi> at the <hi>Altar</hi>: what are they <hi>Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> alſo? For ſtanding up at the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned expreſſely in the firſt Liturgy of K. <hi>Edward</hi> 6. and practiſed alſo, though not preſcribed, under that now in uſe amongſt us. Bp. <hi>Iewell,</hi> as you ſee allowes it, with whom you are not worthy to be named in the ſame day. And for the practiſe of it, take this of <hi>Hooker.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <q>Becauſe the Goſpells which are weekely reade, doe all hiſtorically declare ſomething, which our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> himſelfe either ſpake, did, or ſuffered in his owne perſon, it hath beene the cuſtome of Chriſtian men, then eſpecially, in token of the greater reverence to <hi>ſtand,</hi> to utter certaine words of acclamation, and <hi>at the name of Ieſus to bow.</hi>
               </q>
Which harme'eſſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as he tells us, there was not any man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to uſe; nor was it neceſſary: all ſorts of people uſing them without conſtraint, till you and your forefather <hi>Cartwright</hi> made a ſcruple of it. The firſt originall hereof is by antiquity referred to Pope <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> who lived in the 5. Centurie: therefore no <hi>Innovation</hi> ſurely. As little <hi>Innovation</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:4205:85"/>
is there, in reading the ſecond ſervice at the <hi>Altar</hi> or Communion table. The <hi>Rubricke</hi> of the Church appointeth, that it ſhall be ſo. Compare the laſt <hi>Rubricke</hi> before the Comunion, with the firſt after it: and you will ſooner finde your ſelfe an <hi>Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> in ſo ſaying, then any of the Biſhops in ſo doing. Nor was it onely ſo appointed, and not done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
<q>For learned <hi>Hooker</hi> tells us in the place laſt cited, that ſome parts of the divine ſervice of the Church are ſuch, that being they ſerve to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular good purpoſe, even when there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion adminiſtred; nevertheleſſe, being deviſed at the firſt for that purpoſe, are at the table of the Lord for that cauſe alſo commonly reade?</q>
No <hi>Innovation</hi> hitherto <hi>Maſ. Burton,</hi> but what comes after. You make a noiſe of <hi>Image-worſhip and Croſſe-worſhip</hi>; I know no ſuch matter: no ſuch enjoyned, that I am ſure of, nor no ſuch practiſed that I can heareof. If any ſuch thing be, tell me who, and when, or I ſhall take you alwayes for a very falſe brother, that make no conſcience what you ſay, or whom you ſlander. I hope you doe not meane by <hi>Croſſe-worſhip,</hi> the ſigning young children when they are baptized with the <hi>ſigne of the Croſſe</hi>: or if you doe, I trow you cannot take it for an <hi>Innovation.</hi> Nor neede you feare Idolatry in that Chriſtian u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, as ſome clamoured once. The 30.

For ſpeaking of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node in <hi>London</hi> An. 1603. and of the <hi>Canons</hi> then agreed on, he ſaith as followeth. <hi>Crucis ceremonia in Baptiſmate retinetur, et explicatur, ſed ita et tot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitis cautionibus, ut ſacroſancti ſigni reverentia om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis aboleri potius, quaem confirmari videatur.</hi> No <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations</hi> all this while, but ſuch as you have falſly charged upon the Biſhops, of <hi>Image-worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Croſſe-worſhip:</hi> and therefore all your feares of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the <hi>Maſſe-God,</hi> as you call it, are all come to nought.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have found no novelty, nothing that tends to Innovation in the worſhip of God: but a reviver and continuance onely of the antient uſages which have beene practiſed in this Church ſince the reformation, and were commended to it from the pureſt ages.
<q>And here we would have left this charge, but that you tell us p. 158. that all thoſe rites and ceremonies which are to be uſed in our Church are by an Act of Parliament pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to the Communion booke reſtrained to thoſe only which are expreſſed in the ſame booke.</q>
Either you are a very unlucky Lawyer, or a very bad Church-man. For tell me I beſeech you, where doe you finde in all that ſtatute, that there ſhall be <hi>no other rites and ceremonies uſed in the Church then are expreſſed in the booke of Common prayer?</hi> That all thoſe ceremonies which are expreſſed in the ſaid booke ſhall be obſerved; the ſtatute doth
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:4205:86"/>
indeede informe you: but that none other ſhall be added, that you finde not there. The contrary you may finde there, if you pleaſe to looke.<note place="margin">Statute 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 2.</note>
               <q>For it is ſaid expreſſely that the <hi>Queenes</hi> Majeſty may by the adviſe of her Commiſſioners Eccleſiaſticall or Metropolitane ordaine and publiſh ſuch further ceremonies or rites as may be moſt for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Gods glorie, the edifying of his Church, and the due reverence of Chriſts holy myſteries and Sacraments.</q>
This you reſtraine unto the perſon of the <hi>Queene</hi> affirming p. 66. that <hi>it is not to be extended to her ſucceſſours in the Crowne.</hi> How truely this is ſaid, hath beene ſhowne elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. And were it ſo in point of Law, yet a good <hi>Church man</hi> as you are could not chooſe but know, that in the <hi>Articles</hi> of the Church it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and agreed on, that <hi>the Church hath power to decree Rites or ceremonies.</hi>
               <q>Art. 20. and more then ſo, that every particular or nationall Church, hath authoritie to ordaine, change, and aboliſh ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or Rites of the Church ordained onely by mans authority, ſo that all things be done to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying. Art. 34.</q>
Theſe Articles you have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to more then once or twice, and therefore cannot chooſe but know, that <hi>other ceremonies may be uſed in the Church,</hi> then thoſe which are <hi>expreſſed in the Common prayer booke.</hi> Nor were theſe Articles confirmed onely in the Convocation, the power and authority of the which you regard but little: but were confirmed, and ſubſcription to the ſame exacted by Act of Parliament, as your unlearned
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4205:87"/>
Counſaile can at large informe you. Its true, ſome ſuch as you have quarrel'd with the 20. Article, as if that clauſe of giving <hi>power unto the Church, to decree rites or ceremonies, and authority</hi> in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of faith, were not coequall with the Article, but thruſt in of late: and for that cauſe, by ſome undue and ſiniſter practiſe, the booke of Articles was lately printed in the Latine tongue, and that clauſe left out. But in the antient Copies publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the yeare 1563. the Article is intire and whole, according as it is in all thoſe bookes of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> to which you ſeverally ſubſcribed. Nor ſaith that <hi>Article</hi> any more, as to the matter of ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ceremonies, then what is afterwards affirmed in the 34. Article, as before was ſaid: nor more then what hath poſitively beene affirmed by <hi>your</hi> owne <hi>Divines,</hi> as you pleaſe to ſtile them. <hi>Calvin</hi> whoſe judgment in this point you neither may nor can decline, hath ſaid as much upon theſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Non poteſt haberi, quod Paulus hic exigit niſi ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditis conſtitutionibus tanquam vinculis quibuſdam, ordo ipſe et decorum ſervetur.</hi> That which St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires, cannot be done, ſaith he without rules and Canons, by which as by ſome certaine bondes, both <hi>order</hi> and <hi>decorum</hi> may be kept together. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raus</hi> yet more plainely, and unto the purpoſe; <hi>Facit eccleſiae poteſtatem de decoro et ordine eccleſiaſtico libere diſponendi, et leges ferendi.</hi> So that you ſee the Church hath power to decree rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in things that appertaine to order, decency,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:4205:87"/>
and uniformity in Gods publicke ſervice: and which is more, a power of making lawes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons to inforce conformity unto the ſame, in the opinion of your owne Doctors. And if it pleaſe his Majeſty with the advice of his Commiſſioners or <hi>Metropolitane,</hi> to ordaine new ceremonies, or if the Church thinke fit to adde further rites, to thoſe which are received already: I know no remedy ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law or conſcience, but that you muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto them. Which ſaid we will proceede to thoſe other Innovations, which you have falſly charged upon the Prelates.</p>
            <p>The fourth change is, you tell us, in the civill government, which they labour to reduce and transferre to eccleſiaſticall, while they ſeeke to trample on the lawes of the land, and ſtep between the King and his people, (the Prelates power over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaying the ſubjects right) in the free uſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Lawes, pag. 129. You make the like out-cry to my LL. the Iudges, ſaying.
<q>Doe not your wiſdomes ſee a new generation of <hi>Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> riſen up in this Land,<note place="margin">Art. 3. s 26</note> who uſurping and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing a <hi>Papall</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> power and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, exempted from the Kings Lawes &amp;c. doe thereby begin to overtop the Royall throne, and trample the Lawes, liberties and juſt rights of the Kings Subjects under their feete. p. 29.</q>
               <hi>Quid dignum tanto?</hi> What is the ground of all this noiſe. Nought els it ſeemes, but that the high Commiſſioners thinke that Court of too high a nature, to be affronted by ſuch fellowes as your
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:4205:88"/>
Learned Counſailes, of which you tell us. p. 129. and that my LL. the Iudges, out of their honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable love to Iuſtice, are not ſo eaſily moved to ſend their writs of prohibition to that Court, as ſome of their Predeceſſours were before them. And is there not good reaſon thinke you?
<q>For if (as <hi>Dr.</hi>

And you may alſo know, if you pleaſe to know it, how that it was affirmed once by K. <hi>Iames</hi> of bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, in his ſpeech at <hi>Whitehall</hi> before both houſes of Parliament An. 1609. <hi>That the high Commiſsion was of ſo high a nature, that from thence there was no appellation to any other Court.</hi> Both Courts being thus ſupreme in their ſeverall kindes, and neither of them being to <hi>be abridged, reſtrained and controuled by the other,</hi> as long as the Iudges in the high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion keepe themſelves (within their bounds) to cauſes of eccleſiaſticall cognizance: what reaſon have you of complaint, in caſe you cannot get a <hi>Prohibition,</hi> as before you did. Moſt likely that my LL. the <hi>Iudges</hi> are growne more difficult in that kinde, as for diverſe other reaſons, ſo moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially becauſe they ſee the Iudges in that other
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:4205:88"/>
Court ſo carful, as not to meddle in any thing which may entrench upon the Courts of common Law or the ſubjects liberty.</p>
            <p>Call you me this an <hi>overtopping of the Royall throne, a trampling of the Lawes, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and juſt rights of his Majesties ſubjects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their feete?</hi> Cannot ſo inſolent a wretch as you be denied a <hi>Prohibition</hi> from the Courts of Law, or may not Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> be threatned for his ſawey and irreverent carriage by the <hi>high Commiſsion</hi>: but preſently you muſt raiſe an outcry, <hi>ac ſi Anniball ad portas,</hi> as if the libertie of the ſubjects was indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered <hi>in the free uſe and benefit of the Lawes,</hi> as you pleaſe to phraſe it? yet this amongſt the reſt you have made a cauſe of your ſeditious libelling againſt Church and State; as if the one were like to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure the other; and all were in a way to ruine, but for ſuch Zelots as your ſelfe, the carefull watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the times. But good Sir be aſſured there is no ſuch danger. For as the <hi>reducing of the civill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſo eccleſiaſticall,</hi> which you ſo much feare, there muſt be other meanes to doe it, then by a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of obtaining <hi>Prohibitions</hi> from the <hi>Common Law.</hi> And it is never more likely to be effected, then when your ſelfe ſit chiefe in your longed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>Conſiſtory,</hi> with your <hi>Lay-elders</hi> round about you.</p>
            <p>Then Kings and <hi>Queenes</hi> and whatſoever is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God, muſt caſt themſelves before your foote-ſtoole, as you your ſelves have told us in your publicke writings: And as for buſineſſe, the

fifth of <hi>November,</hi> and laſtly that for the faſt, ſet forth by his Majeſties appointment, An. 1636. And firſt, you ſay, in the <hi>Communion booke ſet forth by Parliament, and commanded to be read without any alteration, and none other,</hi> they have altered ſundrie things p. 130. Ho there. Who told you that the <hi>Common-prayer-booke</hi> was ſet forth by <hi>Parliament?</hi> Thinke you the Knights and Burgeſſes of the houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> were buſied in thoſe times, in making or in mending Prayer-bookes? The Statute 2. &amp; 3. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. c. 1. will tell you that the Common prayer booke was <hi>ſet forth</hi> (in that very word) by the <hi>Archbp. of Cant.</hi> and certaine of the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and diſcreete Biſhops, and other learned men of this <hi>Realme</hi>: and being ſo <hi>ſet forth,</hi> was by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Parliament</hi> confirmed and ratified, as it related to the Subject. Which courſe was after ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in the <hi>review</hi> of the ſaid booke, both in the fift and ſixt of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, and in the firſt of Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Being <hi>ſet forth</hi> then by the Clergie, it was, as you informe us, <hi>commanded to be read without any alteration</hi>: that was indeed done by authority of <hi>Parliament.</hi> Doe you obſerve that ordinance, do not you alter it, and chop and change it every day; at leſt if you vouchſafe to reade it, as perhaps you doe not. And if it muſt be read with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any alteration, and none other; why doe you quarrell at the reading of the ſecond Service at the Communion Table before and after Sermon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there ſo ordered? or uſe another forme of prayer then is there appointed? Remember what
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:4205:90"/>
you tell us here, for you and I muſt talke about it in the next generall change. Meane time what are the ſundry things which you ſay are altered in the booke <hi>ſet forth</hi> by Parliament. You tell us but of two, and you talke of ſundry. How ſhall I credit you hereafter, if you palter thus in the beginning. But for thoſe two, what are they I beſeech you?
<q>Marry you ſay, that in the Collect for the Queene and the Royall Progenie, they have put out <hi>Father of thine elect and of their ſeede,</hi> as it were, excluding the King, Queene, and Seede Royall, out of the number of Gods elect, <hi>p.</hi> 130.</q>
This you have told us of in your Epiſtle to the King, and in your Apologie, and the <hi>Newes from Ipſwich.</hi> The Queene is more beholding to you, then I thought ſhee had beene; you take ſuch ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care for her <hi>Election.</hi> But Sir, a word before we part. Who told you that this Collect was <hi>ſet forth</hi> with the booke allowed by Parliament? I trow King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, and Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had no royall progenie: ſo that this Collect could not bee then in <hi>Eſſe</hi> when the booke was made.</p>
            <p>The firſt time it was made and uſed, was at the happie entrance of King <hi>Iames</hi> on this Realme of <hi>England</hi>; neither ſet forth nor ratified by any Parliament that hath beene ſince. Now King <hi>Iames</hi> had at his firſt comming hither, <hi>a royall ſeede</hi>; but when his Majeſtie the King, came unto the crowne, he was then unmarried; and after he was married, had not children preſently you know well enough. Would you have had the collect
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:4205:91"/>
paſſe as it did before; <hi>Father of thine elect and of their ſeed,</hi> when as the king, whom you muſt needs meane by <hi>Elect</hi> in that place and prayer, had no ſeede at all? I hope you ſee your folly now, your moſt zealous folly; which made you in the Newes from <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> on the recitall of this ſuppoſed alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to crye out, <hi>O intollerable impietie, affront, and horred treaſon</hi>; Moſt bravely clamoured. The other alteration which you charge them with, is, that in all the common prayer bookes printed ſince the yeare 1619. in the Epiſtle for the Sunday be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Eaſter, they have turned <hi>in the Name of Ieſus,</hi> to <hi>at the name of Ieſus</hi>: to countenance, as you ſay, their forced bowing to the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi>; (you are ſtill for <hi>to it.</hi>) Such change there is indeede, but yet no alteration from the booke or text; The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Bible, as they call it, out of the which the Epiſtles and Goſpells were firſt taken readeth <hi>at the name</hi>: and ſo doth Biſhop <hi>Iewell</hi> too, citing this very text in the place and paſſage noted to you in the laſt Chapter. And if you looke into the Bible of the laſt tranſlation, you finde that it is therein alſo, <hi>at the name of Ieſus</hi>: ſo that you have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to repine at this, which is a reſtitution one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the proper reading, and no change at all.</p>
            <p>The ſecond booke which they have altered, as you ſay, is that appointed to bee read on the fifth day of <hi>November, publiſhed</hi> by authority of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, <hi>p.</hi> 131. <hi>ſet forth by act of Parliament, p.</hi> 41. in the Margent <hi>ordered</hi> by Parliament, in the ſecond
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:4205:91"/>
               <hi>p.</hi> of your apologie, <hi>ordered, ſet forth</hi> and <hi>publiſhed,</hi> all by <hi>Parliament,</hi> and yet the <hi>Parliament</hi> did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it. All that was done by <hi>Parliament</hi> was that the day of that deliverance was appointed for a kinde of holy day, wherein the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ople were to meete together to ſet forth Gods glory: and it was there enacted alſo, that upon every ſuch day, that very ſtatute <hi>of the inſtitution,</hi> ſhould be read publickly to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Of any forme of prayer, ſet forth, or afterwards to be ſet forth, <hi>ne gry,</hi> I am ſure, in all that ſtatute. The booke was after made and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Kings authority without the trouble of a <hi>Parliament.</hi> However being ſet out, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, though not by <hi>Parlament,</hi> you cannot but be grieved at the <hi>alterations.</hi> Well what are they. Firſt you complaine, that whereas in the former booke there was this paſſage, <hi>Roote out that Babiloniſh and Antichriſtian ſect which ſay of Hieruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> in the Edition <hi>A.</hi> 1635. it is ſet downe thus, <hi>Roote out that Babiloniſh and antichriſtian Sect of them which ſay of Hieruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> Here's <hi>of them</hi> added more then was. And this you thinke doth make a great and fearefull difference.
<q>For whereas in the Originall it was plainely meant, that all <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> Seminary Prieſts and their confederates are that <hi>Babiloniſh</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> ſect, which ſay of <hi>Hieruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> this latter booke either reſtraines it to ſome few that are of that mind, or elſe mentally tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres it on thoſe <hi>Puritans</hi> that cry downe with <hi>Babilon,</hi> that is, <hi>Poperie,</hi> which theſe men call
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:4205:92"/>
                  <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and the true Catholick Religion, <hi>p.</hi> 130, 131.</q>
It ſeemes you have a guilty conſcience, you would not ſtart ſo much at this elſe. <hi>Quid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt non habere conſcium, habenti conſcientiam,</hi> ſayd the Father rightly. <hi>That Babyloniſh Sect which ſay,</hi> and <hi>that Babyloniſh Sect of them which ſay</hi> make's ſo little difference: that were you not guilty to your ſelfe, of many ill wiſhes againſt <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> you would not have ſo ſtomacked at the alteration. And being that it is confeſſed by you, their Oracle, that the <hi>Puritans</hi> doe cry downe with our <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> by them called <hi>Poperie</hi>: they come within the compaſſe of the prayer, take which forme you liſt, either that <hi>Babiloniſh Sect,</hi> or <hi>that Babiloniſh Sect of them.</hi> Nor is it ſtrange that ſo it ſhould bee. For howſoever the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> Prieſts and their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates were at firſt intended: yet if the <hi>Puritans</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them in their deſignes of blowing up the Church and State, and bringing all into a lawleſſe and licentious <hi>Anarchie</hi>; the prayer will reach them too, there's no queſtion of it. The Statute, 1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 2. <hi>Confirmatorie</hi> of the Common prayer booke, hath ordained ſeverall penalties for ſuch as ſhall deprave the ſaid booke of Common prayer, or obſtinately refuſe to uſe it, or uſe any other forme of prayer then that there appointed: as alſo a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mulct of 12<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>toties quoties</hi> upon every man that doth abſent himſelfe from Church on Sundaies and holy dayes. This was intended at the firſt againſt <hi>Recuſants</hi> there being then no Puritans in <hi>rerum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura.</hi> And may not therefore all the penalties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:4205:92"/>
contained, be juſtly laid upon the <hi>Puritans,</hi> if they offend in any of the kinds before remembred? The like may alſo be affirmed of the <hi>High Commiſsion,</hi> eſtabliſhed hereby at the firſt, for the correction and reduction of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> being then the onely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite partie to the Church: and yet you know, the <hi>High Commiſsioners</hi> may take a <hi>Puritan</hi> to taske, if they finde him faulty.</p>
            <p>That which you next complaine of, is that whereas in the old booke, the prayer went thus, <hi>Cut off theſe workers of iniquity, whoſe Religion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, whoſe faith is faction:</hi> it is now altered into this, <hi>who turne Religion into rebellion, and Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to faction.</hi>
               <q>Hereupon you inferre, that theſe <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators</hi> would not have the <hi>Popiſh Religion</hi> to bee termed <hi>rebellion,</hi> and their <hi>Faith faction,</hi> as the antient Copie plainely ſhewes it to be: but turne it off from the <hi>Religion</hi> to ſome perſons, which turne Religion into rebellion, and Faith into faction, ſo as by this turning they plainely imply, that the Religion of <hi>Papiſts</hi> is the true Religion, and no rebellion, &amp; their Faith the true faith, &amp; no faction, <hi>p.</hi> 131.</q>
You make another uſe of it in your Apologie, and tell us that it tendeth to <hi>juſtifie and extenuate notorious treaſons &amp; traytors, and to uſher in Poperie, Superſtition and Idolatry, p.</hi> 3.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:4205:93"/>
rebellion,</hi> or the <hi>Faith</hi> therein profeſſed, <hi>faction:</hi> muſt it needs follow thereupon, that by ſo doing they imply, that that religion is the true religion, and that faith the true faith. There's a <hi>non ſequitur</hi> with a witneſſe. There is a kinde of religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Turkes.</hi> Becauſe I cannot ſay that their <hi>religion is rebellion</hi>; doe I imply ſo plainely (as you ſay they doe) that therefore their <hi>religion is the true religion.</hi> And there's a <hi>faith</hi> too queſtionleſſe among the ſeverall Sects of Chriſtians in the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne, Muſcovite,</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Churches. Becauſe I thinke not fit to ſay of any of them, that their <hi>faith is faction</hi> muſt I conclude aſtringently, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the faith profeſt by each particular Sect, is the true faith. You might well tax me ſhould I ſay the one; and I may laugh at you for concluding the other. <hi>Adeo argumenta ex falſo petita, inepto habent exitus,</hi> as <hi>Lactantius</hi> hath it. Your uſe is yet more ſcandalous, then your inference falſe. For how doth this tend to juſtifie and extenuate <hi>notorious treaſons</hi> and <hi>Traytors.</hi> The treaſons and the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſtand as before they did, unleſſe the ſtaine be laid more deepe upon them then before it was. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the imputation ſeemed to reſt on the faith it ſelfe: which being a generall accuſation concerned no more the guilty, then it did the innocent. But here it reſteth where it ought, upon the perſons of the <hi>Traytors,</hi> who are not hereby juſtified, or their crime extenuated: but they themſelves condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the treaſon aggravated in an higher man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. That which comes after of <hi>uſhering in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>

Superſtition and Idolatry, is but your ordinary flouriſh, one of your <hi>generall calumnies; and needes not a particular anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O but ſay you, and undertake to make it good, the very religion is rebellion, and the faith is facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and therefore there was ſomewhat in the chang which deſerved that cenſure. That their religion is rebellion, you prove two wayes.

                  <hi>Firſt</hi> becauſe the Ieſuites and Seminary prieſts refuſe to take the oath of Supremacie, which is injoyned to all Papiſts, <hi>3.</hi> Iac. c. <hi>4.</hi>
               </q>
You muſt needes ſhew your <hi>law,</hi> you have ſuch ſtore of it. For ſpeake man, was the <hi>oath of Supreamacie</hi> enacted 3. <hi>Iacobi.</hi> Then am I out againe, for my bookes tell me it was 1 <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabethae.</hi> In your Apologie you place the <hi>oath of alleigance</hi> 1. <hi>Elizabethae,</hi> and here to make your ignorance the more remarkeable, you place the <hi>oath of Supremacie</hi> 3. <hi>Iac. Cujus contrarium ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſt.</hi> The <hi>oath of alleigeance</hi> tis you meane. And ſure you will not ſay, all Seminarie Prieſts and Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papiſts refuſe the oath of alleigeance; conſidering that of each ſort, ſome have written very learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in defence thereof: therefore according to your way of diſputation, the religion of all <hi>Papiſts</hi> is not rebellion, and conſequently their faith not faction.
<q>The ſecond proofe you offer, is, that by Doctor <hi>Iohn White</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cracanthorp</hi> it is affirmed that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth diſloyaltie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt kings; that <hi>Popiſh</hi> Authors doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt the Popes power over kings; that ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> have ſayd that Chriſtian kings are dogges, which
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:4205:94"/>
muſt be ready at the Shepheards hand, or elſe the Shepheard muſt remove them from their office. <hi>p.</hi> 134.135.</q>
This argument is full as faulty as the other was; and will conclude as much againſt your ſelfe and the <hi>Puritan</hi> faction, as any Papiſt of them all. The Citizens of <hi>Geneva</hi> expelled their B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. as the <hi>Calvinians</hi> in <hi>Emden,</hi> did their Earle; being their immediate Lords and Princes. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Inſtit. l. 4. c. ult.</note> 
               <hi>Calvin</hi> hath taught us that the three eſtates <note n="(b)" place="margin">In Rom. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Paraeus</hi> that the inferiour Magiſtrate, &amp; <note n="(c)" place="margin">De Iure regui.</note> 
               <hi>Buchanan</hi> that the people may correct and controule the Prince; and in ſome caſes too depoſe him. And you Maſſ. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> have condemned that abſolute obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Kings and Princes which is due to them from their ſubjects; and that unlimited power which is aſcribed unto them, becauſe theirs of right. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may from hence conclude, or elſe your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is worth nothing, that out of doubt the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan religion is rebellion,</hi> and <hi>their faith faction.</hi> As for your generall challenge, p. 191. <hi>viz. What one Proteſtant can they bring that ever committed treaſon againſt his king, or lifted up an hand againſt his ſacred perſon:</hi> I leave it to the Papiſts to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to it, to whom your chalenge is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But I could tell you in your eare, (which I would to God were otherwiſe) of more than one or two twice told and twice told to that, <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> of that ſort which you moſt labour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and make to bee the onely right ones. Had you diſtinguiſhed as you ought, betweene the doctrines of that Church, and the particular either
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:4205:94"/>
words or actions of particular men: you had not made ſo raſh a venture, and loſt more by it than you got. So then the <hi>religion</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not being in it ſelfe <hi>rebellion,</hi> though ſomewhat which hath there beene taught may poſſibly have beene applyed to rebellious purpoſes; there is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle feare that their <hi>faith</hi> is <hi>faction</hi>: and ſo the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not ſo grievous as you faine would have it. What further reaſon there was in it you ſhall ſee anon.</p>
            <p>The third booke, altered as you ſay, is that ſet ſorth by the king for the publicke faſt, in the firſt yeare of his reigne: and which his Majeſtie by his proclamation commanded to be reprinted and publiſhed, and ſo reade in the Church every Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday. What finde you altered there? In the firſt Collect, as you tell us, is left out this remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pious ſentence intirely, <hi>viz.</hi> Thou haſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from ſuperſtition and idolatry, wherein we were utterly drowned, and haſt brought us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt cleere &amp; comfortable light of thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed word, &amp;c. And then you ad; <hi>Loe here theſe men would not have Popery called Superſtition and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, nor would they have the Word of God ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, as that cleare and comfortable light, which teacheth us all duties both to God and man.</hi> p. 142. This is the laſt of all theſe changes, which tend, as you informe us, to bring in <hi>Popery</hi>; and therefore I will tell you here, what I conceive to be the reaſon of thoſe alterations which you ſo complaine of. You cannot chuſe but know, (becauſe I think you have it in your Pamphlet againſt D <hi>Coſens</hi>) that in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:4205:95"/>
the <hi>Letanie</hi> of King <hi>Edward</hi> 6. there was this clauſe, <hi>viz. From the tyrannie of the Biſhop of Rome, and all his deteſtable enormities, from all falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine &amp;c. Good Lord deliver us.</hi> This was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be, as indeede it was, a very great ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall and offence to all thoſe in the Realme of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which were affected to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>: and therefore in the Liturgie of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it was quite left out. Had you beene then alive, you might perhaps have quarrelled it, and taxed thoſe learned men that did it, of <hi>Popery, Innovation,</hi> &amp; I know not what: and then conclude it that they would have the people think that there was neither <hi>tyrannie</hi> in the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor any deteſtable <hi>enormitie</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But as that then was done with a good intent, and no man quarrelled for it that I can heare of: why ſhould you thinke worſe of the changes now or quarrell that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which gave order for it, before you knew by whoſe authority it was ſo done, conceive you not that thoſe, who in this Kingdome, are affected to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; are not as apt to take offence now, as they were before; or that there is not now as much conſideration to bee had of thoſe which are that way affected, as was in any part of the ſaid Queenes time? the matter being of no greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than this is, how great ſoever you pretend it.</p>
            <p>Moſt of our faults before have beene of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion</hi>; but theſe that follow, moſt of them are <hi>omiſsion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> onely. Firſt you except againſt the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out of the whole prayer, It had beene beſt for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:4205:95"/>
us, &amp;c. And this was done with an <hi>Alas, becauſe therein was commended the profitable uſe of continuall preaching the Word of God,</hi> p. 142. The Newes from <hi>Ipſwich</hi> calls it, <hi>the moſt effectuall prayer of all, becauſe it magnifies continuall often preaching,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>call's our powerfull Preachers Gods ſervants.</hi> Say you me ſo? Then let us looke upon the Prayer, where I perſwade my ſelfe there is no ſuch matter. All that reflects that way is this.
<q>It had beene alſo well, if at thy dreadfull threates out of thy holy word, continually pronounced unto us by thy ſervants our Preachers, we had of feare; as corrigible ſervants, turned from our wickedneſſe.</q>
This all, and in all this where doe you finde one word that magnifies <hi>continuall preaching,</hi> or that takes any notice of your <hi>powerfull Preachers, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum pars ego magna,</hi> as you boaſt your ſelf. Cannot the dreadfull threats of Gods holy word, be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way pronounced, and pronounced <hi>continually</hi> by Gods ſervant, then by the way of <hi>Sermons</hi> only, or if by <hi>ſermons</hi> onely, by no other <hi>Preachers</hi> than thoſe whom you ſtile <hi>powerful preachers,</hi> by a name diſtinct? I trow the reading of Gods Word in the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, preſents unto the people more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full threats, then what you lay before them in a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and will ſinke as deepe: Therefore aſſuredly there was ſome other reaſon for it, then that you dreame of. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd thinke you that it might not be, (there being prayers enough without it) becauſe in the whole <hi>Tenor</hi> of it, it ſoundeth rather like a complaint or a narration, then a prayer? Two other
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:4205:96"/>
prayers you finde omitted, the one for the <hi>Navie,</hi> and the other for <hi>ſeaſonable weather:</hi> as if a forme of prayer fitted for a particular time and purpoſe, muſt be ſtill obſerved; when there is no ſuch cauſe to uſe it, as at firſt to make it. The <hi>Navie</hi> then went out againſt a great and puiſſant <hi>Monarch,</hi> to ſet upon him on his owne coaſts, many leagues from home: the honour and the fortune of the kingdome being layed at ſtake. Now it keepes onely on our owne coaſts, without an enemie to bid battaile or to cope withall: and rather is ſet forth to prevent a danger, then to remove it being come. The caſes being different, muſt we needes uſe the Prayers which were then ſet forth? What thinke you of this clauſe, <hi>Lord turne our enemies ſword into their owne boſome</hi>; Would that be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per at this time, when as his Majeſtie is at peace with all his neighbours? Had you not longed to picke a quarrell; I finde not any thing in this, that might provoke you: nor could you poſſibly have pitched on any thing, that had leſſe become you. For are not you the man that ſpake ſo much againſt long prayers, as wee ſhall ſee anon in your next generall head of <hi>Innovations</hi>; becauſe thereby the preacher is inforced to cut ſhort his ſermon? and doe you here complaine that the Prayers are ſhortned, that ſo you may have libertie to preach the longer? I ſee it were a very difficult thing to pleaſe you, ſhould a man endeavour it. That which comes next, is that the Prayer for the <hi>Lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth and her Children,</hi> is left out in the preſent faſt-booke,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:4205:96"/>
which were expreſſed in the former <hi>p.</hi> 143 and that as the <hi>Newes-booke</hi> ſaith, <hi>while they are now royally entertained at Court.</hi> My Lord the <hi>Prince Elector</hi> cannot but take this very ill, that you ſhould make his royall entertainement here a maske to cover your ſeditious and malevolent projects. For you know well enough, that not alone in this new <hi>faſt-booke,</hi> ſet forth ſince his arrivall here, but long before his comming hither, that excellent <hi>Lady</hi> and her children, had not by name, beene ſpecified in the <hi>Common prayer booke.</hi> Why did you not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that omiſſion there, as well as leaving out the <hi>Father of thine Elect?</hi> Or will you have a reaſon for it, why it was layed aſide in both; if you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to be ſatisfied by reaſon, I will give you one, and ſuch a one as may ſuffice any one but you. In the firſt <hi>faſt-booke,</hi> his Majeſty our Soveraigne Lord had not any children, to be remembred in our prayers: and the <hi>remainder</hi> of the <hi>royall ſeede,</hi> was in that moſt illuſtrious Lady and her Princely iſſue. That caſe now is altered. His Majeſty Gods name be praiſed hath many children, as well male, as female; none of the which are ſpecified by name, particularly, but the <hi>Prince</hi> alone: the reſt together with the Lady <hi>Elizabeth and her Princely iſſue,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all comprehended in the name of the <hi>Royall Progene.</hi> The Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her <hi>children,</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no more neglect in this, then the Kings owne moſt <hi>Royall iſſue,</hi> will give you little thankes for ſo vaine a cavill.</p>
            <p>More anger yet. You charge the Biſhops next,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:4205:97"/>
that they cry up with <hi>fasting,</hi> and downe with <hi>preaching.</hi> For crying up faſting, you produce this inſtance, that in the <hi>order for the Eaſt, theſe words are left out of the new booke, viz.</hi>

<q>The <hi>Order</hi> then is this, <hi>Num.</hi> 6. <hi>Admonition</hi> is here laſtly to be given, that on the faſting day there be but one Sermon at morning Prayer, and the ſame not above an houre long, and but one at evening Prayer of the ſame length, to avoid the inconvenience that may grow by the abuſe of Faſting: ſome eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it a meritorious worke: others a good worke, and of it ſelfe acceptable to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due regard of the end: others preſuming fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiouſly to enter into publicke faſts without the conſent of authority, and others keeping the people together with over much wearineſſe, and tediouſneſſe, a whole day together: which in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:4205:97"/>
this time of contagion is very dangerous, in ſo thicke and cloſe aſſemblies of the multitudes.</q>
This is the place at large, ſo pricked and commade, as I finde it in the ſaid old booke. Deale honeſtly, if you can in any thing, in this. Theſe words, <hi>To avoide the inconvenience which may grow by the abuſe of faſting</hi>; Are they the beginning of a new period, as you lay them downe? or what doe they relate unto, unto the merit of a faſt? No Sir, but to the former words touching the number and the length of Sermons, wherin, ſome men (your ſelfe for one) had placed ſo much ſanctity; that publicke faſts ſo ſolemnized were by ſome thought (no doubt) me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious workes; by others many times kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due authority: by others ſo ſpunne out with Sermons of foure houres a peece, that with much wearineſſe and tediouſneſſe it tooke up the day; no care at all being taken to avoid contagion, which in ſuch cloſe and thicke aſſemblies is exceeding dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. This is the plaine <hi>Analyſis</hi> of that paſſage, in the ſaid firſt booke. Aſſuredly, what ever other cauſe there was, there is no reaſon to ſuſpect that it related anything to the point of <hi>merit.</hi> Theſe times are ſo fallen out with <hi>faſting.</hi> (Vnleſſe it be a <hi>Faſt</hi> of their owne appointment) that you have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cauſe to feare leſt any man ſhould place a part of <hi>merit</hi> in it. <hi>Non celebranda eſſe jejunia Statuta.</hi> To cry downe all ſet times of <hi>faſting,</hi> which was the hereſie of <hi>Aerius</hi> in the former times, is reckoned a chief point of <hi>orthodox</hi> doctrin, in the preſent times. No <hi>merit</hi> placed in <hi>faſts,</hi> ordinary or extraordinary,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:4205:98"/>
that I can heare of, unleſſe perhaps you place ſome <hi>merit</hi> in your <hi>long Sermons</hi> on thoſe <hi>faſts,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſaide, And dare you then affirme as in the <hi>newes-booke,</hi> that this place and paſſage, was <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely left out to gratifie the Papiſts, or to place any popiſh merit in the preſent faſt?</hi> if any body may be ſaid to be gratified in it, it is you and yours, whoſe abſurd courſe and carriage had in the former book been deſcribed ſo lively. But you are ſtill the ſame. <hi>Primus ad extremum ſimilis ſibi.</hi> You and the <hi>Black Moores</hi> skinne will waſh white together. This is, I hope enough to ſatisfie you, touching the crying up of <hi>faſting</hi>: and for the crying downe of <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> on the dayes of faſt, that hath beene ſpoken of already. How far it is ſuppreſſed at all other times, you meane to tell us in the next of your generall heades; and we expect to heare what you have to ſay.</p>
            <p>On then. Your ſixt generall <hi>innovation</hi> is in the <hi>meanes</hi> of <hi>ſalvation,</hi> in which there are particulars very many which you charge them with.
<q>As <hi>viz.</hi> in ſuppreſſing lectures, cutting ſhort preaching, forbidding any prayer before the Sermon but that barren forme of words in the <hi>Canon</hi>; uſing no prayer at all after the Sermon, but reading a ſecond or third ſervice at the <hi>Altar.</hi> Having no ſermon in the afternoone; catechizing onely for halfe an houre, and that by queſtion and anſwer onely; and finally limiting all Sermons in great Cities and the univerſities to one houre, ſo as the people cannot enjoy the benefit of more then one
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:4205:98"/>
Sermon a day, <hi>p.</hi> 150.</q>
Theſe are the ſeveralties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that generall head; and they relate either to <hi>preaching</hi> or to <hi>praying</hi>; or indeed altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>preaching,</hi> and unto <hi>praying</hi> no further then as ſubſervient thereunto. Firſt for ſuppreſſing <hi>Lectures,</hi> why doe you reckon that for an <hi>innovation,</hi> when as the very name of <hi>Lecturers,</hi> and <hi>Lectures,</hi> are in themſelves a new and late invention? borrowed by <hi>Travers</hi> and the reſt towards the latter end of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, from the new faſhions of <hi>Geneva.</hi> We in the Church of <hi>England</hi> know no other names, but <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Curats</hi>; and <hi>Curats</hi> are againe divided into <hi>Parſons</hi> &amp; <hi>Vicars,</hi> and thoſe which doe officiate for and under them, now in the uſe of ſpeech called <hi>Curats</hi> as by a proper and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct name. Your <hi>Lecturer</hi> hath no place in the prayers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the termes of <hi>Law.</hi> But being <hi>Geneva</hi> had it ſo; a <hi>Doctor</hi> ſuperadded to the ordinary <hi>Paſtor,</hi> whoſe office onely was to teach, not to adminiſter the ſacraments or execute any other miniſtry to the <hi>Prieſt</hi> belonging: it muſt needes bee diſpoſed ſo here, that by degrees, inſenſibly wee might be brought more neere that Church. There is a ſtory of the <hi>Bats</hi> or <hi>Reremice,</hi> that when the birds came to demand tribute of them, ſhewing them their breſts they ſaid they were beaſts: and when the beaſts came to them and craved the like, ſhewing them their wings, they ſaid they were birds.

Now for theſe Lecturers, we may diſtinguiſh them into <hi>Weekes-day Lecturers,</hi> and <hi>Lords-day Lecturers,</hi>
               <q>As <hi>Weeke-day Lecturers,</hi> you complaine how they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by that reſtriction in his Majeſties Proclamation about the faſt: and tell us, that the Prelates doe extend the letter of the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if but one houſe in a Pariſh be infected, the peſtilence thus continuing and the faſt not ceaſing, all wedneſday ſermons in the whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt be ſuppreſſed. <hi>p.</hi> 147,
If ſo, as ſo it is not, (you know well enough) what reaſon had you of complaint.</q>
Are there not holidayes ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that you and yours doe reckon them as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, both to Church and State? Obſerve the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dayes as you ought with prayers and Preaching: and ſee what loſſe the Church would have, or any of the people finde, for want of <hi>Wedneſday</hi> or any other <hi>weeke-day Lectures.</hi> As <hi>Lords-day Lecturers</hi> we ſhall meete them in the afternoone, wherein all ſermons are put downe, if you tell us true.</p>
            <p>Next followes cutting ſhort of Preaching. How comes that to paſſe? For that we muſt needes ſeeke
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:4205:99"/>
elſewhere, for here you tell us not. Looke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in your 17. <hi>p.</hi> and there wee have it.
<q>There you find fault with them that are all for outward formalities (you being for none at all your ſelfe) in that they place all the ſervice of God in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>long-prayers,</hi> and thereby excluding prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching as unneceſſary: and <hi>p.</hi> 158. commanding of <hi>long Matins</hi> inſtead of Preaching; which as they are performed, in Cathedrall Churches, you call prophanely <hi>Long Babyloniſh ſervice, p.</hi> 160.</q>
This is the blocke you ſtumble at, that whereas formerly you uſed to mangle and cut ſhort the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that you might bring all piety and the whole worſhip of God, to your extemporary prayers and ſermons: now you are brought againe to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient uſage, of reading the whole prayers, as you ought to do. And call you this an innovation? Are not you he that told us that the <hi>Communion-booke ſet forth by Parliament, is commanded to be reade without any alteration, and none others, p.</hi> 130. And if you reade it not as it is commanded, make you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration thinke you? Doe you not finde it alſo in the 14. Canon, that.
<q>All Miniſters ſhall obſerve the Orders, rites, and ceremonies preſcribed in the Booke of Common-prayer, as well in reading the holy Scriptures, and ſaying of Prayers, as in adminiſtration of the Sacraments, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing in regard of preaching or any other reſpect, (how like you that Sir) or adding any thing to the matter or forme thereof.</q>
The very ſelfe ſame anſwer we muſt alſo make to another of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:4205:100"/>
your cavils, about the uſing of no prayer at all, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Sermon, but reading a ſecond or third ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at the <hi>Altar.</hi>
               <q>For being it is ſo appointed in the booke of Common Prayer, that <hi>on the holidaies</hi> if there be no Communion, ſhall be ſaid all that is appointed at the Communion, untill the end of the Homilie, concluding with the Praier for the whole ſtate of Chriſts Church, &amp;c.</q>
The innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is on your part, who have offended all this while, not onely againſt the Canon, but the Act of Parliament, by bringing in new formes of your owne deviſing. As for <hi>forbidding any prayer before the Sermon, but that barren forme of words in the Canon,</hi> (for being in the <hi>Canon</hi> you can give it no better <hi>Epithite</hi>;) if any ſuch forbidding be, its but agreeable unto the Canon, which hath determined of it long agoe: and ſo no innovation of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times. Nor was that Canon any new inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neither, when it firſt was made: but onely a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition and confirmation of what had formerly beene ordered both in King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, the Queenes injunctions according to the rule and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the former times; the Preachers then uſing no forme of prayers before their Sermons, but that of bidding, moving, or exhorting, which is now required in the Canon; as may be plainely ſeene in Biſhop <hi>Latimers</hi> Sermons, Biſhop <hi>Iewels,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Andrewes,</hi> and diverſe others. Your afternoone Sermons on the Sondaies, if performed by <hi>Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> are but a part of that new faſhion which before wee ſpake off: and having no foundation in the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:4205:100"/>
Church at all, it cannot be an <hi>Innovation</hi> to lay them by. And if the <hi>Curate</hi> of the place, or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath the Cure of Soules; beſtow his time in <hi>Catechizing,</hi> as he is appointed, that in effect is but to change one kinde of Preaching for another. So that if he that hath the <hi>Cure,</hi> doth carefully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his office, and performe his duty: you have no reaſon to complaine for want of having Sermons in the after noone. I know it is the cuſtome of you and yours, to take up Sermons more by tale then weight: and ſo you have your number, you thinke all is right. But as in feeding of the body, one tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate meale digeſted preſently and concocted throughly, adde's more unto the ſtrength of nature, then all that plentifull variety of delicates which gluttony hath yet invented: So doe they profit beſt in all heavenly wiſdome <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not who heare many Sermons, but which heare good ones. For limiting the <hi>Catechizing</hi> unto halfe an houre, that's ordered by the <hi>Canon</hi> alſo: and it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the <hi>Canon,</hi> that <hi>Children ſhall bee taught no other Catechiſme, then that ſet forth in the booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer.</hi> Not that the <hi>Curate,</hi> is to examine them by queſtion and anſwere onely, without expounding any of the principles of religion, which is that you quarrell: but to <hi>examine and inſtruct them,</hi> as the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> hath it. Yet ſo that under the pretence hereof, nor you nor any ſuch as you, may aſſume that libertie, as to turne ſimple <hi>Catechizing</hi> for the inſtruction of the youth and ignorant perſons of the Pariſh; into a <hi>Catechiſme Lecture</hi> of ſome two houres long, not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:4205:101"/>
from your mornings ſermons, but in name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. If in great Cities and the Viniverſities, Sermons are limited to the ſame time of the day, or as your owne phraſe is, to one houre onely; aſſuredly it is neither new, nor ſtrange. The Sermon appointed for the morning being a part of the ſecond ſervice, is to be read or ſpoken in all Churches, at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Church. Nothing in this <hi>de novo,</hi> that I can heare of. In <hi>Oxford</hi> it was alwayes ſo, ſince I firſt knew it; the Sermon for the Vniverſity and Towne being expreſſely at the ſame time. Nor neede you bee offended at it, if by that meanes the people in thoſe places cannot heare above one ſermon in a day: it being not many but good ſermons, not much but profitable hearing, which you ſhould labour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto them; but that you would bee ſome body for your often preaching. Our Saviour tels us of ſome men, that thought they <hi>ſhould bee heard by much ſpeaking</hi>; and you are one of them that teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that they ſhall be ſaved by much hearing.</p>
            <p>Your two laſt innovations I ſhall joyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the one being in the <hi>rule of Faith,</hi> which <hi>is now made,</hi> you ſay, <hi>to be the dictates of the Church, to wit, the Prelates,</hi> p. 151. the other in the <hi>rule of manners,</hi> which muſt not <hi>bee any more the word of Chriſt, but the example of the Prelates lives, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of their writings onely.</hi> p. 156. In this you have moſt ſhamefully abuſed your ſelfe, and all them that heard you. The <hi>rule of faith</hi> is ſtill the ſame, even the holy Scriptures: nor can you name a man who hath changed this rule, or made the dictates of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:4205:101"/>
the Church, to wit the Prelats, the rule of faith. The application of this rule, that is the expoſition of the <hi>Script.</hi> you muſt acknowledge to be in the <hi>Churches power,</hi> or els you are no ſon to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng.</hi> For in the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you have ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once or twice, it is ſaid expreſly that the <hi>Church hath authority in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſies of faith, &amp; that it is vwitnes &amp; a keeper of holy writ: As alſo that it hath authority to expound the ſcriptur,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditioned that it <hi>ſo expound one place, that it be not repugnant to another.</hi> And for the judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>prelats,</hi> I know not how you can excuſe your ſelfe before <hi>God</hi> almighty, for not ſubmitting therunto; having called God to witnes, that you would ſo do. For when you took the order of holy Prieſthood, it was demanded of you in the Congregation, <hi>whether you would reverently obey your Ordinary, and other chiefe Miniſters, unto whom the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and charge is committed over you, following with a glad mind and will their godly admonitions, and ſubmitting your ſelf to their godly judgements:</hi> and <hi>you made anſwer,</hi> that <hi>you would, the Lord being your helper.</hi> Either then you muſt firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vince their judgements of ſome plaine ungodlines, or elſe your not ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them, muſt be a plaine colluding both with God and man. <hi>Reeve,</hi> whom you jeere at ſo, both in your <hi>Paſquil</hi>; p. 152. and in your <hi>dialogue between A. &amp; B.</hi> ſaith no more then this: and if you ſay not this, you have not lied unto men only, but unto <hi>God</hi>

My ſoule for theirs that faithfully obſerve this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. So he. And had you kept this order, you had not ſo engaged your ſelf in theſe factious brabbles, wherewith you have diſturbed both your ſelfe and others. Touching the rule of manners, that any hath affirmed or written, that it muſt bee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Prelates lives and dictates, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no proofe. Onely you ſay, and ſay it onely, that they <hi>doe countenance, allow, and by Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopall authority diſpenſe with an heatheniſh kinde of life, eſpecially in moſt ſacred times, as the Lords day.</hi> This is no proofe I hope, but an <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> or <hi>a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Principii</hi> take it at the beſt; although it bee an argument you are uſed moſt to. And I muſt anſwer you to this in the words of <hi>Tullie, Quid minus eſt, non dico Oratoris ſed hominis, quam id objicere Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſario, quod ſi ille verbo negarit, ulterius progredi non paſſis.</hi> Till you bring better proofes for your <hi>innovations,</hi> your ſelfe muſt be reputed for the <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator</hi>: and all the miſchiefe which you have imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt other men, will fall upon your owne pate, and deſervedly too.</p>
            <p>Hitherto you have acted the falſe Accuſer, and have done it excellently well, none better. In the next place you come to play the Diſputant; and that you do us wretchedly, none worſe.
<q>For firſt you ſay, that it is <hi>pleaded</hi> by <hi>our changers,</hi> (as you pleaſe to call them) that they bring in no changes, but revive
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:4205:102"/>
thoſe things which antient Canons have allowed and preſcribed; as ſtanding up at the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> and at the reading of the Goſpell, bowing at the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and to the high Altar; removing the communion table to ſtand <hi>Altarwiſe</hi>; placing of Images in Churches, erecting <hi>Crucifixes</hi> over the Altars, commanding of long <hi>Mattins</hi> inſtead of preaching and the like.</q>
This ſaid, you anſwere hereunto, that wee in this land, are not to <hi>be ruled by the Popes Canons, or the Canon Law, but by the law of God and the King. And that there are no other rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to be uſed in our Church, then thoſe that are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Act of Parliament, prefixed to the communion booke, and are expreſſed in the ſame booke.</hi> But Sir, you may bee pleaſed to knowe, that the commanding of <hi>long prayers</hi> is warranted by that <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> which you ſo inſiſt on; the prayers being made no longer, then that Act commandeth: and that our bowing at <hi>the name of Jeſus</hi> is enjoyned by the 18. Canon, which being authorized by his Majeſtie, is the law of the King, and being grounded on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the <hi>Philipians,</hi> is the law of God. Our ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the Goſpell, and praying with our faces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt, have beene ſtill retained by our Church, not out of any ſpeciall Canon, but <hi>ex vi Catholice conſuetudinis,</hi> by vertue of the conſtant and continuall cuſtome of the church of God.
The pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the holy Table Altar-wiſe, and ſtanding at the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> have generally beene obſerved in Cathedrall Churches, ſince the Reformation: it being granted by a good friend of yours, the Author
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:4205:103"/>
of the <hi>holy Table,</hi> that in ſome Cathedrall Churches, where the ſteps were not tranſpoſed in <hi>tertio of the</hi> 
               <q>Queene, and the wall on the backeſide of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> untaken downe; the table might ſtand, as it did before, along the wall.</q>
For <hi>bowing to the high Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> I know no ſuch matter, either in practice or in precept: for bowing towards it, wee have the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of antiquitie but no preſent precept.
<q>Your friend and <hi>fidus Achates,</hi> the good miniſter of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> could have told you this, that although the Canon doth not enjoyne it, yet reaſon, pietie, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice of antiquitie doth: that Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe it in Saint <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> Liturgie; and the Lay-men are commanded to doe it in Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtomes</hi> Homilie: and finally if there bee any proud Dames, <hi>quae deferre neſciant mentium religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, quod deferunt voluptati</hi> as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeakes, that practice all manner of curteſies for <hi>maſkes</hi> and <hi>dances,</hi> but none by any meanes for <hi>Christ,</hi> at their approach to the holy Table: hee declares them Schiſmatickes, bequeathing them unto <hi>Donatus,</hi> with a proteſt, that hee will never write them in his Calendar for the Children of this Church.</q>
For Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in Churches, and Crucifixes over the Altars, finde you, of all loves, that the Church hath any where commanded them, or any of the Prelates in their viſitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, given order for their ſetting up? if not, why do you charge it on her, and bring not any proof at all that ſhee hath impoſed it. So that your anſwer being thus come to nothing, the objection by you brought on the Churches part, remaines unanſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:4205:103"/>
               <hi>Viz.</hi> that the Prelates of the Church have brought in no changes, but onely have revived thoſe things which the antient Canons have allowed and preſcribed; the Law of God, the King, and the Act of Parliament, either inabling them to doe ſo, or not gainſaying it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Secondly you object on the Prelates part, that they bring in no Innovations, no new rites, but what hath been in uſe ever ſince the Reformation, and that in the moſt eminent places even the Mother Churches of the land; ſo as all that they goe about is to reduce inferiour Churches to an unitie and conformitie to their Mother-Churches; that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all to unitie, they may take of that reproach which the Adverſaries caſt upon us in this kinde.</q>
This is their Plea indeed, you ſay wondrous honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Would you could hold long in ſo good a veine, and not flie out unto your wonted arts of Scandall and falſe clamours upon noe occaſion.
<q>For having pleaded thus, you make an anſwere preſently, that the Cathedrals are the old <hi>high places</hi> not yet remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; the antient dennes of thoſe old foxes; the neſts and Nurceries of ſuperſtition and Idolatrie, wherein the old Beldame of <hi>Rome</hi> hath nuzzled up her brood of <hi>Popelings,</hi> and ſo preſerved her <hi>VSVM SARVM,</hi> to this very day. p. 159. and finally that the Prelates make theſe mother Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedralls (being <hi>Romes</hi> adopted daughters) their Concubines, whereon to beget a new baſtard gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>ſacrificing</hi> Idolatrous Maſſe-prieſts through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the land. p. 163.</q>
But Sir, conſider in cold blood, that <hi>this</hi> is not to anſwere, but to rayle downe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:4205:104"/>
His ſacred Majeſtie, in his reſolution of the caſe about Saint <hi>Gregories</hi> Church, neere the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> did determine poſitively, that all Parochiall Churches ought to be guided by the <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the mother Church upon the which they doe depend:</hi> and yet hee did <hi>declare his diſlike of all Innovations and receding fromantient conſtitutions grounded upon juſt and warrantable reaſons</hi>; Which makes it manifeſt that he conceived not this conformitie with the mother Churches, to com within the <hi>compas of an Innovation.</hi> But wherefore tell wee you, of his Majeſties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which are not pleaſed with any thing that his Majeſtie doth, except it may bee wreſted to advance your purpoſes.

               <q>It is a ſigne (saith he) of the latter dayes drawing on; even the contempt of the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:4205:106"/>
Church, and of the Governours and Teachers thereof, now in the Church of <hi>England</hi>: which I ſay in my conſcience, of any Church that ever I read or knew of, preſent or paſt, is moſt pure, and neereſt the Primitive and Apoſtolicall Church in Doctrine and Diſcipline, and is ſureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt founded upon the Word of God, of any Church in Chriſtendome.</q>
Which commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the Church doth ſtill retaine; ſo may it take up the complaint in more grievous manner: thoſe times being modeſt then in reſpect of theſe; and thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts which he complaines of, being now growne to ſuch an height, <hi>Supra quod aſcendi non poſſit,</hi> that greater cannot be imagined. Wherein, as the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umviri,</hi> whom at firſt I ſpake of, have well played their parts: ſo there is none of any age, nor all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all ages, which hath ſhewne greater malice unto the Church, and to the Governors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of it, then you, Maſ. <hi>Burton.</hi> Not to the Biſhops only, and inferiour perſons, whom either for their place or calling, you were bound to honour; but to the ſupreame Governor thereof, your <hi>Soveraign</hi> and <hi>Patron,</hi> as you pleaſe, ſometimes to call him: your carriage towards whom, I ſhall firſt lay down, according as before delivered; and after tell you my opinion freely, what I thinke therein. Firſt, for the King, you call His royall power in queſtion, and are offended very much that any one ſhould attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute unto him an unlimited power, as you meane unlimited, or that the Subject ſhould be taught that his obedience muſt be abſolute, that being (ſay you)
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:4205:106"/>
a way, to caſt the feare of God, and ſo his Throne, downe unto the ground. You tell us of ſome things the King cannot doe, and that there is a power (in government) which he neither hath, nor may tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre upon another. You had my cenſure of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the Second Chapter. Yet I will here be bold to tell you, that as it is a kind of <hi>Atheiſme</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> what God can doe, and what hee cannot; though ſuch diſputes are raiſed ſometimes by unquiet witts: ſo it is a kind of diſobedience and diſloyalty to queſtion what a King can doe, being Gods Deputie here on earth; eſpecially to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what he can, and what he cannot. Then for the obedience of the Subject, you limit it to poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive lawes; the King to be no more obeyed then there is ſpeciall Law or Statute for it: the Kings <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Royall,</hi> being of ſo ſmall a value with you, that no man is to prize it, or take notice of it, further then warranted by Law, and which is worſe, you ground this poore obedience, which you pleaſe to yeeld him, upon that mutuall ſtipulation, which is between the King and people; and thereby teach the people, that they are no longer to obey the King, then he keeps promiſe with the people.</p>
            <p>This ground of obedience laied, you next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed unto the cenſure of his Majeſties actions: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that in your commitment unto Priſon, his Majeſtie had not kept his ſolemne covenant made with his people, touching their <hi>Petition</hi> (which you call) <hi>of right.</hi> That by his <hi>Declaration</hi> before the Articles, the Doctrines of Gods Grace and mans
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:4205:107"/>
ſalvation have beene huſht, and ſilenced, and that by ſilencing thoſe needleſſe controverſies, there is a ſecret purpoſe to ſuppreſſe Gods truth, and to bring in the contrary errours, as did the <hi>Arian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours by their law of <hi>Amneſtia.</hi> His Majeſties Declaration about lawfull ſports upon the <hi>Sunday,</hi> you taxe, as tending manely to the diſhonour of God, the prophanation of the Sabbath, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation of the fourth Commandment: and charge him that thereby, and by his ſilencing of thoſe doctrines before remembred, and reſtraint of preaching on the <hi>Faſt-dayes,</hi> in infected places; hee hath given way to <hi>Innovations,</hi> contrary to his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne promiſe made unto his people. His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Chappell Royall and the furniture thereof, you liken unto <hi>Nehu chadnezzars</hi> golden Image, and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians Altar</hi>: the King himſelfe to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate Julian,</hi> and that Idolatrous King <hi>Ahab</hi>: incouraging the people both by particular inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a generall exhortation to ſtand ſtoutly to it. Finally you lay down a moſt odious and diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſuppoſition, touching the ſetting up of <hi>Maſſe</hi> in his Majeſties Chappel, and what is to be done when that comes to paſſe. And ever and anon informe him (as if you meant to terrifie and affright him with it) how much the people doe beginne to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in their good opinion of his Majeſtie; that they grow jealous of ſome dangerous plot, that all the people of the Land (by your commitment to the priſon) may be poſſeſſed with a ſiniſter opinion of the Kings juſtice and conſtancie in keeping his
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:4205:107"/>
ſolemne Couenant made with his people as in that <hi>Petition of right</hi>; and if hee obſerve his word no better, it will be ſaid of him in ſucceeding <hi>Annalls,</hi> that hee had no regard to <hi>ſacred vowes and ſolemne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations.</hi> Thus having taught the people that all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the King is founded on a mutuall ſtipulation betweene him and them; and telling them, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and in how great matters, he hath broke the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made betweene them: you have releaſed the people <hi>ipſo facto</hi> of all obedience, duetie, and alleage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to their Soveraigne Lord; and thereby made them <hi>free ſubjects,</hi> as you pleaſe to call them, ſo <hi>free</hi> that it is wholy in their pleaſure whither they will <hi>obey,</hi> or not.</p>
            <p>Thus have I briefely layed together your carraige and behaviour towards our Lord the King:<note place="margin">3 Edw. l. 33</note> wherein expreſſely contrarie to the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> that <hi>no man tell or publiſh any falſe newes or tales, whereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord or occaſion of diſcord or ſlander may growe betweene the King and his people or the nobles</hi>; you have as much as in you was, made a breach betweene them.

So farre the lawes provide to prevent all diſcord, and the occaſions of the ſame: but for preventing of <hi>ſedition,</hi> and <hi>ſeditious</hi> either words or writings, they are more ſevere: of which how far you have been <hi>guiltie,</hi> we ſhal ſee annon. Mean time you may take notice, if at leſt you will, that it hath beene the antient practiſe of thoſe men, whoſe ſtepps you follow, to put into the peoples mindes ſeditious humours, thereby to make themſelves of power againſt the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi>: and ſometimes alſo to terrifie and affright the Prince or ſupreame <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> with the feare of uproares, the better to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh what they had projected.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:4205:108"/>
whereof you are chiefe. And for your odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſuppoſition, of <hi>ſetting up of Maſſe in the Kings Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi> let mee tell you this. That it is Criminall,<note place="margin">Hiſt. of K. H. 7. by the Viſ. S. <hi>Alb.</hi>
               </note> if not Capitall, to uſe <hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>Ands,</hi> and <hi>ſuppoſitions</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſo high a nature; and ſuch as in ſome caſes hath beene judged <hi>high Treaſon.</hi> Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> a man as of eſpeciall merit, ſo in eſpeciall favor with King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, found it no jeſting matter to uſe <hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>Ands,</hi> in things which doe ſo neerely concerne a King. For ſaying onely, that <hi>if he thought the young man (Perkin Warbeck) to bee the undoubted ſonne of King Edward the fourth hee never would beare armes againſt him</hi> he was condemned of treaſon, and executed for the ſame: the Judges thinking it unſafe to admitt <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>ands</hi> in ſuch dangerous points.</p>
            <p>So for your dealing with the Biſhops, you labour to expoſe them as much as in you is, to the publicke hatred; and to ſtirre up the people to effect their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. Not to repeate thoſe ſcandalous and odious names, which <hi>pasſim,</hi> almoſt in every page you have caſt upon them, to bring them into diſcredit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with the common people: you have accuſed them of invading his Majeſties ſupreme authoritie, and left them, as you thinke, in a <hi>Premunire</hi>; the better to incenſe his Majeſtie againſt them alſo. whom having exaſperated, as you hope, againſt them, you call upon him in plaine termes to <hi>hang them up, as once the Gibeonites</hi> did <hi>the</hi> 7. <hi>ſonnes of Saul; at leaſt to joyne with God and his good ſubjects, Courtiers, Nobles, Judges, Magiſtrates,</hi> and <hi>the rest together,</hi> to <hi>cut them off, and roote them out.</hi> Which if hee will not doe,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:4205:109"/>
you tell him roundly that for his owne part, he will make a very <hi>ſorrie accompt to almightie</hi> God, for the great charge committed to him; and then, that God for his part, will rather adde unto, then decreaſe our Plagues; till he hath utterly deſtroyed vs. But fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leſt this ſhould not edifie with ſo wiſe a Prince, you practiſe next upon the people. And knowing that there is nothing, which they prize ſo highly, as the defence of their religion and lawfull liberties; you lay about you luſtilie, to let them ſee how much they are in danger of looſing both. For this cauſe you accuſe the Prelates allmoſt every where for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of <hi>Poperie, tooth and nayle for Poperie,</hi> confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating with <hi>Prieſts and Jeſuites,</hi> for rearing up of that religion; and ſetting up againe the <hi>the throne of Anti-Chriſt</hi>: and all their actions you interpret to tend that way. Next you crie out, how much the people are oppreſſed contrarie to their rights and liberties, affirming that the Biſhops <hi>doe not onely over toppe the royall throne, but that</hi> they <hi>trample the lawes, liberties, and juſt rights of the Kings ſubjects under their feete</hi>; and cutt the people off, <hi>from the free uſe and benefit of the Kings good lawes.</hi> Which ſaid, and preſſed in every place with all ſpight and rancour, you call upon the <hi>nobles</hi> to <hi>rowze up their noble Chriſtian zeale and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous courage; upon the judges,</hi> to <hi>drawe forth their ſword of juſtice</hi>; upon the <hi>Courtiers, nobles,</hi> others, if <hi>they have any ſparke of pietie, now to put their helping hands in ſo great a neede</hi>; and leſt all theſe ſhould faile, you call upon the <hi>nation</hi> generally to <hi>take notice of their</hi> Antichriſtian <hi>practiſes &amp; to redreſſe them withall their force
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:4205:109"/>
and power.</hi> What doe you thinke of this <hi>Alarme,</hi> this <hi>Ad arma ad arma,</hi> this calling of all ſorts of people to combine together, to <hi>rouze their ſpirits, drawe their ſwords, put to their hands, muſter upp all their force and power</hi>: doe you not thinke this comes within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of <hi>ſedition?</hi> have not you done your beſt (or your worſt rather) to raiſe an <hi>inſurrection</hi> in the ſtate, under pretence of looking to the ſafety of <hi>religion,</hi> and the <hi>Subjects rights?</hi> I wil not judge your conſcience, I leave that to God. But if one may collect your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by your words and writings; or if your words and writings may bee cenſured, not onely according to the effect which they have produced but which they might: you are but in a ſorry taking. And becauſe poſſiblie when you finde your danger, you will the better find your error, and ſo prepare your ſelfe for a ſincere and ſound repentance; I will a little lay it open. Make you what uſe there of, you ſhall thinke moſt fitt.</p>

that they have more then private intereſt in the things of God, and in the government of States: nothing more plauſible nor welcome to ſome ſort of men, ſuch whom you either make or call <hi>free Subjects.</hi> This <hi>Buchanans</hi> device, to put the ſword into the hands and managing of the people;<note place="margin">Deiure Reg.</note> in that his moſt ſeditious maxime, <hi>Populo jus eſt imperium eui velit deferat.</hi> And ſuch the doctrine of <hi>Cleſelius,</hi> one of your brethren in the cauſe, a furious <hi>Contra-Remonſtrant</hi> of <hi>Roterdam,</hi> who laid it for a doctrine before his audience,<note place="margin">Marca. Reſp. pars 2. p. 50.</note> that if the Magiſtrates and Miniſters did not do their parts to preſerve Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the people muſt, <hi>licet ad ſanguinem uſque pro ea pugnarent,</hi> what blood ſoever ſhould bee ſpent in purſuite thereof. Such grounds were alſo laid in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, by thoſe who then were held as you thinke your ſelfe, the <hi>Grand ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters</hi> of the cauſe: men like to <hi>Theudas</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> who thought themſelves, as you doe now, to be ſome great <hi>Prophets,</hi> and drew <hi>much people after them,</hi> ſo many that they threatned to petition to the <hi>Queenes highneſſe,</hi> with no fewer then 100000. hands. But what became of theſe jolly fellowes. They periſhed, &amp; as <hi>many as followed after them, &amp; redacti ſunt ad nihilum,</hi> and are brought to nothing: nothing remaining of them now, but the name and infamy. Nor can I promiſ better to thoſe who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their courſes; and either furiouſly runne, or elſe permit themſelves to bee drawne along into thoſe raſh counſailes: which as they are begunne in diſobedience, and proſecuted equally with pride
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:4205:112"/>
and malice; ſo can we not expect that they ſhould have a better end, then calamitous ruine. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall earneſtly beſeech and exhort all thoſe, who have beene practiſed with by this kind of <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> (if ſuch at leaſt may caſt their eyes on any thing which is not made to feede their humour) that they would ſeriouſly endeavour the Churches peace, and conſcionably ſubmit themſelves to their ſuperiours in the Lord: not following with too haſtie feete thoſe <hi>Ignes fatui,</hi> who onely leade them on to <hi>dangerous precipices,</hi> and <hi>dreadfull down-falls.</hi> The greateſt vertue of a Subject is his <hi>free obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>; not <hi>grudgingly</hi> or of <hi>neceſsity,</hi> or for feare of puniſhment: whether it be <hi>unto the King,</hi> as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the chiefe</hi>; or unto <hi>Governours as unto them which are ſent by</hi> him,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.13.14.</note> 
               <hi>for the puniſhment of evill doers, and for the praiſe of them that doe well.</hi> Suſpition, as it is in Kings, the ſickneſſe of a tyrant (and ſo his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie King <hi>Iames</hi> conceived it) ſo is it in a Subject, the diſeaſe and ſickneſſe of a miſchievous braine, apt upon every light ſurmiſe, to entertaine unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pernitious counſailes. The ſafeſt man is he, that thinkes no evill, and entertaines not raſhly thoſe unjuſt reports, which are deviſed and ſpread abroad by malicious wits, of purpoſe to defame their betters: that they themſelves might gaine applauſe, and be cryed up, and honoured, yea <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum non</hi> adored by poore ignorant men, who doe not underſtand aright what their <hi>Projects</hi> ayme at.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I muſt informe both you and them, that howſoever it was thought not to bee unfit, that at
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:4205:112"/>
this preſent time an Anſwer ſhould be made unto all your quarrells, that ſo the people whom you have ſeduced might ſee the errour of their courſes: yet neither you nor they muſt expect the like on all, or any of thoſe factious provocations which every day are offered to the publicke governement. Things that are once eſtabliſhed by a conſtant law, are not at all to be diſputed, but much leſſe declamed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt: or if they bee, will finde more ſhelter from the lawes, then from their Advocates. Theſe ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and ſeditious pamphlets are now growne ſo rife, that every day (as if wee lived in the wild of <hi>Africke</hi>) doth produce <hi>new Monſters</hi>: there being more of them divulged at this preſent time, then any former age can ſpeake of; more of theſe facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirits <hi>quam muſcarum olim cum caletur maxime,</hi> then there are <hi>Scarabees</hi> and <hi>Gad-flies</hi> in the heat of Summer. And ſhould the State thinke fit, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very libell of yours, and ſuch men as you, ſhould have a ſolemne Anſwer to it: you would advance your heads too high, and thinke you had done ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then ordinary, which ſhould neceſſitate the ſtate to ſet out Apologies. That, as it would encourage you to purſue your courſes; ſo would it ſuddenly diſſolve the whole frame of government; which is as much endangered by ſuch diſputations, as by diſobedience. And yet I would not have you thinke, that you are like to find thoſe daies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>ubi &amp; ſentire quae velis,</hi>

               <hi>&amp; quae ſentias loqui liceat</hi>; in which you may be bold to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine what you liſt, and ſpeake what ever you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:4205:113"/>
much leſſe to ſcatter and diſperſe in publick what ever you dare ſpeake in private. Princes have other waies to right themſelves, and thoſe which are in authority under them, then by the pen: and ſuch as will fall heavier, if you pull them on you. Kings &amp; the governors of ſtates, as they participate of Gods power and patience, ſo doe they imitate him in their juſtice alſo; and in their manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt obſtinate perſons. God is provoked every day, ſo Kings: God did ſometimes expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with his faulty people, and ſo doe Kings: God ſometimes did imploy his Prophets to ſatisfie the clamours and diſtruſts of unquiet men; and thus Kings doe alſo. But when the people grew rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, and ſtif-necked, and would not heare the <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers voice, charme hee never ſo wiſely</hi>; God would no longer trouble himſelfe in ſeeking to reclaime them from their peeviſh folly: but let them feele the rod and the ſmart thereof, till the meere ſenſe of puniſhment had weaned them from it. So how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it bee true, <hi>convitia ſpreta exoleſcunt,</hi> that ſcandalous pamphlets, ſuch as yours, and thoſe which if not yours, are now ſpread abroad, have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times with much both moderation, &amp; wiſdome, been ſlighted and neglected by the greateſt perſons: yet if the humor be predominant, and the vein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, it hath beene found at other times as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that the tongue which ſpeaketh proud words be cut off for ever. Nor would I have you ſo farre abuſe your ſelfe, as to conceit that none of theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Paſquils, which are now caſt into the world,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:4205:113"/>
doe concerne the King. For as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us, that <hi>whoſoever doth reſiſt the power, reſiſts the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13</note> becauſe <hi>there is no power but it is from God:</hi> So whoſoever doth traduce and defame thoſe men, which are in chiefe authority under the King, doe defame the King, becauſe they have their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and authorities from and under him. And thus it was affirmed in <hi>Vdals</hi> caſe,<note place="margin">Sutel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For when it was pretended for him, that he defamed not the Queen which the law provided for, but the Biſhops onely: it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that they who ſpake againſt her Majeſties ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme government in caſes Eccleſiaſtical, her lawes, proceedings, and all thoſe Eccleſiaſticall officers, which rule under her, did defame the Queeene. Your caſe being juſt the ſame with <hi>Vdalls,</hi> nor you, nor any ſuch as you have reaſon to perſwade your ſelves, but that your ſcandalous <hi>Paſquills</hi> doe as neerely concerne the King, as thoſe did the Queen; or that you ſhall be anſwered alwayes, <hi>edictis melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi> with pen and paper. If Authority hath ſtoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſo low, this once, to give way that your ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pamphlets ſhould come under an examination, and that an Anſwer ſhould be made to all the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous matters in the ſame contained, I would not have you thinke it was for any other cauſe, but that your Proſelytes may perceive what falſe guides they follow, and all the world may ſee how much you have abuſed the King and his Miniſters, with your ſcandalous clamours. Which done, and all thoſe cavills anſwered, which you have beene ſo long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding;

it is expected at their hands; that they reſt ſatisfied in and of the Churches purpoſes, in every of the things objected; and looke not after freſh <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies</hi> upon the like occaſions. And ſo I leave both you and them with thoſe words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which you have ſo perverted to your wretched ends: <hi>My ſonne feare thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change: for their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity ſhall ariſe ſuddainely, and who knoweth the ruine of them both.</hi>
