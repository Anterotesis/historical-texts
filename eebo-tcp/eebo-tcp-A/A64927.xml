            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE EARL of ARRAN, Eldeſt Son to Duke <hi>Hamilton.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN this humble Addreſs to your Lordſhip, perhaps as unſeaſonable now as the Declaration of my never-fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Zeal to his Sacred Majeſty, my Lord and Maſter. I am very ſenſible how great a Riſque I run, firſt, of offending your Lordſhip, and next the preſent <hi>State</hi>; but I aſſure your Lordſhip, I am infinitely more Aw'd by my firſt Fear than my Laſt, for <hi>that</hi> I hope will allow <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> even to the Poets themſelves, (<hi>provided they be no Papiſts</hi>) though there ought to be no Toleration for Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and Ill Manners; which, at this time, take too Saucy a Liberty, and treat even Crown'd Heads with that Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Contempt, as if the <hi>Britiſh</hi> World had agreed they would be Govern'd by no more <hi>Kings:</hi> And it is no doubt that ſort of Eſtabliſhment is Aim'd at by that great Part of the Nation, the <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> But all true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, Men of Honor, and of the Orthodox Church, 'tis to be hoped yet, have other Sentiments, of which number your Lordſhip is one; whoſe Glorious Principles of Loyalty and Honor, even <hi>now</hi> ſhine forth to the World, and with a Noble Luſtre gilding all your other Vertues, have render'd your Lordſhip one of the moſt Conſiderable of any Great Men of your Nation to all ſucceeding times; and 'tis from Men of ſuch Principles we muſt hope for the Accompliſhment of that Good which has ſo lately been aſſur'd us, That of making both King and
<pb facs="tcp:55254:3"/>
People happy; which cannot be by forcing his Majeſty to an Exile, and, to palliate that Cruelty, (to give it no worſe Name) brand him with all the Infamy that Malice can invent. We would willingly poſſeſs our ſelves with the belief, that ſuch Impudent and right-down Treaſonable Libels, as daily come out upon their Majeſties, are rather the uncontroulable and implacable Fire-Balls of a few convicted (though now too bare-faced) Criminals, than the Connivance, much leſs the Toleration of thoſe that now Rule; whoſe Commands ought to ſuppreſs Miſchiefs of ſo dangerous a Conſequence, leſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every little Pique they ſhall pleaſe to take againſt <hi>thoſe</hi> they now pretend to <hi>ſerve,</hi> they ſhould run into the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and treat them at laſt as Ill as they have done their Lawfull King, or God himſelf; ſince to ſpeak Evilly of the one, is to Prophane the other: They need not give us that Infallible Proof, that Religion (ſo much their Pretence) is the leaſt of their Deſign and Aim, ſince no Man on Earth can profeſs himſelf a Chriſtian, or even a Moraliſt, with Notions ſo abſolutely Heatheniſh and Diabolical; Actions ſo directly contrary to Scripture, and all the Rules that God himſelf has ſet us. And however neceſſary ſome may imagin theſe Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions may be to the preſent Intereſt, to poſſeſs the wretched Rabble, and common Raſcality, yet they are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing approved or believed, by thoſe of common Senſe or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Education, that they are abhor'd; and are as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely a diſgrace to this great deſign of Setling Religion, as the protection and toleration given to the Aſſaſſin of the moſt Reverend Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and the <hi>Rye-Houſe</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirator. And becauſe Three or Four condemned Criminals have by their Villanies made themſelves uncapable of Living under a King, they muſt now be allow'd Authentick Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt his preſent Majeſty, and blacken him with ſuch Actions of Horror, that the moſt barbarous of Villains, Thieves, and Murtherers, nay the Fiends themſelves, were never guilty of: And though theſe ridiculous and inhumane Libels are only Calculated for the naſty Rabble, and the fooliſh poſitive Multitude, and are below the Senſe even of thoſe that write them; yet they ſerve to blow a Fire that will be one Day too Hot for this Nation. I know they are Countenanced, and ſeemingly Credited, by a great many
<pb facs="tcp:55254:3"/>
diſaffected and ill-minded Men, whoſe buſineſs is no other ways to be done than by ſetting the World at Odds. And no doubt but it was found abſolutely Neceſſary, after the treating his Majeſty at his Return with ſuch unaccountable Contempt, that his Fame and Glory ſhould be ruin'd as well as Himſelf; having no other Excuſe for their own Crimes but loading his Majeſty with Calumnies: A poor and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Shift to juſtify a too precipitate Proceeding; a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding which their Lordſhips, both Spiritual and Temporal (too zealous for Religion, and too remiſs for the King and Nations ſafety) had not, I am afraid, well enough Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, or the enſuing Conſequences; nor ought it to have been expected, that when they turned out Popery they ſhould have ſuffered their King, by the Indignities put upon him, to ſeek his Safety in a Foreign Nation. I am certain, that none has a more intire Reſpect for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> than my ſelf, nor a higher Veneration for the Eſtabliſhed Religion: As for that Word <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> it bears too great a Latitude for me to underſtand; but, I hope, it is not by dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out the Jeſuits, to down with the Biſhops too; which is but too much the Fear of thoſe that are hearty well-wiſhers to the Eſtabliſhed Church, Laws, and Liberties. 'Tis therefore wiſhed that ſuch Publick and Noble Spirits, as that of your Lordſhip, would repreſent theſe Fears to the great Councils of both Nations; and ſince Affairs go ſo contrary to the true Intent of this great Deſign, they would be pleaſed to take the Care of theſe Nations into their Conſideration: And as they are all Men of Honor, and his Sacred Majeſty the Head and Fountain of Honor, they would not ſuffer that to be polluted by prophane Hands; nor permit a Cauſe of ſo High and Glorious Pretences, as this of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to be violated, and not ſerve the end for which it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. And let thoſe foul Aſperſers make good thoſe Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals they have ſpread, by any honeſt or tolerable Witneſſes, (and not ſuch as perhaps, who having been guilty of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crimes, and to get a General Pardon for real Villanies will confeſs themſelves Guilty of feigned ones) and then they may be allowed to Rail; but if not, let them be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to that juſt Law to which they are Condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: For the Land has too lately been made Calamitous
<pb facs="tcp:55254:4"/>
enough by falſe Witneſſes, on whoſe Account too much Blood has been ſhed.</p>
            <p>Some ſuch Witneſſes (if any) <hi>Danvers</hi> will pick up for Proofs that the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Eſſ.</hi> was Murthered, on which bloody Subject he has troubled the World with too Notable Pieces; which he is pleaſed to call, <hi>A full Diſcovery, by poſitive Proofs</hi>; in which there is neither Diſcovery, nor Proof, but a deal of Stuff and Noiſe, trifling Surmiſes, bug bear Words, of <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Murther, bloody Villany,</hi> and a thouſand terms of the like frightful Senſe, dividing his Text as if he were in his Tub a bellowing forth as many Lies, Aſperſing and Accuſing Men of undoubted Honor, and honeſt Principles; laying the Scandal on, let them take it off as well as they can; and let the World judge, if that Noble and moſt Pious Lady, the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſ.</hi> Exemplary for every Vertue, and holineſs of Life, would let paſs the Murther of her Lord in Silence, and Unſearched into, when ſhe had ſo good an Occaſion offered as this, by the <hi>unchriſt'ned Colonel,</hi> if ſhe were not aſſured of the way and manner of his Lordſhip's deplorable Death al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. 'Tis therefore the humble Requeſt of all honeſt Men, that this Licentiouſneſs of the Preſs may be ſuppreſt; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, inſtead of Eſtabliſhing of Laws and Religion, we are hurrying both to Ruin, and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>My Lord, all the World knows your Lordſhip to be a true Lover of your Country, and a noble Aſſerter of all its Liberties, and equal to thoſe, the Rights and Prerogatives of your King, whoſe Intereſt has hitherto been Inſeparable with your own, even in the worſt of Times; but, oh! never ſo bad as theſe; for then our King was but oppreſs'd, but now he is forc'd to fly, contrary to the Intent (I hope) of all who have embark'd in this great Deſign. But though we have not yet found the Effects of it, wholly to doubt it, were to call in queſtion the Integrity of a great Prince, and the Loyalty of the nobleſt Part of the Nation, and ſuſpect the moſt aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unpreſidented Atchievment that ever was ſurprizing in Hiſtory, and the moſt conſiderable Turn of State that the Univerſe ever ſaw. We will therefore look up, and hope that the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> accompliſh'd with ſo many Vertues, and who has the true Notion of Religion and Honour in his great Soul, will, by the ſacred Keeping of his Word, in making our
<pb facs="tcp:55254:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
King happy, give us an Aſſurance of all he has promis'd us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: For after the moſt Refin'd Stateſmen, and Men of the moſt Wiſdom and Conduct in the Eſtabliſhment of Nations, have debated as long as they pleaſe, they will find at laſt there is no way to give us our Religion, Laws, Liberties, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but by recalling and fixing our King in his Lawful Throne. The Conſtitution of <hi>England</hi> being founded on Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, it were to embroil the Nation in Eternal War, either Civil or Foreign, not to ſubmit half way, and recall our King to his proper Glories; otherwiſe, no humane Wiſdom can prevent our being perpetually fatigued with our Neighbours, who are like to give us ſufficient Diverſion, if we are in Love with War, and be at a continual Expence of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood (and Mony more dear to us;) and let us pleaſe our ſelves, if we can, with the Contempt we put on <hi>France,</hi> and ſet as lightly of the Force and Power of that Monareh, as we do of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we may to our coſt find, that <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. of <hi>France</hi> is not ſo eaſily ſubdued as (it hapned) <hi>James</hi> II. of <hi>England</hi> was; nor that his Forces, of what Religion ſoever, will abandon and betray their King, as ours did; who, to the Eternal Shame of that Religion (we only talk of and do not practiſe) find thoſe Principles (which are thought too bloody in the <hi>Papiſt</hi>) infinitely more Juſt and Honorable than thoſe of ours; ſince they thought they ought in Conſcience to fight Faithfully for that Prince who fed and clothed them, let his Religion be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo contrary to their own; and moſt certainly there might have been a <hi>Medium</hi> found between their quitting of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or their Loyalty, which have hitherto been thought inconſiſtent: But on the contrary, Vertues that uſed to go hand in hand among good Chriſtians, and Men of Honor. And the Primitive Chriſtians gloried in their Loyalty, though even to Heathen and Tyrant Emperors.</p>
            <p>And as it was not lawful to puſh things to that Extremity to which they are arriv'd, ſo neither was it needful; we having a King that bleſt be God, who wou'd not have carried his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing Power to that height, as to become a Burthen, or Grievance to his People; and his Majeſty, and his Council, muſt have been a Synod of Gods, to have committed no Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the management of ſo Critical a Government.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt but his Majeſty, out of a tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the Papiſts, was pleaſed to give them a little incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb facs="tcp:55254:5"/>
and reſpite from Affliction; and we may ſee by his Majeſties willingneſs to reſtore all things to their firſt Order, at the very firſt Addreſs of the Biſhops, that he did not think his Counſels Infallible.</p>
            <p>Perhaps 'twill be Objected, That he made not this Gracious Condeſcention till after he heard of the Deſigns of the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> If this be granted, they muſt alſo grant me this other truth, That it could not be fear of being Conquered by the Foreign Army (as Malice would inſinuate) that could oblige him to it; for then his Majeſty knew not but that he was ſure not only of his Great Men, but alſo of his Army, that was able to have vanquiſh'd a far greater Army than what came with the Prince; and no body doubted his Succeſs (if they had fought, and that his Men had ſtood by him) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe who before knew how he was to be abandon'd. And 'tis moſt certain, and well known to ſome of Quality, that his Majeſty would have condeſcended to any reaſonable terms that Honor could have propos'd; nor did he come back again from <hi>Feverſham</hi> but with a full Intent to have adjuſted the great Affair: But while they complained on Evil Counſels, on the King's ſide, 'tis thought, they had not thoſe, on the other ſide, that were Friends to Peace, or an Accommodation; for if they had meant any ſuch thing, his Majeſty had not been ſent away again no better than a Priſoner.</p>
            <p>I will not ſay, that thoſe Misfortunes that hinder'd us of this happy Peace, and promis'd Union, were the Faults of his Highneſs, whoſe Deſigns were undoubtedly Noble, but the Effects of a too violent Council, too much biaſſed againſt the Royal Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip, and all other Great Men of both Nations, are moſt humbly beſought, by all Loyal and Honeſt Church of <hi>England</hi> Men, to uſe your Intereſts both for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe poor diſtracted Kingdoms, and eſpecially for the Reſtauration of his moſt Sacred Majeſty; for which yours, and their Lordſhips, will Eternally receive the Prayers and Bleſſings of all good Men: And my humble Muſe, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to proſtrate her Complaint here at your Feet, ſhall rouſe her Melancholy Head again, and Sing yet once more to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Loyalty of the Great Name of <hi>ARRAN,</hi> and the Illuſtrious <hi>HAMILTON.</hi>
