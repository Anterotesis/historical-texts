         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet we have store of young Doctors, some of which not over-learned, who, as soon as ever they come out of the University, will undertake to write Prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Apothecaries for Medicines to cure the Sick even of the most obstinate and intricate Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, when they are void of all manner of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and full of nothing at best but Noise and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Notions: But since these two contribute little to the Recovery of the Sick, they are not by wise Men to be relied on, except when no others c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mercy, old Doctor, reply'd the Emperor, I find by your Confession that you are an experienc'd Man, I'll venture to take something from you, or by your Directions, for I know, continued the Emperor, that by the Divine Decree of God Almighty, all Metals, Minerals, Herbs and Plants, enrich'd with various Scents, Tasts, Colours and Forms, grow and spring forth of the Earth, possest with many and great Virtues, insomuch, that I hold it a great Offence to attribute to any other than to the Deity the Benefit of a Blessing adapted for so many Uses; besides, the Knowledge of the Virtues of these things is no less than Divine in its Original; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no Man's Capacity could ever attain to the Knowledge of these things at first, without the Assistance of a Supernatural Power and Inspiration; this being so, 'twill be easily granted, that when in the beginning God breathed into <hi>Adam</hi> the Breath of Life, he then also taught him the Knowledge of Nature in all her intricate Operations, Faculties and Virtues, that is, discovered to him, the secret Energy of all things contained in the Circuit of this Universe; and at this day we see the same God preserves by means all those Beings he at first made without means. In fine, said the Emperor, I will not adventure to be preserv'd by unexperienced Men, lest I should Shipwrack my self upon the Rocks of horrid Ignorance; but will look for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of my Life from those whose Experience, under God, has furnish'd them with the Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and then we shall know the great Creator of the World, and us: and since even now all our little Knowledge, Arts and Sciences, come from God, let us then wholly rely upon Him; for <hi>except we abide in Him we can do no good thing,</hi> John 15.16.</p>
            <p>Next, I will give you to understand what manner of Men <hi>Physicians</hi> and <hi>Surgeons</hi> ought to be; <hi>Omnibus aliis Medicus praestantior unus.</hi> They ought to excel others in fearing God, and eschewing Evil, as much as Divines themselves; for truly the Divine and Physician <hi>conveniunt in uno tertio</hi>; they are both for Curing; the Divine heals <hi>Corpus per Animam</hi>; the Physician, <hi>Animam per Corpus.</hi> Every Divine is a Spiritual Physician, and every Physician ought to be a Spiritual Divine, tho' not by Profession, yet by Practice; for into their Hands God has put the Lives of those he lov'd so well, that he Redeem'd them by the Blood of his only begotten Son. St. <hi>Luke,</hi> the beloved Physician, was a Divine Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list, and commends the Study of those great Books of God, the Book of his Scripture, and that of his Creatures, since the glory of God, and the good of his Creatures, ought to be the Mark to which all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of Physicians ought to be directed.</p>
            <p>Physicians should by no means give the least En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to such a Monster as Covetousness within their Breasts; nor ought they to have any respect to Persons, but go as freely to the Poor for a little Money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or for nothing, when Need requires, as to the Rich for ample Rewards; for <hi>those that give to the Poor, lend to the Lord, and</hi> may be sure <hi>God will reward them double-fold.</hi> On the other hand, a Physician is not bound to behave himself in this manner to the Rich, but may take his Fee lawfully and cheerfully when it is offer'd; but there are too many who are willing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37390:10"/>
to have the Physicians Help, but slow in Paying him. Hence 'tis observ'd, that a Doctor appears to his Patient in three different Forms: <hi>First,</hi> when he tells the Patient there is hopes; O then he appears as an Angel. Next, when the Cure is perform'd, the Patient looks upon his Physician as a God. But lastly, when the Physician demands his Reward, then his Patient takes him for a Devil. Thus different Circumstances beget different Opinions in those hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Minds that are corrupted by Avarice and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Therefore it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the Physicians and Surgeons Rule, <hi>Accipere dum dolet,</hi> to take the Sound Fee whilst the Sick Hand gives it.</p>
            <p>Life is short, Art long, Occasion sudden, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience dangerous, Judgment difficult: Hence we may conclude, there are but few good Physicians; and yet it is not sufficient, tho' the Physician or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon do their Parts or Office, unless the Patient and his Attendance do their Duty also, whereby outward things may be as well order'd as those that are given inwardly; this is the main Hinge upon which all the rest turn; and therefore ought earnestly to be prest, and all too little to make Servants diligent: The Physician ought to be faithful and cautious in Practice; for Life hangs as it were but by a slender Thread, and is at best but short, yet is apt to be made much shorter by many Accidents, and those very small ones too. Art is long, if Theory and Practice are consider'd. Diseases are sudden, and if not suddenly removed, may quickly ruine. Past Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, if not well understood, may lead the Physician into Errour; besides, Judgment is very difficult, through the Variety of Diseases and their Causes, which, by the Fault of the Sick and his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, are many times not perceived even by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians of greatest Abilities.</p>

a bad <hi>Chylification</hi> is the original of many Diseases. How careful then ought People to be in keeping the Kitchen of their Bodies, I mean their Stomachs, clean, since that would be the only means to prevent Diseases, as well as cure them; nay, this would so preserve Health, that Men might attain the Happiness of seeing the utmost of their appointed days with Ease and Comfort.</p>
               <p>It was the Opinion of the ancient Physicians, That the <hi>Stomach</hi> and <hi>Spleen</hi> contained a <hi>Ferment,</hi> which hindred them from performing rightly what they were intended for, because the abundance of <hi>fixt Salt</hi> falling upon the <hi>Stomach</hi> causeth <hi>soure</hi> and <hi>unsavoury Belchings,</hi> from which also proceeds <hi>melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick, tenacious, gross</hi> and <hi>crude Humours,</hi> which mixing with the <hi>Mass of Blood</hi> causeth a <hi>Cachexy,</hi> which obstructs the <hi>Liver,</hi> and finally ends in <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick</hi> Distempers. Now my <hi>Pills</hi> and <hi>Tincture</hi> are the most excellent means yet known for their Cure and Prevention, by cleansing and sweetning the whole <hi>Mass of Blood</hi> and <hi>nervous Iuyce,</hi> rectifying all the Defects and Injuries that putrifie the <hi>Blood,</hi> which being corrupt, defileth the whole Habit of Body, and is the Cause of <hi>Eruptions,</hi> or all sorts of <hi>Breakings out</hi>; as <hi>Itch, Leprosie, Spots, Ring-worms, Kings-Evil,</hi> and all sorts of <hi>Swellings</hi> in the Joynts, or other parts, which sometimes turns into <hi>Fistula's,</hi> or such fretting <hi>Vlcers</hi> or <hi>Sores</hi> that will hardly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Cure till the <hi>Scorbutick Humours</hi> be carried off, and the <hi>Mass of Blood</hi> cleansed from the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Humours, the primary Cause thereof; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you must first remove their Cause, before you can effect a Cure. Sometimes these Humours break out principally in the <hi>Head,</hi> and then it turns to the <hi>Scurff</hi> or <hi>Scald-Head.</hi> Sometimes they fall on
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37390:18"/>

Sometimes these Humours over-heat the <hi>Brain,</hi> by reason of <hi>Vapours</hi> which arise from the lower parts of the <hi>Body,</hi> sent up to the <hi>Head,</hi> and then they bring <hi>Deafness,</hi> by obstructing the <hi>Organs</hi> and <hi>auditory Nerves,</hi> which hinder the <hi>Drum</hi> and <hi>Anvil</hi> from sending the Eccho to the <hi>Brain,</hi> and many times is the Cause of more stubborn Diseases; as <hi>Cancers</hi> in the <hi>Breast, Gouts</hi> of all sorts, <hi>Dropsies, Iaundice, Collick Pains,</hi> with <hi>Griping</hi> in the <hi>Bowels, Stitches</hi> in the <hi>Sides, Pains</hi> and <hi>Weakness</hi> of the <hi>Back, Obstructions</hi> of the <hi>Liver, Spleen, Mesentary, Diaphragma, Tranchea, Arteria,</hi> and <hi>Stoppage</hi> of the <hi>Pipes</hi> of the <hi>Lungs</hi>; hence come <hi>Asthma's,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, Coughs,</hi> with <hi>Shortness</hi> of <hi>Breath</hi>; and when the <hi>Stomach</hi> is stufft with these ill <hi>Scorbutick Humours</hi> we are afflicted with <hi>Giddiness</hi> of the <hi>Head, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion-Fits,</hi> and lastly with <hi>Contraction</hi> of the <hi>Nerves.</hi> Sometimes by over-charging of Nature with strong Drinks proceed <hi>Vapours,</hi> which cause <hi>Apoplexies, Belchings,</hi> and <hi>loss of Appetite.</hi> Sometimes these <hi>Scorbutick Humours</hi> produce <hi>Numbness,</hi> and <hi>Tingling</hi> in the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and so turn to a <hi>Palsie,</hi> with Weakness and Wearisomness, wasting of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and decay of <hi>Body</hi>; besides, in Old and Young these Humours bring <hi>Swooning,</hi> and by coagulating of the <hi>Blood</hi> hinders its <hi>Fermentation,</hi> and then the <hi>Influx</hi> of <hi>Spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thus much I thought fit to say of the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> such as would know more may consult my little Pamphlet I formerly set out, for the <hi>Cure of the Sick and Diseased, through God's Blessing, by my Famous Medicines,</hi> therein mentioned. This is the <hi>Second Edition,</hi> for some Reasons I have left many things out that were in that. In that Book I gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Three Pills</hi> and a <hi>Quart Bottle</hi> of <hi>Diet-Drink,</hi> which <hi>Three Pills</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Bottle</hi> I sold for <hi>Three Shillings</hi>; but this that I now offer I afford for half the Price, <hi>viz. Three Pills</hi> and an Ounce Vial of this my present <hi>Antiscorbucick Tincture</hi> are sold for <hi>One Shilling Six-Pence,</hi> and yet will serve longer than the other, and is more easie to be carried, 'tis also as useful as that, having the same Virtues which that had in curing the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> and all its complicated Symptoms, which are almost like so many different Diseases. That was only to be taken Spring and Fall; this may be taken at all Times and Seasons of the Year; when Necessity requires take it as follows: A strong Body may take all the <hi>Three Pills</hi> in a Morning alone in the pap of an Apple, Treacle, or Honey. They must take immediately after them, and also now

and then betwixt their workings, a little Posset-Drink, warm Beer, or Water-gruel, for the space of two hours, then eat some little fresh Meat for Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or what is agreeable to the Stomach, that is to say, easie of Digestion. The next Morning take forty drops of the <hi>Tincture</hi> in half a pint or less of Ale, or warm mild Beer; and let such as are afflicted with <hi>Aches</hi> and <hi>Pains</hi> take two pennyworth of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridate</hi> in a little mul'd Sack every third Night, keeping themselves in a breathing Sweat for two or three hours after; but beware of throwing your Bed-cloths off. Keep taking the <hi>Tincture</hi> every Morning, and <hi>Mithridate</hi> in mul'd Sack for <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Aches</hi> every third Night, till the <hi>Tincture</hi> is done, and doubtless you will find much Comfort and Ease thereby. <hi>Note.</hi> This is for those of full Years; but such as are 16 or 18 years old, may take two <hi>Pills</hi> first at once in a Morning, and thirty drops of the <hi>Tincture</hi> the next Morning, and so keep taking thirty drops every Morning in warm Ale till it is done; but for <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Aches,</hi> Sack and Mithridate, as before. Those of 10 or 12 years of Age, may take one <hi>Pill</hi> and twenty drops of the <hi>Tincture</hi> in Ale, as aforesaid. Those from 6 years of Age to 8, may take half a <hi>Pill</hi> and ten drops in Ale, as aforesaid. Children that are under that Age, being Rickety or Weakly, may take a quarter part of a <hi>Pill</hi> and five drops in Ale every Morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> give such a little Milk turn'd with Wine or Beer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sweetned with Sugar, and a little Nutmeg in it. Give them this for their Breakfasts.</p>
               <p>Other young Children that are under two years old, being troubled with <hi>Worms, Wind,</hi> or <hi>Fits,</hi> may take three or four drops in new Milk, sweetned with Honey and a little Juice of Herbegrace, called Rue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

that believe him. Never was the World more pester'd with these Impostors, for they creep now adays into small Villages, telling a Thousand Lies to thrust off their Trash and Trumpery, making the poor ignorant people believe they are the only Men in the World for curing all Distempers incident to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: They commonly take half the Money in hand they agree for, which is more many times than an understanding Phisician would really have for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Cure; nay, they often leave the Patient in a worse Condition than when they first undertook them. On their Stages they give a large account of their great performances in Remote Parts, which, if but throughly known, would be found for the most part as false as the Narration is loud and vociferous. And if at any time they by chance perform a Cure, they are so ignorant, that they cannot give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for such benigne Effects.</p>

               <p>Finally, I give the Honour of the Success of my Labours unto God Almighty, who restores all the Afflicted, if it be his blessed Will, to perfectness of Health, stability of Strength, chearfulness of Mind, and liveliness of Faith, purely out of his free Mercy and Bounty.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I heartily wish that when this our precarious Life is ended, we may all be Elevated to those higher Orbs and Heavenly Mansions of inviolable Happiness, where the Sun shall be no more our Light by Day, nor the Moon by Night, but the Lord our God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main our everlasting Light and Glory, Amen.</p>

            <p>And here observe, that all Actions proceed from some faculty, and that Man being composed of Body and Soul, has two sorts of Faculties, <hi>viz.

            <p>The World was at first a formless Chaos, till God out of the abundance of his Goodness, sent forth his holy Spirit, which Dove-like, with mighty out-spread Wings, sate Brooding on the vast Abyss, and made it pregnant of the World, then Darkness gave place to Light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all the fulgent Lamps of Heaven ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd (as they truly are) Glorious; all Creatures receiv'd their Being, and every Plant, Tree, Herb, and Flower, sprung from the verdant Earth which was raised above the Waters, every thing of use had Seed in it self, or other means to preserve its kind, that a second Creation should never be requisite, but as yet, Man, the Lordly Creature, whose Province was to Rule and Govern the other Creatures, was wanting: He was framed with more Solemnity than all his inferior Creatures, being as it were the Product of mature Council and deliberation, stamp'd after the Divine Similitude, inspir'd with the Breath of Life, and Honour'd with many advantages beyond what any other Animal can pretend to; the contemplating of which, long since made the Royal Prophet break out into this Rapture, <hi>What is Man that thou art mindful of him, and the Son of Man that thou visitest him?

plainly that this glorious Universe, bespangled with sparkling Fires, every where adorn'd with wonderful objects, Proclaming the Wisdom and Omnipotence of its great Workman or Creator, was in Six days made out of an Eternal Privation of Matter by the Omnipotent <hi>Fiat</hi> of God: Hence, because that in Six days, the World, and all that therein is was Created, and because God rested the Seventh day, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably Collected, that in Six Thousand years, which are but as Six days in God's Account, the World shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
