         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To deſcribe that people aright, a man muſt have in him
extraordinary of the Mimmick, and therefore I would deſire
the Reader in the peruſal of theſe Lines, to adde to them
ſomething of action; for it is impoſsible to perſonate a

My requeſt therefore is to all thoſe who ſhall read this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

in Taverns, Ale-houſes, or Coffee-houſes, to have a ſpecial
care therein, that I may not be murthered in my own Lines,
but to adde to it a graceful ſhaking of the head, drawing back
the legs, and thruſting out the ſhoulders, and then it will
be <hi>ala mode France.</hi> If all the humors I have writ of them
do not ſuit patt to the Nation the ſame time you read this,
you muſt impute it to the fickleneſs of thoſe people, whoſe
inconſtancy is ſuch, that let me now write never ſo real a
truth of their Garb or Clothes, though the Author and
Printer make all the haſte imaginable, they will be in another
faſhion before the Book can be publiſhed, that a Taylor may
as well take meaſure of a Garment for the Moon, as an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

               <p>Indeed a Fidler in <hi>France</hi> is a man of a very high repute, for I
remember about five years ago being in your Countrey at a town
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101631:3"/>
not far diſtant from <hi>Orleans,</hi> whileſt I and the reſt of my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
(amongſt which was a <hi>Fille de Joy</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi>) were at Dinner,
there entred into our Room three of theſe uncouth fellows, with
Flats on their heads like cover'd Diſhes, and in ſuch a garb as our
Countrey-men uſe to clothe Poles wherewith to affrighten Crows
from eating their Corn, being for the moſt part pinn'd together,
and the reſt faſtened with here and there a ſtitch, ſo that they
were <hi>a la mode de Tatterdemallion.</hi> At the firſt ſight of them I
caſt one eye on my Cloak, and the other on my Sword, as not
knowing what occaſion I might have of the one, to deſend the
other; for by their inſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

not imagine them to be other than Thieves: but when I took a
more ſtrict ſurvey of their Apparrel, I ſoon alter'd that opinion,
and rather gueſs'd them to be the Excrement of a Priſon, though
it ſoon appeared that I was alike deceived in my thoughts, they
being neither better nor worſe than errant Fidlers. Theſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
though ſuch as we in <hi>England</hi> ſhould not hold worthy of the
Whipping-poſt, without leave, and without reverence on their
parts performed, fell to their work, abuſing our ears with ſuch an
harſh Leſſon, that one of our School-boys playing on the <hi>Jews-Trump</hi>
compared to this, might have been taken for the Muſick
of the Spheres: but as if this had not been puniſhment enough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, they muſt needs adde to it one of their Songs, but then
how did I bleſs my ſelf in the remembrance of our Ballad-ſingers
when they Chant the Tunes of <hi>In Summer time,</hi> and <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Now though I underſtood not French perfectly yet by that little
I had, and the ſimpering of the <hi>Fille de Joy,</hi> I perceived it was
Bawdy, yea, ſuch as could not patiently be endured by any but a
French-man.</p>

               <p>But <hi>Monſieur,</hi> give me leave to proceed in my Story: what to
do to be rid of theſe fellows I knew not, for I knew not how to
call them Rogues handſomly in French, and for other Languages
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101631:3"/>
they underſtood none, and to beat them, they were Villains of
ſuch an inferior quality, as indeed was not worthy of mine or any
honeſt mans anger; a knot of Raſcals ſo infinitely below the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of a Statute, that they would have diſcredited the Stocks;
and to have hang'd them, as it would have hazarded the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Gallowes, ſo it would have been unprofitable to the
Executioner, their Clothes being onely fit for the Rag-woman;
it would have puzzled a man in a whole years time to have ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Vengeance for them which they would not have injured, in
the ſuffering the greateſt torment one could inflict on them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not to hearken to their Ribaldry. But to proceed, after their
Song was ended, one of them pulled a Diſh out of his pocket,
and ſet it before us, into which we were to caſt our Benevolence,
which by cuſtom (you know <hi>Monſieur</hi>) is but but onely a Soll from
every man; ſuch a rare Calling it is to be a Fidler in <hi>France!</hi>

Beard-bruſhes, and Gentle womens Fans; but in other more
ſubſtantial Trades how infinitely ſhort do you come of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh?
Your Cutlers make ſuch abominable and fearful Knives, as
would grieve a mans heart to ſee them, enough almoſt to make
one loathe the Victuals that ſhould be cut by ſuch miſ-ſhapen In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.
And your Glovers are worſe than your Cutlers, for

were made, were cut off by the wriſt. And what excellent work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

did much admire the gallantry of your Nation, thinking no place

There came to viſit a Scotch Lord of my acquaintance a French
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101631:5"/>
Gallant, who had on him a Sute of Turky Grogram doubled
with Taffata, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

Bugle-lace, a Shirt of pure Holland appearing through the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his Doublet, which was likewiſe wrought with curious
Needle-work; the Points at his Waſte and Knees (for ſo the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
there then was) alledged with a Silver-edging; his Garters,
Roſes, and Hat-band ſutable to his Points; a Beaver Hat, and a
pair of Silk-ſtockings; his Cloak alſo of Turky Grogram cut up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
black Taffaty. This man by his Habit I gueſſed to be no leſs
than a Lord, (for who would have imagined <hi>Aeſops</hi> Fable to have
been a real truth, that the Aſs was dreſt up in the Lyons skin)
and according to the man that I imagined him to be, I gave him
the Stile of <hi>My Lord</hi> at every word. After ſome diſcourſe, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me to clap a Handkerchief to my cheek, and to make a kinde
of a ſowre face, asked me what I ailed? I told him I was very
much troubled with the Tooth-ache. Alas, ſaid he, that is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous

and the next morning ſomewhat before the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſent my ſervant for a Barber to trim me and make me neat,
becauſe I could not tell what occaſion I might have of ſeeing his
Lady, or his Daughters. This Meſſenger chanced to happen on
his Lordſhip, who was no other than a Barber; but when I ſaw
him come in with his Apron before him, and pulling a Caſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
out of his pocket, bleſs me! I thought I ſhould have
ſplit my ſelf with laughing, had not the conſideration of my own
folly, of being ſo obeyſant to him the night before, ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
me. His Lordſhip, though he gueſſed the cauſe of my

of a <hi>Quardeſou,</hi> and indeed he was very dexterous in his Art, and

               <p>A Friend and I having a great deſire to ſee the Countrey, we
took Poſt-horſe, intending for <hi>Amiens,</hi> but might as good have
been mounted on a Poſt, as on ſuch Jades; as lean they were as
<hi>Envy</hi> is by the Poets feigned to be, having neither fleſh on their
bones, nor skin on their fleſh, nor hair on their skin; neither was
it ſo alone, that their bones might be numbred through their skin,
but the Spur-galls had made ſuch Caſements in their fleſh, that an
ordinary Farrier might have known what Diſeaſes they were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with, by ſurveying their Entrails. They were very eaſie to
be mounted, and there was no great fear of melting them by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding,
ſurely <hi>Don Quixot</hi>'s <hi>Rozinante</hi> was a horſe of State to
either of theſe. Being thus mounted, and galloping a foot pace,
in twelve hours we had ridden fourteen miles; night coming on,
and a pretty big Town juſt before us, we reſolved to lodge there,
whert enquiring for one of the chief Inns, we were directed to
the skelliton of a Houſe, which in <hi>England</hi> would ſcarcely have
paſſed for an Ale-houſe, and yet there it was an Inn, ay, and an
honorable one too: Alighting at the door, the Hoaſt of the houſe

Ale-houſes are a ſtory higher praiſe worthy than your Inns,
as may appear by the deſcription of this, and by which you may
give a gueſs at the reſt. No ſooner were we alighted, but our
Hoaſt (the ragged fellow I told you of before) conducted us to a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101631:6"/>
room, ſomewhat reſembling a Charnel-houſe, being full as dark
and as dampiſh; on one ſide whereof was a pretty big hole, which
formerly had been a Glaſs-window, but the Glaſs being gone it
was for the moſt part ſtopped up with Peaſe ſtraw: In this room
was the reſemblance of three Beds, for by their deſcription you
will ſay it was improper to call them Beds; the foundation of
them was of ſtraw, which not having been ſhifted in many a year,
it was ſo infinitely thronged together, that the Wooll-packs which
our Judge ſit on in the Parliament, were melted Butter to them.
Upon this lay a large Bag containing a Medley of Flocks and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but ſo ill ordered, that they ſtuck out of the ſides like to the
knobs of a Crab-tree Cudgel; the Sheets on thoſe Beds were
<hi>party per pale,</hi> a mean betwixt white and black, and ſo courſe, that
a Mariner would have diſdained to have uſed them for a Sayl; the
Coverlets were alike anſwerable to the reſt of the Bedding, here
a hole, and there a patch, and for Curtains and Valances, my
Landlady had diſrobed the Beds of them two years before, to make

other part to be finiſhed by us if we would have it; it was enough

               <p>That which to you is ſo pleaſing, ſoon wearied us, wherefore
we took our leaves of them, and proceeded on in our Journey, and
about Noon came to another Town ſomewhat bigger than a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
and comparable to the worſer ſort of Market-Towns in
<hi>England,</hi> diſtant from the place where we lay before, about five
miles, (for we rid very hard, and ſpared not for Horſe-fleſh) here
we reſolved to bait both our ſelves and our horſes, and to that
purpoſe ſingled out an Inn where we expected to finde beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations,
and indeed we thought we had found a great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe,
for there it was our fortune to meet with a Rabbet, larded
it was, as all meat is in that Countrey, otherwiſe it is ſo lean it
would be burnt up ere it could be roaſted, it was ſerved up with
the feet on, and the reaſon of the cuſtom thereof in that Country
is (I conceive) that being a frugal Nation, they would make them
go the further. The ſight of this Diſh gave us great content, but
when we came to eat thereof, it proved ſo tough, that I verily
think it was no more than two removes from that Rabbet which
was in the Ark; but though it proved ſo bad in the eating, the
price thereof was good enough, no leſs than Half a Crown Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.
My Companion thought it to be very dear, but I adjudged
otherwiſe, for certainly the Graſs which fed it was worth more
than eight times the money.</p>

               <p>Now <hi>Monſieur,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak ſomething of what I obſerved of the
women in your Country, and to begin with the Peaſants, as being
moſt in number: They are a ſort of people which cannot ſay the
leaſt claim to any ſhare of beauty, ſo that ſhe which with us is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
amongſt the vulgar, would be amongſt them eſteemed for a
Princeſs, quite contrary to the women in <hi>England,</hi> where you have
many thatched Cottages that harbour ſuch Beauties, as would
tempt <hi>Jupiter</hi> from his Throne to court them in a golden Showre.
Anſwerable to their Beauty is their Attire, their head being wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
about with an old Diſh clout turned out of ſervice, or the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a Table-cloath reſerved from waſhing; the goodneſs of
their faces tells us that that is ſufficient, for why ſhould the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
of their head be handſomer than the fore-part? They have no
need of Masks, and the Bacon-rined colour of their faces tells us
that they were ſtrangers to Bon graces when they were children.
As concerning Petticoats, they have all of them ſuch a kinde of
Garment, but moſt of them ſo ſhort, you would think them cut off
at the Placket; Now when the Parents have worn them till ſuch
time as the rottenneſs of them will ſave a labor of undreſſing, they
are a nevv cut out and fitted for the children, by vvhich time they
have done vvith them, they ſpeed to the dunghil, being ſcorned to
be taken up by the Rag-vvoman. For ſhooes and ſtockings they
take no great care for, few of them ever had above one pair in all
their lives, and vvhich they vvear every day, being very durable.
In this degree hath Nature placed them, and the greateſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that they do enjoy, is that they are contented vvith the ſame.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Engliſh-man.</speaker>
               <p>Well, next I will ſpeak ſomthing of the middle ſort of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
or ſuch as live in Cities and great Towns, (for I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to mention the Court, as being above my ſphere) of theſe
ſort of women there is much difference from the Peaſants; but
in what? ſurely nothing but in attire, otherwiſe Nature hath
not been over prodigal to them for beauty, ſo that <hi>Don Quixot</hi>
did not ſo deſervedly aſſume to himſelf the title of <hi>The Knight
of the ill favoured face,</hi> as they may that of the <hi>Damoſels</hi> of it;
The moſt comly and beſt proportioned part about them is their
hands, long, white, and ſlender; but ſcarce ſhall you ſee one
of a hundred, whoſe wriſts, and betwixt their fingers is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
all over-run with a ſcab like to a leproſie. Their diſpoſitions
hold good correſpondency with their faces, and ſuit as well as
a Toaſt and Nutmeg doth with a pot of Ale in the depth of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
all which you will ſwear to be truth, when you once come
but to hear them ſpeak; no better Character being to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
of them, then from their prating, which is ſo tedious
and infinite, that you ſhall ſooner want ears than they Tongues;
ſet but their Tongues once a going, and they are like to a
Watch, you need not winde them up above once in twelve hours,
for ſo long will the Thread of their diſcourſe be in ſpinning,
ſuch everlaſting Talkers are they all, that they will ſooner
want breath then words, there being no wayes to ſilent them,
but only to go out of their Companies. But were this only to
ſome of their Familiars, it were the more tolerable, but ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or acquaintance, all is one, though indeed no man is to
them a ſtranger, for in two houres time you ſhall have them as
familiar, and as merry with you, as if you had been of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
ſeven yeares, or bred up in a houſe together ever
ſince you were born; Now though I cannot condemn any of
them of diſhoneſty, as having had no ſuch experience of them,
yet to an Engliſhman ſuch ſudden affability argues ſomwhat of
a confident boldneſs, to ſay no worſe. I remember, the firſt
time I came to <hi>London,</hi> being but a young Novice, ſcarcely wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <p>Then to proceed in my ſtory concerning the French women.
They are abundantly full of laughter and toying, and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in ſtore ſome laſcivious ſongs, which they refuſe not to
ſing in any company, ſo that a ſtranger would think modeſty
were quite baniſhed the Kingdom, or rather that it had never
been there; and whereas women in other Countrys are moſt
aſhamed to diſcourſe of thoſe parts which makes them women.
Theſe French Dames will talk of them, even before men, as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101631:10"/>
broadly as a Midwife, or a Barber-Surgeon. So that if that ſaying
be true, that <hi>Modeſty is the beſt apparel of a woman,</hi> I doubt many
of the Female ſex in <hi>France,</hi> muſt go thinly clad, and a great many
of them quite naked.</p>

               <p>Truly I ſaw but little difference amongſt them, it is an
Epidemical diſeaſe, both Maids and Wives, Madams and
Damoſels, Rich and Poor, alike ſick of it, if there were any
difference, it was onely in this, that thoſe who were higheſt in
their places and callings, were likewiſe higheſt in this lightſom

have been always addicted too much to your Apiſh faſhions, ſo
in our late times, when Rebellion was rampant, had they got
too much of your unworthy cuſtom of ſpeaking irreverently of
their King; but I hope that cuſtom is out of uſe with us now.
I wiſh it were ſo in <hi>France;</hi> where ſcarce a day paſſeth without
ſome ſeditious Pamphlet printed and publiſhed, in diſgrace of
the King, or ſome of his Courtiers; the Contents of which
Libels they will not ſpare to ſpeak of in each place where they
come; take them from this, (which you can hardly do till
they have told all) and then they fall upon their ribaldry, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating

and how your Gentlemens tables furniſhed, which though
they come not nigh ours, yet are they beyond compariſon
above the Paiſants. Their Beef they cut out into little chops,
ſo ſmal, that what goes there for a laudable diſh, would be
thought here to be a Univerſity Commons, now ſerved
from the hatch. A loyne of Mutton ſerve amongſt them for
three roaſtings, beſides the hazard of making pottage with
the Rump. They have likewiſe ſtore of Fowl, but ſuch
as the King found in <hi>Scotland,</hi> viz. foule napkins, foule
table cloaths, &amp;c. but to ſpeak truth, that which they have is
ſufficient for Nature and a friend, were it not for the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101631:13"/>
ſtrange miſteries of the Kitching-wench. Their Cooks are
much famed for rare fellows, but their skill conſiſts not in
the handling of Beef, Mutton, and ſuch like ſolid meats,
but in the making of puff-paſtes, kickſhaws, and ſuch fine
devices, onely to fill the pallat, but not the belly, and ſo
by conſequence would make rare fellows in a Garriſon, to cozen
the belly, and feed the eye. Now if you can digeſt the ſluttiſhneſs
of the Cookery of (which is moſt abominable at the firſt fight)
ſit down and welcome, where you muſt ſay your own Grace,
private Graces being there as ordinary as private Maſſes, and
from whence (perhaps) they learned them. Grace ended,
fall to where you like beſt, for they obſerve no order nor
method in their eating, and if you expect a to have Carver, you
may riſe a hungry; thus are their Tables furniſhed, and

Executioner had ſmitten off his head, he caught it in his arms, and
ran with it down the Hill as faſt as his legs would carry him; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
run thus half a mile he ſat down and reſted, and ſo he did nine
times in all, (you muſt conceive he was very heavy loaden to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
his head in his arms) but having ran three miles, he ran himſelf
quite out of breath, for then he fell down and died, over which
place was built this Church conſecrated to his Memory wherein
the aforeſaid Reliques are kept.</p>

               <p>Yes <hi>Monſieur,</hi> I ſhall tell you of a piece of Civility of one of
your Madams, as I was informed by an Acquaintance of mine
who was an Eye-witneſs to it. That being at a Tilting, a Roguiſh
Boy was peeking under a Ladies Coats, a Courtier ſeeing it, went
about to remove him from that ſawcy action: but when her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip
perceived his intention, ſhe hindred him with this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
<hi>Laiſſe Monſieur, laiſſe les yeux ne ſont pas larrons:</hi> The

               <p>I will not deny but there may be ſome of them very conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
but generally they are moſt irreverent and irreligious;
great Scoffers, yea in matters of Religion, and at thoſe times
when they ſhould be moſt ſolid, witneſs that Gallant who lying
on his Death-bed, when he had the <hi>Hoaſt</hi> (ſo they call the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lords Supper) brought to him by a Lubberly Prieſt,
he ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt came to him, as he went into</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>riding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
upon an Aſs.</hi> Another of them being to receive the Sacrament,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101631:15"/>
when the Prieſt had with many words perſwaded him that the
Bread and Wine was the real Body and Blood of Chriſt, he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to taſte of it, becauſe it was then Fryday. And I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by a Gentleman, that at a Maſs in the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> Church in
<hi>Paris,</hi> he ſaw two French Papiſts, when the moſt ſacred Myſtery
of their Faith was celebrating, break out into ſuch a blaſphemous
and atheiſtical laughter, that even an <hi>Ethnick</hi> would have bluſhed
to have heard it. Can we then think theſe men to be religious,
who make a ſcoff at the Divine Myſteries of our Salvation? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
had a <hi>Lutheran</hi> done this, ſome French hot-head or other,
would have ſent them laughing to <hi>Pluto.</hi>

               <p>I remember dat old woman very well, who was of ſuch an age,
that it is queſtionable whether ſhe were ever young or no: for,
but that I have read the Scriptures, otherwiſe I ſhould have been
apt to have believed that ſhe was one of the firſt Pieces of the
Creation, and that by ſome miſchance or other ſhe had ſcaped
the Flood: Our Countrey-man <hi>Tom. Parr</hi> the <hi>Salopian Wonder,</hi>
was but an Infant to her; at the leaſt you could not but have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
her one of the Reliques of the firſt Age after the building of
<hi>Babel,</hi> ſeveral Ages before the birth of the <hi>Wandring Jew;</hi> her
face was for all the world like unto that of <hi>Sibylla Erythrea</hi> in an
old Print, or like that of <hi>Solomons</hi> two Harlets in the Painted
Cloth, or like thoſe Statuas on the out-ſide of <hi>Weſtminſter Abbey,</hi>
which for theſe ſix hundred years have been expoſed to winde and
weather. It is doubtful whether our Arch Poet <hi>Ed. Spenſer,</hi> when
he writ his Poem of <hi>The Ruines of Time,</hi> did not purpoſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it of her; ſure I am it is very appliable in the Title. Now
by reaſon that all her Teeth were out, her Tongue was boundleſs,
and without ceaſing would move for ſix and twenty hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet,
the faſtidious pratler which <hi>Horace</hi> mentioneth in his <hi>Ninth
Satyr,</hi> was but a Poiſne to her. Now whether ſhe be living ſtill,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101631:16"/>
or no, I know not, but if ſhe once come to be ſpeechleſs, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſhe is then paſt all recovery.</p>

               <p>Well <hi>Monſieur,</hi> onely one word before you go, and then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.
There is an old Proverb, that the Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> is
<hi>Rex Regom,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is <hi>Rex Hominem,</hi> the King of
<hi>France Rex Aſinorum,</hi> and the King of <hi>England Rex Diabalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
The Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> is called <hi>Rex Regem,</hi> in reſpect
of having ſo many free Princes under him, who have power of
themſelves to Coyn Money, raiſe Soldiers, and other Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
conſenant to Regal Authority. The King of <hi>Spain Rex Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem,</hi>
for that his Subjects are ſo conſtant and faithful in their
Allegiance, not queſtioning what the Prince does, but obeying
becauſe he ſo commands it. The King of <hi>France</hi> is called <hi>Rex
Aſinorum,</hi> becauſe of the Subjects patient bearing of thoſe inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
Taxes which he ſucks out of their ſweat and blood. Pride
in matters of Sumptuouſneſs, and the Civil Wars which laſted a
long time in that Countrey, having occaſioned moſt of the Crown
Lands to have been ſold or mortgaged, ſo that the Subject is
now onely the Revenue of the Crown. The Kings hand lying ſo
heavy upon them, that it hath almoſt thruſt them into an <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
bondage: To recite all thoſe Impoſitions which this miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
people are afflicted withal, were almoſt as wretched as the
payment of them, I ſhall briefly inſtance in ſome few, and firſt
<hi>Gabelle de Sel,</hi> or Gabel on Salt, which is an Impoſition that no
man in the Kingdom (ſome few Countries excepted) can eat any
Salt, but he muſt buy it of the King, and at his price; but this
is not all, for though through poverty many of them could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to eat meat (when they can get it) without Salt, yet are
they forced to take ſuch a quantity of it, or howſoever they will
have of them ſo much money. This Impoſition is exacted with
ſuch unconſcionable rigour, that it is thought to be worth unto
the King 3000000 of Crowns yearly. Next is the <hi>Taillon,</hi> a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101631:16"/>
heavy burthen which lies almoſt altogether upon the poor Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
who are a people of any other the moſt unfortunate, paying
ſuch infinite Rents to their Lords, and ſuch innumerable Taxes
to the King, that all their care and extream labour is onely ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to pay their Duties, and keep them from the extremities of
cold and famine. This Impoſition was at firſt levyed by way of
Extraordinary Subſidy, and lay alike heavy upon all, but now it is
confined onely to the Peaſant; the greater Towns, the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Kings Houſe, the Officers of War, the Preſident,
Councellors, and Officers of the Courts of Parliament, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
the Clergy, and the Scholars of the Univerſity, being freed
from it. Divers Impoſts have they beſides, as the Soll upon the
Liure, which is the twentieth penny of all things bought or ſold,
onely <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Sallets</hi> excepted. Impoſts upon Wine double and
treble, and after all this, the poor Vintner forced to pay the 8th
penny of that Wine which he ſelleth, to the King. Then is there
beſides Impoſts on all ſorts of Fruits, Proviſions, Wares, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,
to which we may adde the baſe and corrupt money in it,
being for the moſt part made of Tin and Braſs. Hardly ſhall you
ſee a Piece of Gold of the French ſtamp, ſcarce any but what
comes out of <hi>Spain,</hi> which are very ill proportioned, and which
one reſembles to a French Cheeſe, being neither long, nor ſquare,
nor round, nor thick, nor thin, nor great, nor little, nor any one
of theſe, but yet all, and yet none of them.</p>
               <p>Theſe Circumſtances conſidered, we may the clearer ſee our
own felicities, which to expreſs in a word, is to ſay onely this,
<hi>That the Engliſh Subject is in no circumſtance a French man,</hi> though
we are ſo blinde as herein not to ſee our own happineſs, but by
our often Rebellions have given occaſion to that Apellation, that
the King of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>Rex Diabalorum.</hi>
