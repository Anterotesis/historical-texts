            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>MEeting accidentally with this <hi>Poem</hi> in
Manuscript, and being informed
that it was a Piece of the incomparable
Mr. <hi>AC</hi>'s, I thought it unjust to hide
such a <hi>Treasure</hi> from the World. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd
that our Author in his Preface to
his <hi>Works,</hi> makes mention of some <hi>Poems</hi>
written by him on the <hi>late Civil War,</hi> of
which the following Copy is questionably a
part. In his most imperfect and unfinish'd
<hi>Pieces,</hi> you will discover the Hand of so great
<pb facs="tcp:61183:3"/>
a Master. And (whatever his own Modesty
might have advised to the contrary) there is not
one careless stroke of his but what should be kept
sacred to Posterity. He could write nothing
that was not worth the preserving, being ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually
a <hi>Poet</hi> and <hi>Always Inspired.</hi> In
this Piece the Iudicious Reader will find the
Turn of the Verse to be his; the same Copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Lively Imagery of <hi>Fancy,</hi> the same
Warmth of <hi>Passion</hi> and Delicacy of <hi>Wit</hi> that
sparkles in all his <hi>Writings.</hi> And certainly
no Labours of a <hi>Genius</hi> so Rich in its self, and
so Cultivated with <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi>
can prove an unwelcome <hi>Present</hi> to the
<hi>World.</hi>

divide,</l>
            <l>More than the Seas from all the</l>
            <l>World beside.</l>
            <l>From every part the roaring Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
play,</l>
            <l>From every part Blood roars as loud as they.</l>
            <l>What <hi>English</hi> Ground but still some Moisture bears,</l>
            <l>Of Young Mens Blood, and more of Mothers Tears.</l>
            <l>What Airs unthickened with the Sighs of Wives,</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61183:4"/>
Alas, what Triumphs can this Victory shew,</l>
            <l>That dies us Red in Blood and Blushes too!</l>
            <l>How can we wish that Conquest, which bestows</l>
            <l>Cypress, not Bays, upon the Conquering Brows,</l>
            <l>It was not so when <hi>Henry</hi>'s dreadful Name,</l>
            <l>Not Sword, nor Cause, whole Nations overcame.</l>
            <l>To farthest West did his swist Conquests run,</l>
            <l>Nor did his Glory set but with the Sun.</l>
            <l>In vain did <hi>Roderic</hi> to his Hold retreat,</l>
            <l>In vain had wretched <hi>Ireland</hi> call'd him Great.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ireland!</hi> which now most basely we begin</l>
            <l>To labour more to lose than he to win,</l>
            <l>It was not so when in the happy East,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Richard</hi> our <hi>Mars, Venus</hi>'s Isle possest.</l>
            <l>'Gainst the proud Moon, he the <hi>English</hi> Cross display'd,</l>
            <l>Ecclips'd one Horn, and the other paler made.</l>
            <l>When our dear Lives we ventured bravely there,</l>
            <l>And digg'd our own to gain Christs Sepulchre.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61183:4"/>
That sacred Tomb which should we now enjoy,</l>
            <l>We should with as much zeal fight to destroy.</l>
            <l>The precious Signs of our dead Lord we scorn,</l>
            <l>And see his Cross worse than his Body torn.</l>
            <l>We hate it now both for the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Iew,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To us 'tis Folishness and Scandal to.</l>
            <l>To what with Worship the fond Papist falls,</l>
            <l>That the fond Zealot a cursed Idol calls.</l>
            <l>So, 'twixt their double Madness here's the odds,</l>
            <l>One makes false Devils, t'other makes false Gods.</l>
            <l>It was not so when <hi>Edward</hi> proved his Cause,</l>
            <l>By a Sword stronger than the <hi>Salique</hi> Laws.</l>
            <l>Tho setched from <hi>Pharamond,</hi> when the <hi>French</hi> did fight,</l>
            <l>With Womens Hearts against the Womens Right.</l>
            <l>The afflicted Ocean his first Conquest bore,,</l>

            <l>As if he had Angry with that Element been,</l>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61183:5"/>
Where's now that spirit with which at <hi>Cressey</hi> we,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Poictiers</hi> forced from fate a Victory?</l>
            <l>Two Kings at once we brought sad Captives home,</l>
            <l>A Triumph scarcely known to ancient <hi>Rome;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Two Foreign Kings, but now alas we strive,</l>
            <l>Our own, our own good Soveraign to Captive!</l>
            <l>It was not so when <hi>Agincourt</hi> was won,</l>
            <l>Under great <hi>Henry</hi> served the Rain and Sun,</l>
            <l>A Nobler Fight the Sun himself ne'r knew,</l>
            <l>Not when he stop'd his Course a Fight to view!</l>
            <l>Then Death's old Archer did more skilful grow,</l>
            <l>And learned to shoot more sure from th' <hi>English</hi> bow;</l>
            <l>Then <hi>France</hi> was her own story sadly taught,</l>
            <l>And felt how Caesar and how <hi>Edward</hi> fought.</l>
            <l>It was not so when that vast Fleet of <hi>Spain,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Lay torn and scatter'd on the <hi>English</hi> Main;</l>

To her great <hi>Neptune</hi> Homaged all his Streams</l>
            <l>And all the wide-stretched Ocean was her <hi>Thames.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Thus our Fore-Fathers Fought, Thus bravely bled,</l>
            <l>Thus still they live, whil'st we alive are dead;</l>
            <l>Such Acts they did that <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> too,</l>
            <l>Might Envy those, whom once they did subdue.</l>
            <l>We're not their off-spring, sure our Heralds Lie,</l>

            <l>Some <hi>Cadmus</hi> sure sow'd <hi>Serpents</hi> teeth for us;</l>
            <l>We could not else by mutual Fury fall,</l>

Such years, as if Earths youth Return'd had been,</l>
            <l>And that old Serpent Time had Cast his Skin:</l>
            <l>As Gloriously, and Gently did they move,</l>
            <l>As the bright Sun that Measures them above;</l>
            <l>Then onely in Books the Learn'd could misery see,</l>
            <l>And the Unlearned ne're heard of Misery.</l>
            <l>Then happy <hi>Iames</hi> with as deep Quiet Reigned,</l>

            <l>And least this blessing with his Life should Cease,</l>
