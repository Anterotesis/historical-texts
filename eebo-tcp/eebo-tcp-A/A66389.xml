            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DECLARATION
OF THE
Sense of the Archbishops,
and Bishops,
Now in and about London, upon the Occasion
of their Attendance in Parliament,</head>
            <head type="sub">Concerning the Irregular and Scandalous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of certain Clergie-men, at the Execution
of Sir JOHN FREIND and Sir
WILLIAM PARKINS.</head>
            <p>WE the Archbishops and
Bishops, now in and about
<hi>London</hi> upon occasion of our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
in <hi>Parliament,</hi> having seen a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64748:4"/>
Printed Paper, Entituled, <hi>A true Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of the Papers delivered by Sir</hi> John
Freind <hi>and Sir</hi> William Parkins <hi>to the
Sheriffs of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Middlesex,
<hi>at</hi> Tyburn <hi>the place of Execution,</hi> April
3. 1696. And being also certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the most irregular beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Snatt,</hi> in pretending to <hi>Absolve</hi>
the said Criminals at their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to the great scandal of the
Church, and of our holy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
have therefore thought our
selves obliged to Declare our Sense
of the same, as here followeth.</p>
            <p>1. As to the Paper before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
we cannot but observe,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64748:4"/>
that in that part to which Sir <hi>John
Freind</hi> is Entituled, among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things there delivered as his
private Opinion, (for which we
must leave him to God) there are
mingled some things concerning
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to the great
dishonour and reproach of it. That
venerable Name is, by the Author
of that Paper, appropriated to that
part of our Church which hath
separated it self from the Body;
and more particularly, to a Faction
of them who are so furiously bent
upon the restoring of the late King,
that they seem not to regard by
what means it is to be effected. We
have a sad instance of it in this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64748:5"/>
very Person, who (as was deposed
at his Tryal) was privy to the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Design of <hi>Assassination,</hi> and yet
neither discovered it, nor shewed
any dislike of it, but as <hi>he was afraid
it might ruine King</hi> James <hi>and his</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Tryal p. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;</hi>
and was ready also, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with others of the same
<hi>Christian Principle</hi> (as the Author of
his Paper is bold to call it,) to Act
in Conjunction with an Army of
<hi>French</hi> Papists, for the Ruine of
their Country, and the Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Religion which they
themselves do profess.</p>
            <p>2. As for Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi>
who also professed to dy in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64748:5"/>
Communion of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
We cannot think he meant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing elseby it, than that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to the same violent Faction:
being assured (as we are by very
good Information,) that both he
and <hi>Sir John Freind</hi> had withdrawn
themselves from our Publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
some time before their
death. Which makes us the less
wonder to find in both their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
so light, and even favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
a mention of that most In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
Design of Assassinating
his Sacred Majesty: and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that of <hi>Sir William Parkins,</hi>
who, though he was publickly
convicted of his having engaged
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64748:6"/>
so many in that horrible Sin, yet
after all could think to clear
himself of it with this wretched
excuse: <hi>'Tis true, I was privy to the
Design upon the Prince, but was not to
Act in it.</hi> Blessed be God, there
never was any of our Church,
that in any change of times
could have this laid to his charge,
that he was so much as <hi>privy</hi> to a
Design of Assassination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> For those Clergymen
that took upon them to absolve
these Criminals at the place of
Execution, by laying, all three
together, their hands upon their
heads, and publickly pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64748:6"/>
a Form of Absolution; as
their manner of doing this was
extremely insolent, and without
Precedent, either in our Church,
or any other that we know of,
so the thing it self was altogether
irregular.</p>
            <p>The Rubrick in our Office of
the Visitation of the sick, from
whence they took the words they
then used, and upon which, if
upon any thing in our Liturgy,
they must ground this their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
gave them no Authority
nor no Pretence for the absolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Persons; nay, as they
managed the affair, they acted in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64748:7"/>
this Absolution far otherwise than
is there directed.</p>
            <p>That Rubrick is concerning sick
Persons, and it is there required,
<hi>First,</hi> That <hi>the sick person shall be moved
to make a special confession of his Sins, if
he feel his conscience troubled with any weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
matter, and then, after such confession,
the Priest shall absolve him, if he humbly
and heartily desire it.</hi> But here they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
and that publickly, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
condemned by Law for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable
Crimes, without so much
as once <hi>moving</hi> them at that time to
make a <hi>special confession of their sins,</hi> at
least for those Sins for which they
were condemned. And on the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64748:7"/>
other side, here were persons Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
that did not humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
Absolution, as <hi>feeling</hi> any such
<hi>weighty Matter</hi> to <hi>trouble</hi> their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;</hi>
but on the contrary, in Sir
<hi>John Freind</hi>'s Paper it is declared
that he had a great deal of <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in suffering</hi> for that cause,
which he firmly believed to be
<hi>the Cause of God, and True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If these Ministers knew not
the State of these Mens Souls
before they gave them Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as it is manifest two of them,
Mr. <hi>Snatt</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> did not,
as to Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> (they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64748:8"/>
having since declared that they
had not spoke with <hi>Sir William</hi>
till they were at the place of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,)
how could they, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
manifest Transgression of
the Churches Order, as well as
the prophane abuse of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>Christ</hi> hath left with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
absolve them from all
their Sins?</p>
            <p>If they were acquainted with
these Mens Sentiments decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in their Papers, then they
must look upon them, either
as hardened <hi>Impenitents,</hi> or as
<hi>Martyrs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:64748:8"/>
We are so charitable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that they would not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
them under the former
Notion; for that had been, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
sealing them to Damnation:
But if they held these men to
be <hi>Martyrs,</hi> then their absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them in that manner was
a Justification of those grievous
Crimes for which these men suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
and an open affront to
the Laws both of Church and
State.</p>
            <p>Upon the Consideration of
these Things, and for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Right to our Church,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64748:9"/>
which may otherwise suffer, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
such as are strangers to
our Constitution, by the evil
Principles and Practices, both
of the aforesaid Criminals, and
the Three Clergy-men that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
them, who all pretended
to be Members of the Church of
<hi>England:</hi> We do declare, That
we disown and detest all such
Principles and Practices; look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon them as highly Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
and Seditious; dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
both to the Church and
State, and contrary to the True
Doctrine and Spirit of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion. And we also take
this occasion to warn and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64748:9"/>
all the People committed
to our Charge, to beware of such
Seducers, and to avoid them; lest
(as the Apostle <hi>St. Peter</hi> speaks)
<hi>they be led away with the error of the
Wicked,</hi> and fall from their sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
Adherence to the Principles
of the True Church of <hi>England,</hi>
as it was established at the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Reformation of Religion,
and as by Gods especial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it continues to this day.</p>
