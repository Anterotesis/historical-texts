            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ACCOUNT

PARLIAMENT
BY THE
<hi>Ministers</hi> sent by them to OXFORD.</p>
            <p>In which you have the most remarkable passages
which have fallen out in the six Moneths service there,
divers Questions concerning the Covenant of Grace, Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp;c. are briefly stated.</p>
            <p>Particularly, there is presented two Conferences, in
which the Ministers together with the truth, have
suffered by reproaches and falshoods in print and otherwise.</p>
            <p>The chief points insisted on in those Conferences are,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Whether private men might lawfully Preach.</item>
               <item>2. Whether the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were Antichristian.
Both which Questions were disputed, Objections answered, and the
Truth confirmed.</item>
               <item>3. And lastly, Divers of <hi>M. Erbury's</hi> dangerous errours which he broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and maintained, are recited and refuted.</item>

The Right Honourable
THE
LORDS and COMMONS
Assembled in High Court
OF
PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen you descended so low, as to make
choice of us to Preach to the learned V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity
and famous City of OXFORD,
wee durst not performe blind obedience,
wee consulted God and our consciences,
our friends and Brethren; we looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the service as a taske <hi>par animo Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dri,</hi>
and our friends looked upon our obedience to your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<hi>tanquam obedientiae prodigium.</hi> Wee considered that
GOD doth usually make use of weake instruments in
great and high services, that all the glory may be ascribed
to God alone, to whom all the glory is due, because <hi>he works
all our works in us and for us.</hi> We came hither with selfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
thoughts, being confident that God who called us to
a new service, would give us new abilities, and raise our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
as high as our work. We know each impotent creature
moved by the instinct of nature, doth adventure upon its own
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45459:3"/>
particular hurt for the general good. Philosophy hath taught
us that we must not love what is good upon private grounds,
with respect to our own particular interest, or private good;
and experience tels us, that great things have been brought to
passe by weak and inconsiderable means. We are ashamed to
be outvied by the gallantry of that noble Queen, who with
resolution above her sex cryed out magnanimously, <hi>If I perish,
I perish:</hi> we resolved therefore to run any course (and deprive
our selves of that sweet content we took in more retired em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
more sutable to our abilities) that the publique
might be more furthered, and God more honoured, though
we had perished in the work:<note place="margin">Naz. Orat 20.</note> this is (as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> speaks)
the law of Martyrdome, neither to seek danger, nor feare it.</p>
            <p>It is now requisite that we should in this our last moneth,
give you some account of this halfe years service; our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
will assure you, that we have been true to our principles,
and you know we were sent <hi>to beare witnesse to the truth.</hi> We
must needs subscribe to that zealous expression of <hi>Zuinglius,
Quas non oportet mortes praeligere—imò in quam profundam
inferni abyssum non intrare, quàm contra conscientiam attestari?</hi>
It is more desirable to go to hell, then to witnesse any thing
against our conscience.<note place="margin">Anno 1253.</note> 
               <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> relates a story of one
that was not afraid to speak the truth upon his death-bed.
<hi>The Fryers,</hi> saith he, <hi>and the Prelates are all Hereticks; the
Fryers for not reproving the Prelates, and the Prelates for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
Benefices upon unworthy persons.</hi> We have spoken as if
we had been upon our <hi>death-beds,</hi> sure we are, they will not
pronounce us guilty of the Fryers Heresie.</p>
            <p>The corruptions of men do many times by an over-ruling
providence prove the occasions of fulfilling the promises of
God; lies are made subservient to truth, and envy to charity,
by the wise disposall of the God of Heaven: a sweet experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereof we his despised servants have met withall in
the result of the ensuing conferences, touching which we find
men of different minds. Some of deep judgement and (as we
hope) good affections, do much wonder why the Ministers
sent down by the Paaliament to <hi>Oxford,</hi> would condescend to
dispute with men who have not skill either to discerne the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45459:3"/>
strength of others arguments, or the weakenesse of their own
answers, much lesse the sufficiency of answers given to their
reasons for satisfaction. It will be requisite therfore to lay
downe the grounds and reasons which moved the Ministers
then present, to yeeld to any such private meetings at their
first coming to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, they found the Vniversity &amp; City much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and divers hopefull men in both, very much unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
they perceived that it was not possible to instruct, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
reforme, and settle even ingenuous men, unlesse there
were some private exercise allowed in which they might
have some freindly conference, without any wrangling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
with these unsetled but hopefull men.</p>
            <p>It was far from the intention of the Ministers upon the
place,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 1.</note> 
               <hi>to receive such as were weake in the faith to doubtfull dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations,</hi>
notwithstanding they knew themselves obliged <hi>to
beare the infirmities of the weake,</hi> and durst not please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
no nor others, any further then might make for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They did not thinke themselves too high for commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and fellowship of ordinary saints, much lesse did they
conceive themselves <hi>Lords of the peoples faith;</hi> they knew that
the ablest Ministers may be established and comforted by the
experiments of grown Christians,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 11, 12.</note> for even the Apostle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
desires,<note place="margin">Modeste signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficans se non minus paratum esse consolatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem &amp; aedifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem ex eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum fide capere, quám ex suâ ipsius praebere. Dickson in loc. &amp; D. Selater <hi>on Rom.</hi> 1. 12.</note> that he and his Romans <hi>might be comforted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the mutuall faith of one another;</hi> and therefore howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it would in a rationall way have seemed more for their
advantage to have admitted none to the meeting but prudent
and well accomplished Christians, and more agreeable to
reason, <hi>to let every one bear his owne burthen,</hi> and to converse
with those onely who are not burthensome, but helpefull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
strong Christians, yet they did know it is their duty to
help others and deny themselves, to support the weake, and
beare with their weaknesse, and not seek to please themselves,
but Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 1.</note> who commands them to beare the infirmities of
the weake, and forbids them to please themselves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1.
and hereupon though they foresaw that this exercise would
load them with unpleasing burthens and censures, <hi>yet they
resolved not to please themselves, but to pleasure even weake
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45459:4"/>
Christians for their good to edification, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Christ pleased not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover the Ministers were assured that there were some
weak Christians, who would be very willing to give them a
private meeting, but would by no means be perswaded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
to the Parish-Churches, the constant place of publique
meetings; now the Ministers thought fit that these <hi>weak bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
for whom Christ dyed</hi> should be tenderly respected, and
not given over as <hi>lost sheepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides there were some of the Vniversity who had been
taught that there were certain vacuities in the Morall law,
that Christ was a Priest after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vide Tertullia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Apologet. Minut. Foel. Plinij Ep. &amp;c. Conventus bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum non est factio sed Curia,</note> that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation
of Gospell-graces and sincere obedience to the
whole Gospell make men capable of the pardon of sin, and do
as conditions qualifie beleevers for justification, &amp;c. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
therefore are not ashamed to professe that the intent
of their meeting was not only to satisfie scrupulous men, and
resolve cases of conscience, a service of no mean concernment,
and such as could not be performed in a satisfactory way
without a conference; but they desired to set up a kind of
Catechisme Lecture, <hi>by way of conference,</hi> and that the rather
because they knew all that stood in need of catechising, would
not brook the ordinary way of catechising <hi>by Question and
Answer,</hi> the first being esteemed more friendly and familiar,
and this latter accounted (by men as proud as they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant)
too Magisteriall.</p>
            <p>The Ministers saw it necessary to lay downe the first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the doctrin of Christ, namely the foundation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
from dead works, and faith towards God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
they did clearly explain the doctrins of justificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and Regeneration, they did set open the treasures of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, and shew unto the people by what means they
might get an interest in Christ; by what evidences they might
clear that interest, and how they might improve it to their
best advantage, <hi>Therefore seeing they have this Ministry they
faint not, but renounce the hidden things of dishonesty (which
might put them to shame) not walking in craftinesse nor handling
the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45459:4"/>
have commended themselves to every mans conscience in the fight
of God, 2 Cor.</hi> 4, 1. 2. And that the Gospel which they haue
vindicated may not be hid, they published Propositions or
<hi>Theses</hi> to the world, which they did assert and evince by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable
Arguments at their severall exercises from the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
<hi>September</hi> till the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may please further to understand; there were severall
Rules for the better regulating of these meetings.</p>
            <p>1. That the Ministers deputed to state the point and keep
order, should begin and conclude the exercise with prayer.</p>
            <p>2. That the Principlall question should be propounded a
Week before it was stated and determined, that every one
might upon mature deliberation deliver his judgement, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
for the edification of the company that met.</p>
            <p>3. That such Questions only should be propounded as did
tend to the clearing of some weighty point of faith, worship,
or obedience, that all niceties and subtilties might be waved,
and that Truth which is according to godlinesse manifested
and maintained.</p>
            <p>4. That nothing should be begun or carried on in that
meeting through strife or vain-glory, but all proceedings
should be in lowlinesse of mind and brotherly love, that they
might in honour prefer one another and shew that each did
esteem another better then himselfe.</p>
            <p>5. That no man should be interrupted, unlesse he seemed
tediously impertinent to him who was appointed to keep
order.</p>
            <p>6. That none should advance this or any other private
metting in opposition to, or contempt of publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but every one be carefull to benefit himselfe by this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
that he might be the better prepared for all solemn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
service, and ordinances in publique.</p>
            <p>The Apostles made it their businesse by teaching from house
to house, in private to prepare Christians for publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and to unite them that they might with zeal and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse
<hi>continue, 1. In the doctrine delivered by the Apostles:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. Whether all the sins of beleevers past, present,
and to come, are in Justification at once and in one sentence
pardoned?</p>
            <p>1. By that sentence whereby a beleever is declared righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in the sight of God, for and in the righteousnesse of Jesus
Christ bestowed on him, his sins are freely remitted unto him,
and he stands discharged in the sight of God from the guilt of
them, and from the condemnation which the law pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
against them, <hi>Rom. 4. 6. Hebr.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
            <p>2. Guilt of sin may be considered two wayes,
<list>
                  <item>1. As it cleaveth to sin and importeth a deserving of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and this is every where, where sin is; even
in the godly themselves, <hi>Psal. 143. 2. Psal.</hi> 130. 3.</item>
                  <item>2. As it redounds to the person, actually subjecting him
to the curse.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>3. Though every sin whatsoever be in its own nature dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and so might bind the person under wrath and the
curse, yet no sin doth actually subject any person under wrath
and the Curse, but that which is committed while he is under
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45459:6"/>
the law, and before he is under grace, for it is the law which
worketh wrath, <hi>Rom. 4. 15. Rom. 6. 14. Rom.</hi> 8. 1.</p>
            <p>4. Sin cannot properly be said to be pardoned to a person
before it be committed, for where sin is not, guilt is not; and
where guilt is not on a person, it cannot be said by a pardon
to be removed from him: but the sins of an unregenerate man
when he is justified are actually pardoned, that is, the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the person under wrath by reason of these sins is taken
off from him, and he translated under grace; and the sinnes
which he commits after regeneration so far forth as they have
any kind of guilt in them, so far forth they may be said to be
still forgiven to him, <hi>Mich. 7. 18. Psalme</hi> 51. 9.</p>
            <p>For understanding whereof we may note,</p>
            <p>1. That as sin is damnable in it self, so where it continues
to be, it would continue to damne, if the pardon once given,
should not likewise be continued to the person to whom it is
given. Now these are two things and two acts of grace; to
Justifie a person, and to continue the Grace of Justification to
him; for God might (if such had been his pleasure) pardon sin
past, and leave a sinner under the power of sin in case he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it afterward, to bring a new guilt upon him unto
death, as of it self it is apt to do: so that as a stone in a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is of it self apt to fall downward, and so would do if the
building should not continue, so sin in a justified person is apt
to condemne, and would condemne him as well as any other,
if God should not continue to justifie, or multiply to pardon
<hi>Isay</hi> 55. 7.</p>
            <p>2. We may note that God may be considered two wayes,
<list>
                  <item>1. As a Judge proceeding against Male factors according
to the law which inflicteth a curse, <hi>Rom. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 15.</item>
                  <item>2. As a father proceeding against offending children with
anger and displeasure; so the Lord may be angry with
his own people, <hi>Esay 64. 8, 9. Exod.</hi> 4. 14.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>An unjustified person sinning is an enemy under the curse of
God as a judge, a justified person sinning is a sonne under the
anger and displeasure of God as a father. So that there is a
guilt subjecting the one to a legal curse, and a guilt subjecting
the other to a paternall displeasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45459:6"/>
If then it be asked in what sense justified persons may and
do aske pardon of sin committed by them after justification;
we answer.</p>
            <p>1. In regard of legall condemnation, so we daily aske the
continuance of the pardon already granted; for it is one thing
to pardon, and another to continue to pardon, or to preserve
to a person that interest in a pardon once pronounced, which
he if he were left to himselfe would by every sin after forfeit
and cast away, 2 <hi>Sam. 7. 25. Heb.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
            <p>2. In regard of paternall displeasure, so we daily aske the
recovery of his gracious and fatherly countenance towards
us, and the removall of that anger which our sins might justly
provoke against us, <hi>Psal. 51<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9, 12. Psal.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
            <p>3. In pardon is considerable,
<list>
                  <item>1. The generall sentence once pronounced in a mans
first translation from nature to grace.</item>
                  <item>2. The particular application of that grace with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
to particular sins, as they are daily or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally
committed. In which sense Remission al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
granted in the covenant of grace is by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
sued forth and pleaded with respect to their
daily sins, and Christs continuall interceding for
them, 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 1, 2. Hebr.</hi> 7. 24, 25.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>4. Sin is said to be forgiven two wayes, 1, In the court of
the Judge, which is in our first translation from nature to
grace. 2. In the conscience of the sinner reading his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and in this sense we daily pray for more full revelation
and manifestation thereof to us.</p>

               <hi>Quest. Of the use of the Law to beleevers.</hi>  
            </p>
            <p>1. The law was given to man in his innocency as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of life and righteousnesse, requiring perfect and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
obedience under the paine of a Curse, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
            <p>2. The law by the fall of man became weak and unable to
justifie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. so that none could have been saved if the
Lord had not been pleased to make a Covenant of grace.</p>
            <p>3. Since the fall of man the law was published againe, and
added to the Covenant of grace, not as a part of it, nor as a
supplement to it, but as a usefull instrument to further and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the purposes of the Gospell, <hi>Galat. 3. 19. Exod.</hi> 20. 2, 3.
Take it thus then.</p>
            <p>First, Negatively, the use of the law in the time of grace is
not to justifie or save men, <hi>Rom. 3. 20. Galat. 2. 21. &amp;</hi> 3. 21. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet was it published purposely to condemne and destroy
men, because condemnation was in the world before, <hi>Rom.
5.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Affirmatively; but the of it is,</p>
            <p>1. To be a meanes and instrument to drive men to the
grace which is revealed in the Gospel, by shewing
men their sin, misery, and weaknesse, <hi>Rom. 3. 20. Galat.
3.</hi> 22. under the curse of the law.</p>
            <p>2. As a rule of life and obedience to those that are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
that having received life, grace, and love, to
doe Gods will, they may hereby be directed to the
knowledge thereof, 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 23.Jam. 2. 10. 11.
1. Joh. 3. 4. Matth. 5. 17, 19. Rom.</hi> 3. 31. for though
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45459:7"/>
grace doth dispose us to doe the will of God, yet the
law sets forth to us what that will of God is.</p>
            <p>1. Righteous persons then are delivered from the law as a
Covenant of life; from the curse and condemnation thereof;
they expect life from a better covenant, <hi>Galat. 3. 13. c.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
            <p>2. From the occasionall provocation of the law, that it
doth not provoke lust, and cause sin to be the more busie and
working in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 13.</p>
            <p>3 From the slavish bondage of the law compelling to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
duties, out of feare, without love and delight, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15.</p>
            <p>But they are not delivered from the law as the rule of a holy
life, or from the commanding power of the law; for the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
must be subject to the will of the Creator, which will is
signified to us in the law; for the law is holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> just, good, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
<hi>Psal. 19. Rom.</hi> 7. 12. 14. and we are called unto holinesse,
1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 7. therefore we are to learne that holinesse whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
we are called out of the law, which is holy and good.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1 God hath made a Covenant of grace with all the
elect in Jesus Christ.<note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 16, 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. This Covenant is<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 3, 4. Acts 15. 9, 11. Gal. 3. 8, 9, 14. 16, 17.</note> one and the same for the substance of
it both to Jews and Gentiles, though in regard of the different
manner of dispensation it is called sometimes first and second,
sometimes the old and new Covenant; the Luviticall dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45459:8"/>
did consist in temporary and carnall ordinances,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 12.</note> which
were but shadows of these heavenly things,<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 5.</note> which are more
clearly revealed by a more excellent ministery to the children
of God, dispersed abroad in severall Nations throughout the
world. This cleare dispensation since Christ is unchangeable,
and in regard of these severall respects forementioned the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
administred unto us is said to be a better Covenant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
upon better promises.<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>All that are actually brought under this holy Covenant
have their minds inlightned to know God, their consciences
purged, hearts purified, and wills subdued by the fear of God,
they trust not to their own merits, live not after their owne
lusts, fall not from the state of grace again, but live in sincere
conformity to the perfect and spirituall law of God.</p>
            <p>The successe of our Christian conferences,<note place="margin">The successe.</note> whether more
private or publique, was undeniably great.</p>
            <p>1. Some that scrupled the lawfullnesse of Infant-Baptisme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
were reduced and established by a private conference, when
we were engaged to treat of another subject in our more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
meetings.</p>
            <p>2. Divers that are not fully of our mind in point of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and some that were directly contrary, did ingeniously
acknowledge that after a faire debate they received much sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in some maine points of doctrine; others did grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
confesse that they were now convinced that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
intentions were <hi>pious,</hi> and that their endeavours did ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
conduce to the advancement of Christianity, and
gave us great thanks for our pains.</p>
            <p>3. Divers Scholars, and some of them fellowes of Houses,
did blesse God that ever they saw those Ministers in <hi>Oxford,</hi>
which the Parliament sent down, and that they had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
to be admitted unto free conference with them; yea,
they hoped that <hi>Oxford</hi> would be like <hi>Athens</hi> of old <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and yet not like those envious Athenians who sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for none but themselves and their neighbours of <hi>Chios:</hi> for
they perceived that there was now a spirit of comu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nion shed
abroad upon Christians in a visible way of heavenly partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
In a word, God was pleased to blesse these exercises
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45459:8"/>
with admirable successe to the envy of some and setlement of
others: Mr. <hi>Erbury</hi> was (as we are assured) much offended,
whether because his Auditory decreased, or his errors were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
we shall not now examine, and he stirred up the spirit
of the Parliament Soldiers against the Ministers sent downe
from the Parliament, and so did passionately serve the grand
malignants in their master-plot; which was to incense the
Soldiers against the Ministers.</p>
            <p>The first time that Mr. <hi>Erbury</hi> was observed to come to
our meeting, he brought with him a company of soldiers, who
did rather affront and oppose then dispute, and Mr. <hi>Erbury</hi>
would not keep at all to the question which was in hand, nor
would he observe any rules, he would neither speak pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
nor breifly, he told us that he did not acknowledge <hi>that
Christ</hi> had any Church on earth, and therefore denyed Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Congregations to be Churches, and the Ministers of
those (as well as of Presbyteriall) congregations, were by
him denied to be true Ministers of Christ, and hath himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the title, though not the pay and salary of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xerxes</hi> destroyed all the Temples of the Grecians, because
they seemed to overthrow the infinitenesse of God, by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribing
him within the walls of a Temple: we will not
examine whether Mr. <hi>Erbury</hi> doth conceive that Christ and
his Spirit will be too much stinted and circumscribed if any
Church or Ministery be acknowledged. Only we cannot but
wonder that he should be entertained, muster'd, paid as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
by them who account all Ministers to be covetous for
taking any temporall reward for such spirituall service as may
in their judgement be performed by any Saint or member of
the Church or Army.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman, we know not how else to stile him, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that he exercises neither as a gifted man nor Minister,
(now the Ministery is contemned and vilified) undertook to
prove demonstratively, that the Ministers of Independent as
well presbyterian Congregations are unchristian, and so by
consequence Antichristian; after he had made a loose and
cloudy speech in which he had so audaciously abused and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45459:9"/>
the Scripture, he did complaine that an houre or two
was not sufficient for him to explain his opinion and urge his
Arguments: his <hi>unum magnum</hi> was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That there were no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
now, and therefore no Ministery; he was desired to
prove his consequence, but could not; he talked much of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
book, that the Saints &amp; Christ made one perfect man, at last
he fixed upon that text, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. from whence he
concluded that God gave five sorts of Ministers, and where
there were not all five there were none. It was answered that
Apostles, &amp;c. were extraordinary Officers, but Pastours and
Teachers were ordinary Officers to be continued in the
Church for the making of Saints by the blessing of God upon
their ministery, nay for the edefying and perfecting of Saints,
all Saints, for the edefying of the whole body till wee <hi>all
come not onely into the unity of the faith,</hi> but to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the fulnesse of Christ, and therefore no Saint is so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
or excellent a scholar or disciple, but he may be taught by
the Ministers of Christ; for though there be a great deale of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
in regard of those severall degrees of perfection, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are
to be found in severall Saints, yet the highest perfection of the
most accomplished Saint here below, is said to be <hi>according to
the measure of the gift of Christ, Ephes.</hi> 4. 7. who gave Pastours
and Teachers, <hi>vers.</hi> 11 to bring the Saints to the highest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
attainable in this life, <hi>verse</hi> the 12. Finally, it was
made most cleare and evident to Master <hi>Erbury</hi> and all the
company, that Christ did not only make promises to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
themselvs, but to such as were to succeed them in their
ordinary Ministery, that is, to such as were to <hi>teach and baptize
even unto the end of the world, Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. And when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
was made who were the successors of the Apostles, the
answer was that the Elders were the successors of the Apostles
because the Apostle when he was to take his leave, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.
sent <hi>to</hi> Ephesus <hi>for the Elders of the Church, verse</hi> 17. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
the oversight of the Church to them, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
that the Elders were <hi>Bishops or overseers</hi> of the Holy
Ghosts making; here is, if we may so call it, a kind of
resignation, a most manifest recommendation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to whom he had preached, to the care of the Elders,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45459:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>when Saint</hi> Paul <hi>was to see their faces no more, Acts</hi> 20. 25.</p>
            <p>There was something else objected about the order of the
Corinthian-Churches from the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. And to that obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
there were very many satisfying answers given: some of
them shall be related; First, it is evident that the Apostle
doth rebuke the disorders in those Churches which did mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
tend to confusion, though caused or occasioned by such
as did pretend to Revelation,<note place="margin">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. 12. 26.</note> 
               <hi>verse 26. How is it then brethren?
when yee come together, every one of you hath a Psalme, hath
a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
let all things be done unto edifying.</hi> The Apostle doth
declare that he who pretended a revelation was to be tried
and judged by the Prophets, <hi>verse 29. for the spirits of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
are to be subject to the Prophets, verse</hi> 32. Moreover it is
manifest that the Apostle doth not presse the observation of
this order, as a meer prudential matter, but presses it as one of
the commandments of the Lord which doth oblige even Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and spirituall men, <hi>verse 37. If any man think himselfe be
a Prophet or spirituall, let him acknowledge that the things that I
write unto you are the commandements of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, there were these four points distinctly proved; First,
that divers amongst the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were endued with the gift
of Prophesie, which was as extraordinary as the gift of
Tongues or Miracles, and no argument taken from an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
example and an extraordinary gift doth prove that
ungifted men are authorised to Preach or Prophesie in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
course. Secondly, divers among the Corinthians were
enriched by <hi>Christ</hi> in every thing, in <hi>al utterance and in al know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
1 Cor.</hi> 1. 5. but sure every Saint is not inriched in utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and all knowledge. Thirdly, it is most manifest, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Saint did not ordinarily preach or prophesie amongst the
Corinthians, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 29. Are all Apostles, are all Prophets,
are all teachers, are all workers of miracles?</hi> and <hi>verse 30. Have
all the gifts of healing?</hi> &amp;c. all the Saints did not teach, but only
they that had the gift of teaching, even as all did not work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
all did not interpret, no more then they did all speake
with tongues. Fourthly, it is most evident that they only did
teach, whom God set or appointed to teach in the Church,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45459:10"/>
and God did set <hi>some,</hi> not <hi>all</hi> to teach in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.
12.</hi> 28. Every member is not an <hi>eye, for where then were the
hearing?</hi> verse 17. <hi>Now God hath set the</hi> members <hi>every one of
them in the body, even as it hath</hi> pleased him, <hi>verse</hi> 18. and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
member must be content with its place, and observe that
order, which God hath set; <hi>The Saints may find themselves
work enough if they prepare for hearing, and heare as they ought,
and practise what they heare, and therefore they should not take
the work of Preaching upon them which is sufficient to take up
the whole man, but leave it to them whom God hath appointed to
give themselves wholly to prayer and preaching.</hi> It was also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
unto them that Reverend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cotton</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi>
was now brought to see their opinion (which was once his
own) to be an error, and subscribes to our judgement with a
great deale of ingenuity and sweetnesse in his Booke of the
<hi>Keyes,</hi> the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>page.</hi> The opponents were not able to reply
any thing to these answers, but desired to know when we
would meet again: we told them that we could not meet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
that day three weeks, because the monethly Fast was to be
observed upon the next week, and the fifth of <hi>November</hi> the
next week after; whereupon it was desired by some of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Erbury</hi> his adherents, that our next question might be to
this effect.</p>
            <p>Whether there was any Ministry committed to the hands of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
persons in the Church of Christ?</p>
            <p>When we came to the place of meeting and the question
formerly agreed upon at the last meeting was red, which was
to be the subject of the present conference, it was decried by
the Soldiers, who denied that to be the question; yet we are
most assured that it was resolved upon to be then disputed. It
was desired that we might read the <hi>Theses,</hi> in which the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was fully stated, because they did give much light to the
clearing of that question which they so much desired, at length
after much importunity it was yeelded to, that we should
read them, which was done as followeth.</p>

            </list>
            <p>After the Theses were read, some of the Commanders sayd,
that they did not differ from us in them, and therefore would
have us to prove our call: we told them that although we were
ready to do that, yet since this was the Question agreed upon on
both sides, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Earbury</hi> for his part embraced it, and wee
had stated it in our Theses, wee could not yield to the altering of
it: but by the clamours, reproaches, and uncivill language and
behaviour of some present, we were born down, and another
Question was yielded unto, which was,</p>
            <p>Whether those that are called Ministers, had any more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to Preach in publique, then private Christians which were
gifted; <hi>whereupon (since the Souldiers would have it so) one
of our company undertook to prove,</hi> that they had no authority to
Preach, what ever we had.</p>
            <p>His argument was this, They that had authority to Preach,
have such names and titles (importing an office and calling)
which are given to Preachers in the Scripture: But they had not
those names, and titles that are given to Preachers in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
therefore they had no authority to Preach.</p>
            <p>The <hi>minor</hi> being denyed, it was thus proved, The names and
titles that are given to Preachers in the Scripture are such as
these, <hi>viz.</hi> Pastors, Teachers, Stewards, Watch-men, Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours,
Over-seers, Ministers, Rulers, and such as must give
an account, &amp;c. But these names and titles did not agree to them:
therefore they had no authority to Preach.</p>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> was denyed, this was undertaken to be proved by
the parts, and first it was proved that Pastours and Teachers
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45459:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were names and titles given to Preachers. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. was
produced for the proof of it, hee gave some Apostles &amp;c. some
Pastors and Teachers, these name and titles of Pastours and
Teachers were given here to Preachers and men in office, and
not to gifted brethren, as appears by the connexion and scope of
the place.</p>
            <p>First, it was answered, that this place did not prove the
thing, for then Preachers must be Prophets and Apostles, &amp;c.
also.</p>
            <p>To this was replyed, that that did not follow in regard Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apostles were extraordinary officers, <hi>&amp; pro tempore</hi>
for the first planting and founding of the Church, and therefore
though Preachers were not Prophets and Apostles, yet they
were Pastours and Teachers, and were ordinary officers and to
continue in the Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it was sayd, there was no such distinction of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and ordinary in the Scripture, and that the answer was
not sufficient;</p>
            <p>It was replyed that we read not the word ordinary; neither,
yet it follows not that therefore there were not ordinary; neither
read we the word Trinity, yet it follows not that there are not
three Persons.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, another said, they did not preach as men in office,
but only as gifted brethren, and therefore though those names
did agree to men in office, yet that did not hinder but that they
might be Preachers in another capacity.</p>
            <p>It was replyed, that did imply a contradiction, to preach
publickly, and yet to be a private man; in regard that to preach
implyed a publicke office and mission, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. so that
for any man to take upon him a publick office which was not
an officer did usurpe; as if a common Souldier should do the
work of a Colonel without a Commission or a call, though he
be never so skilfull, shall be thought to usurpe; and a Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
though hee be more able then the Judge on the bench, yet
must not take upon him the Judges office before hee is called to
it as well as qualified for it. Every man must use his gifts in
his own sphere and compasse, a Pastour in a publick way, and a
private man in private wayes of edification; each member of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45459:12"/>
the body according to its own measure, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 16. But they
were not out of their station in this, as a private man should be
in the work of a Magistrate, Judge, or Colonel, because they find
that private men in Scripture have taught publickly without an
office, and therefore they may do so too; for proof hereof was
produced the example of those, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>It was answered, that it doth not appeare, that they who
preached were private men, <hi>Philip</hi> who was named was an
Evangelist, the rest might be Elders in office at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> there
used to be Apostles, Elders, and Brethren; and if all were
dispersed but the Apostles, then Elders as well as private Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
beside, whoever they were, in probability they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
and commission from the Apostles to do what they
did, and so they did it not without a mission; however, the
case was extraordinary, and it doth no way follow, if where
no officers are to doe a work, private persons being furnished
with more notable gifts, then any now ordinarily are, may
endevour to propagate the Gospel where it was not at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
therefore in ordinary times of the Church where officers are
who are furnished with greater abilities and a speciall call, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
should take their work out of their hands, and do that in a
constituted Church which others did where there was no
Church at all, nor officers to gather one.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Apollo</hi> preached, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 26. true, But how prove they
hee was no Minister? hee is called so in expresse tearms,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. They prove hee was none because he was ignorant,
and instructed by <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla.</hi> But did hee well to
preach being ignorant? yes, hee was able to make out Jesus
Christ, being eloquent and mighty in the Scriptures, If so, then
the argument that he was not a Minister because ignorant, falls
to the ground; To this nothing was replyed that we could call
to minde.</p>
            <p>But they might all prophecy one by one, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 31. It
was answered, that that was cleerly meant of the Prophets
amongst them, who were officers, and had an extraordinary gift,
of prophesie by revelation given them, <hi>verse</hi> 30. and not of
every one of the people at large, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 29. Ephes.</hi> 4. 11.
No, it was not extraordinary, for they were to speak to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45459:12"/>
exhortation, and comfort. As if extraordinary officers
might not speak to those ends.</p>
            <p>It was further answered, that the text in the <hi>Ephes.</hi> was not
exclusive of others, and therefore others might preach though
not enumerated, for elsewhere others were mentioned, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
helps governments, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>It was replied, first, that though there was mention made
of helps and governments, which many did interpret of ruling
officers, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. speaks of officers designed for preaching of
doctrine, though all officers might not be set downe here, yet
none ever questioned whether all for doctrine were not set
downe. Secondly, that this must be a full enumeration of all
officers for preaching, for the Apostle mentions, the gifs
Christ gave to his Church at his Ascension, and if here were
not all, then Christ at the time of his Ascension, did not give
all gifs sufficient for his Church, which could not be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
whereupon in the opening of that place four particulars
were observed; first, the time when Christ received and gave
these gifts to men, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 68. 18. at the time of his Ascension
when he led captivity captive, it being an expression taken
from triumphs of Conquerors after great victories, it was their
custome then to give gifts and largesses to the people: so Christ
ascending into Heaven, and leading the devill, hell, and death,
as it were in triumph, having destroyed them and delivered his
people from their power, at that time gave gifts unto his
Church. Secondly, the gifts given were Apostles, &amp;c. which
were officers for the good of his Church. Thirdly, the end to
which they were given, the perfecting the body of the Saints,
&amp;c. Fourthly, the time how long they were to continue, till we
all come, &amp;c. that is, to the end of the world, while there shall
be any that must be brought into the unity of the faith and of
the knowledge of Christ and to be perfected in him, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
will be as long as the world doth last, so that Christ at
that time when hee led captive all his enemies that did oppose
him in his state of humiliation, received gifts and gave them to
men, that it might appear that in spight of all those enemies
he would provide such gifts and officers, as were necessary for
his Church. Now the Apostle reckoning up those gifts in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45459:13"/>
and pointing out the ends for which they were given,
and the time how long they were to last, it cannot be supposed
that eyther Christ did not then receive and give all gifts necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or that the Holy Ghost in enumerating those he received and
gave, should not enumerate all, so that they who are not
within the number of those officers there mentioned, are none
of the gifts given to the Church at the time of Christs ascension
for the end specified, and therefore there must be some other
time when Christ gave those to the Church who are only gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
brethren, for those ends of perfecting the Saints, the worke
of the Ministry, the edifying of the body of Christ; or else it
must be acknowledged that themselves not preaching by way
of office according to their former answer, cannot have so
good authority to preach in publick as they have who are the
Officers designed by Christ. Thirdly, whereas it was answered,
that in the very same <hi>chapter</hi> the members are said to edifie
one another, the reply was this, by edifying, was not in faith
and knowledge by preaching, but it was edifying in love, for
so the words are, <hi>verse</hi> 16. it was answered by Master <hi>Earbury,</hi>
that those were given <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> though the works they were
to doe were in other hands before.</p>
            <p>This being a begging of the question it was further said, all
are not Apostles, &amp;c. and that private men were not allowed
to doe the works of Apostles and Evangelists, and therefore
not of Pastors and Teachers, if some parts of the text were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive,
so were others; it was added that then it will follow if
Christ had never given Apostles, Prophets &amp;c. yet the Saints
might have been perfected the body of Christ edified, and all
brought into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of
the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the
stature of the fulnesse of Christ, which seemeth very strange
to us.</p>
            <p>We were ready to have pressed other arguments, to prove
that private men have no authority to preach, but the multitude
of Souldiers in a violent manner called upon us to prove our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
whereupon it was thus argued.</p>
            <p>They who were qualified, approved, called, ordained accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the minde of Christ, are the Ministers of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:45459:13"/>
But some Ministers in the Church of <hi>England</hi> are qualified,
approved, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi> some Ministers in the Church of <hi>England</hi>
are the true Ministers of Christ.</p>
            <p>The <hi>minor</hi> was denied. In the proof of which he began with
qualifications, which were set down, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. Titus</hi> 1. They
who have the qualifications there set down, are qualified accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the mind of Christ: but some Ministers in the Church
of <hi>England</hi> have those qualifications: <hi>Ergo</hi> it is true, that some
Ministers in the Church of <hi>England</hi> are qualified according to
the mind of Christ: The <hi>minor</hi> was denied.</p>
            <p>It was demanded what qualifications were wanting; the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
was made by Master <hi>Earbury,</hi> that it was one qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Ministers must be no strikers, but all the Ministers in
<hi>England</hi> are strikers.</p>
            <p>The reply, Master <hi>Reynolds,</hi> Master <hi>Harris,</hi> Master <hi>Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
are no strikers, therefore all are not. Master <hi>Earbury</hi> said,
they are, and all are strikers, which hee laboured to prove
thus,</p>
            <p>They who destroy the communion of Saints, and inflict
temporall punishments upon spirituall weaknesse are strikers:
but all the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> do so: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both propositions were denied, first the <hi>major,</hi> because the
Apostle in both places means it of fighting &amp; striking according
to the usuall acception of the word, and of outward violence:
secondly, the <hi>minor</hi> was denied, with this confirmation, they
that have faith and love do not destroy the communion of the
Saints, but many Ministers in the Church of <hi>England</hi> have true
faith and love, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was answered by Master <hi>Earbury,</hi> that the Ministers of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> had not Gospel faith, and love, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was sayd to that by one of the Ministers, that hee himself
had a saving justifying faith, of the same kinde with that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
therefore hee had a Gospel faith. But it was said by
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Earbury,</hi> that we had no Gospel faith because no rivers of
living water nor gifts of the Spirit flowing out of us. Answer,
Whatever faith he understood by that, yet surely they had faith
and love enough to keep them from destroying the communion
of Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:45459:14"/>
It was added by Master <hi>Earbury,</hi> that the Ministers of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> allow parish Churches, therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the communion of Saints; Answer; absurd enough, yet
this was said to it, communion of Saints is either reall, mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and spirituall, betweene the members of Christs body my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall,
and which no believer can be an enemy unto, let him be
in a parish or any other relation; and externall, in some or
other Church way of communion in the ordinances, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which true beleevers who all hold spirituall communion,
might differ and yet be no wayes destroyers of the communion
of Saints.</p>
            <p>But how inflicters of temporall punishments? and that all
of them, since Ministers inflict no penalties at all? answered,
why their principles are such, they approve of punishment for
errors and heresies, therefore they destroy the communion of
Saints, This was looked upon as a meere <hi>odium</hi> and reproach,
cast not only on the Ministers, but much more on the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
as enemies of the communion of Saints, and therefore
fitter to be answered by the Magistrate then a Minister.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Earbury</hi> said also, that the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> did set
up societies, <hi>viz.</hi> Presbyteries, which did destroy the communion
of Saints; It was answered that all Ministers did not set up pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries,
and secondly, they that did, did not destroy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints. Master <hi>Earbury</hi> said also that they did allow
of an Ordinance of Parliament for the punishment of errors and
heresies, and therefore they did destroy the communion of Saints;
It was answered, we know of no such Ordinance, and therefore
could not be said to allow of it.</p>
            <p>After Master <hi>Earbury</hi> had denyed the qualifications of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
because strikers, another would needs have them disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
because covetous, and that all of them: how so? they
who take other mens goods from them by fraud and circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
under pretence of giving them somthing for it which
was worth nothing, are covetous; but so doe all the Ministers
of <hi>England</hi> by receiving Tythes, <hi>ergo</hi> all are covetous. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
we did now conceive that our opposites had it in designe
to lay us as low as they could by disgracefull speeches and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
because they could not beat us down by strength of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45459:14"/>
argument. We apprehended the arguments, or rather reproches,
that the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> were all strikers and covetous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
have as little weight as charity in them.</p>
            <p>After this wee proceeded to the second branch of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That there were some Ministers in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
approved of according to the mind of Christ; That there
must be a proof and approbation of Presbyters, appeared,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 10. Let these also first be proved, &amp;c. And that many
Ministers in the Church of <hi>England</hi> had undergone sufficient
tryall, was proved thus: They who have been examined and
approved by those who are Ministers of Christ, able to examine
and approve them, and designed to that purpose, are approved
according to the minde of Christ: but some Ministers in the
Church of <hi>England</hi> have been thus examined and approved,
&amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>minor</hi> was denied upon two reasons;</p>
            <p>First, that they who examined and approved them were not
able to do it (though as was urged they had understanding and
knowledge in the arts, languages, and Scripture) because they
had not the Spirit.</p>
            <p>This was thought a very strange and unchristian charge, and
indeed a reproach upon all the Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> many of
which have been, and many are such eminent and glorious lights,
and instruments of good in the Church of Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that they who examined and approved any of the
Ministers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> were not Ministers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
therefore could not approve others. Reply; They who
were themselves qualified, approved, called, and ordained ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the minde of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were lawfull Ministers; but
they that approved Ministers in the Church of <hi>England</hi> were
such; <hi>Ergo.</hi> It was said this was <hi>idem per idem</hi> in a circle.
It was returned thus, that indeed the same thing that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at first, was proved again by the same argument, because the
same thing was denied, which was denied at first; yet this was
no circle, in regard that hee was forced by the answerer, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that which was the first mayn question, to use the first mayn
argument again; for hee who denyes those to be Ministers of
Christ who approved and ordayned us, denyes us to be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45459:15"/>
of Christ who are approved and ordained by them, and it
is but one and the same question, and therefore there can be no
<hi>medium</hi> used to prove their Ministry to be true, but the same
which was used to prove ours to be true.</p>
            <p>After much time spent in the former debates, and it now
grew late in the night, some notwithstanding were still very
importunate to have the Conference carried on unto that
branch of the former Argument which concerned the Call of
the Ministers: whereupon one of the Ministers spake to this
effect.</p>
            <p>That unto a Minister two things were required: <hi>Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
fitting him for the service; and a <hi>Call</hi> separating him
thereunto.</p>
            <p>The qualifications are, 1 <hi>Piety</hi> of life. 2 <hi>Abilities</hi> of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and ministeriall gifts, whereby hee might be a <hi>workman
who need not to be ashamed.</hi> That in both these respects, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any thing which had been spoken, no man could take
any just exception against very many Ministers in the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> who are well knovvn to be eminent in both.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Call</hi> is tvvofold, <hi>Inward,</hi> from God; and <hi>Outward,</hi> from
man.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Inward call</hi> is vvhen a man so qualified vvith piety of
Life, and abilities of Learning, is by the secret vvork of God
on his heart moved <hi>to desire the office of a Minister,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
himselfe to serve the Lord and his Church in that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And that all the Ministers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are
destitute of this <hi>call</hi> we dare likewise challenge any man to make
good.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Outward call</hi> is, when a man thus qualified, moved, and
inclined
by God unto such an office, is <hi>separated,</hi> designed, and
authorised by <hi>men</hi> thereunto likewise.</p>
            <p>This is considerable eyther as in <hi>Ecclesiâ constituâ,</hi> a Church
setled; or as <hi>in Ecclesiâ Restituendâ,</hi> a Church to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>In a setled <hi>constituted Church</hi> this outward <hi>call</hi> is by Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the hands of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> upon due and mature
examination and approbation of the person so qualified, with
prayer commending him to God, who hath fitted and inclined
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45459:15"/>
him unto that service; and this <hi>call</hi> the Ministers of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> had <hi>in Collegio presbyterorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it was objected, That we had this our Ordination from
Antichristian and wicked men, who cannot doe any thing for
Christ.</p>
            <p>To this Answer was made: 1 That no man was able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that all they from whom the Ministers of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> received their Ordination to the Ministry, were wicked
or Antichristian. And that we could with much more confidence
affirm, that many of them from whom our Ministers received
Imposition of hands, were men fearing God.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Dato sed non concesso,</hi> supposing, though not granting,
that they were such, we further answer in these three Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>First, That some evill men may, and alwayes have <hi>de facto</hi>
been, Officers and Ministers in the Church. In the Church of
the Jews <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinchas;</hi> in the dayes of Christ, Scribes
and Pharisees; in the family of Christ, <hi>Judas;</hi> in the Churches
of Christx, envious and perverse Teachers, <hi>Phil. 115. Act. 20.
29,</hi> 30.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the wickednesse of such men did not null or
evacuate their Ministeriall acts: for our Saviour would have
the Scribes and Pharisees heard while they sate in <hi>Moses</hi> chair,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 2. and the Apostle was glad when men preached
Christ, though it were out of envie: and Christs commission
did as well authorize <hi>Judas,</hi> as any other, to preach the Gospel,
and to Baptize, <hi>Mat. 10. 5. John</hi> 4. 2.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that if the principall acts belonging to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall
function of such men, namely, Preaching and Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
or administring Sacraments, were not nulled nor made
void by their personall wickednesse, then consequently no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
act comprised within the same office or commission,
could be thereby made void. So that if <hi>Judas</hi> had been an
Apostle, when Christ sent his Apostles to Ordain Elders in
the Church, his <hi>Ordination,</hi> notwithstanding his personall
wickednesse, would have been as valide, as his <hi>Preaching</hi> or
<hi>Baptizing</hi> formerly had been. [The Leaprosie of the hand
doth not hinder the growing of the corne which that hand
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45459:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
soweth. Whatever arguments <hi>Austin</hi> useth in his Writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Donatists,</hi> to confirm the Baptism of Hereticks, are
valid to confirm the Ordination of the like men.] So that
though they were neverso wicked, hereticall, or Antichristian
Ministers, through whom the Ministry appointed by Christ,
hath by mean conveyances descended upon us, yet this doth
not at all void our Ministry. [A River which hath a pure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
may run through many impure channels, and yet becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
pure again, is no way prejudiced by the impurity of the
channels through which it passed. The Word, Sacraments,
Ministry, are <hi>Christs owne,</hi> an continue to be <hi>His</hi> still, what
corrupt hands soever be the instruments of conveying them.]</p>
            <p>Finally, if wee should take for granted upon the principles
of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> that the Ordinations of Hereticks or other
wicked men were void, and so there were no ordinary way
for continuing a succession in the Ministery, but that upon the
universall corruption of instruments, visible succession were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted:
yet <hi>in Ecclesiâ restituendâ,</hi> an <hi>unusuall</hi> and <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
call</hi> in the Church it self, so reforming would be <hi>in
that exigent and extremity</hi> a valid and sufficient <hi>designation</hi> of
men in themselves duly qualified for that office. And even so
the first Reformers of the Protestant Churches were called out
unto the service of those Churches in the worke of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
the Reformation whereof they had by their zeal and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
so much promoted. For the dispensation of the Word
and Sacraments, by the Ministers of the Gospel, being a work
necessary and perpetuall, <hi>Matth. 28. 19, 20. Ephes. 4. 11,
12, 13. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 26. where <hi>ordinary</hi> means of continuing
them are impossible to be used, <hi>unusuall and extraordinary</hi>
may take place. [The ordinary course of Circumcision was to
be on the eighth day, but this course being not so well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
in the case of Israels travell through the Wildernesse, it
was at last observed in an extraordinary manner, to wit, after
forty yeers, <hi>Josh. 5. 2, 7.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the equity of this will the more appear if wee consider
that in this case, the Church doth not do more then she may
do, only something, which ordinarily should be done, is left
undone, for want of such officers unto whom the doing of it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45459:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did belong. For <hi>Election</hi> of men to this service may be by the
Church her self, though <hi>formal ordination</hi> by imposition of hands
be only by officers. And the Churches Election alone in this
exigent would be a valid <hi>call,</hi> where imposition of hands were
impossible to be obtained, because where and when officers do
do it, the Church may be said to do it by her officers: and
where there are no officers to do it, the election of the
Church doth vertually comprize the act of the officers. [The
Apostle sayth, that <hi>unto principalities and powers was made
known</hi> BY THE CHURCH <hi>the manifold wisdome of God,
Ephes.</hi> 3. 10. and yet the <hi>Church did it not but by the Preaching
or Ministeriall works of her officers.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It shall not need to adde here what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Beza</hi> sayth of the
first Reformers, That they were <hi>à Deo extra ordinem excitati,
rebus ita collapsis, ut ordinariae vocationi nullus esset locus relictus,</hi>
That they were extraordinarily raysed up by God, the state of
the Church being so corrupted that there was no place left for
an Ordinary Call.</p>
            <p>So then upon the whole matter we affirm, That we are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Ministers of the Gospel, having by Ordination received
Imposition of hands <hi>in Collegio presbyterorum,</hi> and our first
Reformers (besides the like Ordination, which the wickednesse
of Instruments could not invalidate) were by the Election of
those Churches (unto the Reformation whereof they had so
eminently concurred) called out unto the same service. This
was the substance and sense of what was spoken.</p>
            <p>Thus far this day, the report whereof might well have been
spared in this juncture of businesses of higher concernment, had
not the partiall and uncivill (not to say uncharitable) reports
of some enforced so much from us, wee rather choose to ask
pardon for saying so much, then for saying so little, and so
many of us as held our selves at this debate silent, do conceive
that we need no Apology for so doing with wise men; and for
such whom neyther our speech nor silence, our presence or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
our mildnesse nor earnestnesse can please, wee are not at
leisure to give any account of our selves to them,<note n="*" place="margin">Tu linguae, ego ourium sum dominus.</note> theirs be

Master <hi>Earbury</hi> was assured by his followers that he had gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the day, and therefore now hee was the only Minister, or
rather Apostle in the World; whereupon hee began to gather
some people together, as if hee intended to build, plant, or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Church; but first he thought fit to dig at the <hi>foundation</hi>
of the true Church of Christ, which wee must needs confesse
was <hi>the best way to overthrow it,</hi> and make good his grand as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
that <hi>Christ hath no Church on earth.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Earbury</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon the eleventh of <hi>December,</hi> at a publick meeting before
divers of the City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> endevoured to prove this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<q>That the fulnesse of the Godhead, the same fulnesse of the
Godhead which is in Christ, dwels bodily in the Saints,
in the same measure, though not in the same manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
as it dwelt in Christ whilest hee was here below
in the flesh.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For the proofe of this damnable doctrine, he alledged (as we
are informed) these places of Scripture, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 13. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11, 12. and <hi>Psalme 22. 22. Coloss. 1. 27.
Coloss. 2. 9, 10. John 17. 21, 22, 23, 24. Ephes.</hi> 3. from <hi>v.</hi> 14.
to the 19. 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 12. 2 Pet. 1. 4. Zach.</hi> 12. 8. Mark, the
Scripture doth not only say we shall bex <hi>one with God</hi> as Christ
is, but it sayth more, we shall be <hi>as God.</hi> But (sayth he) it
will be objected, That God hath anointed Christ above his
fellows, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 9. I answer (sayth he) this place is meant of
being anointed with the Godhead: but be it known to you,
<hi>Christ hath no more of the Godhead then we have,</hi> and therefore
is not anointed in greater measure then we are, but onely in a
greater manifestation; and <hi>if we beleeve this, we shall doe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
works then ever Christ did;</hi> that Text then, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 9. is
meant only of the manifestation of the Godhead; For as the
soule is as much in the little finger, as in the head, so is <hi>there as
much of the Godhead in the least member of Christ, as there is in
Christ himselfe.</hi> I do, sayth Master <hi>Earbury,</hi> remember another
Text that is urged by some to overthrow the doctrine which
I have delivered, which you may read in the third Chapter of
<hi>John<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> v.</hi> 34. 35. but the objection being specially grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the 34 <hi>verse,</hi> may be answered out of the 35 <hi>verse,</hi> for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45459:17"/>
sayth Master <hi>Earbury,</hi> whatever God hath given to the Son
he hath given to the Saints, and <hi>if the Saints saw this they would
never ask any thing any more of God, because all things are given
to the Saints,</hi> and God loves the Saints as he loves the Son,
<hi>John</hi> 17. 23. True it is, that all Kingdoms, Countries, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
arex given to Christ, <hi>Psalme</hi> 2. 7, 8. but it is as true that they
are given to the Saints, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 26, 27. whatsoever the Son
hath received of the Father, the Saints have received likewise,
they have received the same power, the same glory, but they
do not see it. Nay, whatsoever is spoken of the Son is spoken
of the Saints, for the Saints are the Son; and this is manifest,
sayth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Earbury,</hi> and then produced two places of Scripture
to prove it, <hi>Revel. 3. 9. Revel.</hi> 21. 7. Wee are now heirs of all
things as the Son is, and we shal know it, and men shal know it,
and <hi>come and worship at our feet:</hi> therefore let this be the ground
of our Faith and Hope, for Christ is not shut up in Heaven, but
Christ is in us the hope of glory.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Earbury</hi> doth as you see positively deliver these blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
errours, and yet when he was admonished by one of
our brethren, hee sayd, hee did not deliver any thing dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
for hee did only enquire into the Truth of things as one
that was to seek. To which it was replyed that, First, hee did
urge Scripture to prove his opinion. Secondly, that hee sayd
his Exposition was manifest. Thirdly, that he pressed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to receive his Exposition, to build their hope upon his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
and to believe the Scriptures in his sense. Fourthly, to
encourage them to receive his interpretation, hee assured them
that if they would believe his doctrine, they should do greater
things then ever Christ did, and men should come and worship
at their feet. Fiftly, hee was advised to deliver practicall points
to the people, and not to teach any thing for truth concerning
which hee was not fully perswaded in his own minde. Sixtly,
our brother desired him to enquire of those who were able to
resolve him in those things of which hee doubted, and not
to enquire of a company of unsetled people, for by that means
he might bring them also to doubt of most of the principles of
the Christian faith.</p>
            <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">Decemb. 11.</note> upon the eleventh of <hi>December,</hi> Master <hi>Earbury</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:45459:18"/>
took upon him to prophecy of greater shakings yet in <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as <hi>Ireland.</hi> In <hi>Scotland,</hi> sayth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
they think to preserve themselves, but you shall see and
they will feel greater shakings yet, even mighty Earth-quakes;
but if the Lord teach you this doctrine which I have now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
it will keep up your spirits. Remember that it is not
only God that gives you strength, but God is your strength,
and you shall walk upon God himself as upon high places;
believe it, wee are filled with the same Godhead, with the
same glory that Christ is, and wee are one with the Father as
hee is.</p>
            <p>These Notes were communicated to one of our company by
a Captain; whereupon, one of our brethren preached just
the contrary doctrine, and proved that it was a fundamentall
Article of the Christian Religion, because Christ hath built his
Church upon this fundamentall confession or acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as upon an immoveable Rock, <hi>Matth. 16. 16, 17, 18.
Simon Peter</hi> said, <hi>Thou art Christ the son of the living God;</hi> and
what said Christ? <hi>upon this Rock will I build my Church.</hi> This
is the <hi>great Article</hi> so often disputed and cleered in primitive
times by the Apostles for the <hi>conversion of Jews &amp; Gentiles. That
Jesus Christ who took our nature of the blessed Virgin, is the true
Messiah the son of the living God, God equall with his Father, nay
the same God</hi> (though not the same person) <hi>with his Father, God
by nature and yet Man by nature; perfect God, and perfect Man,
both natures the divine and humane being inseparably united in
the person of the son of God, the second person of the glorious Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
This truth was made evident by the whole series of the
book of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, and therefore <hi>it's not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for us to acknowledge that Christ is in some sense God and
Man, but we must believe this truth as it is revealed and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Scriptures,</hi> because the Scriptures are the <hi>doctrinall;</hi>
foundation, and Christ the <hi>personall</hi> foundation. Wee are built
upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, Jesus
Christ himself being the chief corner stone, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 20. yee
must walk, sayth the Apostle, <hi>as yee have received,</hi> and be built
up in Christ, and established in the faith <hi>as you have been taught,
Coloss.</hi> 2. 6, 7. Divers of Master <hi>Earbury</hi> his Auditory were
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45459:18"/>
startled with this Sermon: two of them came to Mr. <hi>Cheynell,</hi>
and told him that he had delivered Doctrine contrary to what
they had been taught by a very pretious man Mr. <hi>Erbury;</hi> Mr.
<hi>Cheynell</hi> told them they were to examine which of those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Doctrines was agreeable to the scriptures; For he that
preacheth contrary to <hi>M. Erbury</hi> his opinion is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
if <hi>Mr. Earbury</hi> his opinion be contrary to the word of
God: whereupon they desired Mr. <hi>Cheynell</hi> to give M. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
a meeting, that the point in controversie might be fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed
in the presence of them who had heard both Ministers
preach. M. <hi>Cheynell</hi> offered to meet at Mr. Mayors house; and
put off his other businesse that he might fulfill his promise; but
contrary to expectation, Mr. <hi>Erbury</hi> desired to be excused;
whereupon Mr. <hi>Cheynell</hi> wrote to M. <hi>Erbury</hi> to meet him any
where else, if he desired a more private meeting, or to meet him
at the Scools if he desired a more publick disputation: <hi>Mr. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
refused to write an answer or declare his opinion under his
hand, yet signified his desire to confer with <hi>Mr. Cheynell;</hi> upon
this answer <hi>Mr. Cheynell</hi> were to his Quarters, and after confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with him, did both beseech and admonish him before an
Officer of the Army to study those points better, and to consult
some that were able to give him satisfaction in them: for if he
consulted none but unsetled men, he did not take the right
way to be setled. <hi>Mr. Erbury</hi> replied, that God did reveal
the mystery of Christ to babes, and conceal it not only from
worldly wise men, but from those that were spiritually wise, <hi>as
if any man could be spiritually wise without the knowledge of
Christ:</hi> surely this was as vain as if he had said Christ will save
babes, and damn those that are spiritually wise, for no man can
be wise to salvation who is ignorant of the saving mystery of
Christ, and certainly that is the mystery our Saviour speaks
of, <hi>Matth. 11. 25. 26. Master Erbury</hi> after this admonition
preached to divers of the City in an high and daring way, He
took that portion of Scripture, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 25. for his text, and
preached to this effect, as we are credidly informed.</p>
            <p>They are much deceived who say we deny the Godhead of
Christ, for Christ is nothing else but God <hi>[he meaneth God the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45459:19"/>
Father]</hi> manifested in our flesh. Christ is anointed with the
Spirit, <hi>that is, the power of God, Isay 61. 1. Luke</hi> 4. 18. He hath
anointed me, <hi>me;</hi> what Christ as a distinct person from the
Saints? no, Christ and all the saints; For <hi>it is but simply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to look upon Christ as distinct from the Saints,</hi> because
Christ and the saints make one man; He is the head and we
the Members, He and we make one perfect man. The Saints
have the same anointing that Christ had, and <hi>therefore as
Christ was sent to preach, so are they,</hi> and indeed <hi>the only prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and teaching from God is in the Saints.</hi> It is not the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of this Nation that can invent to send Preachers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
but when God hath broken the Nation and their
Formes, <hi>they set up a new Forme,</hi> but there will never be any
true teaching till Christ doth appear in the Saints they only
have the only oyle, <hi>Isay</hi> 61. 3. 4. and therefore they only shall
build the old waste places. What is become of those Preachers
that had their Orders from the Bishops, and so from the
Pope? There is not one to be found in the North and in <hi>Wales,</hi>
they are gon to far Parsonages from whence <hi>Malignants</hi> have
been thrown out; <hi>You may see what a blessed Reformation we
have now at this day:</hi> the saints shall build these old wast pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
not men in holy Orders (they will not accept of 20 by
the year) but the saints shall build them, the saints, not those
who call <hi>themselves</hi> Ministers, but those whom the people shall
call Ministers,<note place="margin">Isay 61. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Isay</hi> 61. 6. Priests and Ministers because they
shall have a double portion of the spirit, <hi>verse</hi> 7. double to
that which the Priests had under the Law, or Ministers hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
under the Gospel, and it shall be acknowledged that God
is in their flesh, <hi>verse</hi> 9. mark, a double portion <hi>in their land,</hi>
that is, <hi>in their flesh.</hi> It is by <hi>providence</hi> that we speak now,
for <hi>the world seeks to hinder us;</hi> but the Law shall go forth of
<hi>Sion, Micha 4. 2. Sion,</hi> that is the place where God dwels;
where is that but in the saints? <hi>The Law then shall go forth
from the Saints:</hi> what Law? <hi>not the Commandements,</hi> but the
Law of the spirit shall go forth out of the saints, even the Law
of the spirit of life in Christ; The word of the Lord shall go
forth, that is, Christ himselfe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 13. that is, <hi>there shall
be an appearance of Christ in the Saints. Kings shall bow down
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45459:19"/>
and lick the dust Psal. 72. 9 10, 11. under whose feet? why, the
feet of the Son and of the Saints,</hi> (as we shall shew hereafter)
<hi>and then there shall be peace.</hi> Now there is a war amongst the
Saints, Independants against Presbyterians, and they against
the Rebaptized, but when God shall appear in our flesh, there
will be no vexing of one another. My deare friends, be sure
that where there is a destroying spirit in the Saints, there is no
appearance of Christ; for this is nothing but the appearance
of <hi>Antichrist and of the Divell,</hi> who was a murderer from the
beginning. I am affraid to call them Saints who have the spirit
to make a man an offender for a word, who have an intent to
catch men and imprison them, nay bring them to death; to
take advantage of a mans weaknesse, this is not the spirit of
Christ, this is the spirit of Antichrist, for <hi>the Saints shall not
hurt in all the holy mountaine, not a Jew though he curse Christ
Jesus, nor a Turk that makes a scoff of the Son of God.</hi> It is a
strange hypocriticall nation this; we have prayed these eighty
years for the conversion of the Jews, and yet we will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a Jew to live amongst us: I feare the bloud of the Jews cast
out of this nation, and abominably butchered, is not yet wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away, this is a meer mockery, there must not a Papist nor a
Malignant be suffered to live amongst us. We pretend to
Christ and we have not the spirit of Christ within us, for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
spirit is the spirit of Antichrist. Dear friends be not
angry if the spirit of Antichrist appear in you, for it was in
Christs <hi>owne Apostles</hi> in three things.</p>
            <p>First, a <hi>spirit of Prelacy</hi> or pride; the poor Fisher-men dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
who should be greatest.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a <hi>spirit of conformity;</hi> because one did cast out
Divels and did not follow them, they forbad him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a <hi>spirit of cruelty:</hi> suppose men will not owne
Christ, will ye destroy them? are you of the spirit of <hi>Iames</hi>
and <hi>John,</hi> of a destroying spirit? <hi>Christ came not to destroy any
mans liberty or life, therefore a destroying spirit is the spirit of
Antichrist.</hi> Consider what is said of the Beasts in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
the Dragon was under Popery, another Beast under E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy,
<hi>and the next Beast is that of these times,</hi> his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is lowly yet, but he speaks like a dragon, bonds, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45459:20"/>
bloud. Note, first, his pride, he speaks high things. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the spirit of conformity, you must receive a mark in
your head, and be of their opinion; and a mark in your hand,
practise as they do. Thirdly, a spirit of cruelty to vex those
that will not conform, they must have <hi>no liberty of conscience,
nor liberty of Trade.</hi> Many Saints have been hanged, as <hi>Barrow;</hi>
and it may be some in these dayes may be put to death, and <hi>it
will be a wonder to after ages why they were so.</hi> The four plagues
of <hi>Babylon</hi> are death, that is a dead spirit; famine, that is, want;
<hi>they are ever complaining of this want and that want, they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of this sin and that sin, they want this grace and that grace;
this is a signe that we have the spirit of Antichrist in us, we do not
see our fulnesse and praise God for it, we have all the fulnesse of the
Godhead in us and doe we complaine?</hi> Yet <hi>M. Erbury</hi> thought
fit upon another day to enlarge himselfe upon that Text, hee
preached on before in the presence of divers Citizens, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi>
16. 13.</p>
            <p>Christ, saith Master <hi>Erbury,</hi> is nothing else but the anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the Lord, anointed with the Godhead, and so are the
Saints, for Christ and the saints make one annointed. <hi>Habak.
3. 13. all the Godhead is in us as it is in him, though this be not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,</hi>
yet <hi>we have for the present the same glory that the Son
hath, John</hi> 17. 22. Dear friends, Christ was anointed with the
Spirit also, but what is the Spirit? <hi>The Spirit is the power of God
and the appearance of Christ.</hi> All power is in God, now <hi>when
that power of God shall act and come forth, then it is the Spirit.
therefore the Spirit is the coming forth of the power of God.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the Spirit is the appearance of Christ, for Christ is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the wisdome and the power of God, so then <hi>the coming
forth of the power of God is the Spirit and that Spirit is Christ, for
Christ and the Spirit are both one.</hi> Friends, we have an ignorant
blind devotion, we pray to Son, Father, and Spirit, and know
not what the spirit is, but the scripture tels us that the spirit
is the power of God, and the appearance of Christ, <hi>Luke 1. 35.
chap.</hi> 24. 49. the power of the most High, that is, the spirit, <hi>Acts
2. 4. 2. Cor.</hi> 13. 4. compared with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. the spirit then
is the coming forth of the power of God, and therefore <hi>we
must not look upon the spirit as a person in the Godhead:</hi> poor
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45459:20"/>
people are miserably puzled about this, and therefore I will
shew it out of the scripture. There is but one God and that is
the Father, in whom all power is. 2. When this power comes
forth, it is the spirit. 3. All the power of God comes through
Christ, and therefore Christ is called the power of God, nay
the spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In their divinity yonder, they will say, the Father is not the
Son, the Son is not the Spirit,</hi> but I say that Christ is the spirit,
that is, <hi>Christ in his appearance is the Spirit, John</hi> 14. 16, 17 18.
The spirit shall come, that is, I will come and comfort you, <hi>the
power of God shall appeare in me, so then the other comforter that
he would send was not another third person, but the power of God
appearing in Christ,</hi> therefore <hi>let us not be cheated in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our Religion;</hi> read 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17 18. The Lord Christ is
that spirit, that is, he in whom the power of God is, the 18.
<hi>vers.</hi> is best translated in the Margin of your Bibles of <hi>the Lord
the Spirit,</hi> Christ then is the Spirit. Beloved, that we may be in
a maze no longer, let us know God aright as he is.</p>
            <p>1. There is one God.</p>
            <p>2. As there is one God, so we read that there is the Father,
the Son, and the Spirit. Now these three are not three persons
in the Godhead, but they are severall appearances of God unto
men. As <hi>God is in himselfe and of himselfe, so he is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. As <hi>God comes forth in the man Christ Jesus,</hi> as the fulnesse
of the Godhead dwels in him <hi>that is the Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>God coming forth in power is the Spirit.</hi> We do not by
this deny the Godhead of the Son, but <hi>shew what we hold of the
personalities, they are but the inventions of men.</hi> The Spirit is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the power of God in the man Christ, and therefore
<hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. there is no mention of a <hi>third person.</hi> And in the Book
of the <hi>Revelation</hi> there is <hi>no praise given to the Spirit,</hi> but all
to the Father who sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb, to
the man Christ Jesus, in whom God dwels bodily, <hi>as he doth in
the Saints.</hi> Now then this is that I <hi>drive at,</hi> that as soone as we
know Christ in us, and that we are anointed in him, then the
spirit of the Lord shall come upon us, that is <hi>the power of the
power from on high,</hi> there will be the appearance of Christ in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45459:21"/>
us; this is plain to me, I trust it is so to you. We shall have the
appearance of Christ (as <hi>David</hi> had) in our <hi>sufferings, sayings,
songs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. In our sufferings, <hi>for our sufferings are as</hi> Davids <hi>were,
the sufferings of God: our sufferings are as Christs were, most
from God,</hi> Matth. 26. 38. Mark 14. 33. <hi>why did Christ take
some Disciples to pray with him? why, because</hi> he was affraid
to pray alone; <hi>and he prayed the same words thrice, because</hi> he
was amazed and could not go forward, <hi>but prayed the same
words</hi> over and over; and it hath bin so with me when I had the
spirit of bondage. <hi>You talk much of</hi> a man crucified at <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
some hundred years ago; it is no such great matter to know
that Christ suffered at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> but to know that we suffer as
the Son, that our iufferings are the sufferings of God, there is the
mystery: I dare not say any more, for the time is not yet come to
speak the truth; only thus, <hi>David</hi> filled up what was before, and
we fill up what is behind of the sufferings of Christ, Col. 1. 24. Rev.
12. 11. <hi>all our sufferings are the bloud of the Lamb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In our sayings as <hi>David, Psal. 22. 22. Hebr. 2. 11, 12.
John 8. 28. Psal. 71. 17. David</hi> never went to School and hee
knew hidden things.</p>
            <p>3. In songs, Christ did sing in <hi>David,</hi> we must sing in Christ
we set up our selves when we do not speake and do things <hi>as the
power of God, and in the appearance of Christ;</hi> we shall be as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
as <hi>Saul</hi> if the Godhead do not appeare in us, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It was as we conceived high time to call Mr. <hi>Erbury</hi> to an
account, after so many fair warnings given him and so many
foul errors preached by him, both to Scholars and Citizens; but
because Master <hi>Erbury</hi> his followers were as confident as hee
was, that no man was able to disprove or refute him; one of
our company undertook that Task, and offered to do it in the
publick Schooles, the fittest place for Scholars to dispute in, but
Master <hi>Erbury</hi> desired that the meeting might be at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
Church upon Monday the 11 of <hi>January</hi> at two of the
clock in the afternoon, because some of his followers were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to meet at Schools: They met accordingly; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
desired leave to explaine himselfe; and began much after
this manner:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:45459:21"/>
Friends, and Fellow-soldiers, and you gentlemen Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
I am come hither this day to answer a publike Charge,
and a private Challenge, &amp;c. Whereas it did appeare indeed
that <hi>M. Erbury</hi> his Adherents made the Challenge; but
that was not insisted on, Master <hi>Erbury</hi> had fair leave to
proceed in his Apology. He said that it was not his custome
to speake any thing dogmatically, for he did proceed in all his
Lectures by way of inquiry. How true this Apology is may
appear by the extracts of his three sermons before: and if it
had been true, yet it is <hi>no Apology;</hi> for this is to be a meer
Sceptique, and the ready way <hi>to teach his Auditors to question
all things, and hold nothing.</hi> But Master <hi>Erbury</hi> was not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to own this deceit, for he presently added that he spake
not as a Minister to them, for he had renounced his M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nistery
long since in the presence of the Bishops, nor did he speake as
a gifted man knowing the mystery of Christ, but as one that
was to <hi>seeke,</hi> and therefore (said he) we are now upon a way
of enquity, we are <hi>seeking out</hi> David <hi>and the King,</hi> according
to that Prophesie, <hi>Hosea</hi> 3. 5. For I find that <hi>Christ is a mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
hidden, not manifested by the Prophets or the Apostles,</hi> for
the Apostles, saith he, did but see Christ in a Glasse darkly; but
we, saith he, behold the glory of God shining in the man Christ,
<hi>the face of Christ, that is, the person of Christ, and</hi> we have Christ
in us the hope of glory, and that is indeed <hi>The mystery, Coloss.
1. 27. Christ as without us is not the mystery, but Christ as in us,
Christ as born in us, suffering and rising in us, for our sufferings
are the filling up of Christs sufferings, Coloss.</hi> 1. 24. Now though
<hi>Paul</hi> knew Christ suffering in him, yet <hi>Paul</hi> confesseth that he
had not attained to the resurrection of the dead, <hi>Phil. 3. 10.
11. This mystery then was manifested only in part to the Apostles,
and primitive Christians:</hi> but ever since the Apostles ceased,
this mystery hath been a sealed book, as you may see, <hi>Revel. 5.
1.</hi> 2. 3. He that sits upon the Throne is God, <hi>even the Father
God himselfe.</hi> The book is sealed with seven seals, that is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
sealed, and no man in Heaven or Earth, or under the
earth, is able to open this Booke, but this Booke shall be opened
again when Christ shall come in his spirit in the Saints, <hi>Revel.
10.</hi> 1. 2. this little book contains the mystery, Christ in us the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45459:22"/>
hope of glory; And when the seventh Angel doth begin to
sound, the mystery of God shall be finished, <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. 7. Now
this mystery is nothing else but Christ in the Saints, that is,
<hi>Christ is not a distinct person from the Saints;</hi> for the Saints
and the Son make one perfect man, <hi>Ephesians 4. 7. 8. 9. 12. 13.
Master Erbury</hi> had many other excursions before he came to
the question: to which it was replyed, but we shall give you a
brief account. <hi>Master Cheynell</hi> desired to know of <hi>Master
Erbury</hi> what that mystery was, which <hi>Master Erbury</hi> was
better acquainted with then the Apostles, or primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
whether it was the mystery of faith and godlinesse, a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
necessary to salvation; if it were necessary to salvation; then
sure it was sufficiently revealed to the primitive Christians:
but <hi>if it be not a saving mystery</hi> saith Master <hi>Cheynell let us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
trouble the people with it.</hi> 2. Master <hi>Cheynell</hi> desired to
know <hi>how Master</hi> Erbury <hi>came to open that booke, which no
man in heaven or earth can open. 3. Master</hi> Cheynell asked
him whether the seventh Trumpet had yet sounded. 4. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Master</hi> Erbury had any <hi>new revelations which were not
contained in the Scripture. 5. Whether he made himself an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
a Prophet, or of some higher order,</hi> because he pretended
that there would be <hi>no Ministry till new Prophets and Apostles
were sent to gather the people of God dispersed abroad and intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that he himselfe knew more of the mystery of Christ then the
Prophets or Apostles. Master</hi> Erbury would not give any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
answer to any of these questions; for he said they were
ensnaring questions: To which <hi>Master</hi> Cheynell replyed, why
then our meeting will be to little purpose, if you will neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
or vindicate your doctrine; But the truth is, <hi>Master</hi>
Erbury saw he had overshot himself in these elaborate extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies,
rather then expositions; for if he had said that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Trumpet had not yet sounded, then it would have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed:</p>
            <p>1. That the mystery which <hi>Master</hi> Erbury pretends to be
so well acquainted with is <hi>yet sealed,</hi> and not revealed to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
Erbury, or any other.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Master</hi> Erbury by his exposition of <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.
4.</hi> compared together, doth overthrow his own opinion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45459:22"/>
and confirme ours, if the seventh Trumpet hath not yet soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
for by both places layd together, if Master <hi>Earbury</hi> his
exposition be solid, <hi>Pastors and Teachers must be continued in
the Church, till the mystery be finished,</hi> and therefore <hi>till the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Trumpet hath sounded, Revel.</hi> 10. 7. But the mystery,
sayth Master <hi>Earbury,</hi> will not be finished till Christ and the
Saints are made one perfect man, <hi>Ephes. 4. 11, 12, 13. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is still need of Pastors and Teachers in the Church if</hi>
the seventh Trumpet hath not yet sounded, and Master <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
hath but deluded the people in pretending to declare a
secret to them, which will not be declared till the seventh
Trumpet hath sounded. Master <hi>Cheynell</hi> did likewise desire
them to observe that Master <hi>Earbury</hi> did intimate that <hi>God the
Father only is God of himselfe, and that the Saints are equall to
Christ;</hi> but enough of that anon; After many circumlocutions
Master <hi>Earbury</hi> did at length descend to the question, and laid
downe this Thesis,
<q>The Saints have the same fulnesse of the Godhead dwelling
in them, in the same measure though not in the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation,
as it doth in Christ: but the Godhead shall
be manifest in the same manner and measure in the Saints
as it is in Christ.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Earbury</hi> indeavoured to prove this proposition by the
14 of John from the 2 <hi>verse</hi> to the 20. From the 2 and 3 <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
he raised this observation, <hi>That Christ ascended that he
might receive the fulnesse of the Godhead for himselfe, that so he
might impart it unto us;</hi> because he went to prepare a place
for us, that he might come againe and receive us to himselfe
that where he is we might be also: but Christs mansion was <hi>in
the Father,</hi> verse 10. <hi>therefore our mansion is to be in the Father,
and the fulnesse of the Godhead is to be imparted to us as it is to
Christ. For the Father is the Godhead,</hi> and we are to be in the
Father, and the Father to dwell in us, <hi>as he dwelt in Christ, and
Christ in the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this exposition there were these exceptions taken by our
brother.</p>
            <p>1. Christ had the fulnesse of the Godhead before his ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45459:23"/>
and therefore Christ did not ascend that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the fulnesse of the Godhead.</p>
            <p>2. If the Godhead were imparted to any Saint, that Saint
would be as Christ is, truly God.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Saints are not in the Father, as Christ is in the Father;</hi>
for the divine Persons are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>quia</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they are in
one another because they have one and the same infinite es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
they are all three one and the same God.</p>
            <p>4. The Father is not the Godhead, because the Father if
we speak properly, is the first Person, the Godhead is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all three Persons.</p>
            <p>His next Argument was taken from <hi>John</hi> 14. 12. The Saints
have a greater power then ever Christ had, for every one that
believes in Christ may doe greater works then ever Christ did.</p>
            <p>Our brother answered, that the speech was <hi>limited,</hi> they
should doe greater works then <hi>these,</hi> that is, greater then the
miracles which Christs speech referred to, and therefore Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Earbury</hi> did ill to interpret the Text, as if the words were
to be simply and universally taken, when it is evident that
they are to be restrained <hi>quoad materiam subiectam;</hi> for Christ
did satisfie the justice of God for the sins of all the elect, which
no Saint could ever have done. M. <hi>Earbury</hi> was asked whether
he would acknowledge that Christ satisfied Gods justice for
the sins of all the elect? but he would not answer yea, or no,
but said that M. <hi>Cheynell</hi> endeavoured to intrap him. M. <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
said that the Apostles gaue the Holy Ghost, which was a
greater work then ever Christ did. M. <hi>Cheynell</hi> desired him to
prove that the Apostles gave the Holy Ghost as Christ did, by
their owne immediate power, or prove that Christ did not
give the Holy Ghost. M. <hi>Earbury</hi> replyed, that Christ did not
give the Holy Ghost before his ascension; and so retreated to
his first hold, as if Christ had ascended, that he might receive
such a fulnesse of the Godhead as did enable him to give the
Holy Ghost. Our brother desired them who were accquainted
with the Socinian controversies, to observe that <hi>M. Earbury</hi>
had not his revelation from Heauen, but <hi>Poland:</hi> and desired
<hi>M. Earbury</hi> to consider that Christ satisfied for the sins of the
elect before his Ascension</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:45459:23"/>
M. <hi>Earbury</hi> his next proof was taken from <hi>John 14. 20. 21.
Joh.</hi> 17. 5. 21. 22. from whence he collected that the same fulness
of the Godhead was given to the Saints w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Christ,
for the Saints have the same glory because they are one with
Christ, perfectly one with him, <hi>as the Father is one with him,</hi> &amp;
therefore the fulnesse of the Godhead dwels in them. The same
glory which Christ asks for in the 5 <hi>verse,</hi> he gives to the Saints
<hi>verse</hi> 22. of the 17 of <hi>John, there is the same union between
Christ and the Saints, which is between Christ and this Father,
verse</hi> 21. 23. the same love <hi>verse</hi> 23. I say the same love, saith
M. <hi>Earbury,</hi> speake in as <hi>high a measure as you will, I will prove
the same measure, nay there is a higher measure of love expressed
to the Saints, then to Christ, though in a mystery, there is the same
love and the same union,</hi> that is, <hi>an union of love.</hi> Many answers
were given to this Argument which need not be repeated. To
that concerning union with Christ, it was answered to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
That the union betweene Christ and the Saints is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a mysticall union by faith, or a morall union by love, or a
glorious union by a beatificall fruition. And because <hi>M. Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
pressed the word <hi>(as:) one with the Father as Christ is
one;</hi> our brother answered, that there was a received distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
among Divines, <hi>sicut veritatis, sicut aequalitatis, sicut simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudinis.</hi>
(As) doth sometimes note onely the truth of a thing;
and so the union between Christ and the Saints is a true union,
a reall though a mysticall and spirituall union. 2. (As) notes
no <hi>equality</hi> in that place of <hi>John,</hi> though it may note a <hi>simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
so the proportion and distance be observed betweene
creatures and their Creator. Finally, <hi>M. Cheynell</hi> told him
that the interpretation smelt too strong of <hi>Poland,</hi> when he
intimated <hi>that there was only an union of love, between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Christ,</hi> for there is also <hi>an union of nature;</hi> but there
is not an union of nature between God and the Saints: the saints
are joyned to Christ by faith, and are therefore <hi>one spirit</hi> with
him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. but they are not <hi>one God</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then</hi> M. Earbury <hi>insisted very long upon</hi> Coloss. 2. <hi>because
that Chapter doth explain the mystery of God</hi> even the Father,
<hi>and of Christ,</hi> verse 2. <hi>though the Spirit that is the power of
God (as we said before)</hi> even Christ, <hi>who is the wisdome of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45459:24"/>
God, and the power of God doth manifest himself,</hi> Joh. 14. 21.
<hi>The Father is the</hi> eternall God, God in himself and of himselfe
greater then all, and highest of all: the Father is the Godhead,
and he fils the man Christ with all the fulnesse of the Godhead,
<hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 9. For Christ hath all given to him as the Saints have;
and as <hi>there is the fullnesse of the Godhead in Christ, so is
there also in the Saints, For they are</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> verse 10.
<hi>which is rendred</hi> compleat, now the Saints are not compleat till
they are filled with all the fulnesse of God <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 19. filled with
love, for God is love, and that love wherewith we are filled is God:
filled with Christ the wisdome of God, and with the spirit the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God, with those three that are in Heaven: <hi>this is the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and it is incomprehensible, for the</hi> love of God to Christ and
the Saints is Incomprehensible.</p>
            <p>We fear that you would be tired out, if all that was obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
against this exposition should be related; but it must be
observed, first, that when M. <hi>Earbury</hi> speaks of God, he saith,
<hi>[God even the Father]</hi> and when he mentions the Father, he
saith, the Father is <hi>God himselfe,</hi> the <hi>eternall God</hi> &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he doth intimate, that Christ is not <hi>God of himself, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
God, equall to his Father.</hi> Our brother therefore took ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
against these expressions, because they seemed not
to drop from M. <hi>Earbury,</hi> but to be affected since they were
so often repeated. M. <hi>Cheynell</hi> offered to prove that <hi>Christ is
God by nature, God of himselfe equall to his Father.</hi> M. <hi>Earbury</hi>
replied, dear Sir, you are not to dispute, but to answer what
I object; whereas indeed M. <hi>Earbury</hi> was to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent,
and did make a Speech instead of a Supposition for
the explication of his Thesis, and therefore M. <hi>Cheynell</hi> should
have had free liberty to have disputed, and M. <hi>Earbury</hi> was
engaged to answer his arguments, but when that would not
be permitted, and M. <hi>Earbury</hi> desired our brother to consider,
that that phrase <hi>God by nature,</hi> was no <hi>Scripture phrase.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Cheynell</hi> replyed, Sir, now it appears that you are not so
well read in Scripture as you pretend to be, you may read the
expression,<note place="margin">Galat. 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 8. and though you will not give me leave
to dispute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet suffer me to expound the place, and shew the
ground of my Exposition: The Apostle shews in this place</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:45459:24"/>
1. <hi>That religious service must be performed to none but to him
that is God by nature,</hi> from hence it will follow, that if Christ be
not God by nature, we ought not to performe religious service
to Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Apostle shews that</hi> they are ignorant of God, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
service to them who are not Gods by nature.</p>
            <p>3. M. <hi>Cheynell</hi> shewed <hi>that Christ was God by nature, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in the form of God, and was God equall to his Father,</hi> and
proved it from <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>subsisting in
the form of God,</hi> thought it no robbery to be equall with God.
<hi>He who is in the form of God, and without prejudice to the Father
equall to him must needs be God by nature, the selfe same God</hi>
(though not person) <hi>with the Father;</hi> and therefore an <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi>
God, <hi>God in himself, God of himself,</hi> the <hi>eternall God. It
is robbery to make more Gods then one, It is robbery to make the
Saints equall with God, but it is no robbery to make God the Son
equall with God the Father, because Christ is God by nature,</hi> but
no Saint is God by nature; the fulnesse of the Godhead, all
the fulnesse of the Godhead dwels, and dwels bodily, that is,
really, (for body is opposed to shadow) in the person of the
Lord Jesus. And therefore it is evident, that the same fulnesse
of the Godhead which is in Christ, is not truly and really in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Saint. <hi>The Congregation received this exposition with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
shout and acclamation; but M.</hi> Cheynell <hi>desired them to
forbear, and told them that if he could not intreat them to be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
he would silence himselfe and proceed no further, least such
testimonies of approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might give offence or cause disturbance.</hi>
2. Desired the company to take notice that M. <hi>Earbury</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Spirit, <hi>the power of God,</hi> almost as oft as he had occasion
to mention the Spirit, which expression did too plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that M. <hi>Earbury</hi> held correspondence with the Socinians
in their hereticall opinions. M. <hi>Earbury</hi> professed that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read any of their writings, and yet when M. <hi>Cheynell</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
between the spirit and the graces of the Spirit, a
little after, M. <hi>Earbury</hi> forgot himself, and said, that was a
Polandisme, conceiving that the spirit was by that distinction,
imprisoned in Heaven, and he began to tell a story of some
cast out by a Synod for such expressions: and when M. <hi>Chey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:45459:25"/>
did distinguish afterward between Christ considered as a
<hi>glorifiedman,</hi> and as <hi>the Lord of glory;</hi> M. Earbury said, <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
man was one of the Polonian expressions:</hi> let the Reader
judge whether M. <hi>Earbury</hi> never read any of the Polonian
Writers. 3. Our brother desired M. <hi>Earbury</hi> to deal plainely
and clearly with him; whether he did acknowledge and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
three Persons and one God? our brothers question was
grounded upon M. <hi>Earbury</hi> his mention of three in Heaven,
and yet his frequent confounding of the Son with the Spirit;
for sure if the Son be the Spirit, as he doth commonly preach,
there cannot be <hi>three</hi> in Heaven, for <hi>the Son and the spirit are
but one as he conceives;</hi> nay, there will be but one in Heaven,
for the Son is nothing but the wisdome of the Father, or the
power of the Father, and so there will be no more divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in Heaven, but the Father only. Besides, M. <hi>Earbury</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Father is the <hi>true God, and God is love, and the Son
is wisdome, and the spirit is power,</hi> M. <hi>Earbury</hi> seemed to put
off his Auditory with a <hi>Trinity of Attributes, instead of a Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Persons,</hi> and consequently to make <hi>many Threes</hi> in Heaven,
for <hi>iustice, mercy, eternity, will make another three in this sense.</hi>
But M. <hi>Earbury</hi> said, that he came not thitherto be catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
but it was easie to reply that he came thither to explaine
himself, and satisfie the Congregation, which could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be done unlesse he would give positive answers to perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
questions. M. <hi>Earbury</hi> told us, that the fulnesse of the
Godhead should be revealed more clearely hereafter in the
flesh of the saints at the sound of the seventh Trumpet, but it
was more clearely revealed in the Prophets, then by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
becasue the Apostles were most taken up with writing
about <hi>Faith and particular things,</hi> yet <hi>John</hi> the Divine wrote
clearly of it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 2. and therefore he pronounced all them
to be <hi>Antichristian, who did not believe that there is the same
fulnesse of the Godhead in Christ and all the saints,</hi> which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be very cleare from the 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 2. 3. that is, saith
he, <hi>whosoever denies that Christ is in us, is Antichrist,</hi> for by
flesh is not meant the <hi>humane nature,</hi> saith M. <hi>Earbury,</hi> but
<hi>the coming of Christ is the manifestation of the Godhead in the
flesh of Saints, for Christ himselfe is the Spirit with God.</hi> Our
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45459:25"/>
brother was here forced to lay open M. <hi>Earbury,</hi> and declare
that M. <hi>Earbury</hi> conceived that Christ was man before the
world was, and therefore though he came into the world to
be made of a woman, yet he came not to be made <hi>man,</hi> but to
be made <hi>flesh.</hi> Hereupon Mr. <hi>Earbury</hi> charged our brother
with revealing of secrets, and said, that he had delivered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to that purpose in a private Conference. Our brother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
that he had not spoken a word about that Argument,
if M. <hi>Earbury</hi> had not led him into it, by his perplexed dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and pronounced such a censure upon all men, that are
not of his mind, as to say, they are Antichristian.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Earbury</hi> insisted much upon <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 19. That ye
may be filled with all the fulnesse of God;<note place="margin">See learned M. <hi>Bayne</hi> his Annotations upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians.</note> which our brother
said, was to be expounded by <hi>John</hi> 1. 16. of his fulnesse we
have all received grace for grace. Divers are said in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be full of the Holy Ghost when they are <hi>sufficiently
enabled to perform the dutyes which belong to their present estate
and are growing up towards that fulnesse, which all the Saints
shall enioy when God is all in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>M. Earbury</hi> seemed most confident when he came to
urge his arguments, taken out of the Book of the <hi>Revelations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first was drawen from <hi>Reuel. 2. 26. The Saints haue the
same power over the nations to crush and breake them that Christ
himselfe hath.</hi> The answer was, that the Saints did not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by their owne strength, but by the strength of Christ.
Christ doth overcome, and we triumph, we have a share in that
victory which Christ gaines by his owne arm, <hi>John</hi> 16. 33 True
saith <hi>M. Earbury,</hi> but the Son hath <hi>no power of himself,</hi> he hath
all from the Father, and so have the Saints, and the Saints have
the same power that Christ hath.</p>
            <p>Our brother denied this bold assertion,<note place="margin">Bold asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> because the Saints
are not Omnipotent, nor hath the Father given power to the
Saints to quicken <hi>whome they will,</hi> nor have the Saints <hi>life in
themselves,</hi> as the Son hath <hi>life in himselfe,</hi> and the Father <hi>in
himselfe, John</hi> 5. 21, 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His next argument was taken from</hi> Revel. 3. 21. The Saints
have the same honour, worship, throne, glory, that the Son hath, nay
the same with the Father, and therefore they have the same God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:45459:26"/>
Our brother answered, that <hi>hard and obscure places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
should be expounded by plaine places.</hi> But it is clear that all
men ought to honour the Son even as they honour the Father,
<hi>John</hi> 5. 23. and it is as clear that the <hi>Saints are not to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as the Father is,</hi> whom M. <hi>Earbury</hi> acknowledgeth to be
<hi>God of himself, highest of all, and greatest of all:</hi> to give that
honour to the Saints, which is due to the Father is <hi>Robbery
and Idolatry, and to maintaine that it is due to the Saints is loud
blasphemy.</hi> There was another answer given more direct to
that very Text, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 21. our brother observed a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Thrones expresly mentioned in the very Text; The
Saints shall sit with Christ in <hi>his Throne;</hi> but Christ sits with
his Father in his <hi>Fathers Throne:</hi> Christ therefore must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as a <hi>glorified man,</hi> and so the Saints shall sit upon the
same Throne that Christ sits on <hi>as a glorified man:</hi> but if Christ
be considered as the <hi>Lord of Glory,</hi> as the same God with his
Father, so he sits upon the <hi>same Throne with his Father.</hi> Now
though Christ promise that the Saints shall sit with him in <hi>his</hi>
Throne, yet he doth not say, that they shall sit downe <hi>in his
Fathers Throne as he himself doth</hi> who is in the Father, and one
God with the Father. Nothing is more clear in Scripture then
that <hi>no man save he that is God-man is to be advanced to the
right hand of the Maiesty on high, above all that is named in the
world to come, Ephes.</hi> 1. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>His third argument out of the Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> was
grounded upon <hi>chapter</hi> 21. 7. They who <hi>inherit all things</hi> have
the same fulnesse of the Godhead in them which Christ had
who was <hi>heir of all things, Heb.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
            <p>Our brother answered, that Christ is the <hi>naturall Heir</hi> of
God, that we are the <hi>adopted Heirs of God.</hi> Christ is Heir of
all things <hi>by nature,</hi> because he is God <hi>by nature,</hi> but the Saints
are Heirs by <hi>free grace;</hi> whatever blessings they inioy from
their election to their glorification, proceeds from free and
rich grace, <hi>as they are elected, so are they called, iustified, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and glorified by free grace.</hi> And the first Chapter to the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> doth put a distinction between Christ and the Saints,
as is evident by the worke <hi>of Creation, v.</hi> 2. his <hi>satisfaction, v. 3.
his eternall generation, v.</hi> 5. we must not say to a Saint as God
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45459:26"/>
doth to Christ <hi>[Thy Throne ô God endureth for ever,</hi> vers. 8.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Erbury</hi> promised us three Arguments more and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to draw them up into form.</p>
            <p>His first Argument was taken from <hi>Isay</hi> 61. 1. to 7. They
who are annointed as Christ, are to preach the Gospel to the
World, and whom the World shall own as the only Ministers
of Christ, and shall honour as the Son, they have the fulnesse of
the Godhead in them: but the Saints are annointed with the
Godhead, &amp;c. therefore.</p>
            <p>There being but one clause of the major pertinent to the point
in hand, M. <hi>Erbury</hi> was desired to prove that <hi>the saints were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
with the Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Erbury <hi>endeavoured to prove it by this Argument.
They</hi> who know all things are annointed with the Godhead: but
the Saints know all things, therefore the Saints are annointed with
the Godhead.</p>
            <p>Our brother shewed that this was a fallacy, <hi>à dicto secundum
quid ad dictum simpliciter:</hi> The answer was, that the Saints do
know all things <hi>suo modo,</hi> that is, all things necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but they doe not know all things simply and universally,
because they are <hi>not omniscient. They who are omniscient are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
with the Godhead; but &amp;c. The Saints are not omnis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
therefore they are not annointed with the Godhead;</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
you see follows from that medium. M. <hi>Cheynell</hi> therefore
made it evident that unlesse [by knowing all things] was meant
that they were omniscient, the major was false; if he took those
terms in one sense in the major, and another in the minor, it
was a false Syllogisme, consisting of four terms, as may appear
to the eye.
<q>They who are omniscient are annointed with the Godhead.
But the Saints know all things necessary to salvation,
therefore the saints are annointed with the Godhead.</q>
            </p>
            <p>M. <hi>Erbury</hi> said that Omniscient was no scripture-terme,
our brother desired him to prove <hi>that the Saints knew as much
as God knoweth,</hi> or take some other medium; for though it
was impossible to prove the proposition denied, yet he might
finde out some more probable medium. <hi>Mr. Erbury</hi> tryed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other wayes but could not conclude, and therefore our
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45459:27"/>
brother being almost quite spent, concluded the exercise as he
began with prayer.</p>
            <p>We shall not stand to make generall observations upon all
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Erbury's</hi> dictates, but the designe is evident, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy
and Ministry of this Kingdome are both aimed at,
because godly Ministers preach up the power of Magistrates,
and prudent Magistrates countenance pious Ministers who
were ordained (by a Colledge of Ministers <hi>separated</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi>
and Antichrist, by a professed subjection to Jesus Christ) and
set apart to preach the Gospel of Christ, by which all discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Christians know, Antichrist hath been much weakned, and
will in time be quite overthrown. Nay, it is cleare that all wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded
policy for the affairs of this life, is grounded upon
Religion; for God, and so godlinesse under God by his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
heaps all blessings upon the wisest, and wel-built <hi>State,</hi> it
doth uphold and maintaine all Common-weals in an happy
order, and makes a land to become the land of <hi>Immanuel;</hi>
now the Christian religion cannot be upheld without a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Ministry; for if a Ministry had not been necessary, Christ
would not have instituted it; being necessary, Christ will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
it, for Christ will not be wanting to his Churh in things
that are necessary for its edification and encrease; the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
then being instituted, and therefore necessary, must be
maintained; for no Christian or company of Christians must
presume to abolish an Institution of Jesus Christ. The end of
the Ministry is to work upon the conscience for the restraint
of sin, and to beget such graces as do incline both Governors
to rule, and inferiors to obey according to the word; finally
to nourish justice and charity, temperance and fortitude,
amongst all sorts of men, and therefore <hi>the Ministry doth in
its order by Gods blessing much serve for the preserving of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weals,
the glorifying of God, and the saving of souls.</hi> They
then that are enemies to the Ministry, are enemies to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of States and Churches. When M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Erbury</hi> can prove that
the saints are equall to Jesus Christ, we will acknowledge that
the saints may both preach, and ordaine Preachers.</p>
            <p>We were bold upon such sad considerations as these, to write
this following Letter to our Noble and more victorious then
triumphant Generall.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:45459:27"/>
                  <opener>May it please your Excellency,</opener>
                  <p>TO take these few lines into your saddest thoughts: We are
commanded to give an account to the <hi>Parliament</hi> of the state
of this Vniversity, and City, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Erbury</hi> doth publickly deliver
divers blasphemous errours in this City, such as these, <hi>That the
fulnesse of the Godhead doth dwell in the Saints in the same
measure, though not in the same manifestation as it doth in
Christ; and that the Godhead shall be after the same manner
in the saints, as it is in Christ; the Saints shall have the same
worship, honour, Throne, glory, that Christ hath, and a more
glorious power to do greater works then ever Christ did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Ascension.</hi> He will not acknowledge <hi>That Jesus Christ
is God of himselfe, God by nature, and the same true God with
the Father;</hi> the truth is, we are not able to recount all his errours
and blasphemies, but he hath been dealt with, first by Letter, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
by Conference he was admonished in private, and (when
he would not cease to seduce divers godly persons of this City who
are committed to our care by both Houses of Parliament) he was
publickly refuted in the Vniversity Church. Colonel <hi>Ingol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(as we are assured) casheered him, and yet he continues in the
Garrison; we make our addresse to your Excellency before we
make any complaint, or give up our account to the Parliament
(which must be done within this moneth) that your Excellency and
we that are so deeply entrusted, may both give up our account with
ioy. The rest of our brethren are of our iudgment, but are not
now present with us. Nay, it is granted by all in our Assembly,
that none are to be tolerated, whose errours are contrary to the
common principles of Christianity, and we do thankefully remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
when we received such noble entertainment at your Quarters,
that you did zealously declare your iudgment against a licentious
spreading of damnable doctrings: We recommend this weighty
businesse to your care, and you and your Army to God as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth</p>

            <p>Upon the receipt of this Letter, his Excellency returned this

                  <opener>Gentlemen,</opener>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Cannot but acknowledge this as a very good respect to me and
this Army, to give me Cognizance of what you apprehend tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
M. <hi>Erbury,</hi> before you make more publick addresses, as
likewise of your fair and religious carriage to him, in admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and reasonable debate with him; I hope I shall take care to
prevent your further trouble in this matter; and therefore have
sent to him to appear before me; I should be unwilling to be found
one, who should either countenance any member of this Army, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing
the civill peace and power (under whose protection we all
are) or maintaining such Errours as impeach a greater power and
soveraignty, to which all men (who professe themselves Christians)
must acknowledge themselves subiect: And this is all, that at
this time I shall trouble you with, with this further desire; That
in such cases as these (if any hereafter happen) you would continue
the same love and respect unto me, which is, and shall be very much
acknowledged by,</p>

            <p>We humbly conceive it altogether needlesse to give any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
account of the University in regard the Visitation approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and therefore we shall not anticipate their work.</p>
            <p>As for the City, we must needs say, we have found among
many of them much love and respect; we can speak it, (and
we desire to do it to Gods glory) he hath given us some evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
pledges of our Ministry among divers, who have been so
far wrought upon, that they have in a publick manner renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and abominated that bloudy <hi>Oxford</hi>-Oath, which they had
formerly taken, desiring upon a Fasting day to be humbled for
that sin in a speciall manner, and also that the Congregation
would be earnest with God in prayer for a pardon for them.
Others both in the University and City will acknowledge, that
God by us his weak contemned servants hath began that great
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45459:28"/>
and glorious work of grace in their hearts, so that we have had
the lot of <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> some mocked, others sleighted him,
but certain clave to him and believed, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 32. 34.</p>
            <p>Thus have we faithfully and truly given you an account of
the most remarkable passages which have fallen out since our
coming to <hi>Oxford,</hi> in which you may easily see how unjustly we
have been scandalized, how the truth hath by some been bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
how <hi>Heresies</hi> have been fomented, and we trust, in some
measure refuted: And now we hope that the premises may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
both advantage and oportunity to both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to consider seriously of some expedient, for the speedy
preventing of the farther spreading dangerous errours, and the
promoting of our covenanted reformation, as in all parts of the
Kingdome, so especially in this University.</p>
