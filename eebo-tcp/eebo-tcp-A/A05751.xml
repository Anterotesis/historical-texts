         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The greatneſſe of the Wals, the ſafety of the Forts, the beautie of the Houſes, the riches of Columnes, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue drawne into that place all the Marble, I aſper, and Porphyry of the Earth, were the rare wonders of the Architecture, but aboue all theſe things appeared a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Temple, which the pietie of this Prince had conſecrated to the Diuine Wiſdome, vnder the name of <hi>Saincta Sophia,</hi> whoſe building the riches ſeemed in ſome ſort to enuie the glory of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the like deſigne; at the leaſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the time, and the power of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> Seuen rich Lampes miniſtred occaſion to curious ſpirits to obſerue their rare art, they all receiued at one inſtant the ſubſtance which did nouriſh their flames, and one being extinct all the reſt were quencht. This was in the yeare of Grace, three hundred and thirty. Since two tumultuous factions grew in the Citie, who after they had caſt the fire of an vnfortunate Sedition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſpirits of Men, brought the flames into this goodly Temple and burnt it. For this cauſe <hi>Inſtinian</hi> the Emperour employed in the reſtoring thereof, a part of the Treaſures which he had greedily gathered together: He cauſed it to be re-edified with more ſtate then it had beene, and in ſeuenteene yeares he imployed thirty foure Millions of gold, which was the Reuenew of Egypt for that time: He laid a foundation of eight hundred thouſand Duckers of yearely rent, and cauſed this holy and reuerend place to be ſerued by nine hundred Prieſts, Men who had the merit of their beginning from Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Pietie. The Citie being the Queene of the World, within few yeares after, ſaw her reſtorer triumphing ouer the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1212:6"/>
King of Perſia, and had the grace to keepe in her boſome, the precious treaſure of Chriſtianity, a part of the Croſſe of the Redeemer of the World, found by the carefull pietie of the Emperours Mother: her joy, pompe, and luſtre, were growne to that height, as it ſeemed there could be nothing more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: it is by ſucceſſion of time the ſeate of the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narches of the Earth: <hi>Senerus</hi> and <hi>Anthonin</hi> his ſonne did enuy it, and rauiſhed from its reſtorer, the glory to haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, calling it <hi>Anthonia,</hi> by one of their names.

In the yeere 1453. on Tueſday the ſeuen and twentieth of <hi>May,</hi> it was after a long ſiege made a prey to the victorious Turke: <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second of that name, and the eleuenth Emperour of the Turks entred it by force, ſpoyled it, and ſackt it; The Emperour <hi>Conſtantine Paliologo</hi> loſt his life, with a great number of men of quality, and all the Chriſtian men were ſubiect to the Sword, or to the rigour of bondage: the women were a ſport to the lubricity of the Turkes, and their goods ſubiect to their ſpoyle, in reuenge (ſome ſay) of the ſacke and burning which the Grecians made of Troy, from whom they will haue the Turkes to be deſcended: but rather for a puniſhment of the impiety of the Grecians, who blaſpheming againſt Heauen, deny that the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from Ieſus Chriſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon in the ineffable Trinity. <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second of that name, was the firſt that ſetled the <hi>Othoman.</hi> Throne there, They changed the name among them, and called it <hi>Stamboll,</hi> that is to ſay, the great, the Royall, and the abundant.

The forme is Triangular, whereof the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſide is that towards the Serrail, which lookes to the Sea towards the ſeuen Towers, and its vaſt circuit containes about fiue leagues: The wals are of an extraordinary height, with two falſe Brayes towards the Land, and incloſe ſeuen Hils within it. The firſt ſerues as a Theatre to the Imperiall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the Prince, where it is commodiouſly and proudly feated: The laſt lookes vpon the extremity of the fartheſt parts of the Towne oppoſite to this, and vpon the way which leads to Andrinopolis by Land. But betwixt the third and the fourth, where a Valley doth extend it ſelfe called the great, is an Aqucduct of rare ſtructure, which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> cauſed to be drawne ſeuen leagues from the City, and <hi>Solyman</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond aduanced it two Leagues beyond, and increaſed the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of water in ſo great abundance, as they doe ſerue ſeuen hundred and forty Fountaines for the publique, not recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe which are drawne into diuers parts to furniſh the great number of Bathes which ſerue for delights, and the Turkes ſuperſtition.</p>

contained the ſiluer that was coyned and in Ingots: another had diuers armes and ornaments for Souldiers, and the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons for Horſes, enricht with gold, ſiluer and precious ſtones: the fift ſerued for ancient Armes, Medales, and other precious remaynders of Antiquity: the ſixt contained the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines for Warre: and the ſeuenth, the Rols and Records of the Empire; accompanied with a goodly gallery, in the which were placed the rich ſpoyles which <hi>Selym</hi> the firſt brought from Tauris, when he triumphed ouer Perſia. All theſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were carefully kept vntill the Reigne of <hi>Selym</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. But it is in eſtates as with priuate Families. In theſe ſome gather together with much toyle that which their heires waſte prodigally; and ſome Kings heape vp treaſure which ſerue as a ſubiect of prodigality to their Succeſſors. For this Prince baſe and effeminate, who it ſeemes, was not borne but for the ruine of his Empire (if Chriſtians could haue imbraced the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) waſted in the expences of the Nauall Army, which the battaile of <hi>Lepantho</hi> made ſubject to the Christians, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the warre of Cyprus, the beſt part of the immenſe treaſure which his Father had heaped vp in theſe Towres: the reſt ſerued for his laſciuious and diſordered paſſions with his Concubines.

               <p>Conſtantinople hath within the incloſure of the wals aboue two thouſand Moſquees, or Turkiſh Temples built by their Emperors: for we will make no further relation of the rarities
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1212:7"/>
of that Imperiall City, but ſuch as are at this day. Wee may read the wonders of that ancient City in other Authours; and particularly in the Bookes which <hi>P. Gillius</hi> hath written. The chiefe of all theſe Moſquees is that which hath been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in the ancient Temple of <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> called by the Turkes <hi>Ayaſophia</hi>; it hath ſixe goodly and ſumptuous Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, the walls are of bricke, couered in old time both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without with white Marble, Porphyry, and other rich ſtones; they are now of Lead. The open Porches about it haue ſix doores which augment the beauty; foure doores of the Church open at the entry; the height of the Vault couered with Lead, ſhewes the magnificence of the worke: ſixteene great Pillars ſupport it, foure are Iaſper of the Ile of Cyprus, foure are of white Marble, foure of Porphyry, and foure of another ſtone as rich: forty eight other Pillars of leſſe big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but of the ſame matter ſerues to ſupport this great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brique, and a leſſer and lower Vault is ſupported by foure and twenty Columnes of the ſame Marble and Porphyry. The rare Statues and rich Images wherewith <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had adorned it, are no more to be ſeene: <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second had vowed them to the ſack of the City when he tooke it: only an Image of the Virgin who bare the Sonne of God, remaynes whole and vntoucht in the midſt of the Vault, not without a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular prouidence of Heauen: Yet the Turkes draw a vaile croſſe to prohibit the ſight; but this doth not hinder the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by creeping vp by ladders to ſatisfie their deuotion, when as at lawfull houres they may enter into the Moſquee: Now the Turkes haue white-caſt the Vault in diuers parts, to write the Name of God in the Arabique tongue. The breadth and length of this Church may be well comprehended by the height, the which is limited by the ſhot of a Harquebuſſe: vnder it is a Vault full of Altars and Sepulchres, in reſpect whereof the Turkes haue cauſed the doores to be walled vp. In a place neere vnto it are found ten great Piles full of Oyle ſince the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> which haue continued vnto this day free (by reaſon of the low vault) from the fire which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the firſt beauties of this Temple, the long continuance

               </p>
               <p>By theſe vaulted places they deſcended into two hollow Caues which goe vnder the ſtreets of the City, the one leads to the Grand Serraill, and the other goes farre vnder <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> vnprofitable at this day, except the one which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued light by ſome breaches which time hath made, ſerues only to winde ſilke, and brings vnto the Coffers of the <hi>Shaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> or Exchequer, three or foure hundred Zequins of yearely rent. But the goodly and ancient buildings which did adorne this admirable Temple, haue beene ruined by the Turkiſh Emperours, except thoſe which ſerue for a dwelling to ſome Congregations of the Prieſts of the Alcoran.</p>
               <p>Beſides this great and admirable Moſquee, there are foure others of note, the durable markes of the magnificence of the Turkiſh Emperours. The firſt was built by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second, after that hee had triumphed ouer Conſtantinople: He cauſed it to be erected after the Modell of <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> but much leſſe; he enricht it with threeſcore thouſand Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of Reuenue; hee cauſed two hundred faire Chambers to be built about it couered with Lead, as well to lodge the Prieſts which did ſerue, as to receiue all ſtrange Pilgrimes of what Nation or Religion ſoeuer they were, where they are entertained for three dayes: without the Cloyſter are alſo built fiftie other Chambers for poore men. The ſecond Moſque was made by <hi>Baiazet</hi> the ſecond ſoone to the ſaid <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The third by <hi>Selym</hi> the firſt ſonne to this man: and the fourth by <hi>Solyman</hi> ſecond ſonne to <hi>Selym.</hi> Theſe three laſt Princes are euery one buried within the walls of this Moſquee in ſtately Tombes, vpon the which there are continually a great number of Lampes burning, and Turkiſh Prieſts mumbling of the Alcoran, who pray after their manner for the ſoules of theſe Monarches. The moſt ſtately of theſe foure Moſquees is that of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Second, it exceeds in Marble and other rich ſtones the pompe of <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> but it yeelds to the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Architecture, whereunto few could yet attaine.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1212:8"/>
                  <hi>Selym</hi> the Second built his Moſquee in the City of Andrino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis: <hi>Achmat</hi> the laſt employed exceſſiue ſummes of money in the Fabrique of that which he built of late yeares in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople:</hi> the magnificency of the ſtructure exceeds thoſe which we haue mentioned, the Turks call it the new Moſquee, and their Prieſts the Incredulous: for that <hi>Achmat</hi> cauſed it to be built againſt the aduice which they gaue him, that ſuch a worke would not profit his ſoules health, ſeeing that hee had made no conqueſts to enlarge the Empire of their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. For the Law of the ſtate conformable to that Religion, forbids Turkiſh Princes to build any Temples, if they haue not extended the limits of their Empire in the Territories of Chriſtians, where they may cauſe their Alcoran to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: for ſuch workes of piety cannot be vſefull to the health of their ſoules (the <hi>Mufties</hi> ſay) who are oppoſite to ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, if their Emperours would vndertake it.</p>
               <p>The Grecians which are Chriſtians, haue within Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople forty Churches for their diuine Seruice; the Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans haue foure, and the Latines (leſſe fauoured than theſe) haue but two: It is true that moſt of them are lodged at Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, now called Pera, which is on the other ſide of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, where they haue nine Churches for their Deuotions and holy Myſteries. The Iewes haue the credit to be within the City in nine ſeuerall quarters, and haue eight and thirty Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues. They haue gotten more libertie and power then they haue in Chriſtendome, for that they obſerue the formers of the Grand <hi>Siguior,</hi> and moreouer they haue the managing of the Domeſtique Affaires of great Men and Officers of the Port, where they are the common giuers of aduice. The walls of this Imperiall City are yet firme and entire. They are double vpon the firme Land, except it be towards the Gate of <hi>Aya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chapeza,</hi> that is to ſay, the holy Gate, by reaſon of the great number of Religious bodies which were in a Church neere vnto that Gate. <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second entred thereby to defile the holineſſe of the place: there are nineteene Gates aſwell
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1212:9"/>
vpon the firme Land as towards the Sea, which ſerue for an entrance into this City. Many great places are extended for the commodity of the Publike, ſome haue preſerued the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Pyramides, and the workes of Braſſe erected by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperours, amongſt others that which they call <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> where there are to be ſeeene whole Obeliſques; and three great Serpents of Marble creeping vpward wreathed one within the other: One of the which hath a breach in the throat, for <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second entring into the City, had a conceit that they were the worke of ſome enchanting Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and ſpurring on his Horſe to be ſatisfied, hee made this breach with his Launce. There is euery day a publique Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket in ſome one of theſe places. One Friday it is in three, and the moſt famous are of Wedneſday, Thruſday, and Friday, They call them <hi>Schibazars,</hi> that is to ſay, Markets of things neceſſary for vſe. About theſe places are erected aboue two thouſand ſhops for Breakers, who ſell any thing wherewith to furniſh the neceſſity of thoſe which deſire to repaire their want: The sole of this old traſh is not ſo little but it yeilds yearely vnto the Princes Coffers ſix Charges of Mony, which is in value eleuen thouſand Sequins, or foure thouſand, foure hundred pounds ſterling for the Turkiſh exaction makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of euery thing.

ordained, that whoſoeuer ſhould come to ſalute the <hi>Grand Seigneur,</hi> ſhould be led vnder the Armes by <hi>Capigis</hi>; And this cuſtome hath hee carefully obſerued. Wee doe not read that there was euer any ſtranger but ſuffered this Rigour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept an Embaſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> named <hi>Monſieur Nouailles</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aix,</hi> who was ſent to <hi>Selim</hi> the Second, by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, to mediate ſome accommodation for the <hi>Venetians</hi> affaires: comming into the Chamber, when as the <hi>Capigis</hi> had laid hold of his Arme he ſcattered them with his Elbowes, and ſpake aloud, that the libertie of a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the dignitie of a Biſhop could not endure to be led like a ſlaue: And ſo leauing the <hi>Sultan</hi> and thoſe that were in the Chamber amazed, he went freely to his Reuerence, and would not caſt himſelfe at his feet, as others doe, but inclined a little to kiſſe his Robe.</p>
               <p>When the Embaſſadour had kiſt the <hi>Sultans</hi> Robe, who ſits vpon Cuſhions of Cloth of Gold curled, he retires back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with his face alwayes towards the Prince, and plants himſelfe againſt the wall of the Chamber, to giue way to the Gentlemen of his Traine, who goe likewiſe to kiſſe his Robe: And then he preſents the Letter which the King ſends written in the Turkiſh Tongue. The <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> anſweres no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the preſent; his <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> doth only ſpeake ſome wordes to diſmiſſe the Embaſſadour, who goes out of the Chamber hauing made a Reuerence in bending downe his head, but doth not vncouer it. But you muſt obſerue that no man comes to kiſſe his Robe, vnleſſe hee be attired in Robes after the Turkiſh manner, giuen him by the <hi>Sultan,</hi> the which is the Preſent of a Soueraigne to a ſubiect or ſlaue: For this cauſe the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> forgets not to ſend vnto the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour ſuch Robes as are ſet downe by the Ordinance of the Cuſtome of the Empire, that is to ſay, two that are rich for the Embaſſadours perſon, and one for either of his followers. Moreouer euery Embaſſadour muſt haue a Preſent for the <hi>Grand Seigneur,</hi> the which he ſees firſt before him thorow a Lattice window, whither he is carried by <hi>Capigis</hi>: There he buſies himſelfe to looke on it, whileſt the Embaſſadour and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1212:26"/>
his Gentlemen doe their Reuerence; ſo as they can ſee but halfe his face. To this purpoſe a generous action performed by the ſaid <hi>Monſieur Nouailles</hi> Embaſſadour to <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth is worthy to bee related. <hi>Mahomet Grand Vizir</hi> to <hi>Selim</hi> the Second preſt him much not to forget a ſtately Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for his <hi>Sultan,</hi> and ſent him word that if he had none rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die hee would furniſh him. This Embaſſadour went, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to kiſſe his Robe without any Preſent. The <hi>Baſha</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacht him, and imputed it to contempt that hee had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen any. The <hi>Seigneur</hi> of <hi>Nouailles</hi> made anſwere that the King his Maſter, who was the firſt and greateſt Monarch of Chriſtendome, hearing that <hi>Selim</hi> demanded it as a Tribute, had forbidden him to preſent any. Thus in giuing none, he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his Maſter profitably and honourably; leauing among the Turkes a great admiration of his generous dxteritie, and carried backe into <hi>France</hi> the glorie which thoſe Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours deſerue, whom vertue and not fauour haue aduanced to ſuch Charges.</p>
               <p>Other Embaſſadours of inferiour Qualitie to a Royaltie, receiue Robes in like manner to goe and ſalute him: But they enter not into the <hi>Serrail</hi> with ſo much Pompe, neither are they feaſted, nor haue ſo much familiaritie with the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> yea, there are ſome which ſit not in his preſence. Thus the Turks can meaſure the honour which they doe vnto men, according to the Qualitie of the Princes which ſend them, whoſe perſons the Embaſſadours repreſent. They haue long hands and portatiue eyes, to ſee into the Realmes that are moſt remote to their Eſtates:</p>

ſwayed the <hi>Othoman</hi> Scepter, yee ſhall hardly find one which hath not laboured for his liuing. <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured his Gardens, and of the reuenew of the Fruites which were ſold, he cauſed meate to be bought for his mouth. But as the actions of ſuch men, how religious ſoeuer they be, haue not true Charitie for their Guide, they doe eaſily incline to vice. This Prince added to his Manuall labour ſo horrible a crueltie, as it was to be wiſhed his hands had beene idle. We haue written in the Hiſtorie of his Empire, that viſiting one day, (being followed by his Pages) the Squares of hi. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens which he did manure himſelfe; one of the young Boyes ſeeing haſtie Cowcumbers, gathered one and eate it: <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> returning that way found it wanting, his choler enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him to crueltie, hee ſaw by the ſtalke that it was newly gathered, and hee knew that hee had no company but his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and therefore ſome one of them had done the deed, the which he would know at what price ſoeuer: Hee calleth the <hi>Baſtangies</hi> or Gardiners, puts ſharpe Kniues into their hands, and commands them to open the ſtomacks of his Pages: They take them one by one and open fourteene, finding the Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber not yet diſgeſted in the ſtomacke of the fourteenth: Such was the rigour of this Prince, who for a light offence, cauſed fourteene of the goodlieſt young Boyes (the flowre and choice of all the youth of his <hi>Serrail</hi>) to be murthered. <hi>Solyman</hi> the Second, hee which tooke <hi>Rhodes,</hi> ſpent his idle houres in making of Shooes, the which he ſent to the <hi>Bazar</hi> or Market to ſell, and with the money he cauſed victuals to be bought for his Table. <hi>Selim</hi> the Second who loſt the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile of <hi>Lepantho,</hi> made little Creſcents or halfe Moones, which the Turkiſh Pilgrimes carrie vpon their ſtaues, when they goethe Voyage to <hi>Meque.

Another ſhewed the force of his jawes, and his hands: he held a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhooe betwixt his teeth, and puld it in pieces with his hands; He brake a Plough-ſhare, with three blowes with his fiſt; and hee cauſed a piece of Iron to be made red hot, the which hee tooke in his hand licked it with his tongue, rubbed it on his face, and yet was not burnt: Afterward hee cauſed a Goat to dance pleaſantly vpon his ſhoulders, and neuer toucht it, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to paſſe from one ſhoulder to the other without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of the <hi>Grand SEIGNEVRS</hi> Phyſicians, Chyrurgians and Apothecaries.</head>
               <p>GReat Princes in the midſt of their humane felicities are not freed from the croſſes and diſcommodities of life, and much leſſe from the infirmities that afflict them, to the end their pride might be humbled, and they ſhould acknowledge themſelues to be men. The <hi>Sultan</hi> Emperour of the Turkes ſeekes eaſe for his griefes aſwell as other Monarches: He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines vſually for he ſeruice of his perſon, ten Phyſicians of the moſt skilfull of the Eaſt: Moſt part are Iewes, for the men of that Nation ſtudy carefully in Phyſicke, and proſper

well. And ſeeing that the Turkes neglecting Learning doe not attaine to thoſe Sciences which are neceſſary to make a good Phyſician. Amidſt this number there is one ſuperiour to the reſt, called in their Language <hi>Lecchin Baſsi,</hi> or the firſt Phyſician: Their entertainments are great, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents they receiue make them rich: The firſt of them is reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced in the <hi>Serrail,</hi> they ſerue him with the ſame bread they giue vnto the <hi>Sultan,</hi> which is a dainty kind of bread made of the Graine which is gathered at <hi>Burſia</hi> in <hi>Natolia,</hi> reſerued for the Princes mouth: He hath what fauour hee can deſire in Court, and his Maſter honours him extraordinarily: Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie is a powerfull <hi>Daemon,</hi> and his vertue makes him alſo to be honoured. But the merit of Phyſick hath made it ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in the World, and in Court, that many Kings haue crowned it with their owne Diadems:<note place="margin">See what <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius Ficinus</hi> a learned <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> doth write in the firſt Booke in the Epiſtle to <hi>Thomas Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.</note> 
                  <hi>Sabor</hi> and <hi>Gyges</hi> haue practiſed it in their eſtates of <hi>Media: Sabid</hi> married it to his Scepter of <hi>Arabia: Methridatus</hi> to that of <hi>Pontus</hi>: and <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> held it as great a glory to bee a Phyſician in Egypt as to be a Soueraigne King.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Sultan</hi> is ſick, his Phyſicians are cald to viſit him; if they hold his infirmity to be of continuance, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently lodged in the ſecret <hi>Serrail</hi> which is the Princes quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in Chambers neare vnto him: They giue them two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to attend them; and they may not go out of the Pallace, what neceſſity ſoeuer doth preſſe them, vntill the <hi>Sultan</hi> bee recouered or dead. But when hee is in health, they are only bound to goe three of them euery morning, into the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries ſhop in the <hi>Serrail,</hi> and there to attend vntill noone, if there be any need of their helpe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sultans</hi> Chyrurgions and Barbers haue leſſe libertie: They may not goe out of the <hi>Serrail</hi> where they lodge, but on the day of <hi>Bairam,</hi> which is the Turkes Eaſter, vnleſſe it be by the Princes permiſſion: The youngeſt of this profeſſion ſerue him as Pages, ſome others are Eunuches, which attend the ſeruice of his Chamber: Theſe ſhaue him when hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and waſh him in his Bathes, when hee goes to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

the heate which troubles him, or to ſatisfie the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of his Law.</p>
               <p>The Apothecaries are alſo lodged in the <hi>Serrail,</hi> their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber exceeds both the others: So their Seruice is more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. There are eighteene Maſters which worke, and three hundred Boyes which ſerue them, moſt of which goe once a yeare to ſearch for Simples on the Mountaines and Valleyes for the compoſing of their Phyſicke: Foure Maſters moſt expert in their Art are Superiour to all thoſe: They call them the Priors. The ſhop of theſe Apothecaries deſerues ſo many men as ſerues this great Prince, it is aboue fifty fathome long, and halfe in breadth: The great Veſſels which doe beautifie it, furniſh it abundantly with all ſorts of Oiles, Sirrops, Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Waters, and other liquors proper for Phyſicke: On the ſide of it are foure goodly Chambers full of diuers ſorts of Drugs. Beſides theſe there are two others ſcituate towards the Gardens, where during the Spring which doth enamile the Earth with flowres, and the Summer which doth crowne it with Fruits, they draw the eſſences, and diſtill the Waters which are fit for Phyſicke. But in all theſe Veſſels, amidſt theſe Drugs and diuers Quinteſſences, they find not any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which can mortifie the amorous Paſſions of the Prince, wherewith hee is continually afflicted: They deuoure his lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,<note place="margin">Null<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The places and rankes are obſerued according to the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie of their Offices: The <hi>Grand <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>izir</hi> ſits firſt in the midſt of two long formes faſtned to the wals, which looke towards the doore, like vnto the Seats of Audience for juſtice in <hi>France:</hi> On his right hand (which is the leſſe honourable in Turkey) the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> ſeate themſelues: The two <hi>Cadileſquers</hi> are on the left; He of <hi>Romania</hi> or <hi>Greece,</hi> as the moſt noble Prouince, precedes him of <hi>Natolia:</hi> At the entry of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uan</hi> on the left hand, are ſet vpon a forme by themſelues the three <hi>Teftardars:</hi> They haue at their backes all the Notaries or Regiſters, ſitting on the ground with paper and pens in hand, to write what ſhall be commanded.

The parties which demand juſtice, being many in number, are placed in the midſt of the <hi>Diuan,</hi> with ſo great a reſpect and ſilence as they dare not ſpit. This publique Councell is like vnto that of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the <hi>Louver,</hi> with this difference, that in the <hi>Diuan</hi> euery man is admitted for any cauſe whatſoeuer, All theſe Officers being thus placed, the parties plead their owne Cauſes, &amp; they direct their ſpeech to the <hi>Grand <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>izir,</hi> who precides in this Councell: The other <hi>Baſſa's</hi> neuer ſpeake: If he doth judge that the buſineſſe propounded ought to be preſently diſpatcht, he then decides the controuerſies betwixt the parties: If it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a longer inquiſition, hee referres the judgement to one of the <hi>Cadileſquers,</hi> if the matter belong to the Ciuill Law: If it concerne the Treaſure or Accompts, a <hi>Teftardar</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: and when there is Queſtion of any falſhood, or the verification of a hand or writing, he deputes a <hi>Netangi.</hi> The

The <hi>Baſſa</hi> Captaine of the Sea, is alſo of the number of thoſe which aſſiſt in the <hi>Diuan,</hi> he takes his place in the laſt ranke of all the other <hi>Baſſa's</hi> if hee be not a <hi>Baſſa Vizir</hi>; in that caſe hee mounts higher towards the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> in the order of his inception.</p>
               <p>Dinner being thus ended without pompe, without exceſſe, and without diſſolution, the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> diſpoſeth of the moſt notable reſolutions which haue beene taken in the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uan,</hi> and prepares himſelfe to god and make report thereof to the <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi>; On Sunday and Tueſday, which are the dayes of <hi>Diuan</hi> for publique affaires, and the Councell of Eſtate. This Prince deſcends to that effect into a Chamber which is neere vnto it: being arriued, he cals his Officers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1212:63"/>
to him one after another. The <hi>Capigilar Agaſſi</hi> carries this command. He holds in his hand a long ſtaffe of ſiluer, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Beadles Mace: Firſt of all they call the <hi>Cadileſques,</hi> they riſe vp, make a low reuerence to the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> and follow this Mace-bearer and the <hi>Chaoux Baſſi,</hi> who is ioyned vnto him with his other ſtaffe of ſiluer: Vnder their conduct they goe before the <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> into his Chamber, they reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him and in a manner adore him: For there is not any Soueraigne Prince vpon the earth, whoſe ſubiects ſtand in more feare, nor yeeld him ſo much reuerence. After this they yeeld him an account of their places, then they retire back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards like men that had conſulted with ſome great Diuinity, and ſo goe to their houſes. The Mace-bearers goe to fetch the <hi>Teftardars,</hi> theſe yeeld the like ſalutation to the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> that the others had done; they goe before the <hi>Grand Seigneur,</hi> they ſpeake vnto him of his treaſure and of the affaires of their charge; and hauing ſatisfied him, they retire like the reſt, with their heeles firſt. This cuſtome alwayes to turne their face in retiring is not only practiſed with the Prince, but alſo obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the <hi>Baſſa's,</hi> who according to the Lawes of Turkiſh Ciuility, would hold it a contempt, if in parting from them they ſhould turne the backe. After the <hi>Teftardars,</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Sea if he had been in the <hi>Diuan,</hi> goes to relate vnto the <hi>Grand Seigneur,</hi> the eſtate of his Veſſels of Warre, with that of Armes and Munition which are in his Arſenall. The <hi>Aga</hi> or Colonell Generall of the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> which are the Turkiſh foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enters not into the <hi>Diuan,</hi> hee remaines in the ſecond gate of the <hi>Serrail,</hi> being ſet vnder a Gallery aſſiſted by the Souldiers: He goes firſt of all to audience to his Maſter; and returnes to his ſeate, vntill all the reſt be retired; for hee goes laſt out of the <hi>Serrail</hi>: The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>izirs</hi> goe one after one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and being come into his preſence they frame themſelues to an incomparable reſpect: They ioyne their hands, and bend downe their heads and eyes to the ground, and ſtand ſilent: For amongſt them only the <hi>Grand Vizar</hi> may ſpeake vnto the Prince; He comes laſt with a graue pace, as the party that beares the burthen of all the affaires which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1212:64"/>
haue beene treated in the <hi>Diuan</hi>; hee yeelds an accompt vnto his Maſter, who confirmes the judgements, or diſanuls them, as he thinkes good. Moreouer, he leaues him inſtructions in writing, in a Purſe of Crimſon rais'd Veluet, the which hee laye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus the Turkes doe juſtice to men, whereof the quicke expedition might repaire the defects which they meete with, and yet in that place particularly they are reaſonably exact to yeeld vnto euery man that which is due vnto him: The feare of their owne ruine if they had no vertue, were ſufficient to make the ballance eeuen and ſtraight. For the Turkiſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are accuſtomed to goe by one of their Chambers vnto a Window, only ſhut vp with a Lattice, the which lookes into the <hi>Diuan</hi> directly ouer the head of the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi>: From thence he heares what is ſpoken, and treated; with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of parties, and the Decrees of Iudges; if iniquitie doe ſway the minds and mouths of thoſe, to deny vnto the weakeſt the reliefe which juſtice doth owe them, againſt the violent oppreſſions of the Mighty, the puniſhment which hee takes is very exemplary. Doubtleſſe, as the foundations vphold a houſe, ſo juſtice is a ſtrong ſupport vnto an Empire, without the which it cannot long ſubſiſt. Kings, whoſe principall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is to yeeld it vnto men, ought to cheriſh it aboue all things; It doth aduance them aboue other men, and makes them to raigne happily; and without it violence drawes all diſorders in their Eſtates, troubles them, and ruines them in the end: They themſelues without juſtice, are like vnto thoſe bodies which are troubled with the falling ſickneſſe, whom weakneſſe and paine afflicts: This diuine vertue ſhould not only be the ſoule of their Decree, but the ſoule of their ſoule: In juſtice they ſhall poſſeſſe all the other vertues, for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines them all.</p>

               <p>THe Chriſtians labour ſo profitably to inlarge the Turkes Empire, as they not only furniſh them with occaſions, by their wretched diuiſion, but they alſo breed them vp men, which in time are the moſt generous of their troupes, the greateſt in their Court, and the moſt triumphant in Townes &amp; Chriſtian Prouinces: But in this laſt, force and the conſtraint which theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> vſe towards them, makes them more excuſable, than when they abandon the reaſon and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Chriſtianity, to the blind paſſions of a fatall diſcord: For they ſee come into their houſes, thoroughout all <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Morea,</hi> and in the Countrey of <hi>Albania,</hi> a troupe of the <hi>Grand Seigneurs Capigis,</hi> deputed to make the exaction of the richeſt, and the moſt exquiſite Tribute, that can be leuied in a Country, the which is of men, the beſt proportioned, and enricht with the gifts of Nature. There they chooſe the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, the goodlieſt, and the moſt actiue of all their Children, out of euery three one, the which they doe euery third yeere; and hauing drawne together aboue two thouſand, they lead them to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> At their arriuall, they attire them all in Robes of Cloth of diuers colours; they giue vnto euery one a yellow Cap of Felt, like vnto a Sugar-loafe. In this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage they are led before the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> who being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with al the other <hi>Baſſa's</hi> and Miniſters of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rail,</hi> he makes choice of thoſe that are moſt actiue for the war: Theſe young men are ſet apart, and conducted into the <hi>Serrail</hi> by the <hi>Boſtangibaſsi,</hi> or chiefe of the Gardiners, and a part of them diſtributed where they wanted. Then they circumciſe them: being children of Chriſtians they become yong Turks, and for an inconſtant fortune of the World and of the Court, they loſe the eternall happineſſe of Heauen, in the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1212:65"/>
their firſt beliefe had directed them. They cauſe them to learne the Turkiſh Tongue, and if their ſpirits be capable of more, to read and write. But all indifferently are inſtructed to wreſtle, runne, leape, ſhoot, dart an <hi>Azegaye,</hi> and in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Exerciſes, which are fit for them which will make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Armes.</p>
               <p>The reſt of this goodly choice of the young Children of the Tribute is in the power of the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi>; Hee doth lodge them, and diſtribute them diuerſly; ſome are ſent into the <hi>Sultans</hi> Gardens and Houſes of Pleaſure; others are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gallions and Veſſels at Sea, which make Voyages for the <hi>Sultana's</hi>; The Patrons charge themſelues, and are bound to reſtore them when they are demanded. They place a good number in Artificers ſhops to learne diuers trades, whereof they may ſerue for a Squadron when they ſhall be <hi>Ianizaries</hi> and eſpecially in the time of Warre. The <hi>Baſha's</hi> and all the great Men of the Court haue their part; They are deliuered vnto them by their Names, Countries, Markes of their face or elſewhere, and by the colour of their haire; they binde themſelues in writing, which is contained in a Booke for that purpoſe, to the end that if the neceſſitie of the Warre ſhould force the Captaines to fill vp their companies, in the place of thoſe that are dead, they may take theſe to that effect. But moſt commonly they giue the rudeſt and groſſeſt to theſe <hi>Baſha's</hi>; and they imploy them in their Stables, Kitchins, and other baſe Offices of their Houſes. They which remaine of theſe <hi>Azamoglans,</hi> are ſent into diuers Seminaries, vnder the conduct of diuers Eunuches which haue the charge, and take the care to breed them vp, to bee one day capable to beare Armes, and to ſerue in the Warre in qualitie of Ianizaries. Theſe Children thus placed the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> repreſents them in a Booke to the <hi>Grand Seigneur.</hi> This Prince aſſignes them an entertainment according to his pleaſure, and augments the pay which the great cuſtome doth allow them, which is of foure or fiue <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1212:65"/>
be carefull to pay it according to the order: Hee ſees them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery three Moneths, and viſits them one after another, calling them by their names, to know the number of thoſe which are dead, and to ſee how they be fed and gouerned.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Azamoglans</hi> appointed for the ſeruice of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rail,</hi> are imployed about baſe and vile things as the meaneſt of all thoſe which are of the Royall Family: They ſerue for Labourers in their buildings, they imploy them in their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Kitchins, Gardens, to cut wood, and to carry it, to lead Dogges to the field as their Seruants, and to doe whatſoeuer their Superiours command them, whereof ſome haue charge of tens, others of hundreds, and theſe are alſo vnder the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the <hi>Chicaia,</hi> or Steward of the <hi>Boſtangibaſſi</hi>; the toyle they vndergoe, the paines they take, and the miſeries which they indure make them the moſt patient men in the World, and their Maſters inſtruct them to mortification by moſt rigorous courſes: the leaſt fault is rewarded with fiftie blowes with a Cudgell, the which are ſoundly ſet on. But their baſeneſſe is not without honour nor recompence: There are charges and eminent Offices among them to the which they ſucceed by the order of their antiquity, and their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may make them hope and aſpire to the place of a ſteward, yea of <hi>Boſtangibaſſi,</hi> to ſhew that there is nothing ſo baſe but long labour and inuincible ſufferance, may aduance in time. For to come vnto the dignity of <hi>Boſtangibaſsi,</hi> is to be fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with the Prince, to be great in Court, to ſpeake vnto him when hee walkes, to conduct him at Sea, and to gouerne his Brigandine, and to haue an honourable priuiledge to weare a Turbant in the <hi>Serrail,</hi> which is no leſſe than among the great Men of <hi>Spaine</hi> to ſpeake vnto the King with their heads couered.</p>
               <p>The Gates of the <hi>Serrail</hi> are the limits of their courſes, they neuer goe forth vpon any occaſion vnleſſe the <hi>Boſtangibaſsi</hi> leads them with him when hee goes out of the Pallace to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Princes commandments, and to ruine the fortune of ſome great Man of the Court, as hee did in the yeare 1614.

They doe not ſupply the companies of foote, when there is any want of Ianizaries, out of this number: If they goe out of the <hi>Serrail,</hi> it is to be better bred in other Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, whileſt they are yong: or when they are of riper age, the <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> giues ſome of them to his Fauourites, whom he ſends out of the <hi>Serrail,</hi> as <hi>Baſſa's</hi> of <hi>Caire, Damas,</hi> or ſome other Gouernments of his Empire; they make vſe of theſe <hi>Azamoglans</hi> for their Stewards, Quirries, Treaſurers; and ſuch like Offices in their Family: Moreouer, when the Prince goes a Voyage, or to the Wars, hee leads a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with him to pitch his Tents, vnlade his ſtuffe, and to doe other manuall workes.</p>

               <p>VErtue hath this proper to her naturall beauty, to make her ſelfe to be generally eſteemed, and acknowledged e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by moſt barbarous Nations: ſhe doth not only make thoſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1212:67"/>
admirable which doe poſſeſſe it, but doth alſo giue the Title of their Nobility to their Poſterity, and makes them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. The children that are well borne taken for Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute from the Chriſtians, make triall thereof in Turkey, whereas the Turkes honour their Birth, and ſeparate them from the reſt, to bee better bred and inſtructed in Exerciſes which make them worthy of the greateſt Officers of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: They teach them the Texts of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Law, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the Turkiſh Learning, they inſtruct them in armes, and in all things which may adde perfection to men, which are to attend continually neere vnto a great Monarch. They are all Chriſtian ſlaues; but we ſhall ſee in the courſe of their fortune, that their ſlauery is a way, by the which patience doth lead them to the liberty to command Prouinces, or whole Realmes: and their condition doth teach vs, that it is a happy infelicitie, and an vnfortunate happineſſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Capinga</hi> or great Chamberlaine of the <hi>Serrail,</hi> brings ſome into their number, borne of naturall Turkes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable for their good diſpoſitions, yet ſeldome and with the Princes leaue. For the cuſtome of the Empire in its moſt ancient Conſtitutions requires that ſuch Children ſhould be Chriſtians Renegadoes, the nobleſt and moſt ciuill that can be found. So when the aduantages of the Warre, giue vnto the Turkiſh Armies victories againſt Chriſtians, or the taking of their Townes, and they find therein young children to the age of twelue or thirteene yeares, the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> reſerue them for the ſeruice of the <hi>Grand Seigneur.</hi> For the Turkes hold an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the Nobility of bloud makes ſpirits generous and inclinable to vertue; eſpecially when the care of a good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth poliſh and make perfect the gifts of Birth, as they doe in the <hi>Serrail</hi> with theſe young men. The Diſcipline, which they cauſe to obſerue is, ſo rigorous, as whoſoeuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes it in all points, becomes the moſt modeſt, the moſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and the moſt mortified man liuing. The Maſters which haue charge of their perſons, are white Eunuches, ſeuere, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, fantaſtique, and ſuſpicious, as moſt of your gelded men be. They neuer ſpeake vnto them but in choller, and ſpare not
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1212:68"/>
their Baſtinadoes, whereof they are very charitable; they make them watch and indure all paines; ſo as many of theſe young men, when they come to the age of twenty yeeres, they ſeeke all meanes to flie this ſeuerity: And although they know that they are in the courſe of a great fortune; yet they had rather get out of the <hi>Serrail,</hi> with the ſimple qualitie of <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Mutaferaga,</hi> which is like vnto our Men at Armes or light houſe, than to ſuffer any longer the rigours of this Diſcipline. Their number is not certaine, the <hi>Serrail</hi> receiues as many as they ſend; but vſually they are about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. The order and method wherewith they breed them vp, doth teſtifie that the Turkes haue retained nothing of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous but the name, and haue ſent vs the effect.</p>

In the firſt are placed all thoſe of this condition, which enter into the <hi>Serrail</hi> at a childiſh age: There they circumciſe them if they were not before; being made Turkes, they teach for their firſt Leſſon Silence, and the Countenance they muſt carry for a marke of their Seruitude, and withall a ſingular Reuerence towards the <hi>Sultan,</hi> which is when they are neere him to hold downe their Head and Eyes, and to haue their Hands joyned, or their Armes croſt.

They continue ſix yeares in theſe Exerciſes, after which they are Men and ſit for all paine and labour.</p>
               <p>Then they come vnto the third <hi>Oda,</hi>

Moreouer to the end that his <hi>Agalaris</hi> may gather the more money, to ſupply the expences of their Equipage, when they ſhall goe out of the <hi>Serrail</hi> with the Titles of Gouernours of Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, hee giues them diſpatches for Embaſſies: Theſe men ſell them to the <hi>Chaoux,</hi> or bargaine with them for a Moietie or more, of the preſent which they ſhall receiue from the Prince, to whom they are ſent, the which is of no ſmall importance: For the Princes which hold and depend of the <hi>Othoman,</hi> when he confirmes them in their Dignities, and ſends them the markes thereof, by a gilt Staffe, a Throne, or a Crowne, they are bound to giue to him that is ſent a Preſent of that value which is ſet downe in the great cuſtome of the Empire, the which doth taxe euery one to a certaine ſumme: And of this number is the <hi>Vallachian,</hi> the <hi>Moldanian,</hi> the <hi>Tranſiluanian,</hi> the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> and many other Vaſſalls, and Tributaries of the <hi>Otho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Crowne. This Preſent is diuided betwixt the <hi>Chaoux,</hi> who receiues it, and the <hi>Agalari</hi> who gaue him, or rather ſold him the Commiſſion: Thus they enrich themſelues, and make a ſtocke to furniſh themſelues vpon the firſt occaſion, the which preſenting it ſelfe by the death of ſome <hi>Baſſa,</hi> they are made either Captaine of the Sea, or <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Caire</hi> or <hi>Damas,</hi> or elſewhere.

Many young men whom a deſire of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and a curioſitie to ſee the World, rather than any care to aduance themſelues, hath made them abandon the exerciſes of the <hi>Oda,</hi> and their importunities haue forced the Prince to diſmiſſe them, goe forth with the reſt without any qualitie or office, and with little entertainment by the day: But when as he that is aduanced to the quality of a <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and Gouernour of ſome remote Prouince, is ready to goe out of the <hi>Serrail,</hi> the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> ſends to receiue him at the Gate, by his <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caia,</hi> who is a Steward or Ouer-ſeer of his houſe, with a troup of Horſe to doe him honour, and cauſeth him to be conducted to his Pallace, receiues him with all curteſie, giues him many Preſents, and doth accommodate him with lodgings for three or foure dayes, vntill his owne be prouided in the Citie: After that he hath giuen order, he ſettles his Family, and giues the chiefe places, to ſuch as came out of the <hi>Serrail</hi> with him, he ſtayes ſometime in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> vntill his haire be growne, for he was ſhauen at his comming forth, and likewiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Preſents which the <hi>Sultana's</hi> ſend him, as goodly Linnen and rich Workes: And thoſe which the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him, as Tapeſtries, Horſes, Robes of Cloth of Gold, and all ſorts of moueables neceſſary for a man of his condition: He may be at that time about forty yeares old, hauing conſumed the beſt of his dayes, in the expectance of this fortune. They of the other <hi>Oda's</hi> ſucceed him by the order of their recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the which is exactly obſerued in the <hi>Serrail,</hi> and fauour cannot depriue any man, if he hath not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted ſome notable fault in the royall Pallace: ſo as they of the third <hi>Oda</hi> do part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know by the ſucceſſion what ſhall become of them, and wiſh daily, that it would pleaſe the <hi>Sultan,</hi> to ſend ſome of his <hi>Agalaris</hi> to Offices abroad, to the end they may make place for them.</p>
               <p>This new Gouernour parts not from the Court to goe vnto his charge, before hee hath giuen thankes to the <hi>Capiaga</hi> for the care which hee hath contributed to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement,

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the foure White Eunuches, the chiefe Men of the <hi>Serrail,</hi> and of ſome other Eunuches.</head>
               <p>WE haue ſaid elſewhere that the womens <hi>Serrail</hi> hath no other Guard but blacke Eunuches, which are ſent young to the Court by the <hi>Baſha's</hi> of <hi>Caire,</hi> to be bred vp to that place. The <hi>Sultans Serrail</hi> receiues none but white, the which are choſen in their infancie, out of that pleaſing troupe of children well borne, which are taken for Tribute from the Chriſtians, whoſe fortune the precedent Chapter doth deſcribe. They are cut or mutilated with their owne conſent, and not by force, the which would in danger their liues: The promiſes of the greateſt Offices in Court, and the hope one day to enjoy Dignities whereunto they ſee ſuch men aduanced, ouer-ſwayes their will, to ſuffer themſelues to bee cut, the promiſe are true, for in time they attaine to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Turkey, But the principall of theſe Eunuches, and the moſt ancient among them, which are about the Princes perſon, the firſt and moſt powerfull Heads of the <hi>Serrail,</hi> are the foure which follow.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the <hi>Capiaga</hi> great Chamberlaine of the Empire, in moſt authority in the <hi>Serrail</hi>; as he who may ſpeake vnto the <hi>Grand Seigneur,</hi> when he thinkes good; he doth alwayes aſſiſt neere vnto his perſon, whereſoeuer he goes, whether he goe out of his Royall Pallace, or enters into that of his wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he followes him vnto the doore, where he leaues men to aduertiſe him in his Chamber, when the <hi>Sultan</hi> retires. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies, Packets of Importance, Inſtructions of Eſtate, and all great Affaires paſſe thorough his hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to come vnto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> which make him neceſſary to all others, and gets him as many rich Preſents, and as much money as he can well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. This without compariſon is more beneficiall vnto him, than the entertainment he hath in the <hi>Serrail,</hi> the which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1212:72"/>
at ten Sultanins by the day, which make foure pounds of our ſterling Money, many Robes of Silke and Cloth of Gold, with ſuch moueables as he deſires. Moreouer, his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is furniſhed at his Maſters charge, and at the ſame time that his is. Hee carries a Turbant in the <hi>Serrail,</hi> and goes on horſebacke where he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the <hi>Chaſuadar Baſsi,</hi> or the Treaſurer of the Princes ſecret treaſure; hee hath one key and the <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> another, who doth alſo ſet his Scale vnto it. He hath care to lay vp the gold and ſiluer which comes from Egypt, keepes an accompt of it, and enters alone into this Treaſure with the <hi>Sultan,</hi> hee aduiſeth him for the gathering together of money, and entertaines him with a ſubject which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer diſpleaſing to Prince: The importance and neceſſity of his charge, make him to be much eſteemed: For gold being the delights of men, whoſoeuer hath the ouer-ſight, makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe both powerfull and neceſſary among them: Moreouer, he hath the keeping of all the Iewels of the Crowne, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of thoſe which they preſent daily vnto the <hi>Sultan</hi>; hee gluts his eyes with the luſtre of the goodlieſt Pearles, and the richeſt Diamonds that the Eaſt doth produce: Thoſe which his Maſter giues, and wherewith hee doth adorne himſelfe on a day of pompe, paſſe thorough his hands. Hee liues in the midſt of the Treaſures of the <hi>Serrail,</hi> with hope to ſucceed to the place of <hi>Capiaga,</hi> if death forceth the other to abandon it.</p>
               <p>The third hath the charge of <hi>Chilergi Baſſi,</hi> that is to ſay, great Diſpencer. He is, as with vs, the Maſter of the Kings Wardrobe; by his place he hath a care of the <hi>Sultans</hi> Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and of other things which belong vnto his perſon. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, the pieces of Cloth of Gold, which they ſend for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, the exquiſite Furres, the rich Swords, the Plumes of Feathers, and ſuch like which they giue vnto the Prince, and thoſe which hee himſelfe giues, are vnder his cuſtody. Hee keepes a particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, to the end they may ſee the price of that, which enters into this ſturdy Wardrobe for Princes, and the value of that which goes forth in the ſame qualities: This exerciſe keepes him alwayes in breath; for the cuſtome

of Turkey, (well practiſed in the <hi>Serrail</hi>) being to giue and to receiue, doth furniſh him with imployment enough to paſſe the houres of the day farre from idleneſſe. He hath vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him to aſſiſt him in this painfull labour a great number of Eunuches. The diligence which he muſt ſhew herein, bindes him to remayne in a manner continually within the <hi>Serrail,</hi> his entertainments are his Table, many Robes of Cloth of Gold, a thouſand Aſpres by the day, or eight Sultanins, with many rich Preſents. But the fauour wherewith his Maſter doth honour him, makes the greateſt article of his Reuenew: he hopes by the meanes hereof to enter into the place of <hi>Chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>adar Baſſi,</hi> when it ſhall be void. He carries (for a marke of the honour which he enjoyes) a Turbant in the <hi>Serrail,</hi> and rides within it, aſwell as the two former, and he that followes; for theſe foure Eunuches haue this prerogatiue aboue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers of the <hi>Othoman</hi> Monarch, reſiding in the <hi>Serrail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth is alſo an old pale withered Eunuch, aſwell by the courſe of his yeares, as the want of that which they haue cut away, who enjoyes the Office of <hi>Sarai Agaſſi,</hi> which in Turkey is like vnto the Captaine of the Caſtle of the <hi>Louver</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> but with more luſtre and authority, and ſo he hath more labour and care: For being to look vnto the whole <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rail,</hi> the ordinary Manſion of the <hi>Othoman</hi> Monarches, hee muſt performe his charge ſo exactly, as ſuch Princes will be ſerued; he doth often viſit all the Quarters and Chambers of this ſtately Pallace, to ſee in what eſtate they are, and hath a care to ſee the meaneſt Officers doe their duties, (which is more then with vs, to adde vnto the charge of the Royall Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace the Office of a Maſter of the Houſhold) that the <hi>Serrail</hi> be furniſhed with all things that are vſually needfull, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines within it in the <hi>Sultans</hi> abſence, to maintaine order, and to ſee that this royall Lodging be alwayes in good eſtate. He hath the ſame entertainment with the <hi>Chil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You ſhall not ſee men there, grow vp in one night like vnto Muſhrums or Toad-ſtooles; long attendance, and long ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces aduance them to the places which they deſerue. Thus the <hi>Shaſnadar Baſsi</hi> aſpires to that of <hi>Capiaga,</hi> the <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe foure Eunuches attend vſually in the Princes preſence, only the <hi>Capiaga</hi> may ſpeake vnto him, and not the reſt, vnleſſe the Prince doth queſtion them about their Offices. Beſides theſe Honours and Offices of the <hi>Serrail,</hi> the Prince doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times honour them with the quality of <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and Gouernour of a Realme, as of <hi>Egypt, Damas,</hi> or elſe-where: They alſo attaine vnto the place of <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> which is the firſt of the Empire, and by the authority thereof lead Armies into Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, where they goe to make warre. The which gaue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a generous Gouernour of a place belonging to the Chriſtian in <hi>Hungarie,</hi> to anſwere an Eunuch, Generall of an Army, who had ſummond him to yeeld, that the practice of women was to ſewe and ſpinne, and not to take Townes. The <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> aduanceth them in this manner to great pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces without the <hi>Serrail</hi> to a double end; the one to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their long ſeruices, the other to haue their places, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to aduance other Eunuches, who during their long ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices haue attended, that they ſhould either die or be ſent <hi>Baſha's</hi> into ſome remote Prouinces. For the <hi>Serrail</hi> doth nouriſh many Eunuches vnder the ſweetneſſe of theſe hopes: They may be about two hundred of all Ages.</p>
               <p>Such as cannot be aduanced by order of antiquity to theſe eminent places in the Royall Pallace, are notwithſtanding imployed in things of leſſe quality; ſome keepe in diſtinct places, as Cloſets or Cabinets, thoſe exquiſite things that are giuen as Preſents to the Prince, as great places of Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greece which the <hi>Baſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>AN order being ſo judiciouſly eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Serrail,</hi> and ſo exactly obſerued, it hath not forgotten the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie prouiſion of victuals: They are brought and preſerued with admirable husbandrie, contrarie to the ordinarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Princes Houſes. Firſt, the Corne is gathered for the <hi>Sultans</hi> mouth, for the <hi>Sultana's,</hi> the great <hi>Baſſa's</hi> and the <hi>Mufti,</hi> (for all of them haue their part) in the Territory of <hi>Burſia,</hi> a Towne in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> where retaine for the pureſt and beſt of all the Eaſterne parts: They retaine for the <hi>Serrail</hi> eight or nine thouſand <hi>Quilots,</hi> euery <hi>Quilot</hi> is two Buſhels of <hi>Paris</hi> meaſure: The Mils erected to that end in <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> grind it, the great Ouens of the <hi>Serrail</hi> bake it into bread, and this goodly order diſtributes it by rule, as to the <hi>Sultana's</hi> twentie Loaues a day, to the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> ten, to the <hi>Mufti</hi> eight, and to other inferiour perſons much leſſe, and to ſome but one. This diſtribution is contained in a Book, which the chiefe Baker keepes, to cauſe it to be obſerued. The Corne which is appointed for the great number of men, which ſerue in the <hi>Serrail,</hi> is gathered in <hi>Gracia,</hi> and brought to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> to the quantitie of fortie thouſand <hi>Quilots,</hi> and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1212:75"/>
diſtributed with the like order to thoſe for whom it is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For there they feed men with neceſſarie ſobrietie, to make them labour ſeriouſly in any buſineſſe whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>The Victuals, be it for the Annuall prouiſions, or for the ordinarie of the day, are brought and diſtributed with the like order: About the end of Autumne, the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points certaine dayes to ſee the <hi>Paſtromanis</hi> made, for the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and of the <hi>Sultana's</hi>; They are made with the fleſh of Cowes that are with Calfe, that they may be the more tender, they ſalt them as they doe Stags or Hogs in Chriſtendome; about that time they kill to the number of foure thouſand. The <hi>Serrail</hi> eſteemes this kind of meat, among the delicacies of their Feaſts, and the Turkiſh Families if they haue any conuenient meanes make likewiſe their prouiſion; this great ſtore of fleſh is for the whole yeere. But the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyours doe furniſh the <hi>Serrail</hi> daily with two hundred Sheepe, a hundred Lambes, or a hundred Kids, in their ſeaſon, fortie Calues, fortie Geeſe, or Goſlings, a hundred couple of Wild-fowle, a hundred couple of Hennes, a hundred paire of Pigeons, with ſome other ſmall Birds which the Poulterers bring. There comes no fiſh into the <hi>Serrail,</hi> but to pleaſe the appetite of ſome of the <hi>Agalaris</hi> who deſire to eate it; then they cauſe it to bee taken on that ſide of the Pallace which lookes towards the Sea, the which doth abundantly furniſh all ſorts of fiſh.</p>
               <p>The excellent Oiles which the <hi>Sultans</hi> Kitchin doth vſe, comes moſt commonly from <hi>Coron</hi> and <hi>Modon,</hi> in <hi>Grecia,</hi> a plentifull ſoile for Oliue-trees. <hi>Candi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> only doth furniſh that which is imployed for the Princes ſeruice: for beſides the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate bountie of this liquour, it is without any ill ſent, the which growing old in others makes them vnpleaſing. They haue great prouiſion of Butter in the <hi>Serrail,</hi> the which is brought from <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ldouia,</hi> and other places thereabouts; It comes downe by the blacke Sea in great quantitie but ſalted, the Turkes doe not ſeeke after freſh Butter; either for that they know not the quality, or neglect it: Milke is little in vſe among them; that which is brought to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1212:75"/>
bought by the Chriſtians or Iewes; If the Turkes make vſe of it, it is after it is ſowre, for then they ſay it doth quench their thirſt.</p>
               <p>Other prouiſions of Victuals are drawne from thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces where they moſt abound, and are beſt. The Gallions make two Voyages yearely to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to fraught them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with Pulſes, Sugars, and Spices, as much as ſhall bee needfull for the <hi>Serrail,</hi> and the chiefe <hi>Baſſa's</hi> of the Port; yet the Turkes vſe not much Spices, leſt it ſhould prouoke them to drinke wine, ſo expreſly defended by their Law. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> doth furniſh Dates, and the beſt Prunes that come into the <hi>Serrail.</hi> Apples which are the chiefe delights in their Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Feaſts, and whereof they make a plentifull prouiſion, are gathered in <hi>Vallachia, Tranſiluania,</hi> and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ldauia,</hi> and brought vnto the <hi>Serrail</hi> in great abundance: thoſe which they ſerue vnto the <hi>Sultan,</hi> are for their delicate ſweetneſſe bought in <hi>Candy. Italy</hi> doth alſo contribute to the Prouiſions of this great <hi>Serrail</hi>; the Bailiffe of <hi>Venice,</hi> reſiding at the Port, cauſeth a great quantity of Parmaſant Cheeſe to bee brought for the <hi>Grand Seigneur,</hi> his <hi>Sultana's</hi> and <hi>Baſha's:</hi> they are pleaſed in the taſte, and the Feaſt would not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable if this meate were wanting.</p>
               <p>All theſe things concerne the food, for their drinke they make a liquour in the <hi>Serrail,</hi> called <hi>Sorbet,</hi> compoſed of the juice of Citrons, Sugar, and Water, and ſometimes they adde Ambergreece, moſt excellent to drinke; ſo it is only reſerued for the <hi>Sultan</hi> and his women: The greateſt men of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Pallace make for themſelues, as the foure principall Eunuches, of whom wee haue ſpoken, and ſome few others: The Ice refreſhing it in Summer makes it more delightfull; They make their prouiſion of Ice from the Mountaines about <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> they bring ſuch great ſtore, as the charges (before it be put into thoſe places where they keepe it) comes to twenty thouſand Sultanins, or eight thouſand pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The reſt of the Royall Family quench their thirſt at thoſe goodly Fountaines, which powre forth delicate water abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly for the whole <hi>Serrail</hi>: Wine enters not into it without
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1212:76"/>
violating the Law of the Alcoran, which hath ſo ſeuerely forbidden it; and whereof the wiſeſt of the Turkes deteſt the vſe; they call it the Spurre of Senſualitie, and the Tombe of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The Wood which ſerues for their Kitchin, is ſupplied with the like abundance; they meaſure the quantity by the weight, for ſo they ſell it in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> aſwell as in ſome Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>France,</hi> and particularly in <hi>Landguedoc:</hi> They cut it in the <hi>Grand Seigneurs</hi> Forreſts, and this prouiſion coſts him leaſt of all thoſe that enter into his Pallace. Thirty great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramonſailes, choſen among an infinite number of his Shins take it in, and ſayling by the channell of the blacke Sea, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it into the <hi>Serrail</hi>; his ſlaues haue cut it downe, ſparing good ſummer of money to the <hi>Chaſus</hi> or Treaſure without, whereunto the charges would amount, both for the cutting and carriage.</p>
               <p>But if the victuals of the <hi>Serrail</hi> be furniſhed in abundance and excellencie, the Kitchins which imploy them are ſupplyed with the goodlieſt Implements, which can be ſeene in a Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princes houſe.

               <p>THe number of men lodged and fed in the <hi>Serrail,</hi> which amounts to fourteen thouſand mouths, would make thoſe imagine, which know not the power of the Turkiſh Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, that many Soueraigne Monarchs, lodged together, had drawne all the Officers of their houſes into one Pallace. And truly he whom they ſerue hauing vanquiſhed and ruined ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kings hath made an vnion of their Crownes: His <hi>Serrail,</hi> when he lodgeth there, containes in him alone the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> him of <hi>Trebiſonde,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Babylon, Damas, Egypt, Cypreſſe, Thunis, Algier, Fez,</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> with an infinite number of other ſmaller So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignes, whoſe Empires, Realmes and Principalities hee doth poſſeſſe: So as ſo many Officers as are in his Pallace, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his greatneſſe, ſerue many Crownes. But when he goes out of his <hi>Serrail,</hi> to vndertake a Voyage into ſome remote Prouince, the traine and followers which increaſe his Court is wonderfull. Thirty ſixe thouſand <hi>Iamzaries,</hi> make the number of his ordinary Guard on foot, fortie foure thouſand <hi>Spabi,</hi> which areas light Horſemen, make the Cauallery; two thouſand <hi>Capigas</hi> or Archers of the Port follow him: Theſe beſide their ordinary Guard, execute the Office of the Miniſters of Iuſtice, with men of meaner condition that are vnder them: Two thouſand <hi>Solachis,</hi> which are Guards on foot about the <hi>Sultans</hi> perſon, are of his traine: Foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

                  <hi>Chaoux,</hi> Men imployed in Embaſſies, and in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of Iuſtice march after him.

The number of men for baſer vſes is not leſſe, if we conſider where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are imployed, there are three thouſand Groomes of the Stable, and a thouſand Riders for hunting; the <hi>Balthagis</hi> which cut the wood, and bring it to the Kitchin are eight thouſand: There are a thouſand <hi>Thauegys,</hi> which are Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyours, or Victualers: two thouſand fiue hundred <hi>Therezi,</hi> or Tailors to the Court, ſixe hundred Bakers. And if the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age be made for the warre, the Officers of the <hi>Arſenall,</hi> which are Commiſſaries of the Artillery and others, make fortie ſix thouſand men: The <hi>Gebegys</hi> which make Armes, and repaire and keepe cleane thoſe which are already made, are fourteene thouſand: ſeuen thouſand <hi>Tufechgys</hi> or Gun-makers, follow with their Tooles and ambulatory ſhops: eight thouſand <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peys,</hi> which are the Cannoneers, increaſe the traine of this monſtrous Court. I omit a number of pettie Officers, for that I haue not their names.</p>
               <p>The beaſts of burthen are vſually twentie thouſand, that is to ſay, ten thouſand Camels, and ten thouſand Moiles, which is the ordinary for the <hi>Sultans</hi> houſe, not reckoning the troine of the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> which follow, the which is not ſo ſmall but in ſeeing them march apart, you would take it for the traine of a Soueraigne Prince; for the Turkes carrie in their Voyages all ſorts of Commodities, to the end they may be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated aſwell in Field, as in the Townes of their abode.

ſeeing this young childe wonderfull beautifull, tooke him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by force, and carried him as a Preſent to the <hi>Sultan</hi> their Maſter: The Prince loued him, and in a ſhort time made the greateſt of his Court know, that beauty is many times a powerfull motiue to a great fortune, hee was placed among the beſt reſpected Pages of his Chamber, where hee ſpent his younger yeeres in the midſt of the delights of the <hi>Serrail,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he had the charge of <hi>Aga,</hi> or Colonell Generall of the <hi>Ianizaries</hi>; afterwards he was honoured with the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Baſſa,</hi> then he became <hi>Vizir,</hi> &amp; mounting daily higher, <hi>Romelia</hi> or <hi>Europe</hi> had him for their <hi>Beglierbey:</hi> The mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificences which he ſhewed, during the poſſeſſion of ſo much wealth, would be tedious to relate. One only example ſhall ſuffice for all. <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second, cauſed the eldeſt of his children to be Circumciſed; the cuſtome of the Court will haue great Men to giue him Preſents, as wee haue formerly ſpoken: all performed it; but that of <hi>Machmut,</hi> mounted neere to a hundred thouſand <hi>Sequins,</hi> which would make for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thouſand pounds ſterling. The Ocean muſt bee vaſt and great, which doth breed ſuch great Whales, liuing and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Mountaines: And the <hi>Othoman</hi> Court muſt be ſtately, ſeeing the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> encounter with ſuch fortunes.</p>
               <p>But it may be that of <hi>Machmut</hi> will ſeeme ſtale, for that it happened an age before ours: to ſatisfie thoſe which loue new things, and to augment the proofes of this verity, that the Turkiſh <hi>Baſſa's</hi> are great, we will adde an example which many haue ſeene of late yeeres. It appeared in the <hi>Leuant</hi> in the yeere 1614, and in the perſon of <hi>Naſſuf Baſſa Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zir</hi> of the Empire, whoſe treaſures were ſo great, as they found in his Cofers at the time of his death a Million of Gold in <hi>Sequins,</hi> and in ſiluer Coine eight hundred thouſand Crownes, three buſhels of precious Stones not wrought, a buſhell of Diamonds not ſet in gold, and two buſhels of great round Pearles of ineſtimable value: His other furniture was equall to his treaſure; he had a thouſand goodly Horſes in his ſtable, whereof the leaſt was valued at a thouſand Crownes: Moreouer, he had foure hundred Mares of <hi>Arabian, Egypt,</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:1212:81"/>
the goodlieſt that could be found in thoſe Countries, with many thouſand of Camels and Moyles. His Armory was full of the richeſt Swords that could be found in the <hi>Leuant,</hi> and elſewhere: The leaſt had the hilts of ſiluer: One was ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richt with Diamonds vpon the hilt, as it was valued at fiue thouſand pounds ſterling. The reſt of his moueables were no leſſe precious, his <hi>Perſian</hi> Carpets wrought of Gold and Silke. The great quantity of Cloth of Gold &amp; of Silk of moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent workes; the rich beds, and all, that exceſſe of a monſtrous fortune can draw into the Pallace of a Fauourite, exceeds the imagination of men, and giues occaſion to ſay, that with the ſpoile of ſuch men, they might not only enrich many houſes, but many Cities.</p>
               <p>Such rich and ſumptuous Courtiers go with no ſmal trains: when they march in field, and vndertake a Voyage, be it for their owne particulars, or to receiue the poſſeſſion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of Prouinces, wherewith the <hi>Sultan</hi> doth honour them, the baggage which goes before, and the great number of men which follow them, doth equall, yea, exceed the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of the Soueraigne Princes of <hi>Europe</hi>: Such a traine may buſie the eyes of thoſe that ſee them paſſe, for a whole day, for ſo much time is neceſſary for the leaſt entry into a Towne, and yet many times they ſupply the want of day by Torch-light: It is the care of ſuch <hi>Baſſa's</hi> to ſhew themſelue, great to the eyes of the World: which makes them prodigall in their expences, to be attended by many thouſands of houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould ſeruants, (if they bee not ill ſerued being a difficult thing, but ſuch a number and troupe ſhould be importune and troubleſome) to whom they giue many <hi>Enunches</hi> to command them.

But it is dangerous to ſerue the paſſions of ſuch Louers, where the recompence and the reward or a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full loue, is a Dagger or a Glaſſe of poyſon: For theſe cruell women, when they haue kept ſome young ſtranger three or foure dayes hidden in their Chambers, and haue made vſe of him vntill he be ſo tired and weary with their laſciuiouſneſſe, as hee is no longer profitable, they ſtab him or poyſon him, and caſt his bodie into ſome Priuie: Whether it be that they feare their affections ſhould be diſcouered, or that their light and inconſtant humours, doth alwayes demand new ſubjects, or that it is the nature of their laſciuious loue, to change into Rage and Fury tragically cruell.

He who knew well with what Mertils ſuch Ladies are accuſtomed to crowne their Louers which haue ſerued them, excuſeth himſelfe for that time, pretending ſome important buſineſſe which drew him to the <hi>Serrail</hi>: But he promiſeth at his returne to content her deſires, imtearing her to attend at the paſſage.

The Phyſicians were called to his help, but all their lerning could not find out the cauſe of his infirmitie, nor preſcribe a remedie: Some dayes paſt in theſe extremities, after which an old Turkiſh woman offers to cure him; ſhe viſits him, and hauing looked vpon him ſhe told him in her gibbridge: I will ſoon cure you: But tell the truth, haue you not refuſed ſome Lady that ſought your loue? By her Charmes ſhe expelled thoſe which tormented him, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to health: After which, this man going in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> hee encountred a woman which told him in his eare; Remember another time not to abuſe the courteſie of Women which affect you, and deceiue them no more by your vaine promiſes.</p>
               <p>All the women of Turkey, and eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> doe not tie their affections to men only, they grow paſſionately in loue one with another, and giue themſelues to falſe and vnlawfull loue, eſpecially the wiues of men of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, who liue coopt vp in <hi>Serrails,</hi> vnder the guard of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuches.

the <hi>Diuan,</hi> which is the Councell where Iuſtice is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred; the Captaine of the Sea is high Admirall, and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of Nauall Armies. The <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> commands all the Turkiſh foot, as ſole Colonell thereof. And the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> gouernes the Citie, and takes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the chiefe affaires which paſſe. Theſe foure <hi>Baſſa's</hi> differing in Offices and Honours are notwithſtanding power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in authoritie, the which is of ſuch weight, as they giue and take the Crown from their Soueraigne Prince when they thinke good. We haue ſeene the experience of late yeares, in the perſons of <hi>Sultan Muſtapha,</hi> and <hi>Oſman: Achmat</hi> ended his life and Raigne in the yeare 1617, hee left two young ſonnes; <hi>Oſman</hi> and <hi>Amurath:</hi> He knew by experience that the weight of ſuch a Crowne could not be borne by a Childe, and that the abſolute gouernment of the Turkiſh Monarchie required a man: He called to the ſucceſſion of his Scepter, his brother <hi>Muſtapha</hi> who had beene fourteene yeares a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in his <hi>Serrail,</hi> and made him to taſte this ſweet change, to come from a Dungeon to a Throne, and from the fetters of a tedious captiuitie, to that power to command the greateſt I ſtate vpon the Earth.

When as he had mannaged his enterprize vnto the day of his

departure, when as his Galleyes were readie, and the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Caire</hi> come with an Armie to receiue him; the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> were aduertiſed, they runne to the <hi>Serrail</hi> with the conſent of the <hi>Aga,</hi> the people are moued, the Captaine <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſtirres them vp, they take the <hi>Sultan</hi> in his Chamber, kill ſome great Men in his preſence, dragge him into a priſon, and there make him to ſuffer a ſhamefull death by the hands of an Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, hauing drawne <hi>Muſtapha</hi> his Vncle out of Priſon again, and crowned him the ſecond time Soueraigne <hi>Sultan</hi> of the Turkiſh Empire.
