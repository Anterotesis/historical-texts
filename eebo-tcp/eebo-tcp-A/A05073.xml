         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

his taking Armes for the iust defence of the

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE deuoire of a Gentleman,
making profession of vertue,
consisteth (first of all) in so well
ordering and digesting his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that himselfe may receyue
in them contentment: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
hee ought to make such a splendour of
them, and to iustifie them in such sorte, as the
well minded may bee satisfied, and the ill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
rayse no suggestion to condemne them.
And seeing it is so, that honour (which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
of the fairest workes) proceedeth from
such, who after they haue examined and finde
them worthie, will approue them: he then that
is desirous to be honoured, ought to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that his owne actions (if it be possible) bee
not blemished with any spot or staine: and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
such as deale with persons of great and
highest qualitie, herein stand bound with chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
regard. Admit they should incurre but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the detection of slaunder, which is so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21643:3"/>
in this vnhappy age, when wee see that blamed
which is most modestly doone, and the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to passe with commendation: may not this
then serue as a liuely touch or feeling, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
such to render a publique account, of the
principall carriage of their liues? What I haue
determined to doo at this present, shall be some
discourse of mine owne: to the ende it may bee
truely knowne, what causes haue mooued mee,
after so long rest, and euen among the bonds of
some particular promises, to take these Armes
for defence of the Townes of Sedan &amp; Iametz,
auncient frontiers of the Realme, against such
as haue assayled them.</p>
            <p>To many it is well knowne, in what miserable
captiuitie I haue beene deteyned the space of
fiue yeares and a halfe, by those who haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
little praise for such rigour, wherein happily
I had longer continued, if they had not proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the vncertaintie of humane affaires: but
God is to bee bountifully blessed for this bitter
aduersitie, wherein I haue learned that, which
the most sweetest prosperitie would haue made
me misconceiue.</p>
            <p>The time beeing nowe come of my deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
I was taken foorth of my darke habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to be brought to the place, where I receiued
the sentence of my libertie: but with conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
no lesse hard then mine imprisonment had
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21643:3"/>
beene: notwithstanding I accepted them ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
in respect they surceased my long heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
I must say then, that the first cause of this so
desired benefit, was the bountie of God, who
now remembred mine affliction. The second,
the prisoner that I tooke, for whome I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunged,
and who was of greater price then I.
And the third, the bond of one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
crownes made by the King of Nauarre on
his goods in Flaunders, for the assurance of my
promises, not to beare Armes against the King
of Spayne in his countryes.</p>
            <p>This accomplished, I was deliuered, &amp; then
I went towards Nancy, to make proofe of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiyng
certaine other points, which are couched
within mine Articles: to vnderstand if my Lord
the Duke of Lorraine, (ouer and beside the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed
suretie) would be likewise bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd for
me to the King of Spaine, in the said sum of one
hundred thousand crownes, &amp; if he fayled, one
Prince of Allemaigne, or one Canton of the
Zwitzers. That I should also de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>liuer my second
Son, to be one yeere as an hostage in his Court.
Beside, that the said Duke, &amp; my Lord the Duke
of Guyse, shuld promise by writing a part, signed
with their hands: that I should not beare Armes
against the King of Spayne. In all these bondes
these Spaniards bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d me, as if they had receiued
occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of feare, that so slender a Solidiour as my
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21643:4"/>
selfe, should come soone or late to hinder the
course of their victory: from which thought I
was most furthest off, for my desire stretched no
otherwise, than to gohome to my house, there to
repose my selfe, and giue God thanks for sauing
me from the shadow of death and the graue.</p>
            <p>Beeing arriued in Lorrayne, I spake with the
said Princes, to know if they would fauour mee
with this bond: whereto they very liberally co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discended:
prouided, that his most Christian
Maiestie agreed thereto. To him I went, and
could not obtaine his consent, except I would
promise him, that I would not enter Armes
without his expresse commaundement: this I
likewise graunted. Soone after he wrote to my
Lord the Duke of Lorrayne, that he might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
for me to the King of Spayne: which hee
did, vnder these conditions, that I should bee
bound to him in a hundred thousand crownes,
with all my goodes, as a gage of his bond, for
the satisfaction: afterward, I should promise, not
to beare Armes against him, nor his estate. Like
promise I made him also, in case it went not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
my dutifull obeysance, of seruice and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie
to the Crowne of Fraunce, and to the
King my Souereigne Lord. All these matters
ended, I departed from the saide Princes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
beene very curteously entertayned by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and then I went to Geneua, where I made my
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21643:4"/>
choise of aboade, during the time of this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
warre. At the ende of two moneths, my
Sonne, whome I sent for from the King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,
came to me, and I sent him in hostage to
Nancy, here he was gently intreated while he
there remayned.</p>
            <p>See heere successiuely the pure truth of all my
promises and bonds, and the causes of my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
discouered in due order. Which I haue
doone, to the ende that many, who are ouer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
in censuring the actions of others, either by
humours, ignorance, or bad information: should
be better aduised, &amp; not to condemne me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
they first had heard me, as I know diuers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
haue doone, within more than six mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths:
at which time (with all their vigilancie)
they could not reprooue me of any speeches,
that happily might be thought woorthie repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension.
But these good censurers doo not in the
meane while forethinke themselues, howe they
rashly attempt in causes against their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne
Lord, and likewise against their natiue
countrey.</p>
            <p>In sooth, if I would haue shrunke from my
wordes, beeing pressed thereto by mine owne
particular interests, I should haue beene an
handsome subiect. As for the straunge Armie
raysed, if I would haue gone therin, I could haue
had no meane place or authoritie: seeing that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21643:5"/>
Monsieur de Buillon, and my cheefest frendes,
who were imploied in the conduct therof, called
me, and would haue deferred more to me, then
I could well couet or desire. But I excused my
selfe, and would not outgo the limits of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
because I could not with credit doo it.
And many Gentlemen yet liuing, who were at
the preparation of the said Army, knowe, that I
went so farre as Strasbrough, through the insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
intreaties then made to me, by letters from the
Lord of Buy, that I should parle with my Lords
the Dukes of Lorraine and Cazimire, chiefly
with Monsieur de Segur, to compound for their
passage thorow Lorrayne, and that all had agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(because it was giuen mee) that I should bee
admitted to this busines, where the one nor the
other should be circumuented. But being there
arriued, &amp; not finding the letters of the Princes
before named, and contrariwise, seeing on both
sides courage enkindled, and hatred increase,
the Armies on foote, and their swordes ready
drawne, I thought that the time for me to bee
imployed was past, and agreement should now
be subiect to obseruation: wherefore I would
not wrap my selfe betweene these two tempests,
least my reputation should bee impeached by
fortune. And I did write to my Lord the Baron
of Ausonuille, who was then at Phaltz-bourgh,
the cause that then did withhold me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:21643:5"/>Within a while after the saide Army beeing
ouerthrowne, more through themselues then
the strength of the contrary part, the remainder
driuen backe towards the Alpes, and Monsieur
de Bouillon, who was the chiefe, ouerwearyed
with so great trauayle, came to rest himselfe at
Geneua, where an exceeding feuer tooke holde
on him, whereof he dyed ten dayes after. And
being yet in perfect memory, he disposed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to make his testament, whereby (among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things) he ordayned, that his chiefe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
should remaine vnder the protection and
seruice of the Crowne of Fraunce, and desired
that his Maiestie would maintaine them vnder
such conditions, as they had beene in former
times. And after he had named Monsieur de
Montpensier tutour and gouernour of Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiselle
de Bouillon his sister, whom he left his
sole and onely heyre: he charged me also with
her wardship of her chiefe countries, with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
there to vse and commaund. Which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
for the desire I had to be imployed in
matters profitable to the Realme, &amp; forthwith
I went into Allemaigne, to passe thence to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan.
But being aduertised, that my Lord the
Duke of Lorraine had brought his siege before
Iametz, I staied, and that for twoo reasons: The
first, because I would not trauayle alone in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of so many armed men, and loose my selfe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21643:6"/>
against my will. The other, seeing the said Duke
had begun this warre contrary to the opinion
of many, and of my selfe likewise: I should bee
thought (in respect of what I had promised)
scant maister of my sences, to goe cast my selfe
downe headlong, and so with the councell of
my Lords the Duke Cazimire &amp; Deux-ponts,
and other my good freendes, I embraced the
way of negotiation, rather then that of force.</p>
            <p>Beeing then returned to Geneua, I sent to
his Maiestie, to aduertise him of my charge, and
how my intent stretched to the benefite of his
seruice, hoping hee would not misconceiue of
mine enterprise: humbly desiring his highnes,
to wish my Lord the Duke of Lorrayne, not to
whet his anger vpon an innocent ward, and to
forbeare to touch Sedan and Iametz, frontiers
of his Realme. He wrote to me againe, that he
would send the Lord de Rieux, to cause the
siege to be raysed from Iametz, and that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Montpensier should goe with speed to
Sedan, for the better disposing of the affayres
there: beside, he thought good that I should
not need to goe, because order should be taken
by these meanes. For the rest, hee commended
mine intent, and would assure himselfe of my
vndoubted affection to his seruice, &amp; the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
good of my country, whose safetie I would
euermore seeke by all lawfull meanes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:21643:6"/>This letter receyued, I paused thereon, for the
opinion I held, that the commendation, intreaty,
and prouision of so great a King, would suffise to
remedie a mischiefe that pressed so farre. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
attended for the space of three moneths, &amp;
seene that the wordes of his Maiestie were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
and that one of the Townes was now to
be defended from a furious assault that the other
likewise would go forth in Armes, against them
that made their fieldes voyde and desolate, and
that my Lord the Duke of Montpensier could
not (for good considerations) proceed so farre
as to these places: Seeing likewise (on the other
side) many good Frenchmen, and others of the
Religion, not onely to write to mee, but to tell
me, that in respect of the charge I had taken on
me, I should receyue reproche, and bee accused
to haue fayled in honour, and against the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
I owe to my Souereigne Lord: if I would
not trauayle with hand and heart, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
of these oppressed Townes, which
were vnder the protection of the King, &amp; how
I might sufficiently behold, that against effects
of such puissance, it were in vaine to bring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
helps, but rather matter of like conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
This being vndoubtedly true, I should
so acknowledge: yet I imagined, that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and reasonable proceedinges, ought to
outgoe such as are gouerned by violence, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21643:7"/>
for mine owne particular regard.</p>
            <p>In this sort I prepared my selfe to go into Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaigne,
where I discoursed with certaine
Princes, freendes to this Realme: to see by what
meanes they could warrant, that which it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Frenchmen would loose, and strangers
occupy. They pleaded that this difference arose
on small occasion, and could no way be so bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
decided as by Armes: since that to a Countie
of Monbelliard, who had receyued as great an
iniury, they would deny to make satisfaction.
Now as eche one knowes, that the Allemaigne
iron will not bee mooued without a straungers
golde, and that the one being not seene to glister
aboundantly, the other stands still without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of stir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing: This made mee resolute to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
to Sedan, which I perfourmed, passing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwart
Lorrayne and Fraunce, with no small
store of daungerous perils, and beeing there ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued,
I vnderstood the truth of the state of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metz,
(the defenders of which place are woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
great prayse) which rather stood in neede
of fauour, then now to come to the sharpest
tearmes: yet was I aduised to attempt the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
and sweetest course, causing to be proposed
to my Lord of Ansonuille, a most auncient and
honorable stay in actions of hostilitie, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
moneths, as well to win time in woorking
on the entraunces, made by Madame of Aram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21643:7"/>
neere kinswoman to Madamoyselle of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillon:
as also the better to dispose affections
in seeking the means of agreement, rather then
to follow these threatnings of ruine. These con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
would be no lesse for the assaulters, then
for the people assayled, nor of lesse honour to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
But they hauing examined them, would
neither make any account thereof, or answere,
happily for some opinion they holde, in staying
on their aduauntage and hope, rather then in
their consenting: which will be an occasion, to
giue a long course to the euils that this little
warre hath ingendred, and daily will do. Which
to preuent, Monsieur de la Ferté, who hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
come to Sedan about busines, shall be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
how I haue twise sayde vnto him, that my
Lord the Duke of Lorrayne shall gather no
great fruite by this warre: little gayne shall hee
get, and that vncertaine, but store of charge
and trauayle certaine. The Towne of lametz,
which yet resisteth, hath cost him foure times
more then it is woorth: yet should not hee set
himselfe agaynst an Orphane Princesse, who
demaundeth nothing but peace, whereto shee
will attaine by dilligent search: otherwise her
country must suffer, and in such sort as it were to
begin agayne. As could I declare vnto him
by what meanes, and hee should bee suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
therewith, when I speake that which is true,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21643:8"/>
rather as a seruant to his deserts then an enemy,
and as one that loueth quiet, vnwilling to vse
my Armes against him. This likewise I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
alleadge, to the ende it may be knowne,
that I haue attempted all courteous wayes not
to enter Armes: as well for the good of both
partyes, as alfo for mine owne contentment.
Certainly, I am very desirous, not to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned
to drawe my swoord, which for these
eight yeares hath continued idle, and chiefly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a Prince, to whome I finde my selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding.
Yet (in my iudgement) he is brought
into these newfou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d conceits, by the bad &amp; euill
disposed councell of others, rather then by his
owne naturall disposition: but I may not goe
contrary to that which reason willeth, who
commandeth me when question is made of two
bondes, to preferre the cause of nature before
that of getting, because it is a matter most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
and among these acquisitions, after I haue
iudged of the difference betweene them, I will
stay my selfe vpon the strongest.</p>
            <p>Among all Nations, naturall dutie hath euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
beene, and yet is most commendable, and
the first (after God) is that wherewith wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
our country, which comprehendeth in it
all the other, and bindeth vs so straitly to her,
that it is (as it were) sacrilege, to fayle in the due
performance therof; none of all the other may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21643:8"/>
be equalled with this. As for the fathers &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
themselues, who haue giuen life to their
children, when the father shall be imployed in
the right of his country: they must be constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to holde him excused, howsoeuer deuoted
in affection he be to them. Much more ought
such doo, as holde any one bound onely for a
good turne or a simple promise: for it is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
consequence, that a greater matter must be
preferred before a lesse. I haue heere before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that which I promised to my Lord the
Duke of Lorrayne, but yet with an exception,
which although it had not beene made, ought
euermore to take place, and I thinke that few
people would make doubt thereof, (albeit wee
lyue in such a season, wherin all things are deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and disguised) that the dutie to the Prince,
must go before that is due to any benefactour:
who happily may say; Seeing I haue beene the
cause of your libertie, why will you offend me
with Armes, which you promised not to beare
against me? Truly I cannot deny, that my Lord
the Duke of Lorrayne hath ayded mee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the same more entiere and happy: but I
should not haue recouered the same (which I
speake not as ingratefull for his good turne) by
the three meanes that I haue rehearsed, before
hee bound mee to him: not hauing so small a
thing to promise in preiudice of my present
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21643:9"/>
bond, whereto nature, the lawes, and men of
vertue, will that I cause it to holde due degree.</p>
            <p>I know well it will bee obiected to mee, that
the party which I make to sound so high, ought
to enter into consideration, to see what is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
against it: which I would with all my
heart. But what is this then, to assayle Sedan &amp;
Iametz, Townes vnder the protection, frontiers
of the Realme, faithfull to the Crowne, peopled
with Frenchmen? is not this to touch Fraunce
it selfe? Truely a Romane Ambassadour that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from Hanniball, sayd most well &amp; wisely
before the Senate, that the Carthaginians in
beating of the walles of Sagunt, a confederate
Cittie, battered the walles of Rome. And with
as good right it may be sayde, when with their
Cannons they beat on Iametz, they might doo
the like against them of Paris.</p>
            <p>I haue beene patient so long time, that I haue
iust occasion to feare, least I bee reprooued of
sloth and breach of fayth (hauing a lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for the defence of the said Towns) if I should
longer deferre to imploy my selfe in their safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
from ruine. King Frauncis the great durst
hazard his person and forces, not to haue the
dishonor of the losse of Landrecy, a little towne
that was not of his Realme, but gotten in the
countrey of another. The like did the deceassed
Duke of Guyze, for the defence of Metz, at the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21643:9"/>
new entraunce thereof into the protection of
Fraunce. Should I then fayle, that am but a
most simple subiect, yet retayned for those that
are incorporate with vs, and where there is not
one house, but the Flowers de Luces floorish
therein?</p>
            <p>I shall bee accused as ingratefull towards my
benefactour, because I beare these Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him: but it is in such a defence as I may
not forsake, without beeing conuinced of more
great ingratitude towardes my Countrey and
King.</p>
            <p>You haue broken (saith one) your promise,
which vpon so woorthy a good turne you harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
plighted. If things were in like estate as when
I promysed, I should bee restrayned within my
bounds: but one hath chaunged them, in doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that which I haue shewed, and vnlawfull
beside to be doone.</p>
            <p>Let vs now come vnto the second bond, that
the Tutour is to procure the best for his warde,
and ayd her so farre as need shall require. The
Ciuilians holde thus much, that they place this
next after the father to his owne childe: and will
that the officer shall run to the maintenance of
his wardes right, so soone as to that belongeth
to his Prince. This also reason requireth: the
one being more destitute of a stay or helpe, then
the other, and this bond fulfilled, is so much the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21643:10"/>
more of force, in that it is ioyned next vnto
that of nature. So that I am not to be thought
woorthy of blame, if I haue preferred this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the other vnto my Lord the Duke of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne:
namely in this respect, because it is to
defend, and not to assayle, the defence beeing
more iust then the offence: seeing also, that
this charge was deferred to mee, before my
Lord of Lorrayne assayled Madamoyselle de
Bouillon.</p>
            <p>And that which hath fortifyed me in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
is in hauing examined the cause of
the warre, I finde that the assaulter hath very
slender right to doo so: for if it were about any
auncient difference, hee ought then to shewe
his titles, and to haue them disputed by reason.
If hee haue proceeded on any iuiurie receyued
by the deceassed Lord of Bouillon: why dooth
he not as much to the King of Nauarre, to the
Allemaigns, Zwitzers &amp; Frenchmen, who haue
all sacked and burned within the countrey of
Lorraine? It is not reasonable, that this little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
should satisfie for a common domage.</p>
            <p>Ought wee not rather imitate that course,
that serued for the wrongs doone to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Mont-belliart, to wit, a freendly composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was proposed for feare of the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigns:
who notwithstanding euermore denied
helpe to this ward, left desolate in sight of euery
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21643:10"/>
one? In meane while, God will woorke for the
oppressed, and succour them in time needfull.</p>
            <p>In fine, it is in vayne to flatter, but rather
speake the truth: doth it not appeare, that this is
for the dissipatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the realme, when they make
such shouldering, where the one side is percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
&amp; the other masqued? What is this but as
the Parisians did, and as the attempt against Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longne
sometime, and on the Marquisate of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce
not long since? Is not this rather to run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a pray, then it can any way seeme for the
Kings seruice, when they pill and poll, &amp; make
such outrage? I will auouch that his wisedome
is great, &amp; yet greater is the constraint that one
maketh of his will, in pressing it to resolue on a
war, wherein depends the ruine of France espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in one that hath a spirite of sweetnes and
peace. In this case, what ought an honest min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
man, couragious, and a louer of his country
doo? euen to imitate the auncient Frenchmen,
braue heads &amp; Captaines, as the Bastard of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaunce,
the Hire and Poton, they seeing King
Charles the seuenth to despaire of his affaires,
being assailed with most puissant enemies in the
very entrailes of his Realme, whome he quietly
suffered, as vnable to remedie the same: yet
would not these (for all this) let fall their vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable
hope, but with a ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would
venture the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in this immine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, to find
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21643:11"/>
some meane to exempt the same. And as for the
apprehension of the present euill, some holde, it
may be that the King enclosed, will giue a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
to his subiect, not to aid his estate
now perishing: shall this default bee an excuse
for the subiect? We owe loue, obeisance, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
and fidelitie to our King, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
may die: but wee owe so much to our
countrey as cannot dye.</p>
            <p>Truely I should be quit of my promise to his
Maiestie, not to beare Armes against his seruice
(albeit I must perseuer heerein, if I be vsed as an
enemy) seeing the horrible confusions that are
in the estate: for all is corrupted, force ruleth,
the lawes are without strength, and euen alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
(by some) our houses are diuided, and our
liues prescribed, so that we haue no right of the
one or other. As for the roiall authoritie, in what
manner is it reuyled, despited by the people,
when butcheries shall be made of the subiects of
the Realme? Solon said, that in a diuision a good
Citizen ought not to stand still, but to take the
better parte, in respect of his bond to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
But our countrey is not onely diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but ouerthrowne; not in perill, but already
lost. And in the middest of so great disorder, is
it wisedome to sit with our armes crosse folded,
when reason bids vs throw them abroad? Shall
I attend the rest of the misfortunes of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21643:11"/>
Frenchmen, to depend on our warres, hauing
bowed their knees before the angry conqueror,
or before a straunger, to the end that afterward
I may receiue what Silla presented to his hoast
at Praeneste? This cannot bee doone but once,
vnwoorthy is it to doo it twise. But when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
things to come, in how miserable estate we
shall be, if God should call away our King, (to
whom I wish a long life, conioined with a iust &amp;
peaceable raigne) wee should not suffer to rise
these factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Burgundie and Orleance, which
now prepare themselues, the one to assaile, &amp; the
other to defend: euen that will happen which is
publikely spoken, and the blind themselues may
see, that this warre begun, is rather for the state
then any Religion: but from what euill shall
we then escape free, and of what goodes shall we
not be depriued?</p>
            <l>Hatred, discord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> spoyle, and these Allarmes,</l>
            <l>Crueltie, feare, fierce combats, &amp; these Armes,</l>
            <l>Shall be our pastimes, &amp;c.</l>
            <p>But now to escape these daungerous rockes,
let vs turne our selues to God, who sendes these
plagues for our incorrigible behauiour. Let vs
weepe for our countrey, and succour her in this
generall shipwracke: let vs euery one helpe to
saue her with our armes, and not with our legs,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21643:12"/>
according as the Romaine saide: who forsooke
Caesars part being his benefactour, to embrace
that of the common good.</p>
            <p>I pray God, that in this generall assembly of
the Estates, some one will craue remedie for our
insupportable euils: which may bee throughly
holpen by ceassing these Armes, and remaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
by the continuance.</p>
            <p>This is an heretique that speaketh (some zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
will say) beleeue them not, rather account
them blasphemers. My Lords, be not offended
at these wordes, which may serue you to colour
the warre you would prolong. Truely I am no
heretique, for I will liue and die in this excellent
and renowned fayth of the Romaine Church, a
member of the Catholike: euen the same that
Saint Paul (who was the first Bishop thereof)
instituted, as it appeareth by his sacred registers.
But shall I tell you who he is that wee ought to
account an heretique, in these times wherin we
liue? It is the man that desireth not any peace
or concord in the estate: that wisheth the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
thereof: that strengtheneth himselfe with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the Realme: that expecteth the fall
thereof, because he might gather the pieces;
who hath equitie and holines in his mouth, and
iniustice and hypocrisie in his hart. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the true Catholique is hee that pursueth
peace and vnanimitie: that suffereth paciently
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21643:12"/>
the temporall gouernment established by God
ouer him: that holdes in suspition those straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
who would procure our ruine: that would
haue the estate preserued: and that sheweth in
all his actions how he loueth order, iustice, and
pietie.</p>
            <p>For conclusion, I will loue my country which
hath brought me vp, I will reuerence my Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne
Lord, although he would pursue mee, I
will defend my libertie, goodes, and life, if any
would take them from me. I will aid the French
shamefully afflicted, in as much as I may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
doo, I will garde my warde, as the lawes
commaund mee, and I will oppose my selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
straungers (whatsoeuer particular bond
they hold of mee) who would against all right
possesse themselues with the Towns of the
Realme, for I am a true Frenchman.
Inough is said, the time requires
I should doo it, in respect
it is followed true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and iustly.</p>
