            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere needs no more to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this Book (<hi>Remains of Mr. Joseph Alleine</hi>) to thee, but to assure thee that it is his own, and though a Posthumous, yet no spurious birth. Though some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels come to thee with this disadvant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, onely as they were taken from his mouth as he preached, yet much of it was written with his own hand. If thou hast tasted that divine and warm spirit, which run through his other Writings already published, it will sure set thee a thirsting after what els hath drop'd from the same holy lips or hands. The labours of a man of God, so mighty in the Sriptures, and in the power of God, will not be either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>useful, or unacceptable: though what thou hast here, be but fragments, yet thou wilt find them to be of the same bread, with those loves which have been already dealt out to thee, by the
<pb facs="tcp:62321:4"/>
same hand The Publisher hath gathered up these fragments, it being pity they should be lost. For my part, I have not had the time to read through the whole Book since it came to my hands, but have so far lookt into it, that I Judge it to be singularly useful, for the engaging thee in, and directing and quickning thee to that even, spiritual, active life, which will be both thy beauty and thy comfort.</p>
            <p>That the spirit of the living God, which so eminently furnished the head, fired the heart, and filled up the life of this holy man, may so animate these holy lines, that they may become ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to the forming their very Image upon thy soul and life, is the prayer of,</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62321:13"/>First, <hi>Because men are so generally mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in their own hearts:</hi> and that both <hi>bad</hi> men, and <hi>good</hi> men. <hi>Bad men,</hi> how osten do they boast of their good hearts?

               <hi>Dogs,</hi> and <hi>Tygers</hi> to do this: and yet a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And it is like that he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend what he spake, yea, he did try sarther than the rest did, sor he only did draw his sword. And who would have thought that there was that swearing, and cursing in his heart as there was? And so of <hi>David</hi>'s Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, The difficulty of this appears, <hi>Because the Saints have called in the special help of God, without which they could not come to know it.</hi> So did <hi>David</hi> Psal. 139. 23. <hi>Search me O God,</hi> &amp;c.

Our hearts will deal with us, without this, as a bad neighbour will do when we come to search for our Goods, they will not let you in, except you come with the Kings Officer. Now the difficulty of this lyes (1) <hi>In that the heart of man is so deep,</hi> Eccl. 7. 24. <hi>That which is exceeding deep who can find it out?</hi> Now so is the heart of man; for so <hi>Psal.</hi> 64. 6. <hi>And the heart is deep.</hi> The heart of man is deep as earth, yea, as Hell. <hi>

And we need not any further evidence for this, than that common good opinion that men have of their hearts. Though their hearts are full of odious poyson, and the like, yet they cannot see it till God open their eyes by conversion; and then they can see it: But yet it is but <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-light</hi> that the best of us have here of our hearts.

               </gap> lect, neglect not this duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62321:14"/>Now there be sundry ways of Communing with our own hearts. Sometimes by way of <hi>Consolation. Return to thy Rest O my Soul,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. 116. 7. Sometimes by way of <hi>expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Why <hi>art thou cast down O my soul,</hi> &amp;c. Ps. 42. Sometimes by way of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> to quicken and excite our hearts. <hi>Psal.</hi> 62. 5. <hi>My soul wait thou onely upon God.</hi> Here he stirs up his heart in <hi>believing</hi> in God. So <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, up my Glory.</hi> that is, my heart or soul. The soul of man, that is his honour, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 6. And see how <hi>David</hi> doth exhort his soul: up my heart, my Glory. He found his heart, it may be, somewhat dead and dull, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he stirs it up, sometimes by way of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi> Psal. 16. 2. 7.</p>
            <p>But sometimes by way of <hi>Examination</hi> and <hi>Inquiry,</hi> that is the principal on which all the rest do depend, and therefore I intend to insist on that; and I beseech you to stir up your selves to this duty. My Brethren, you should be often questioning with your own hearts; It is sad to think how <hi>Papists,</hi> yea <hi>Pagans</hi> do out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass us in this, and what a shame is it that we should be such strangers to this duty? After we have been told of it, and have confessed that it is a duty!</p>
            <p>Now you must know there is a <hi>double Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Ordinary,</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary. Ordinary,</hi> and that is either <hi>Transient,</hi> or <hi>more solemn.</hi> The first we should be in continually, every hour in the day. The want of this is the reason that we are such strangers to our own hearts, Christian, Remember this and step in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62321:15"/>
often into thy own heart and thoughts, the heart of man is always talking to it self; and you should often step in and see what it is that they are talking of, see if they are well employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if they be not, set them a Task, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>before, in,</hi> and <hi>after duties;</hi> especially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter duties to search what evil we have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the duty, or else we shall not find matter for examination of our hearts in the evening; we should take notes of our hearts all the day, &amp; read them over in the evening. And then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, there must be a <hi>solemn Examination.</hi> And here I should beseech you Christians, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evening to spend some time for this work; a quarter, or half an hour. I speak of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening</hi> because the <hi>Scripture</hi> speaks so much of this time; and the practice of good men have been in this time: A very <hi>Heathen</hi> could do this, and you shall find this was <hi>David</hi>'s practice. <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>My Reins instruct me in the Night-season.</hi> Well then, I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise thee Christian, to take this advice.</p>
            <p>Every Evening before you sleep, set some time apart, more or less, from the world, and set thy heart as in the presence of God, and charge it before God, to answer to these inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> With reference to your <hi>Duties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First. Did <hi>not God find me on my bed when he looked for me on my knees?</hi> This question might be a shaming question, and I cannot without indignation speak of this, that many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> us should be so willing to please our selves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> a little case, when we should enjoy those
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62321:15"/>
pleasant hours with God! How do you think that God will take this at your hands? there be many persons that do spend many hours in their <hi>beds,</hi> that they might enjoy Communion with God in, and then they are fain to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> up their duties in a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ner, I beseech you that this may be left off. It may be, many of you have not so much to do in the world as others, they have not the business that others have, and therefore they need not rise so soon, but lye longer than others. Ah Christian! do not make that use of it, thou hast no more time for <hi>sloth</hi> than others. I tell thee from God, he hath not given thee any time to be idle in. I am afraid that many of you do not know what it is to <hi>sleep by Rule</hi> If thou dost not, this is a shame to thee, a Christian should do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by Rule. It may be some will say, what Rule must we use? <hi>Ans.</hi> We must have respect to our Bodies, what may be for one man, may not be for another; but for <hi>heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy bodies</hi> six or seven h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>urs is enough in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; let every man give his body no more than his body will require. And remember this general Rule, to be sure that you do use some <hi>Self-denyal</hi> about your <hi>sleep:</hi> That general Rule should be observed, though the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Rule cannot be given. That excellent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, <hi>Mr. Jordan,</hi> that kept assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods love thirty years, did up at three or four a clock every morning, and if he did not, he did bewail it; O that it were thus with you!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62321:16"/>Secondly. <hi>Have I not prayed to no purpose, or let Roving thoughts eat out my Duty?</hi> Take an account every Evening what you have gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by that days Prayers, if we did so, this would be brave; then we should grow apace. But this is our great loss, that we content our selves with the duty done, and do not look to the manner of performance, or the doing of the Duty; therefore if thou wouldst gain by thy duties, see HOW as well as WHAT thou didst pray. How did I pray! was my heart lively or dull? Let it not be enough that your hearts do acquit you in this, that you have not <hi>neglected</hi> duty, but whether you have not been <hi>slack</hi> in the duty. And because vain thoughts are our great enemies here, look that these do not eat up thy Sacrifice; we have been often complaining of these, but we are not eased of them: And what is the reason? because we do not take our hearts to Task about it, for our vain thoughts in duty every day; if we did but ask our hearts this every Evening, our hearts would be ashamed to be found guilty every day.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. <hi>Have I not neglected, or been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry overly in the Reading of Gods holy Word?</hi> I am afraid that many of us do neglect this duty, doth not there pass over our heads ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a day wherein we Read not a <hi>Chapter?</hi> And yet I fear more of the <hi>manner</hi> how you Read. Did you begin with Prayer, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what <hi>promises,</hi> or <hi>Commands,</hi> or <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi> or <hi>Examples</hi> were there for you to <hi>Imitate,</hi> or to <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>avoid?</hi> And did you
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62321:16"/>
turn it into <hi>Prayer</hi> afterwards? That I would advise you to, to turn some of the Chapter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prayer afterward. O that we should slight the word, that the Saints of God have set such a price upon! The word! why 'tis the word of God, and when we see the hand of God to it, this should affect us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. <hi>Have I digested the Sermon I heard last?</hi> Have I prayed it over, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated it over? Brethren, would you know why we are such Dwarfs in Christianity, why we grow so little? Here is one grand Reason, we <hi>take</hi> in much and <hi>digest</hi> but little; it may be thou art greedy of taking opportunities, there cannot be a Sermon but thou must be at it, or else it is not well; but dost thou Pray it over, and Repeat it over again? The want of this is the reason that we grow no better, therefore content not thy self that thou hast heard such a Sermon; it is never well till God hear of it, in Confession, Prayer, and praise for such mercies as were discovered to thee. This is the way to thrive, and you will never Thrive till you come to this. The Reason why there have been so much sowing and so little fruit, is because the seed hath not been <hi>covered</hi> by <hi>Meditation,</hi> and <hi>watered</hi> by <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> the Devil or evil thoughts come and steal away the seed.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Was there not more of custome and Fashion in my Family-Duties, than of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</hi> Brethren, if my observation fail not, Christians are more apt to be formal in these Duties than in others. Now this should be a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62321:17"/>
cause of shame to us, this is a very great evil, we are very formal in such duties as do come ordinarily, especially if we are not the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, but do joyn with others: whereas, if thou didst but make this use of it, thankfully to prize, and gladly improve such opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, thou would'st thrive more abundanly. Say with thy self, now I have an opportunity to worship God in the Family. You that are Heads of Families it is a great mercy that you have, that you can lead your Families into the presence of God: and you that are members of the Family, have a great mercy that you live in a Family where you can come twice a day, at least, to God beyond many others, and do you labour to improve it.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Wherein have I denyed my self to day for God?</hi> Brethren, you have not lived like Christians this day, if so be you have not used some self-denial to day; If thou hast not denied thy <hi>flesh,</hi> but hast given it so much case as it would have: and thy <hi>Appetite,</hi> but hast let it have so much as it would, and thy <hi>tongue,</hi> but let it go out whither it would; thou hast not lived as a Christian.</p>
            <p>Seventhly. <hi>Have I redeemed my time from too long and needless visits,</hi> Idle <hi>imaginations</hi> fruitless <hi>Discourses,</hi> unnnecessary <hi>Sleep,</hi> more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than needs of the <hi>world?</hi> It is a duty incum bent upon every Christian to redeem his time, this hath sate heavy upon the best of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that they have no more redeemed time; now if you would redeem your time, there be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62321:17"/>
these <hi>time-Robbers</hi> and devourers that must be watched.</p>
            <p>First. <hi>Too long and needless visits.</hi> Many men are so <hi>LONG</hi> in their visits, that they loose much time of their own, and others too; whom they go to visit. Ask thy heart have not I been <hi>too long</hi> in such a visit, and so steal away others time as well as my own? And so for <hi>NEEDLESS</hi> visits, when there is no need; be sparing and short in your visits or else <hi>you</hi> will loose your time, and make <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> to loose their time also.</p>
            <p>Secondly. <hi>Idle imaginations.</hi> These steal away our time, and we think not of it; If this were look'd to how might we grow in grace? When a man is on his <hi>Journey,</hi> how might he have good thoughts, whereas our hearts are talking of vanity; and so in our <hi>Shops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. <hi>Fruitless Discourse.</hi> Ask thy heart whether thou hast not failed in this duty? what a shame is this that many Christians do come together and scarce any thing of <hi>God</hi> in their mouths while they be together!</p>
            <p>Fourthly. <hi>Unnecessary Sleep.</hi> There is much evil in this, when persons do take up so much time in their sleep, that there is scarce time left for Religious Duties.</p>
            <p>Fifthly. <hi>More than needs of the World.</hi> Men must be very watchfull of this or else the world will Rob them of their time, if a man will not use some self-denyal about his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occasions, but serve God no more than the world will give him leave, he shall serve God but little.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:62321:18"/>Eighthly. <hi>Have I done any thing more than ordinary, for the Church of God, in a time extraordinary?</hi> Brethren, we shall never be able to stand before our own Consciences in the evil day, if our hearts cannot acquit us in this, that we have put our selves to it more than ordinary for the <hi>Church of God.</hi> You know the troubles of the Church at this day, and we should every one of us run with his Bucket, and put out this fire. God is cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, as <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Aaron, Num.</hi> 16. 46. <hi>Take a Censer — and go quickly unto the Congregation, and make an attonement for them; for there is wrath gone out from the Lord, the Plague is begun.</hi> O let us run for the Tokens of his displeasure are in the land! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> your tears that must quench these flames that the Bush, the Church is burning in. How is it that we do not weep over the Church? we sit here at ease through Gods blessing, but how is it with the Church of God abroad in the land? How far are our hearts from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Gods worthies heretofore? It was said of <hi>One,</hi> that when there was any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ad news, concerning the Church, they were fain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it from her, least her heart should be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with the news of it.</p>
            <p>If we had some certain news that our <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states</hi> were at undoing, how would we break our sleep? and yet how is it that we are so careless of the Church of God! How is it that others are so wounded and sick, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to die with grief, and yet we take so little notice of it? It was the saying of <hi>One</hi> to me,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62321:18"/>
I wonder how any can laugh (<hi>said she</hi>) when Gods Church is in such distress. I beseech you take some more time with God than you were wont to heretofore, for the Church of God. What if thou didst pray <hi>twice a day</hi> heretofore, and now thou doest pray <hi>three times</hi> a day, once a day the more though but a quarter of an hour. to seek to God for the Church, and sometimes a whole day; it will come in upon thy account, when the troubles come upon the Church, that thou didst labour with thy Bucket, if it were possible, to put out the fire.</p>
            <p>Ninthly. <hi>Have I took care of my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?</hi> Many times many of us are very great Loosers by this, by vain company; to be sure if they do us no other harm, they Rob us of our <hi>Time,</hi> and that is no small hurt; and therefore fly from their Company as from a Plague-fore. Or if sometimes thy <hi>Calling</hi> do call thee to them, yet do not go among them, before thou hast Prayed to be delivered from the evil of their Company.</p>
            <p>Tenthly. <hi>Have not I neglected some Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Duty to day, as of Husband, Wife, Pa rent, Child, Master, Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>for your sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First. <hi>Doth not Sin sit light?</hi> This is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> cause of no small mischief to our souls, this is the cause why <hi>Christ</hi> is no more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> sits so light: why we can hear the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a common lovely thing, and be but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

               </gap> fected with it? If thou couldst but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62321:19"/>
sense of sin upon thy spirit, this would be a speedy course of preventing sin; this is a cutting down of a great limb of sin. When a man cuts down a Limb of the Tree, a great deal of brush will come down with it; and so if thou dost but cut down this Limb, let sin sit heavy, down comes self, and pride, and many sins will come down with it. How is it that <hi>Paul</hi> could say, O wretched man that I am <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we are no more distressed with the sense of sin?</p>
            <p>Secondly. <hi>Am I a Mourner for the sins of the Land?</hi> My Brethren, we have great reason, I doubt, to check our selves sharply here, that when God hath made it so plainly a duty to us, and yet we are so little affected with the sins of the Land, when God doth set a mark upon them (onely) for preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Cry for all the abominations that are done in the midst of the Land; yet we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main insensible! Can our hearts acquit us now in this thing? O let us never leave our hearts, but be checking of them for this. If thy name were but wounded, it would break thy heart almost; and yet how is it that we can hear of Gods name to be dishonoured and yet not break for it! Can our hearts witness for us that we do never hear of the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie that is in the land, and of the Superstition and Idolatry of the land, but God doth hear of it again by us, before we sleep, by Prayer? This should be for a lamentation to us, that the wounds that are given to God are no more upon our hearts. We may say of the glory
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62321:19"/>
of God as they of <hi>David.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 3. <hi>'Tis worth ten thousand of us.</hi> Our estates, and names, and all that is dear to us, yea, our very souls are not so much worth as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God. And how is it then that we can see God dishonoured, and we cannot mourn sor it? Gods glory is his Crown that is upon his head; and shall we see his Crown trodden, down in the dirt and not be affected with it? we are far from the disposition of Gods Saints and servants heretofore. When <hi>Moses</hi> saw the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the people, he was so zealous, that he overturned the <hi>Tables</hi> that God wrote with his own finger. And <hi>Ezra</hi> when the people had taken strange wives he sate down and <hi>

            <p>First. <hi>Have I been much in holy ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> Thus we ought to <hi>Pray continually;</hi> not onely at our set and solemn times, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occasions, to step aside and speak a word or two with God; in our Journeys, and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, this is <hi>walking with God</hi> indeed; when we do not onely take a turn or two with him in the <hi>morning,</hi> and so in the <hi>evening,</hi> but all the day long. It is said of <hi>Mr. Dod,</hi> that he never got up his <hi>Horse,</hi> but he prayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came off. Thus did <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> while the King was talking with him, he was pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>So I prayed to the God of Heaven,</hi> this was a Heavenly ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this would keep your hearts a praying all the day long. When the hearts of men do naturally bend to God, as the sparks fly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this is a good thing indeed; when we cannot go by the door, but we must step in and have a turn with God; you will take it as a great kindness for a man not onely to come on set times to visit you, but when he comes in every time he comes by the door to see you; And when thy heart is thus wont to turn into God, this will be an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to thee that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62321:20"/>
thy heart is used to converse with God.</p>
            <p>Secondly. <hi>Hath not God been out of mind, Heaven out of sight?</hi> put that question to thy heart. My Brethren, this is our great sin, and should be our great shame, that the thoughts of God are such strangers to our souls; that we are so little in heaven in the day, as we are. O what a loser is God by this in his glory! what losers are we by this in our graces and comforts! O were our hearts on all occasions thus <hi>thinking of God</hi> how holy a frame should we quickly grow into? Why should not our hearts be as much with God, as the hearts of the Worldlings be with the Creature? Doth not God deserve it as much as the Creature? His heart is always talking with the World: If he come to hear, his heart is talking with the world. If he come to pray, his heart is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the World. Why should not our hearts be talking with God while our hands are employed about this world? It was a Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breathing of a <hi>gracious spirit,</hi> a confounding passage, that I met with; <hi>Lord as formerly I lived without thee in the world, so now let me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> without the world in thee. If we did but love God as well as a worldly man doth love his wealth and riches, we should be so taken up with the love of God as quite to forget the world. For the world makes them forget God, that he is not alwayes in their thoughts. Yea, says he, we should be taken up always with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Brethren, what shall we say for this! How shall we excuse this, that we should be so unmindfull of God, while the Worldling is so
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62321:21"/>
mindful of the world? O what a shame is this! For shame, be ashamed at your selves before we go away hence. I profess Christians, I have wondred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> God will throw away his kingdome upon some that do care so little for it as we do. O shame thy self out of this evil frame! Brethren, why do not we carry it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the world, as the world doth towards us? The world doth carry it towards us as <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> and we know not what it will do to us. VVhy should not we carry it more strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards it? O never leave, till the thoughts of Heaven be thy <hi>natural thoughts,</hi> O check thy heart ronndly in the Evening for this sin, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

               </gap> brought it into a right frame.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. <hi>Have I been often looking into my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp; made conscience even of vian thoughts?</hi> you know your Rule, <hi>Keep thy heart with all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of it are the Issues of life.</hi> Now hast thou been keeping thy heart with all diligence? Brethren, you may be sure your work will go but badly on, unless you look to your hearts, and keep your hearts. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine then in the Evening, how hath my heart been employed to day, hath it not been a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-fare of vain thoughts? of evil imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? I fear that many of us do make little con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> of this. It may be thou dost make conscience of vain thoughts <hi>in duty:</hi> but I fear that few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> do make conscience of vain thoughts at <hi>other times.</hi> Ah Brethren, you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> not known what it is to live the life of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62321:21"/>
Christianity, if you do not look to this. This must be mended. Brethren, what a blessed thing would this be, if we had but once attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this frame! If our hearts did but naturally run in a hollow Channel? This is attainable, and many of the Christians have attained to it. And if it be attainable, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> we should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be quiet till we have attained it. Why, Christian, take this Rule, force thy heart a while to it; keep thy heart for a while in this Tract, set it some holy Subject, some good Task, and make it to ply its work; and when thou hast got to this, then by degrees it will be sweet to thee. It is not enough to say, what hurt is there in such vain thoughts? It is enough that there is no good in them, that there is no profit in them; yea, there is a great deal of hurt in letting thy thoughts to run abroad. My Brethren, you do, I believe, every one of you that are Christians indeed, complain of the burthen of your vain thoughts. I believe, that this is the greatest trouble of many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians here, for the vanity of their thoughts in holy duties. And what is the reason of this? Because they do let out their hearts at other times; this is the reason that we have no more command of our hearts in holy duties, because we do not keep them in at other times. God complains of <hi>Jerusalem, Jer.</hi> 4. 14. (and may he not complain so of us?) <hi>O Jerusalem, how long shall vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> Have not we, many of us, been complaining these seven or twice seven years of vain thoughts, and yet they are lodging in us? And
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62321:22"/>
if you take this course with your hearts, you will find more benefit in it, than ever you did in any thing that you have tryed hitherto.</p>
            <p>But I know what the flesh will say here, what to be <hi>always</hi> taken up with holy things? this will be an intollerable burthen. O but do not hearken to the evil report, that the flesh will bring upon the wayes of God. Indeed I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it will bring some dissiculty, yet I trust, you will be willing to be at some pain for so great a good as this is, but after a little while you will find it easie. There is nothing that is easie to a Learner, but if it be a Trade or such a Tongue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a little while that he is used to it, it is his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>light. And so will this be the sweetest thing in the world to thee, if thou dost but keep thy heart to it a while. And therefore never leave watching and praying, till thou hast got thy heart into this frame.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. <hi>Have not I given way to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of pride or passion to day?</hi> My Brethren, the Spirit of God is a holy Dove that will not rest in an unquiet and froward heart. It was a passage os a very <hi>Holy man, Whatsoever you do, take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of passion.</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Elijah</hi> was sain to call for a <hi>Minstrel</hi> before he could allay his passion; I beseech you to watch your hearts when there is a temptation to pride, and a provocation to passion before you, or else you will grieve the good spirit of God, and make him to withdraw himself from you. It is a saying of <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> when there is a temptation to pride before me, I am fain to watch my heart as narrowly as I would do the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62321:22"/>
Thatch of my house, when fire is put to it; and presently to throw on it the water of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, Resolution, and recourse to God. And so must you do if ever you mean to attain to a heavenly heart. I remember it is written in the Life of a <hi>Holy man,</hi> that he did fear and tremble more when he did hear his commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than when it never so dreadfully thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this frame should be in thee. O fear temptations to pride, I beseech you tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> heed of pride, that your hearts do not grow haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If you do not take good heed, you are like to fall, That Servant is never like to do much for God that is puffed up with pride, If thou hast got down thy self, and trod upon the neck of pride, then thou art become a great Victor indeed. This is the reason why God doth not employ us in his service more, because he sees that there is such an evil heart in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that we would make his mercies fuell for our pride and Lust. Let it be your daily practice to get the victory over this enemy, the pride of your heart. It was a very exemplary pattern that is set before us in that <hi>holy man;</hi> Says he, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himself, Methinks I am broken all in peices before God when I speak to him, as when I tread upon an Egg and trample it all to peices. It was a passage in one of his Letters writing to comfort another, I pray God make use of me a poor Rush, to do you some good. Let us lay this pattern before us. But more especially, look to our holy and humble <hi>Jesus;</hi> and <hi>you shall find rest to your souls.</hi> Follow your pride and passion thus with observation and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62321:23"/>
detestation every day, and this will weary it out at last.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>For your tongues.</hi> Ask these questions.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Have I bridled my tongue, and forced it in?</hi> This is a very necessary question that must be enquired into. I tell thee if thou hast no measure to bridle thy tongue, thou art no Christian. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 26. On the other side if thou hast once got this skill to govern thy tongue, thou art a grown Christian, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 2. He that can govern his tongue, hath attained to some good growth and good perfection in grace. Ah Brethren, you had need to set up <hi>Davids</hi> resolution daily, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 1. <hi>I said I will take heed to my ways, that I offend not with my tongue, Psal.</hi> 17. 3. <hi>I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.</hi> And distrusting his own strength you may see how he runs to God for strength, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 1. 3. <hi>Set a watch (O Lord) before my mouth: keep the door of my lips.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Have I spoke evil of no man?</hi> This is an express charge of the <hi>Apostle, Tit.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>Put them in mind to speak evil of no man.</hi> And the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> chargeth us that if we will grow in grace, to put away the evil of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil speaking. This is a great and universal sin among us; that we are apt to speak evil of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. When we do hear of any thing that is evil in any one, how do we speak of it to our friends? See that you have good ends &amp; a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful call to tell, before you tell of anothers evil. Brethren, this cannot be sussiciently bewailed, that there should be so great an evil among us,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62321:23"/>
that we should be so backward to speak of our brothers evil to himself, and so prone to publish it to those that we should not.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Hath the law of God been in my mouth, as I sate in my house, went by the way, lying down, rising up?</hi> How great is the charge of God given us! And how great is our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in this work! <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> teach them diligently unto thy Children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou lyest down, and when thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> up.</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an can thy heart acquit thee here now? Can thy family acquit thee; that this is thy work when thou art sitting by the fire with them? Can thy yoke-fellow witness for thee, that the word of God is in thy mouth when thou lyest down, and risest up? Can thy fellow-traveller say that these are thy talks when tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> walkest? <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 8. What benefit would this be to others, if thou didst but do this? When wilt thou come to the full resolution of them? Well, set this resolution with thy self, that thou wilt not let thy Conscience alone till thou dost come to this.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Have I come into no Company but I have dropped something of God there, and left some good savor behind?</hi> O what a shame is it that Christians should be so unlike themselves! that when they come into company, it cannot be seen who is the Christian, and who is not! O how should we be ashamed of this, that we should be ashamed of our God! O That thou wouldst make conscience of this, not to come
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62321:24"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nto any company, but to drop something of God there.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>For your Tables.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>Did not I sit down with no higher end than a beast, meerly to please my appetite?</hi> Did I eat, and drink for the glory of God? you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know what it is to be a Christian, till you come to do all things by Rule. Make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of this, to set your ends right when you sit down to your Tables.</p>
            <p>Is it not a shame, that a Christian, should sit down with no higher end than a beast to his meat? Beasts do eat and drink to satisfie their hunger. Remember that thou sit down with an eye upon God. This will make thy table to be sanctified to thee.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Did I not rise from my table with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dropping something of God there?</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, how often dost thou contradict the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thy <hi>Savior?</hi> You shall find his discourse when he sate at the table still that he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways speaking of God. And is it not a shame that thou should st imitate thy Saviour no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Was not my appetite too hard for me?</hi> Brethren, I doubt many of us are little skilled in the duty of <hi>temperance.</hi> It may be many of us do think, we may eat as long as it is pleasing to our appetites. This is a great, though I fear a common evil: that as <hi>Juae</hi> says they <hi>feast without fear.</hi> Here, observe this general rule, never to sit down to your tables but to use some <hi>Self-denia.</hi> And for an exact rule; we cannot give an exact rule to every
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62321:24"/>
one; but this, for healthy bodies to eat so at one meal, that we may be hungry at the next I am verily afraid that this sin of <hi>gluttony</hi> is a very common sin: Therefore Christian set a special watch upon thy appetite.</p>
            <p>There are two sorts of <hi>intemperance</hi> that we should beware of; either with respect to the <hi>Quantity,</hi> or to the <hi>Quallity</hi> of what we eat. We offend in the <hi>first</hi> when we eat more than we can digest. In the other, when a man gives himself to eat that which the <hi>Physitian</hi> tels him is not fit for him. And what a shame is this that neither reason nor grace, should keep a person from breaking out into intemperance.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Did I not mock with God when I pretended to crave a blessing and return thanks?</hi> If I may judge by my own experience, I think that we are more formal in this than in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. Well let this be amended by us, It is a sad thing that we should <hi>mock God</hi> when we pretend to serve him.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>For your callings.</hi> Four questions here.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Have I been diligent in the duties of my Calling?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Have I defrauded no man?</hi> Have I observed that golden rule of justice in my dealings this day, that I have done no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to any man than I would be done unto? When I have considered it, I find that there is more of Christianity in our <hi>moral duties</hi> than we are aware of. This is not to be a Christian, to be so onely in prayer, and hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to be a Christian in your Shops, and fields, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62321:25"/>
If thou art no <hi>second table-man</hi> thou art no <hi>Christian.</hi> Remember that, this is to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to Religion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Have I dropped never a lye in my shop or trade?</hi> You that have dealings in the world you had need to look to this every hour. I beseech you Christians look to this: this is a fearful sin, and it is a sign that there is nothing of Christianity in thee if this prevail. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore set a guard upon thy mouth; and beg of God to keep thy mouth, that there may no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth come from it. And in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examine how thou hast kept thy charge in this respect.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Did not I rashly make or safly break some promise?</hi> There is a great and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil in this respect among those that trade in the world. Be very <hi>wary</hi> and very sparing in making a promise; and when thou hast made it, be sure to perform it. I wonder how you can read that Scripture, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. Of those that shall enter into the holy hill of the Lord, <hi>That he sweareth to his own hurt and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have given you <hi>materials</hi> for the examining of your own hearts. Now my fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther business to you is to know how you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to perform this? will you not content your selves with the approving of these rules only? But will you set it forth in practise? I beseech you do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e resolution and intention, but resolve that never a day shall pass before these things be done by you.</p>
            <p>To stir you up hereunto let me give you these three motives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62321:25"/>First, Consider, that there will be no such <hi>means</hi> in the world for you to get <hi>a sound and thorow conquest over your corruptions.</hi> You have been striving a great while with your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: some with vain thoughts, some with pride, som with passion, and it may be you have got but little victory: And what is the reason? Because you have not followed it with constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. If thou didst but take thy heart to task eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day about it thou wouldst surely get the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory over it. As a <hi>holy man</hi> much experienced in this did use that comparison: Thou must watch thy corruptions (says <hi>he</hi>) as a cat doth her prey; either it must keep in, or else she hath it. If thou didst thus, thou wouldst quickly find the theif, &amp; so wouldst bring it to the bar before hand, &amp; have execution done upon it. We must be daily in the pursuit of our corruptions, we must never give it over, not in one prayer or one day, and then we are like to get the victory over it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Consider this is a ready way to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,</hi> Brethren, the great reason why Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are without assurance, is for want of self-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination: for want of pain and diligence in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving their own heart. But now if you set upon this duty you will be skil'd in your own hearts. I doubt this work of self-examination is seldom done by many Christians, except it be upon some <hi>special</hi> occasion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Consider hereby <hi>you shall come to a thorow acquaintance with your own hearts,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Prove your selves,</hi> and then follows, <hi>know you your selves?</hi> he that proves himself oft, shall know himself at length.</p>

foregoing <hi>Chapter</hi> with this vehement exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the words of my Text. Set your hearts <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By [<hi>All these words</hi>] we are to understand not onely the mercies and judgments spoken of in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> but the precepts laid down in the foregoing <hi>Chapter,</hi> and therefore he addes in the next words after my text, [<hi>which you shall command your Children to observe to do, all the words of this law,</hi>] I shall not stand any longer upon the words but presently give you this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That when God hath-discovered any duty to his people, he looks that they should set their hearts to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the prosecution of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> I shall speak to these <hi>three things.</hi> (First) shew you <hi>what it is to set your heart to any duty,</hi> and shall speak particularly to that duty that God hath lately laid open to us, from those words. <hi>Commune with your own hearts.</hi> (Secondly,) I shall propound some <hi>motives</hi> to stir up those to it that have not yet begun, &amp; to stir up those that <hi>have begun</hi> to go on in it. (Thirdly,) I shall prescribe some <hi>directions</hi> for the conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, constant, easie performance of the duty.</p>
            <p>First, What 'tis to <hi>set the heart to any duty.</hi> This carries in it. First, <hi>Remembrance.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Serious consideration.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Resolution.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Love.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>Life.</hi> Sixthly, <hi>Labor.</hi> Seventhly, <hi>Care.</hi> Eightly, <hi>Constancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>Remembrance,</hi> or a minding of our duty. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Give the more earnest heed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62321:29"/>
to the things that you have heard, lest at any time you let them slip.</hi> The memory of man is a leaking vessel, apt to let out as fast as God poures in. It is like a grate in the water-course; still the trash doth stick by us; but the pure water, the things of God and of another world are soon out and gone. Beloved, it is very strange, and yet very true, those things that we are most affected with, which are most fresh in our minds, that our thoughts do most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally run upon, in a few weeks or months, the savor of them dye, and the things are buried in oblivion: and perhaps scarce ever come to mind again. Concerning this excellent course that we have been directed to, I pray God that I may never live to see it dead and buried: and thus I pray for you all. I confess, I am afraid of myself, lest time should wearout the sence or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of so great a duty: but the Lord be better to me than my fears, and to all others whose fear this is. Neither is it implyed only that we should never forget this duty, or think upon it only nowand then, but that our thoughts should run upon it. That which a man sets his heart upon, he will often mind. The voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man sets his heart upon his pleasure, and therefore will mind his pleasure. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man sets his heart upon his riches, and therefore minds his riches. Their thoughts are so taken up with those things that they scarce think upon any thing else. So it should be with us. When we are sitting at our tables, lying down, rising up, alone, in company, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any duty, inour shops, about our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62321:30"/>
we should remember this course. We should be as well able to <hi>forget to eat</hi> as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the <hi>rule by which we should eat.</hi> VVe should be as well able to forget to <hi>sleep</hi> and <hi>speak,</hi> and follow our callings, as to forget the <hi>rule</hi> by which we should do it. I shall shut up this particular with the prayer of <hi>David,</hi> so full to this purpose, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 18. <hi>O Lord God of</hi> Abraham, Isaac, <hi>and Israel our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagnations of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Serious Consideration,</hi> or a pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the duty in our heart; as the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in <hi>Luke is,</hi> chap. 2. 19. Now there are these three things that we are to consider when God doth discover any duty to us. (First,) <hi>What have I done?</hi> Hath not this command of God been neglected by me? Have not I been a meer stranger to the duty now laid open? or, is not this the duty, that the minister and my conscience hath pressed upon me from time to time, and yet I have neglected it. (Secondly,) <hi>What must I do?</hi> Is not this the command of God? And dare I do otherwise than obey it! Is it not the God of heaven that speaks unto me? examine thy self; commune with thy own heart. Is this God to be slighted? His autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be despised? darest thou, O my Soul, to say the God of heaven nay! (Thirdly,) <hi>What shall I do?</hi> VVhat will become of me in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e day of visitation, and in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nt, if I daily neglect this known duty, this weighty duty, this necessary duty? VVhen
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62321:30"/>
trobles shall come slowing in upon me like the waves of the Sea, one upon the neck of another how shall I be able to stand under them? If I think to go to God for refuge, Conscience will fly in my face, and tell me this is the God, that thou hast despised, whose voyce thou hast not hearkned to. How shall I stand in the day of judgement. and look God in the face, if I am <hi>contentious and will not obey the truth?</hi> What can I expectbut <hi>tribulation, and anguish, and wrath, Rom.</hi> 2. 8, 9. A Scripture which me thinks may be as a thunder-bolt in the hearts of any that hath a secret purpose in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to neglect this duty. If we are careless in this duty, what can we expect but tribulation, and anguish, and wrath?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Resolution,</hi> A setled, fixed pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of heart to do what God commands. When God tells us this is my command, thus and thus you must do; our hearts should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the will of God we will obey: thus and thus we will do. Thus did <hi>David, The Lord said seek my face;</hi> and <hi>my heart answered, thy face Lordwill I seek.</hi> Beloved, we hear our duties, and read our duties many a time; and we are apt to acknowledge that this should be done, and to pray too, that it might be done; but for want of adding of resolution, many a time our convictions and prayers come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Concerning this duty let us not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute but determine: let us not stand reasoning shall I, shall I, but resolve upon it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Love to the duty,</hi> Christians should not only receive the truths of God, but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62321:31"/>
receive them <hi>in love.</hi> The commands of God, like meat that pleaseth the pallat, must go down sweetly, duties must not be so much our <hi>task</hi> as our <hi>choyce:</hi> that which we would rather do than neglect, were we left to our liberty. Beloved, let us not only take up this course as <hi>necessary</hi> onely, but let <hi>us</hi> love it <hi>as</hi> an <hi>excellent</hi> course. Let <hi>us</hi> not go to this work <hi>as</hi> a sick man goes to take down a loathsome potion, but <hi>as</hi> a sound healthy man goes to his ordinary meal.</p>
            <p>Fisthly, <hi>Life,</hi> That which a man sets his heart upon he will be <hi>lively</hi> in, and do it to purpose. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>Not slothful in busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but fervent in spirit serving the Lord.</hi> Standing water is not wholsome; and wine that hath lost its spirit, is not pleasant. <hi>God is a spirit, and they that worship him; must wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him in spirit.</hi> He is a most <hi>pure act:</hi> and he will be served with <hi>activity.</hi> God would not accept a blind, torn, lame sacrifice under the law; and will he accept of a <hi>dead</hi> sacrifice under the Gospel? He would not have, the <hi>Asse</hi> offered to him, because it was a dull <hi>slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish</hi> creature. Nor the <hi>Snail,</hi> because a slow <hi>lingring</hi> creature. We must not come to duties with dead hearts: with dull, drowsie, sleepy souls. When we are going to our work of communing with our hearts, we should stir up our hearts, call in our thoughts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our affections, rub our memories and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, till we have fetched life into them. Every faculty of the soul should act its part in this work: And here let me tell you that 'tis
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62321:31"/>
no fit time to set about this work, when we are between sleeping and waking: when the spirits are so far spent, and the senses tired, that we can scare, see the question, or to hear the answer that conscience gives. It will be good for every one to observe the temper of his body for this work, that so drowsiness may not detain him from it, or make him slight and over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ly in it.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Labor,</hi> we must take pains in duty, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>What soever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might.</hi> There must be labor <hi>before</hi> the duty, to break thorough difficulties and to bring the heart to it. There must be labor <hi>in</hi> the duty to keep the heart close to it. The heart will be unwilling to come to it, and therefore must be compelled. It is apt to wander, and therefore must be restrained and held in. We must not onely do well, but be <hi>patient in wel-doing.</hi> The flesh must be cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: carnal ease and contentment must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, when they stand in the way of our duty, or would steal away the heart from God. God required that the <hi>Male</hi> should be offered up to him in sacrifice, because that was <hi>stronger</hi> than the other: to signifie to us that we must take pains and lay out our <hi>strength</hi> in duty. Belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wheresoever you are when you should se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> about this work, say to your souls as <hi>Christ</hi> to the disciples, <hi>Arise, let us go hence.</hi> If the heart be backward, lay the cord of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand upon it; and by this cord hale it to the duty. Tell it, that the work must be done and shall be done. When thou art come to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62321:32"/>
the work, bind thy heart to the good behavior. When thou art in it, often call upon thy heart to mind the work that it is about. When it would give thee the slip, hold it fast. When it would run from any question before it hath given any determination to it, pull it back: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure it before the living God, in whose presence thou art, and whose honor is concerned in it, to speak out the truth concerning this matter: whether thou art guilty or not guilty.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>Care,</hi> That duty is well done, that is carefully done.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, <hi>Constancy,</hi> That which a mans heart is set upon, he will be hardly taken off from it. We must be <hi>constant</hi> in duties as well as <hi>fervent</hi> in them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 3. Beloved, the work that I am now pressing you to, is not to be done once a week, or a month, or every other day; but every day. Every evening, conscience being mounted upon its tribunal, you are to give accompt of all the things that have passed that day. And remember this, that you never take any excuse for the omitting of this duty, at any time, but what you dare plead before God in the great day of accompt. It is to be performed every day: as sure as the night follows the day. Neither is this the work of a week, or a month, or a year, or of an evil time onely, while the rod of God <hi>is</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your backs; no, it <hi>is</hi> the work of your life: it <hi>is</hi> a duty that you must live and dye in.</p>
            <p>We should not take up this course, <hi>as</hi> the traveller takes up his cloak, which he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62321:32"/>
wears in a storm, but throws off when the Sun shines. This <hi>is</hi> a duty <hi>as</hi> well in prosperity, <hi>as</hi> in adversity. It <hi>is</hi> Summer-fruit <hi>as</hi> well <hi>as</hi> winter-fruit. And I pray God, that neither summers heat, may be able to blast, nor win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cold be able to kill those good beginnings os reformation, that are now, to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>us.</hi> I am afraid, that when God hath broken off one yoak from our necks, we shall cast away another. When God shall break off the cords of the <hi>wicked</hi> from <hi>us,</hi> we shall cast away the cord of <hi>duty</hi> from <hi>us.</hi> I pray God, that when we come into <hi>Canaan,</hi> we may not forget nor cast osf what we promised in the wilderness. Remember it <hi>is</hi> for your life. I shall press this upon you in the words of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 58. <hi>Therefore my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abounding in the work of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection.</hi> It is a hard work, a painful du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; a heavy yoak. Now there are several things that I shall speak, to <hi>answer</hi> this very briefly.</p>
            <p>First, This complaint doth argue a very careless, loose heart. Ah Christian, didst thou keep a strict hand over thy self in the day, thou wouldst not find thy evening work so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult. And hast thou a careless spirit? the more need there <hi>is</hi> that thou shouldst set upon this work, that thou mightest bring it into a better government.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Wouldst thou neglect this duty because it <hi>is</hi> painful? upon the same account thou mayst cast of other duties. Thou can't
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62321:33"/>
not pray, nor hear, <hi>as</hi> thou shouldest without pain.</p>
            <p>Give way to this objection, and for ought I know, in a little time, thou mayst bid farwel to all thy Religion: thou mayst cast off every duty. Thou canst not imagine what a plague it may be to thee, if thou shouldest give way to this objection. Give Satan an inch and he will take an ell: forbear one duty because of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and he will easily perswade men to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Consider who it is that buzzes this in thine ear. Certainly it <hi>is</hi> the devil, the grand enemy of thy soul. God says, <hi>Commune with thy own heart:</hi> Satan says, no, it is too pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. VVhy, who wilt thou be ruled by, God or Satan? thy best friend, or thy worst ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? Christian, in these outward concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thou wilt not advise with thy mortal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy in things that concern thy life: And why wilt thou be such a fool in the matters of thy soul?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, What dost thou cry out of pain? It is thy very calling and profession to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ke pain. What mean those expressions in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture else whereby the life of a Christian is set forth by <hi>striving, wrestling, fighting, pressing</hi> toward the mark? To take pain is essential to Christianity, and without this thou canst not be a Christian. To leave any duty because it is painful is a contradiction to thy profession thou dost herein deny thy self to be a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ifthly, The more difficult the work is, the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62321:33"/>
more profitable thou wilt find it. That duty that cost's us nothing, will yeild us nothing: and that duty that cost's <hi>us</hi> much pain, will yeild <hi>us</hi> much peace and comfort.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Consider, <hi>is</hi> not grace worth the taking pains for? What wilt thou take pain for, if not for grace? Look about in the world: see how the men of the world run and ride, sweat and tire themselves for toyes and trisles. What pains then shouldst thou take for grace, one dram of which is more worth than a world. By this means, thou mayst grow in grace more in one moneth than in some years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>And let me tell thee I have not Charity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to think thee a Christian indeed, if thou dost not think grace worth any labor or pain that thou canst possible be at in the getting of it.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Consider Christian, what pain Christ did take, and what misery he did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go for thee. Thy soul was dearer to him than his own glory: and thy salvation, than his own life and blood. And shall not his glory, his commands be dearer to thee, Christian, than a little carnal ease? Think upon it, if thou hast any spark of ingenuity this consideration will prevail upon thee to set about this work.</p>
            <p>I come now to propound some <hi>motives</hi> to stir up those that have not begun this work, to set about it. And those that have begun, to go on in this work.</p>
            <p>First, Consider <hi>it is the command of God.</hi> It is not the voyce of man, but of God. It
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62321:34"/>
is God that speaks to thee, <hi>Commune with thy own hearts: Examine thy self.</hi> Christian, I urge the command of God upon thy Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wilt thou obey or w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lt thou not? darest thou to set thy self against God! and set thy will above the will of God! O think upon it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Consider the <hi>time when,</hi> and the <hi>manner how</hi> you consented to set to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this duty. It was in a <hi>time of love;</hi> at a <hi>feast of love;</hi> and after a <hi>Song of love.</hi> Consider what a rich mercy God hath bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon you, in giving you liberty to draw nigh to him in such an ordinance <hi>as</hi> you lately sate under. It was but a little while ago, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that you thought that you should drink <hi>no more of the fruit of the vine, till you drank it in your fathers kingdome.</hi> And behold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your expectations, the King hath sent to you, saying, <hi>come and sup with me:</hi> come and sit at my table.</p>
            <p>Hath God dealt so with any people? He hath feasted you in a time of famine: and spread a table for you in a <hi>howling wild<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rness.</hi> Doth not this extraordinary providence think you, call upon you for some extraordinary duty? And do not you think in your consciences that it is this duty? Why else hath God propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to you, and urged it upon you, in such a time as this is? If you neglect it, it may cause God to take away the <hi>Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> and wine</hi> from you; and to <hi>break the stasf of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, What do you know but God put it into the heart of his servant, to press this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62321:34"/>
at that time, to <hi>try whether you were real in that love and loyalty</hi> which you did then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess to him? I suppose you all understand the transactions that passed there between God and you: that God did put his seal to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that he would make good all the mercy promised: and that you did put your seal, thereby binding your selves to the performance of all the duties required.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Consider when <hi>another such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity</hi> is offered to you how will you be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>to look God in the face?</hi> Methinks that man should not dare to come to the Sacrament, and again put his seal to the Covenant, that hath knowingly and willingly broken his last engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Doth not your own looseness, and the <hi>enemies profaneness,</hi> and the <hi>present dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> that you are under, call upon you for more than ordinary <hi>strictness</hi> in your lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations? The Lord have mercy upon us, what prejudice have we brought to the Gospel by our carnal, careless conversations! VVhat pitch of profaneness are the enemies of God risen to! They are not afraid to bid him defiance at his face! In what a doleful case are many of our brethren abroad in the world, and how sad is it like to be with us? The glory of God is gone from the publick to your houses, and are you not afraid? I am sure there is reason enough to think, that it will take its flight from thence too. And doth not all this call upon us aloud in the language of the prophet, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 40. <hi>Let us search and try our ways and turn unto the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62321:35"/>
Lord.</hi> If we look behind us, and see what we have been: If about us, and see how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish men are: And above us, to see the black clouds that hang over our heads; we cannot but see that it is time to take another course, to live more like Christians, And what course so likely to effect this, as daily self-examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? serious consideration is the best way to sound and thorough reformation.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Consider the <hi>excellent advantages</hi> that will come to thee by taking this course. Christian, wouldst thou have peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? The sence of Gods love shed abroad up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy heart! wouldst thou live in heaven? wouldst thou walk in the light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, grow in grace, have thy corruptions overcome and subdued? Behold a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent receipt: the best that ever was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Consider with what face wilt thou be <hi>able to go to God</hi> and beg of him to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due thy corruptions, and to strengthen thy graces when thou wilt not use the means? Think upon it with what face wilt thou be able to look up to God and put up such a petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
            <p>Eighthly, How wilt thou be able to excuse thy self <hi>from hypocrisie,</hi> if thou neglect this duty? When thou dost hear it laid down as a Character of sincerity, not to live in the neglect of any known duty.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Consider what base <hi>ingratitude</hi> you will be guilty of, both to God in sending <hi>his servant</hi> among you: and to his servant
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62321:35"/>
for all the care and pains that he hath taken for your souls?</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Consider what <hi>answer</hi> will you be <hi>able to make to God,</hi> or how you will be able to look his servant in the face another day; when he and you must stand together and give up your accompt: he of his <hi>doctrine,</hi> and you of your <hi>obedience</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, Consider how <hi>conscience will sting</hi> thee for this neglect when thou comest to dye. Ah Christian, when thou shalt be ready to leap into eternity, and shalt want assurance, not knowing whether thy lot shall fall either in heaven or hell. And conscience shall tell thee if thou hadst taken such a course thou mightest have had assurance: when thou shalt with grief of soul remember this and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miscarriage, and that if thou hadst taken this course, thou mightest have prevented this trouble; O how will this adde to thy sorrow and break thy heart!</p>
            <p>I come now to give some <hi>directions</hi> for the constant, conscionable, easie performance of this duty</p>
            <p>First. <hi>Set about this course speedily.</hi> The longer thou dost delay the work, the more difficult thou wilt find it. VVhat is said of repentance is true here, he that is not fit to day will be less fit to morrow.</p>
            <p>Secondly. Be <hi>deeply humbled</hi> that thou hast <hi>neglected</hi> such a duty so long. Hath it been out of <hi>ignorance?</hi> bewail thy ignorance. Hath it been out of <hi>laziness?</hi> bewail that when men would make the building strong, they will lay
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62321:36"/>
the foundation low. It is a good way to be constant and successful in any duty, to begin with sorrow and humiliation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Do it out of <hi>a principle of conscience</hi> in obedience to Gods command: because it is thy duty, and God commands it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. <hi>Bless God for making known this duty,</hi> and prescribing to thee so easie away for the performing of it. Bless God for making known the duty, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d God will bless thee in the doing of it.</p>
            <p>Fisthly. VVhen you come together let this duty be <hi>the matter of your conference;</hi> or at least, be osten speaking one to another of it. Doubtless, it will be good for the carrying on of this work to choose out a Christian friend, and for these to agree together, and unbosome themselves each to other, what doth hinder the work; and what benefit they find <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and engage one another to take up this course, and be constant in it whatsoever times may come.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Take heed of formality,</hi> or keeping on a round in the duty without a due regard of the end of the duty. Take some time once in a week, or fortnight, and call thy heart to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt how thou hast sped, what thou hast got.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>Take heed of resting in the duty.</hi> If thou do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> make an <hi>Idol</hi> of the duty God will make nothing of it: God will curse the work and blast thy design.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Be careful to <hi>live up to those Rules</hi> by which thou hast engaged to <hi>examine thy
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62321:36"/>
self?</hi> As <hi>he</hi> said of prayer, If thy praying do not make thee leave off sinning, thy sinning will make thee leave off praying. So here, if thy examining thy self, do not make thee to leave off thy remissness; thy remissnesse will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make thee leave off thy self-examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. VVhen a man hath been careless in the day, and come to read over these questions, and conscience shall answer guilty in most of these things, this will make the work so tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that thou wilt never long bear the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it. Unless thou art able to live up to these rules, thou wilt never be able to hold on in it long. And therefore remember this, if at any time you find that you have been carelesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n the day foregoing, be sure in the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to set up a <hi>new resolution</hi> to stick close to these rules. Undo all that you have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as it were, and begin again. Try in the strength of God what you can do this day; how exact you can be this day.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Let us set about the work <hi>with some shore ejaculation to God</hi> for his <hi>Assistance</hi> in it, and his <hi>blessing</hi> upon it.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, <hi>Solemnly engage to God</hi> that you will <hi>take up this course</hi> and <hi>be constant</hi> in it, and never lay it down what ever times may come, and temptations may assault you. When God doth enjoyn any duty, he requires all the means that tend to the performing of that duty. Now this is the best means that can be thought upon for every one to engage to God, that he will set upon it and be constant in it. I know that the deceitful heart will be very backward,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62321:37"/>
they are very shy of such engagements. But if they are, remember this, that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the bottom which you will do well to look out: And when you have found it out, to cast it forth with indignation. VVhy should we be backward to do that between God and our selvs, which we have done publickly before many witnesses, and I believe shall be called to do again. To set about this work is no more than you have done already, when you sate under that great ordinance and set your seals that you would perform all the duties of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And did you except this? You will find this engagement a great help to the work. Let us this night before we sleep put this direction in practice; engage your selves to God in some such words as these,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O eternal God, thou that searchest the heart, and wilt not hold them guiltless that take thy name in vain, especially in solemn Covenants made with thy self, I do here solemnly promise, that I will set upon this duty of daily self-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and in this practise to live and dye.</hi> Such engagements God is well pleased with, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 30. 21, <hi>Who is this that engageth his heart to draw nigh to me?</hi> As if the Lord had said, come thou art welcome, I take this kindly from thee.</p>

               <q>And he that winneth Souls is wise.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this verse we have set forth unto us the excellency of a <hi>Righteous</hi> man: and that in <hi>two</hi> things. First, <hi>He</hi> is more <hi>useful</hi> than others. Secondly, <hi>He</hi> is more <hi>skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> than others.</p>
            <p>First. He is more <hi>useful</hi> than others. <hi>The fruit of the Righteous is a tree of life.</hi> The Righteous is not a <hi>barren tree;</hi> but he is a <hi>fruitful bough,</hi> as <hi>Joseph</hi> was. And he doth not bring forth his fruit <hi>unto himself.</hi> His fruit is <hi>a tree of life.</hi> As the tree of life would give life to them that should eat thereof: so the fruit of the Righteous is such, that those

th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t will hearken to his Counsel, shall partake with him of eternal life. When others are as <hi>thorns</hi> and <hi>brambles,</hi> fruitless, unuseful, of no value in Gods world? the Righteous is a fruitful tree, and as <hi>a tree of life</hi> in the midst of the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is more <hi>skilful</hi> and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>wise</hi> than others; And would you know wherin his <hi>wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> lyes? It is in winning of Souls.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That it is a chief part of a Believers, duty, and the chief point of a Believers wisdom to gain Souls unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, 'Tis the [duty] of a Believer to gain Souls. Though he must <hi>begin</hi> at home, with his own soul, yet he must not <hi>Terminate</hi> there; but he must look abroad after <hi>others</hi> Souls. He must not be as a <hi>tree</hi> that bringeth forth fruit to himself alone: but he must be a tree <hi>of life,</hi> that whosoever plucketh of his fruit, to make use thereof, shall live.</p>
            <p>And then Secondly, 'tis his [<hi>wisedom.</hi>] As in the text, so <hi>Daniel.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.</hi> They be the <hi>wisemen</hi> that turn <hi>others</hi> to Righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>Here I shall shew you. (First,) <hi>That 'tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> chief part of his duty.</hi> (Secondly,) <hi>That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a chief point of his wisedome to gain Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firstly, <hi>That 'tis a chief part of his duty</hi> and this appears,</p>
            <p>First, Because this is one chief point of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> love to Jesus Christ.</hi> Wherein did <hi>Paul</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his love to Jesus Christ in any thing, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:62321:38"/>
this, in his <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>industry</hi> to save Souls? <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1, 2, 3. And thus doth <hi>Moses</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence his love. <hi>Exo.</hi> 32. 31, 32. If you would shew your Love to Jesus Christ, this is the best way in all the world to evidence it. <hi>Math.</hi> 25. You may see how carefully <hi>Christ</hi> takes notice of any kindness done to the <hi>bodies</hi> of his elect: but O how much more will he take notice of the love to the <hi>Souls</hi> of his Elect?</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) Because this is the chief point of our <hi>love to our Brethren.</hi> You know that <hi>Christ</hi> tels us that all the Law and the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> hang upon this, <hi>thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thy Neighbor as thy self.</hi> If the <hi>Law</hi> doth bind thee to preserve the <hi>Chastity</hi> and <hi>estate</hi> of thy Neighbor, how much more doth God require of thee that thou preserve the <hi>Soul</hi> of thy Neighbour? This is the principal point of love. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>He that converteth a sinner from the error of his wayes shall save a Soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins,</hi> If God requires that thou help thy Neighbours Ox and his <hi>Ass,</hi> how much more must thou help thy Neighbors <hi>Soul</hi> from hell?</p>
            <p>(Thirdly,) Because this is the principal means <hi>of bringing glory to Christ.</hi> Every soul that is brought in to <hi>Christ</hi> is a <hi>Jewel</hi> put into the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> And wouldest thou not be ambitious of such a service as this? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very soul thou bringest into <hi>Christ</hi> is an eternal <hi>Monument,</hi> set up by thee to the <hi>name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> Wouldest thou have much service done for Jesus Christ? O then labor to bring
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62321:39"/>
in <hi>Souls</hi> to him, that may do his work here in the world. Wouldest thou have much <hi>praise</hi> to the name of <hi>Christ?</hi> O then labor to bring in <hi>Souls</hi> to Jesus Christ. Every Soul brought in to Jesus Christ is a Trumpet of his praise. The glory of a King is in the <hi>multitude</hi> of his subjects. And so 'tis of Christ. This is the great way wherein we are capable to further the <hi>glory of Christ</hi> in the world, to bring in many Souls to Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>(Fourthly,) Because this is a principal <hi>subject of our prayers.</hi> This is one grand petition. <hi>Thy Kingdome come.</hi> In which <hi>petition</hi> we pray, that the Kingdom of grace may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, our selves and others brought into it, and kept in it. Now 'tis a great part of a Christians business to live sutable to his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That 'tis the chief point of a Christians wisdome to gain Souls unto Christ. This appears,</p>
            <p>(First,) Because <hi>Souls</hi> are the goodly pearls that <hi>are of great price</hi> with Christ. O there is no <hi>Merchandise</hi> like to that of <hi>Souls.</hi> No gain like to the gain of Souls. One Soul is of more worth than all the world. You may see of how great price <hi>Souls</hi> are with Jesus Christ, by the great price that he laid down for <hi>Souls.</hi> Did Christ spend, his <hi>blood</hi> for <hi>Souls;</hi> and wilt thou not spend thy <hi>breath</hi> for <hi>Souls?</hi> This is a principal part of wisdome, to deal like <hi>wise Merchants,</hi> in goodly pearls. A wise man will not spend his time for trifles, that is Childish; but his wisdome doth appear in the weight of those
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62321:39"/>
things that he layes out his time and pains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Oh if you would appear to be wise, lay out your time and strength for <hi>Souls!</hi> If thou couldest gain but one <hi>Soul,</hi> what a happy gain would that be?</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) Because <hi>Souls will be the most glorious Crown in the day of Christ.</hi> No Crown like to this, the Crown of <hi>Souls.</hi> The time is coming, when a <hi>Crown of Soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> will be found to be of another manner of value than a <hi>Crown of gold.</hi> What was the Crown that <hi>Paul</hi> wishes for? It was for the Souls that he had converted. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>What is our hope,</hi> or <hi>joy,</hi> or <hi>Crown of rejoycing! are not even ye in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</hi> Why were these <hi>Pauls</hi> Crown? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had <hi>converted</hi> them by his <hi>Ministry,</hi> upon the same account he cals the <hi>Phillipians</hi> (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 1.) <hi>My joy and Crown of rejoycing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. Because we shall most effectually <hi>promote the good of our own Souls by endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to gain others Souls.</hi> By teaching of <hi>others</hi> thou shalt teach <hi>thy self.</hi> By exhorting <hi>others,</hi> thou shalt excite and stir up <hi>thy self.</hi> And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will redound to thy advantage so much as thy laboring to gain <hi>Souls;</hi> though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I bé glorified.</p>
            <p>(Fourthly,) Because this will be <hi>an evidence of our own sound conversion,</hi> if we lay out our strength and time to convert others. In <hi>John</hi> 1. 41. We shall see those <hi>young converts,</hi> when they were but touched, they labor to bring in <hi>others</hi> presently. So that if thou wouldest evidence thine own sincerity to thy
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62321:40"/>
               <hi>Soul,</hi> thou shouldest lay out thy endeavor for the good of others <hi>Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First <hi>Use,</hi> Is it so that 'tis a chief part of a Christians duty, anda chief point of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>Wisedom,</hi> to gain <hi>Souls</hi> to Christ? Then here is matter of <hi>Reproof;</hi> to reprove those that profess the name of Christ; that lay out their zeal no more this way. That lay not out their strength to gain <hi>Souls.</hi> Yea that do not long for, nor endeavor after the conversion of <hi>Souls.</hi> Surely, this speaks sadly to those that <hi>wholy neglect</hi> this duty. But how exceedingly are many of the <hi>people of God</hi> themselves to be blamed for their Negligence in this? doth not thy heart know that there is a brother of thine doth live in such a sin; and yet thou never tel him of it? What a great evil is this! and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutable to the pattern of the Lord Jesus Christ? How did he go up and down <hi>doing good?</hi> and so taken up with <hi>Souls,</hi> that he could scarce spare time to <hi>eat his bread:</hi> insomuch that his carnal friends began to take hold of him, and thought that he had been <hi>beside himself.</hi> O how far art thou from this, that thy friends may <hi>live</hi> in their sins, and dye in their sins, before thou wilt labor to save their <hi>Souls?</hi> The devil he laboreth to destroy <hi>Souls;</hi> and how few be there that do labor to save <hi>Souls?</hi> He may carry away the poor soul, and none labours to take the soul from him. We should be watchful and vigilant for <hi>souls;</hi> for our own <hi>souls.</hi> and others <hi>souls:</hi> because this enemy is always taking opportunities to destroy <hi>souls.</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:62321:40"/>
Sure it argues that you have very little <hi>Lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that you do no more for <hi>souls.</hi> That you have little <hi>zeal</hi> for Jesus Christ, and that you have little <hi>Love</hi> for your <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> that you take no more care for their <hi>souls.</hi> It may be you are careful for the <hi>bodies</hi> of those that are under your charge; but how little do you for their <hi>souls?</hi> How many live without the <hi>worshi of God</hi> in their Families? Without <hi>Catechizing</hi> their Children or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing them? And think they have done well if they provide for their <hi>bodies.</hi> Oh, but man God will find out thy neglects: it was their <hi>souls</hi> that was thy charge also. If you look onely after their bodies, this you will do for your swine. And will you do no more for your <hi>Childrens souls</hi> than for your <hi>swine?</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are ready to say as <hi>Cain,</hi> am <hi>I my Brothers keeper?</hi> If this be not the language of thy <hi>tongue,</hi> is not this the language of thy Life? What dost thou do for thy brother to save his soul from death?</p>
            <p>Second <hi>Use,</hi> is of <hi>exhortation.</hi> To stir you up to perform this <hi>duty</hi> to labor to be <hi>skilful</hi> in this duty, to win <hi>souls</hi> to <hi>Christ.</hi> Brethren, if you would be wise indeed, and if you will gain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, labour to gain <hi>souls.</hi> Oh look upon the woful condition of perishing souls! How few of thy friends and acquaintance hast thou good grou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ds to think they have a share in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ? What wilt thou have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of thy Brothers soul? Thou wouldst have compassion on the body of thy
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62321:41"/>
Neighbor: If thou sawest the house on fire about them, and they asleep, wouldest thou not be stirred up, and with zeal forget thy self, and labor to call upon them and awake them? O how many of our carnal friends do remain in a carnal state, and we sit stilland let them alone! I beseech you stir up your <hi>souls</hi> to relieve the <hi>souls</hi> of others. This is the best Charity and best pleasing to Christ.</p>
            <p>It may be many of you have not wherewith to shew your Charity to the bodies of your brethren: but this way thou mayst shew it, in shewing kindnesse to their <hi>souls. Exhort</hi> them, and <hi>strengthen</hi> them in their duty: <hi>comfort</hi> them, <hi>support</hi> them. If thou canst not give them an <hi>alms,</hi> give them an <hi>exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will say what should we do, or what <hi>means</hi> must we make use of to <hi>do good to to souls?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, you must do it.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>By Scripture demonstration.</hi> When thou goest to deal with <hi>souls,</hi> be sure to make use of <hi>Gods weapons.</hi> Bring the <hi>word of God</hi> with thee. Go forth in the <hi>name of God.</hi> Pour out thy supplication to <hi>God</hi> to prosper the work. And then shew thy brother the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to convince him out of the Scripture, as <hi>Apollos</hi> did. Thou canst never throw down the devils strong holds, but by the use of <hi>Gods</hi> own weapons. No Cannon but this will batter down the strong holds of sin and Satan. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bring the Scripture with thee to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>By earnest supplication.</hi> This was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62321:41"/>
               <hi>Pauls</hi> course who did so earnestly <hi>thirst</hi> for the salvation of his brethren. He strove mightily with <hi>God</hi> in <hi>prayer</hi> for them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>My hearts desire and prayer is, that Israel may be saved.</hi> Carry thy friends to <hi>God,</hi> and go to <hi>God</hi> by <hi>prayer,</hi> and weep over their carnal and unsanctified state. Bring thy dead Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and child &amp;c. to <hi>God,</hi> and put up thy Request to <hi>God</hi> for them, as <hi>Abraham did Ishmael. O That they might live before thee!</hi> How did the <hi>prophet</hi> prevail l y his prayers for the restoring the <hi>dead child?</hi> As the <hi>prophet</hi> did pray in life into the <hi>dead child,</hi> so thou shouldest strive with <hi>God</hi> in prayer for <hi>dead souls.</hi> If thou didst but wrestle with <hi>God</hi> for thy dead wife, or child, or neighbor What dost thou know what <hi>God</hi> might do for them? <hi>What knowest thou O man, but thou mayest save thy Wife?</hi> &amp;c. Thus we are taught by <hi>our Lord</hi> in that great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi> Thus if thou strive by the <hi>word of God and prayer,</hi> then thou mayest be like to prevail mightily for the good of souls, thou dost converse with.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>By kind Obligation.</hi> This is another way by which thou shouldest labor to gain souls. Observe that great rule of the <hi>Apostle</hi> be <hi>pittiful,</hi> be <hi>courteous,</hi> tis the <hi>Rule</hi> that he gives. Labor by <hi>kindness</hi> and <hi>courtesie</hi> to gain upon all thou dost converse with, that thou mayst get within him, that thou mayst be in a capacity to do good to his soul. <hi>Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>wing all meekness to all men. And when thou art thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:62321:42"/>
kind to all men, this will be a means to do good to them by what thou dost. If they be such as stand in need of thy <hi>Charity,</hi> open thy <hi>hand</hi> to relieve their necessity, and that will be a way to open their hearts to thee to receive in thy counsel.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>By faithful reprehensions. Lev.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy Neighbor, and not suffer sin to rest upon him.</hi> Observe that 'tis; quite contrary to <hi>Christian Lovo</hi> to suffer sin to lye upon him: for 'tis c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>hating of him.</hi> Oh Brethren, shew your <hi>Love</hi> to the <hi>souls</hi> that you are among by this, by the faithful rebuking of their sins that they fall into. Manifest it not as a token of <hi>your displeasure,</hi> but as an <hi>ordinance of God.</hi> Deal with him in all <hi>gentleness</hi> and <hi>meekness.</hi> Not gentle with their sins; you must be plain and saithful with their <hi>souls.</hi> You must shew them the danger of such a way: but you must do it with such tenderness <hi>to them</hi> as may make this bitter pill to go down. How do many <hi>souls</hi> miscarry to all eternity for want of professors faithful dealing with them? Oh is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that we have the guilt of <hi>our own</hi> sins upon us, but must we needs have the guilt of our <hi>Neighbours</hi> sin upon us too? Ah <hi>Brethren,</hi> this is enough to convince us that we have little <hi>Love</hi> to our Brethrens souls, in that we have so little care to reprove their sins.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:62321:42"/>Fifthly, <hi>By your convincing conversations.</hi> Live before all thou dost converse with, in the <hi>convincing</hi> power of a <hi>holy Life.</hi> This is the way to convince them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>Likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husband, that if any obey not the word, they also may without the word, be won by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations of the wives: while thy behold your chast conversation coupled with fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Observe here. (First,) That even those that be weakest, and seemingly out of a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to win souls, may by their <hi>Godly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations</hi> win <hi>souls.</hi> Women, who more weak than they? Do not you think that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs onely to <hi>Ministers</hi> to win <hi>souls:</hi> this belongs to all.</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) Observe that a careful and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der walking in the duties of our <hi>Relations</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, with a conjunction with the duties of piety towards God, is a most powerful means to convert souls. When wives shall be strict in their profession, and yet not be in subjection to their husbands, this will offend the men, and not work upon them. Your profession and practice must one answer the other: and then you are like to gain others, I beseech you take this course to gain <hi>souls</hi> to Christ, let there be a suteableness in all the parts of your conversation, be the same <hi>at home</hi> that you are abroad: and bring forth your Religion into your Shops, and Trades, and Fields: That whosoever converse with you may see the power of Godliness in you.</p>
            <p>Sixthly. <hi>By your frequent exhortations.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62321:43"/>
Hebrews.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>But exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dayly, while 'tis called to day, lest any be hardned through the deceitfulness of sin.</hi> Observe it, 'tis not the duty of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> onely to abound in <hi>exhortations,</hi> but 'tis the work of you all. Every one must look to his Neighbours Soul: and that dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. There must be <hi>instancy</hi> and <hi>frequency</hi> in this work: and the reason, is, <hi>lest he be hardned.</hi> Dost thou see such a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour fall into sin? go to him. It may be thou wilt do it hereafter: why it may be the man may be hardned. It may be the man may dye: or thou mayest not have the opportunity: or you may be removed from one another; and the work may be for ever cut off, if thou Neglect it.</p>
            <p>Seventhly. <hi>By your careful observation,</hi> of all those advantages that God hath put into your hands for the dealing with your Brothers Soul. Consider and study with thy self, what advantages thou hast upon him.</p>
            <p>(First,) Take the advantage of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It may be he is taken down by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Now go and warn him of his sin. It may be now he will hearken to thee. <hi>Job</hi> 36. 8. 9. 10.</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) Make use of <hi>thy Relation.</hi> It may be thou art some near Relation in the flesh to him: take that advantage to be dealing with him, for his eternal good.</p>
            <p>(Thirdly,) Make use of his <hi>dependance</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:62321:43"/>
upon thee. It may be he is such a one as is concerned in thy good-will to him: it may be he <hi>works</hi> for thee, or depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy <hi>Charity</hi> for his livelyhood: take this advantage upon him: it may be he will hearken to thee.</p>
            <p>(Fourthly,) Make use of <hi>thy interest</hi> in him. It may be he hath some <hi>affection</hi> for thee: make use of it for God. And this may be a means to win him to Christ.</p>

            <p>THese words are part of <hi>Christs</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle from heaven to the Church of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> wherein he shrewdly checks her hypocrisie and formality, and throughout gives counsels and directions, for her recovery out of that sad estate; from the words we have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you this observation.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That the Lord Jesus Christ, doth take special notice of, and makes strict observation upon the works and ways of his professed people.</hi> He takes notice of their works! for the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of them, for the <hi>quantity,</hi> for the <hi>quality</hi> of them; as hath been shewed.</p>
            <p>We gave you the <hi>Reasons for confirmation,</hi> and made entrance into the <hi>Application,</hi> and have applyed it as to the two first branches; to wit, the <hi>matter,</hi> and the <hi>quantity</hi> of our works. To come now to the Application of the third thing, namely, <hi>the quality of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> Is it so that the Lord Jesus Christ doth
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62321:45"/>
take such notice of our works for the <hi>quality</hi> of them? then this may be usefull by way of <hi>Reprehension</hi> and <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First. For <hi>Reprehension,</hi> this reproves us that we rest so much in the work done, and do so little enquire into the quality of our works as to the sincerity and soundness of them. O my Brethren! how often do we pray, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver examine how we have prayed? and hear, and never enquire, how we have carried it, while we have been hearing? O how many a mans bosome am I now in? Brethren, this is a great evil among men. Yea, I fear among Gods own people, that there is not that care to look into their duties, <hi>how</hi> they are perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Brethren, if the <hi>Lord Jesus Christ</hi> did as you, look no farther than the outside of your duties, and the work done, then you may rest in that; O but Jesus Christ he looks into the <hi>inside</hi> of them, and he labours to see what there is of soundness and sincerity in them: And seeing the Lord Jesus Christ looks so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into them, should not you? This is the cause of many sins and mischiefs among Prosessors.</p>
            <p>First. This is the cause of much undoing <hi>Self-deceit,</hi> when persons rest in the work done, and do not carefully examine, what <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> they did act by, and <hi>ends</hi> they did act for; this doth cause many souls to be undone to their destruction. This was the reason why <hi>Sardis</hi> was so miserably out, and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that she was so much mistaken, they kept on the trade of Religious duties, and because the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62321:45"/>
thing was done, and the duty performed with con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tancy, they thought they were in a good state. You know the speech of that Church, <hi>I am rich</hi> &amp;c. you are to understand it of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Riches, she thought her self upon the growing hand. O but when <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> comes and sees how little sincerity there was in them, he disrellisheth them, and shews them that their works were not perfect before him. And thus it is with many Professors in these days, that because they keep on in Family<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer and good duties, they think all is well, and for want of looking into the Spring of their duties, and their ends in them, they are undone by them. O what a miserable deceit is this! when a poor creature shall reckon that he hath so much gold, so much treasure laid up in heaven, and when it comes to be tryed, all his <hi>Gold</hi> shall prove but <hi>Counters!</hi> O con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what a miserable estate that will be, when you shall come with them, Lord, Lord, we have been a praying people, and have owned and followed thee; and he shall say, away you Hypocrites, you shall have the reward of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, there was not the soundness of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in you; O what a miserable disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will this be! <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 26. He speaks there of some, that did but [<hi>seem] to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and deceive their own souls.</hi> There be some men, their Religion will serve for no other end but to deceive their own souls; to undo them, because they are unsound in their Religion. There are many Professors, that when they come to receive the reward of their
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62321:46"/>
du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ies they will receive another manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward than they thought of; they think to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the reward of their prayers, and keeping the Sabboth and the like; but he that taketh notice of the heart, knoweth their prayers were, but a taking of his name in vain. When they think to have eternal life for their reward, God will say, I will give you the reward of your works. I sound your works to be but hypocrisie, and you shall have the reward of Hypocrites. O Brethren, I beseech you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it! It is an awakening truth, but deserves your consideration; there are many that will not only be undone by their swearing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and the like; but many will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by their praying and hearing, I mean they will be undone by them, by making them the matter of their righteousness before God; and by their confidence and trust, and leaning to their duties. There be many persons, whose prayers and good duties will serve for no other end, but to blind them, and harden them to their own destruction. If you perform reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duties, and do not look into the <hi>manner</hi> of performing them, and take care that you be upright, you may come to blind, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den your selves by them. O there are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Professors in Hell this day for wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting care to enquire into this, what ingredients there were in their duties; whether they sprang from principles of grace, or, but from common convictions; whether they were done <hi>for,</hi> and <hi>from themselves,</hi> more than <hi>from</hi> and <hi>for God,</hi> This made <hi>Luther</hi> say that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62321:46"/>
more of his good works, than of his sins, for his good works were apt to lift him up, but his sins did keep him humble. O Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren! you had need to look about you, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan can make a snare of your good duties, to catch your souls by. There are two wayes whereby men may be undone by their duties, (1) when they make them as a <hi>supposed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> when men do perform Religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and expect that these should obtain the favour of God, and remission of sins, or, at least, should help with the merits of Jesus, to make up a righteousness for them, on which they may climb up to heaven, and stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. Thus those <hi>carnal Jews,</hi> though they were zealous of their duties required by the Law, yet they were lost by going about to establish those as a righteousness of their own. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3 (2) when they make them as a mistaken evidence. There are many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (I conceive) that are so far convinced of the sinfulness of their duties, that they do not lean to these as their Righteousness before God, that those should obtain Gods favour, and their pardon; yet they do conclude that this is an evidence that they have an interest in Christ; and hereby they deceive their own souls-</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But you will say, are not our good duties signs of our right to Christ? doth not the Scripture say,</hi> [<hi>he that doth Righteousness is righteous?</hi>] I <hi>answer,</hi> good works are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a good sign of faith: but then you must look to this, that they be sincerely good. But
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62321:47"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ow many do conclude, because the work is done, that therefore they are in <hi>Christ,</hi> when as they do not look into the bottom of their duties, whether they be done in sincerity or hypocrisie, and so do but deceive their own souls by trusting to them; because their duties are not sincere. O my Brethren, how effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually are many Professours undone by this! That are so hardned in their estate, that it is more hard to bring them into Jesus Christ, than those that are openly prophane. Thus it was observed in our Saviours ministry, that it was more hard to bring in the <hi>Self-justisying Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi> than the <hi>Self-condemning Publicans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Another mischief of this, is, this is <hi>the cause of so much pride and self-considence in duty.</hi> Had <hi>Laodicea</hi> but made a due search into her duties, you should have heard ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of speech from her. <hi>O my pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! Hypocrisie! Deadness! Formality! Lord pitty my woful state!</hi> this would have been the language you would have heard from her: but now because she did not search into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, this did lift her up; and made her think so well of her case. The reason why we are so well perswaded of our selves, is, because we do not see into our selves. Did we but throughly reflect upon, and search into our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when they are performed, we should run to God for pardoning grace. As <hi>Neh. last 22. Remember me O my God, for good.</hi> He did thus after his great zeal for God, and work of <hi>Reformation.</hi> He slies to God to pardon the sins of his duties, O Christian! if thou didst
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62321:47"/>
look into thy duties, thou wouldst see enough to make thee ashamed of them, thou wouldst be ready to cross what thou hast written, and to cut out thy work, and pick it out stitch by stitch. But now persons not searching into their duties, this makes them stick, and be confident in them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. This is the cause of so much <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness &amp; in prosiciency in the ways of God,</hi> did the Christian but duly examine his own duties and espy the defects of the <hi>present</hi> duty, and be sure to amend <hi>that</hi> the next time, that was am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ss now, this would make him, in a little time, come to a wonderfull <hi>prosiciency</hi> in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. But when men go on in a <hi>customary</hi> course, and do not find out their errours, it is no wonder they go on in their errours, in one tract, duty after duty, yea one year after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: A Christian that is careless in the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of his duties, that doth not observe the failings of his duties, to amend at one time what was amiss before, he will be but a Bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in Religion all his dayes. But he that is carefull to examine it. that he may amend what was amiss, this man will soon come to be his <hi>Crafts-master</hi> in his Trade.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This is the cause of so much <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our own estate;</hi> It is no wonder that so many Professors are at a loss about their condition; it is for want of looking into their Religion. They do not know whether they be sound or unsound, whether they be going forward, or going backward, all this is from want of care, to examine and enquire into their duties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:62321:48"/>For want of this men do not know whether they be sound or unsound, for how doth a man know the tree but by the fruit? When all is done, 'tis mens actual obedience that is the great evidence, that their estates must be tryed by. Whatsoever seeming principles of grace and life, and love, may seem to be within, and good resolutions, yet if all this, be not strong enough to bring forth the fruits of obedience, in a holy, self-denying, and flesh displeasing godliness, all is unsound. But then we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> not look <hi>onely</hi> to the outside of our obedience, we must not take the Carkass without the soul. Now when persons do not look into their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but rest in the work done, how can they make any judgment into their estate by them.</p>
            <p>So many that are sound Christians, do not know whether they are <hi>decaying</hi> or <hi>increasing</hi> for want of this, because they do not look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their duties how they perform them. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, how do you perform your duties? Do you more look into them, how sweet they are to you? whether it is better than it was? Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, you must look to this, are you more extensive. and intensive in your duties? Are you more extensive? Heretofore you looked onely at home, to do <hi>your selves</hi> good; do you do good now <hi>to others?</hi> Heretofore, Religion was consined to your <hi>knees,</hi> but now do you bring it forth into your <hi>Shops,</hi> and <hi>Callings?</hi> Here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>osore, you were for <hi>personal</hi> godliness, but are you now for <hi>Relative</hi> godliness? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, you were for duties of the first Table onely, but now do you put both Tables toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62321:48"/>
this would be a good sign, but for want of mens searching into this, they are at a loss; they do not know whether they are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or worse, declining or increasing.</p>
            <p>Fifthly. This is the cause of so much <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊◊〉</desc>

               </gap>: but when he fears not that, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the more remisse. So 'tis here, If we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a strict examination into our hearts, then they will be the more careful to ply the work the more, when they know they shall be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after. But when they know they shall not be looked into, they will do the work thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Beloved, if we would do the work of Religion to purpose, we must deal by our hearts, as we would by trewantly servants, if you would have any thing done, you must keep your eye upon them, If you keep your selves to this course constantly, to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your duties, how they were done, then your hearts will be careful to make thorough work of it. And indeed this enquiring into your duties, is not onely a means to make your hearts sincere in duty, but it is a great part of sincerity. That man that makes no enquiry into his heart, that man is an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erite, there is no soundness in that man. And the lesse care thou hast in looking into thy heart, the less there is of Christianity in thee.</p>
            <p>Sixthly. This is that, that <hi>puts Christ so much out of use.</hi> O Brethren! would you know the Reason, why Christ is so little set
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62321:49"/>
by? Why, it is because we are not thorowly acquainted with our defects. Were we much searching into our duties, then we should fly to our Advocate, and make use of him. And after the performing of our duties, fly to him for a covering of our nakedness and shame.</p>
            <p>Second <hi>Use of exhortation.</hi> Let us do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if Christ take such notice of our duties, O be much in observing your own duties. How your hearts carry it in your duties. If I could but perswade my self and my hearers to the observing of these two Directions, we should make another manner of progress in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. O That you would be but perswaded!</p>
            <p>First, <hi>In the entrance of your duties, set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you your rule fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hat duty;</hi> as. the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar doth his coppy, and do your work by rule You know the Mason will lay the line before he will lay the stone in the foundation, or else he may commit many errors, and the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may come to nothing. So when you come to perform your duties, set your rule before you. Suppose you come to pray, have some thoughts of it, what be the rules you are to pray by. Consider you are not to come in your own names but in Christs. Take heed that you come not in your own Rignteousness, but Christs. And go out to Christ for strength. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that God calls for faith and life induty. And so when you come to hear, consider what rules have I to hear by. And so in giving your Alms. And then your work is like to be done to purpose.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Reflect upon your rule in the close
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62321:49"/>
of your duty,</hi> and examine whether your work hath been done by rule or no. Observe what graces have been acting in your duty, and thankfully take notice of the influences of your graces. Take notice what <hi>corruptions</hi> have been working in your duty, and take the shame of it before God that you should thus miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y. If these <hi>two rules</hi> were but observed by us, we should come to another manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in Religion than we do. But more particularly let me give you three directions for your duties.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Take special notice of the ends of your duties.</hi> O How many do miscarry for want of a Right understanding in this? <hi>Come see my zeal for the Lord of hosts,</hi> said <hi>John.</hi> And all this while he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t Acting for <hi>himself.</hi> And because he did Gods work for such <hi>carnal ends,</hi> God accounts the blood that he had shed to be so much murder and requires it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at his hands, <hi>Hos.</hi> 1. 4. The <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi> were a very strict generation in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their duties. Much in <hi>Alms,</hi> and much and long in <hi>prayer,</hi> and yet all rejected, because they did it for <hi>carnal ends, Math.</hi> 23. 5. Therefore I beseech you as you <hi>Love</hi> your <hi>souls,</hi> look to your <hi>ends</hi> in praying. When you come to prayer Consider what <hi>end</hi> do I propound in this duty? Is not this done out of custome, because 'tis the custome of my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pray morning and evening? When you go to visit the sick, is it onely a civil custom that I am going about? or am I going to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit Jesus Christ in a sick servant of his? And so
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62321:50"/>
of our Alms. If a man set out with never so much diligence in the morning, and it be to a wrong point, he is all the while out of his way. Although a man cannot in every motion of the day mind his end, yet in every <hi>solemn action</hi> (as I have shewed you formerly) with care and pains taking with your hearts, you may come to mind your end, and the rule for that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular action. As for example, When you go to your callings, or to pray, or to eat, and the like; in these solemn actions of the day you may come particularly to renew your intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in your work. And this will manifest your sincerity, and you will come to have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Joy of your work. And if this be not well looked to, all your duties may serve at last for nothing, but to harden, and blind, and deceive you, rather than to save you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Look well to your principles in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> What principles you acted by and from. There may be many good things that may be done, that may be good for the matter, but yet because they do not act from a principle of Grace, God will reject them. There is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal duty of Religion, but an hypocrite, an unsound professor may do it (for ought I know) as well as a Godly man; onely they differ in their principles and ends. Therefore consider that thy duties come from a renewed heart. Examine, art thou acquainted with the new birth? Hast thou been acquainted with Gods converting grace? renewing thy heart! If it be not thus, all thy duties without this will do thee no good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:62321:50"/>Thirdly, <hi>Look to what affections are stirring in your duties.</hi> O how was Christ out with <hi>Laodicea</hi> for this! That because, though much were done, yet there was not much warmth in duty; there was no Life in them. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that the <hi>artisicial breath</hi> is a cold breath but a living breath is a warm breath. As e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you would have the comfort of your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, you must look to the warmth of your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. My soul followeth hard after thee, said the Psalmist <hi>Psalm.</hi> 63. 8. <hi>and thy right hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth me.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Ten parting Counsels.</head>
               <p>First, <hi>COunsel. Observe the degrees of Gods departing, and mourning after a departing God.</hi> The Lord, seems to me, to take his leave of us by degrees. And because it is by such insensible degrees, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid we are apt to take the less notice of it. God hath not thought good to take his farewel of us all at once. We thought, God had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to take all from us at first. You know ministers were excluded from their publick la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and then God lengthned out their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in private. And since an <hi>Act</hi> hath passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our private meetings, so that we have had our liberties with the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62321:51"/>
And now an Act hath passed whereby your Ministers are to be removed farther from you. However the Ministers of Christ are sinful poor men of themselves as others: but yet considering the capacity of their office, they are the great representatives of Jesus Christ. And when the Ministry is removed, this is a degree, and a great degree of Gods removal. You see God hath removed Ministers by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, farther and farther; and what will be the next remove! Me thinks the glory seems to be departing by degrees from the nation, as it was in the time of the prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the 10, 11, 12 chap. If we are left without the powerful preaching of the gospel, and the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means of conversion, what will it signifie though God should give this nation never so much outward plenty? If God should make this nation to wash their steps in butter, and fill our <hi>bellies with his hid Treasures,</hi> what will all this be, if our generations should go down to the pit of destruction by the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands? If there be preaching, yet if there be not a powerful preaching, that will save <hi>souls,</hi> what will it be? And this great mercy God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived us of by degrees. Oh mourn after a departing God! Take heed that you be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with this providence of God. How will God take it of you, if you do not stir up your selves to take hold of God, now he is depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? <hi>Wo to them when I shall depart from them:</hi> Wo to this nation, and this place when God departs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:62321:51"/>Second <hi>Counsel. Take heed that when the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick bellows are broken, the fire of Religion go not out.</hi> The Ministers of Christ are as the common bellows to blow up this sacred fire. And now God seems to have broken these bellowes; Oh take heed lest now Religion should dye away! and the heat and warmth thereof should decay, and by insensible degrees should go out. Weare too too much like green wood, the fire keeps no longer in, than while we are blowing the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows I fear lest you shall see professors too too much like Christ's disciples, who when Christ was taken went every one to his home: so weak their faith, and prevalent their infidelity, that they went their way, as if their work had been done. Take heed lest the like Apostacy creep in among you, that when these helps do fail, you go back again and remit your zeal. Oh Brethren! what ever you let go, be sure you do not let go your hold in Christ; do not let go your hold in Religion. Do but keep your ground there, and no matter what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of any other interest.</p>
               <p>Third <hi>Counsel. When God takes down the common sun, take the more earnest heed to the light that he sets up within.</hi> The ministry of the Gospel, and preaching of the word is like the publick light of the <hi>common Sun.</hi> And this light seems much to fail, and the <hi>shaddows of the evening are stretched out:</hi> and the Sun is like to set upon the <hi>Churches.</hi> Well then if it be so take the more earnest heed to the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Conscience.</hi> You know when the Sun is down every man kindles his candle, and takes
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62321:52"/>
heed to that. <hi>The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord.</hi> Conscience, is the light in every m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ns boso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e. Not that the light within, (as some do talk of) is sufficient without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>Gods word,</hi> to guide a man into the wayes of Life: But yet a well enformed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, instructed in the Scriptures, and well studied in the mind of God, and acquainted with the nature and principles of Religion, may be a great help to a Christian to guide him in his common course. My Brethren, if God deprive you of the <hi>preacher in the Palpit</hi> take the more earnest heed to the <hi>preacher in your bosome.</hi> Set Conscience faithfully on work. This is the preacher in the bosome that tels e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man of his duty and of his sins. Hearken now to the instructions of Conscience, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs and rebukes of Conscience. See and hear what Conscience will speak and direct. What that will touch on, why God hath brought on us these judgments. Oh, take heed! that what ever preacher be silenced; that this preacher be not silenced. Oh! take heed, how you stop the mouth of Conscience. How you desile and harden your Conscience. If Conscience be faithful and free, and you take earnest heed unto him, it may be a standing blessing to you, when the preachers in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit are removed from you.</p>
               <p>Fourth <hi>Counsel. Be sure that none of those extraordinary providences do drive you from God, but that they drive you to God.</hi> I fear le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t this may be the issue of these providences
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62321:52"/>
to many, that they may be driven off from God, that they will give over their diligence and zeal; and give up all for lost and gone. O this will be sad indeed! If these providences drive you from God, this will be a sad sign of reprobation; take heed that these drive you nearer <hi>to God.</hi> Be sure that the more frowning the providences of God are to you, the more do you cleave to him, the more tenderly do you walk before him. 'Tis a fearful sign of an unsound heart, never savoured, and seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with true grace, when afflicting providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do drive men farther and farther off from God. God doth intend by his Rod to whip his children home to him, to make them walk more tenderly; to caution them against sin, that he corrects them for. But now if any of you should make this use of his providences, that after all, you should go farther from God, oh how sad would this be! This is to be like <hi>King Ahaz.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 22. O let these Chastisements from God, drive you every one the nearer to God. And cause you every one to enquire into his way, and the iniquity that is in his hand, that he may reform.</p>
               <p>Fifth <hi>Counsel. Let your own eyes be your Overseers, when God deprives you of your pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Overseers.</hi> The Ministers of Christ, they are termed <hi>Seers,</hi> and <hi>Overseers;</hi> Now God is like to deprive you of these, oh take the more carefull Oversight every one of your selves; be the more strict in your inspection into your own wayes, in the examining of,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62321:53"/>
and inquiring into your own hearts. Beloved it is a duty that I have some time since pressed upon you, and I hope you do yet make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, daily to examine your hearts and ways by those questions; which we gave you sor this end, as a great help to this duty: I beseech you whatever you intermit, constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keep up, and maintain <hi>that duty.</hi> And now especially when God deprives you of your publick Overseers, you should take care of your selves. I have never any hopes that you will come to any proficiency in the wayes of God, unless you come up to the strict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of these <hi>Rules,</hi> that so you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come sensible of your errours, that one dayes <hi>humiliation,</hi> may be the matter of the next days <hi>Reformation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixth <hi>Counsel. Whatever become of your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trade, be sure that you keep up the Trade of Religion.</hi> Beloved, though God see it good to impo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>erish you and undo you in this world yet 'tis all well; if you keep on in Religion. That is a happy man that hath a thriving and flourishing soul, though he is declining in his estate; but if you go back in grace, though you should get all the world, you are misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble losers. Therefore be sure of this, how ever God do frown upon you in the world, that you do not go behind in grace. Oh, you may sadly fall and go behind hand, before you think of it, if you do not take heed to it; though there be no total falling away from grace for a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet there may be sad degrees of falling,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62321:53"/>
and God may let you fall so, that you may besad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded &amp; you may break all your bones; and be a common scandal to Religion all your days Therefore look to this, that however God deal with you in other things, account it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py with you if your souls be thriving: &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever prosperity God gives you, yet if these do not thrive, let none of these things content you. Many persons while they are blessing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their outward increase, are declining in grace. Oh poor Soul! I should pity thy gain, that addest to thy gain in the world, the loss of thy soul to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Seventh <hi>Counsel. Take heed whom and what you hear.</hi> I fear lest after the departuré of Ministers, <hi>wolves should enter not sparing the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ock.</hi> And I am afraid least any should be found among you of itching ears, hearkning after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, and heap up Teachers to your selves. Labour to know what Doctrine they bring you before you hear them. Take heed lest men of corrupt principles and dangerous doctrines should make a harvest of you, and draw Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples after them; and <hi>overthrow</hi> the <hi>faith of some.</hi> And I cannot be faithful to you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warning you of this miserable danger; you are to take heed to the Call of God. Beware <hi>whom</hi> and <hi>what</hi> you hear, hearken to those that are the sent Ministers of Christ. It is like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that Seducers may take the advantage of the present time, that under pretence of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courage and boldness than Ministers have, may seem to alienate the people from their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62321:54"/>
Ministers, as flying from their flocks as hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
               <p>Eighth <hi>Counsel. Maintain with constancy and frequency the Communion of Saints.</hi> Now is the time my Brethren for those that fear the Lord, <hi>to speak often one to another.</hi> Now you are deprived of your publick Overseers, take the more carefull oversight one over another, rebuke one another, admonishone another, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke one another to love and to good works, now if ever, there will be special need of this. If you forsake the <hi>Assembling of your selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> we shall see Religion dying as the coal that is put in the middle of the Room by it self.</p>
               <p>Ninth <hi>Counsel. Walk together in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and unity of the Gospel.</hi> Take heed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>dividing principles, mark them that cause Divisions, and avoid them.</hi> Those that are not for peace be not you for them, what ever pretence they may have to <hi>purity</hi> attend them not, unless they are men that are for peace. If once the ranks be broken, the Army is quickly routed, and if once the unity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians be broken, then Satan hath got his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and is like to have his will. O take heed that you keep together in the unity and peace of the Gospel, that your <hi>Ministers</hi> and that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> may rejoyce to <hi>behold your order and your stedfastness in Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:62321:54"/>Tenth <hi>Counsel. Keep up the Life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>r of Religion.</hi> Be so much the more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in your <hi>Families,</hi> by how much the more you are deprived of your <hi>publick helps.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, be advised by me, and let Satan be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed in this design. He thinks to break the Churches of Christ: Oh but now let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Family be a Church, and let every Master be a Priest and Prophet to teach their Family. Praise and pray for them, and do so much the more in your Families, by how much the more God hath deprived you of your Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>Brethren, so it is that the preaching of the Gospel is like to be scarce, and the means of Conversion is like to be at a stand; and what shall be done for the Conversion of souls? Oh be dealing with them, and never leave them, till you see they mind their souls and Religion. Put them upon secret prayer, and the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, and Repeating the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, oh that I may prevail with you to set up this duty of <hi>Catechising</hi> in your Families in this evil time! And if so be you would but try the use of that help, that I have caused to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on purpose for that end, I do not doubt but you would find it a happy means, for the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the light into their souls.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THis <hi>Psalm,</hi> and particularly <hi>these words,</hi> do contain the Churches sad <hi>lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> over her deep affliction; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her earnest <hi>expostulation</hi> with God about the cause. Two things there are, that the Church in these words doth plead with God.

            </p>
            <p>First, The <hi>greatness of her Affliction.</hi> And there were three things in her asfliction that did make it lye very heavy upon her. First, The <hi>root of this affliction,</hi> and that was Gods [<hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger] why doth thine ANGER smoak?</hi> &amp;c.

                  </gap>rness of her Relation.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst [<hi>the sheep of thy pasture</hi>] as if they should have said, Lord, if thou hadst done this against thine enemies it had been no wonder. If thou hadst poured out thy wrath, against the vessels of wrath, it had not been so much. But what, wilt thou draw out thy sword against <hi>the sheep of thy pasture!</hi> It were no wonder that thou shouldst take the fat and the strong, and pour out thy judgements upon them; but wilt thou do it to thy sheep! There be several doctrines that I may raise from the words, as</p>
            <p>First <hi>Doct.</hi> That Gods people are his sheep.</p>
            <p>Second <hi>Doct.</hi> That God may be sorely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with his own people. With his own sheep.</p>
            <p>Third <hi>Doct.</hi> That when God is angry with his people, it becomes them carefully to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Cause.</p>
            <p>Fourth <hi>Doct.</hi> That when Gods people are under affliction, they ought to take notice of, and be much affected with his anger from which they do proceed.</p>
            <p>Fifth Doct. That Gods people under afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are, or should be more affected with his anger, than with their smart. This is that the Church doth complain of: Not that the Church did so smart, but that God was so displeased and angry. That did most affect her.</p>
            <p>Six <hi>Doct.</hi> That Gods people are apt to have misgiving thoughts of God, when they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sore afflictions. God was angry with his people, and their hearts did misgive them, as if God did cast of his people.</p>
            <p>Seventh <hi>Doct.</hi> That God may be angry with
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62321:56"/>
with his people so sore, and so long, that in the judgement of sence, it may seem, that they are for ever cast off.</p>
            <p>Eight <hi>Doct.</hi> That though the people of God may not murmure against his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; yet they may humbly expostulate with him about the cause. Why doth thine anger smoak against the sheep of thy pasture? I have spoken heretofore to the <hi>first</hi> of these doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, I shall speak now to the <hi>second.</hi> To wit.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That God may be angry, and sorely angry with his own people.</hi> I have already in the audience of some proved this point. And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered several questions. As (first) How <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> may be ascribed to God? (secondly) <hi>How far</hi> he may be angry with his own people. (Thirdly,) What is the <hi>difference</hi> between Gods being Angry with his own <hi>people,</hi> &amp; with <hi>the wicked</hi> I shall not respeak any thing of what I have spoken, but proceed to a fourthquestion.</p>
            <p>Fourth <hi>Question.</hi> By what signs and <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> may we come to know whether God be <hi>angry?</hi> and here I shall first premise four Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions: &amp; then answer the question in six <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi> First, I shall premise these 4 propositions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First Proposition.</hi> That a person or people may verily think themselves to be in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, when they are indeed under his anger and displeasure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Prop.</hi> That neither Gods favor, nor his anger can be known [meerly] by his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward dispensations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third Prop.</hi> That Gods anger or favor must be judged of, rather by our carriage toward
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62321:57"/>
him, than by his carriage towards us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth Prop.</hi> That for the discovering of Gods favor or anger, we must consult rather the book of Conscience, and of Scripture, than the book of providence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First Proposition. That a person or people may verily think themselves to be in Gods favor when they are indeed under his anger and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure.</hi> This is an awakening consideration, and therefore should be duly laid to heart. A <hi>Church</hi> may think her self in a very good and safe condition, and yet <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> may loath it, and be ready to spue her out of his mouth. As of the Church of the <hi>Laodiceans.</hi> Men may cry to themselves <hi>peace and safety, when sudden destruction may come upon them.</hi> And may say, <hi>Is not the Lord among us? No evil can come unto us;</hi> and yet be upon the very brink of destruction. Men may have great <hi>hopes</hi> of the <hi>presence</hi> of God with them, and yet <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> of Gods departing from them. And may cry <hi>the temple of the Lord,</hi> when God is even casting them out of his sight. We read of som that had a great deal of confidence of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor; they would still <hi>lean on the Lord,</hi> and were consident that he had favor for them; and yet the Lord was ready to break out upon them to their destruction, <hi>Micah</hi> 3. 11, 12. <hi>They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, is not the Lord among us? None evil can come upon us. Therefore shall Zion for your sakes be ploughed as a field.</hi> They may think that because the ordinances of God are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62321:57"/>
them, that God is among them; when God may be turning them up as a field that is ploughed. This ought to startle and awaken men. Sirs, it is not your <hi>Confidence,</hi> but your <hi>evidence</hi> that will carry it. Many times there are none so confident of Gods favor, as those that are marked out for the objects of his eternal wrath and displeasure. The carnal <hi>Jews,</hi> they would not be beaten out of their carnal confidence. And though the prophet told them of the wrath of God that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against them, yet they would not hear him, till wrath came upon them, and <hi>there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Prop. That neither Gods favor nor his anger can be known,</hi> [<hi>meerly] by his outward dispensations. No man knoweth either Love or hatred by the things that are before him.</hi> Men have very shrewdly erred by judging of Gods favor, or wrath by his outward dispensations. When the <hi>Psalmist</hi> took his mark by this, how sorely was his faith shaken, and <hi>his feet almost gone?</hi> When he beheld the Godly in affliction and under suppression; and the wicked prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in their wickedness. The 73 Psalm gives you a true account, what a sad bout he had by this. He observed they had <hi>no bonds in their death, and they were not plagued like other men. Their eyes stand out with fatness, they have more than heart could wish.</hi> They were very wicked and yet very prosperous. Full of sin, and yet full of pleasure, and riches and all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward accommodation. Whereas on the other side, he observed that he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>fflicted, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62321:58"/>
of the Godly with him. And was tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this, that God did regard the wicked so much, or more than he did the Godly. And therefore 'tis a very dangerous mistake among the multitude. Many think on the one side, that because God doth prosper them, and bless them as he doth, that therefore they are in the favor of God: for if they were not, he would never deliver them, and carry them through so many troubles as he doth, if he did not love them. This is a dangerous mistake. And so some on the other hand, because God doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict them here, that therefore he hath mercy for them hereafter. They have their hell here, and therefore they shall not go to hell hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Alass man! thou mayst have thy hell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun here, and lengthened out hereafter to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. Thou canst not say from this, that thou shalt escape the torments of hell: but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this, thou mayst hear God say to thee at last as to <hi>Dives, Son remember that thou in thy Life-time receivedst thy good things: but now thou art tormented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third Prop. Gods favor or anger must be judged of rather from our carriage towards him, than from his carriage towards us.</hi> If our walk be according to <hi>Gods rule,</hi> we may be sure that <hi>peace shall be upon us. Gal.</hi> 6. 16. If we are such as <hi>fear God and work Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, then we may be certain that we are accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God. Acts.</hi> 10. 35. <hi>If we do well, we shall be accepted. They that by patient conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nce in well-doing, seek for glory, honor, and immortality, shall have eternal life.</hi> They
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62321:58"/>
are under promise <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 6, 7. But on the contrary, <hi>tribulation and anguish upon every soul that doth evil.</hi> Those that walk disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in disobedience to the will of God, however God may prosper them in their ways, as they may seem, yet they must know that Gods anger is against them. They may know that his anger is against them, because they walk against him: against the flat command of his word. <hi>For these things cometh the wrath of God upon the Children of disobedience, Eph.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, against all ungodliness, and unright cous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of men, Rom.</hi> 1. 18. So they that walk in ways of unrighteousness, and ungodliness, they may know by this that they are under the wrath of God; however <hi>God</hi> may seem to carry it towards them. Men may not conclude that because <hi>God</hi> doth not presently smite, that therefore he is not angry with them. <hi>God</hi> may speak never a word, neither strike a blow; and yet may treasure up wrath against them at the last, and they never think of it. Many a poor wretch thinks, that <hi>God,</hi> because he is silent that he approves of them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 21. <hi>These things hast thou done and I kept silence. Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thy self; but I will reprove thee and set them in order before thine eyes. God</hi> would make them know, that though for the present he spake nothing, and did not shew his anger; yet he would make it known against them. If our carriage be dutiful, and humble toward <hi>God,</hi> what ever his carriage be towards us, we
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62321:59"/>
may be sure that his love is towards us. <hi>God</hi> doth many times carry it as if he were angry, for the tryal of his people, to see whether they will trust him, and walk <hi>by faith</hi> and not <hi>by sence.</hi> Whether they will believe though it be against their own feeling. He will many times put his Children upon this exercise, not in anger, but in Love. As the tender Nurse doth the Child. So on the other hand, <hi>God</hi> may let men alone, and let them prosper in the world, though he be dreadfully angry with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth Prop, That the favor or anger of God, is rather to be gathered from the book of Scripture, and of conscience, than from the book of providence.</hi> Many times the book of providence is very dark, and seems to speak that <hi>God</hi> favors those men; whereas if we look into the <hi>Scripture,</hi> we shall see that they are the vessels of his wrath. And the book of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence may seem to tell us, that such a people are the objects of his wrath, which if we look into Scripture we shall find, that they are the people of his love. Therefore the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> when he could not know by the book of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, he went to the Scripture, to the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, to the oracles, and had those things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened there. This book was a key to open those riddles that he could not understand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He sees that those men that did prosper thus, were the objects of his wrath. And on the other hand, that the poor and afflicted were the onely beloved of <hi>God.</hi> Though this was against his mind before, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 13.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62321:59"/>
               <hi>Thy way O God is in the Sanctuary.</hi> That is, in the place where thy word is preached, and explained, there is thy way, the meaning and sence of thy providence is discovered. Those that have the Scripture against them, these are they that bear the marks of <hi>Gods</hi> anger upon them. And those that have the <hi>Scripture</hi> for them, what ever others judgements be, these be the men of his delight. Therefore let the word of God be your judge. And with the book of <hi>Scripture,</hi> compare the book of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi> For, saith the <hi>Apostle if our hearts condemn us not, than have we confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. But if our hearts condemn us, God is greater then our hearts and knoweth all things</hi> Let conscience be consulted with, when thou art trying thy case, whether thou art in the favor or under the anger of <hi>God.</hi> And that will be able, comparing thy state with the <hi>Scripture</hi> to give a great guess to this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>God</hi> have favor for thee or be against thee.</p>
            <p>Now I must adde six <hi>Conclusions,</hi> in which the question shall be resolved. How it may be known that <hi>God is angry</hi> with any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First Conclusion. The Raign and dominion of sin is a most certain evidence, that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or people, are under Gods anger.</hi> Where sin is raigning, and abounding, gross and hain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sins abounding in any nation or place, you need not any other evidence that God is angry with that people. Especially, when those Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62321:60"/>
are tolerated by <hi>Magistrates,</hi> or found in persons that are in a publick place, then they are fearful signs of <hi>Gods</hi> anger: then you may know there is great misery for such peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though he may seem at present to prosper them. And so for any <hi>particular person,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the sin be gross or close, if thou art under the power of any one unmortified sin, thou mayst be sure thou art under the anger and wrath of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>For these things cometh the wrath of God upon the Children of disobedience. Rom.</hi> 2. 8, 9. <hi>But to them that are contentious, and obey not the truth indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wrath, tribulation and anguish unto every soul that doth evil.</hi> Art thou yet in thy Natural unconverted state, unrenewed? thou mayst go away with sadness; thou goest up and down with <hi>Cain,</hi> with certain marks of <hi>Gods</hi> displeasure upon thee; for we are <hi>by Nature Children of wrath.</hi> If thou art in the estate thou wert in by Nature, thou art surely under the wrath of <hi>God.</hi> If thou remainest in thy old unbeleef, thou needest no more dispute about this matter, the wrath of <hi>God</hi> abideth on thee: The whole book of <hi>God,</hi> and the threatn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>God,</hi> do rise up with open mouth to condemn thee that livest in any unmortified sin. Now sin is unmortified, when persons go on in a purpose of sinning, and in a willingness to practise sin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Know ye not, that to whom you yield your selves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey? whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi> To whom you [<hi>yield</hi>] your selves
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62321:60"/>
servants to obey. The servant of God is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken [<hi>captive</hi>] by his sin under a temptation; but if you yield your selves servants to them, you are the servants of sin. Yield your selves servants to [<hi>obey</hi>] whom do you ordinarily [<hi>obey</hi>]? If the devil can do more with you to draw you from God, than <hi>God</hi> can to keep you to him; if he can do more with you to make you neglect prayer, than <hi>God</hi> can to keep you to it; or if he can prevail with you to commit any sin, more then <hi>God</hi> can to keep you from it, you are under the wrath of <hi>God.</hi> There is a <hi>two fold anger, a stated anger,</hi> and <hi>occasional anger</hi> or <hi>temporal anger.</hi> Occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and temporal anger, and so the Children of <hi>God</hi> may fall under his anger: but by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to him in Christ that anger may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off again. But there is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ate of anger, and that is with the wicked. And this thou art under, who dost live in unmortified sin. Thou art in a state of anger, in a state of wrath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Con When the threats and menaces of Gods Word are against men, this is a sure evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his anger.</hi> You know we may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the anger of men by their <hi>Rebukes,</hi> and <hi>threats,</hi> and the like. If the word of <hi>God</hi> be against thee, be sure the anger of <hi>God</hi> is against thee. Therefore consult the <hi>Scripture.</hi> If the <hi>Scripture</hi> do speak sadly of thy state, that is an undeniable evidence of <hi>Gods</hi> anger, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Wo to the inhabitants of the Sea coast, the word of the Lord is against you.</hi> O wo to them that the word of the Lord is against!
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62321:61"/>
There is wrath from the Lord against that man. Therefore if the Lord do speak against thee, Make thy peace with speed. Do as <hi>Haman,</hi> when he saw the King rise up in hast: he stood up to make request for his life to the Queen. <hi>Est. 7, 7,</hi> So if thou dost find that there is evil intended against thee by thy sins, O fall down upon thy knees and make up thy peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third Con. Publick calamities, except when they come upon a people for Righteousness sake, are the evident tokens of Gods anger.</hi> When <hi>God</hi> doth strike a nation or a people with war, or with pestilence, or with famine, or the like this is a manifest token of <hi>Gods</hi> anger with such a nation or people. This you may see through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the book of <hi>Judges.</hi> Still it was when the people had sinned, and <hi>God</hi> was angry, that these publick calamities were brought upon them, <hi>Judg.</hi> 2. 13, 14, 19, 20, 21. and 3. 7, 8. and 10. 6. There you may see that publick calamities did proceed from the sins that were among them. And if sin be a sign of <hi>Gods</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, you may easily make application. Should not we fear and tremble? should not we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our selves in the dust, and cloath our selves with sackcloth? God hath sent all his three greatplagues togetherupon our nation, <hi>Famine, Sword,</hi> and <hi>War.</hi> O apply this, and see that you be sadly affected with Gods displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Nation.</p>
            <p>But here I put in an exception [<hi>When they come upon a people for Righteousness sake</hi>] then though the calamities be common and publick.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62321:61"/>
Yet it is not a sign of <hi>Gods</hi> anger. In the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times,</hi> the Christians were fearfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted every where, and were killed by the thousands, and therefore this was rather <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome,</hi> then <hi>signs of Gods anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here two things must be considered: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these afflictions did find them <hi>cleaving</hi> to the Lord in their duty: Or, going off from him, and <hi>declining</hi> their duty. Now if they do find them decaying and remitting their zeal and diligence, then those evils, though they do come upon them for Righteousness sake, yet they come for Gods anger too. And so though they should rejoyce in them as coming from wicked men, yet they should be humbled, and take notice too of the hand of Godagainst them in correcting their vices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth Con. When God doth suffer men to prosper in an evil way, this is a fearful sign of Gods anger.</hi> Prosperity is so far from being a sign of Gods favor, that when prosperity doth attend men, and follow them in an evil way, it is one of the most dreadfullest marks in the world against a person or people. <hi>Whom the Lord loves he rebukes, and chastens,</hi> that is, if they wander and go out of his way. And <hi>we are judged of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world, Cor.</hi> 11. 32. So when the Lord lets men go on in their evil ways unpunished, it is a sign he intends they shall be condemned with the world. Brethren, be jealous of your selves, if <hi>God</hi> let a person go on in a way of wickedness, it is a fearful sign.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62321:62"/>
               <hi>Hos. 4. 14. I will not punish your daughters when they commit whordome</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.</hi> It is a sign that he intends higher displeasure against a person, when he lets them go on in a way of sin, and will not stop them, but let them take their swinge in sin. Those whom he intends love to, shall be corrected here, and stopped: but others shall have the gibbet kept for them at last.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifth Con. Spiritual judgements are ever to be taken as sore evidence of Gods anger.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times God doth inflict temporal judgements with an intention to reform them, and amend a people: but when he gives up a person or people to Spiritual judgments, this is a token of his highest displeasure. God doth threaten as one of the sorest evidences of his displeasure [<hi>a Famine of the word</hi>] So <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 59, 60. <hi>When God heard this he was wrath, and greatly abhorred Israel: so that he forsook the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Shiloh the tent which he had placed among men.</hi> When God forsook the tabernacle, and deprived them of the former tokens of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in their ordinances, this was a sign that he abhorred <hi>Israel.</hi> So our <hi>Saviour</hi> as his tokens of his displeasure against the Church threatens that he would <hi>remove his Candlestick.</hi> He would unchurch them as one of his most fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful threatnings, <hi>Rev. 2. 5. Rom.</hi> 1. 23, 24, 28. The <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks of some that were under the fearful token of Gods wrath in this. This was a fearful token of Gods wrath against
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62321:62"/>
them indeed, when God should give them up to such spiritual judgments. <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 10, 11. <hi>My people would not hearken to my voice: so I gave them up to their own hearts lusts.</hi> O this was dreadful indeed! This was the sorest expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Gods</hi> anger that could be against that people, so 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 11, 12. <hi>God shall send them strong delusions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 7. 8. <hi>The elect hath obtained it; but the rest were blinded,</hi> &amp;c. O do you see any such souls thus delivered up? O let your hearts tremble for such persons This is a shrewd evidence, that they are persons gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to great judgements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Six Con. Temporal afflictions, when they find the people of God straying, and wandring, and declining from him, are evident tokens of Gods anger.</hi> They are not always tokens of his anger. When they find us keeping close to God, they are for tryal, and not signs of Gods displeasure? <hi>Job</hi> was highly commended by the Lord when the affliction was upon him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must consult conscience whether it was not for such a sin that <hi>God</hi> is now afflicting thee. And if thou dost find it was for sin, thou hadst need run quickly and make the atonement. But if otherwise, you may conclude it is but for proof and tryal and exercising those graces that <hi>God</hi> hath given you.</p>

God that hath been alwayes good to you, hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been better then since you have had afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Elijah</hi> was never so happily fed at a full Table as when it was a time of great Famine: when God sent him every bit of bread and flesh by the mouth of a Raven. Oh how sweetly do you think that every bit of this bread did rellish with the <hi>man of God?</hi> when he saw that he received it imediately out of <hi>Gods own hand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Brethren, though it hath been a time of great calamity, yet God hath herein heightned his mercy to you; you have seen the <hi>Bush of God</hi> burning and yet not consumed. The por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Children hath been taken away, and yet our cheeks have been fat. We have been cast with <hi>Daniel</hi> into the Lyons den: but God hath sent his angel and shut the Lyons mouth, and we have not been destroyed but are here together to praise the Lord.</p>
            <p>Methinks there are several <hi>periods</hi> of time, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ine the time of our calamities, wherein God hath appeared to us, when we thought all had bin gone. One period was when your Ministers
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62321:64"/>
were shut out of publick by the <hi>Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</hi> Another when we were cast out of our private Meetings, by the <hi>Act made against <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ditious Conventicles.</hi> So called by the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the times. Another by this <hi>Act</hi> that doth now cast Ministers out of their <hi>Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> And me thinks every period should end with praise. We read, that when they removed the <hi>Ark,</hi> that when they had passed such a number of paces then they <hi>slew a sacrifice:</hi> so me thinks as we passe thefe periods of time, at the end of every period we should <hi>offer pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ise.</hi> What though God hath separated your prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers from you, ye as he said, if the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier dies fighting, and the preacher preaching, and the swan singing, then the Saints should part praising. Oh Christians this is the spirit that should be in you, that what ever God doth with you for the time to come, you should resolve to end in his praise for the mercies past. If it were the last day we should have together, surely methinks we should end in praise. And since the Alarm hath been sounded, by the late <hi>unhappy Act,</hi> that saying of <hi>Sampson</hi> hath run often in my mind, <hi>let me dye with the Philistines:</hi> so methinks I would say, let me dye with praise. And now O God, let my hands and heart be lifted up with thy praise: that I may touch their hearts; that every heart of theirs, may sound forth thy heavenly praise. But 'tis easie to be lost in praise, the mercies of God are a deep that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fathomed. Where shall I begin or end? How shall I reach to the top? or when shall I come to the bottom? however I will not say
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62321:65"/>
nothing, because I cannot say all. Let me touch a little of the mercies of God: a little this Evening to shew the mercy of <hi>God</hi> to you. And let it live upon your hearts as long as you live. Consider now what great things <hi>God</hi> hath done for you, whether you are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>of God in general;</hi> or <hi>people of Taunton in particular.</hi> How great are the mercies of <hi>God</hi> to you!</p>
            <p>First, As <hi>you are the people of God in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi> This is the top of all your mercies. In this sayes our Savior <hi>rejoyce, not that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are made subject to you: but in this that your names are written in heaven.</hi> Brethren we have many mercies to praise the Lord for: but this is that should most affect us, <hi>Gods</hi> peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar mercy to us, as we are his chosen generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and peculiar people. Consider now what the Lord hath done for you. Let me open it to you in six or seven particulars.</p>
            <p>(First.) <hi>You are the Election of Grace.</hi> (Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,) <hi>You are the first born of God.</hi> (Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,) <hi>You are the first fruits of the Creation.</hi> (Fourthly,) <hi>You are the Remnant of escape.</hi> (Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,) <hi>You are the Burgesses of heaven.</hi> (Sixthly,) <hi>You are the Members of Christ.</hi> (Seventhly,) <hi>You are the living stones of the Temple.</hi> Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is the man, you will say, whose happiness this is. But this damps my Joy and comfort, lest I should not be the man. Now lest this should damp thy Joy, let me give thee two <hi>Characters,</hi> by which thou mayst come to know whether this be thy case. Thou mayst know it by the <hi>Transactions</hi> that have <hi>passed</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:62321:65"/>
between Christ and thy Soul: and by the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> that hath been made <hi>choyce</hi> of by thee.</p>
            <p>First, By the <hi>Transactions</hi> that have passed between Christ and thee. Hast thou passed under the <hi>Bond of his Covenant?</hi> as Christ hath offered himself to thee, hast thou again delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up thy self to him? hast thou renounced all thy known sins? And took the Lord Jesus Christ for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>hy Head and Husband, to love, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, obey him above all? hast thou conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the conditions of Christ, and accepted of them all? and sayest as my Lord saith, so I will do. Doth thy heart close with the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying laws of Christ, and art resolved not to allow thy self in any known sin; but to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by repentance? If so, thou art the man I am speaking of.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thou mayst know it by the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> that hath been made <hi>choise of by thee.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is known by what he pitcheth his heart upon for his Treasure. What is it, man, that carryeth thy heart? The things <hi>seen,</hi> or the things <hi>unseen?</hi> Who hath most of thy heart, <hi>God</hi> or the world? Which way stands the bent of thy heart? a godly manmust not judg of himself by what he is at worst, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Temptation: Nor others by what they are at best in a fit: but where is thy constant bent? What is thy chiefest care and delight? Is it to converse with <hi>God?</hi> And be like to God? VVhat doth please thee best, when thou art contriving thy happiness? Doth this, that <hi>God</hi> is thine? Or is it something here below? VVhat is thy care? Is it to please <hi>God?</hi> If it
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62321:66"/>
be thus, thou art the man that I am speaking to. And now you that are thus, that have passed under the bond of <hi>Gods</hi> Covenant; and have made choice of him for your happiness, know and understand.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That you are the election of Grace. The election h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>th obtained it,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle, but the rest were blinded.</hi> You are the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that God hath taken out but the heap are left. Oh Christians, the great Transaction of God from all eternity hath been about you. And the great transactions of God in time have been about you. The Lord did from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity enter into a league with his Son for you: and did give him to you. God was laying the foundation of your <hi>happiness</hi> before he laid the foundation of the <hi>world.</hi> God was making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for you from all eternity. Our Saviour is often speaking of this gift in <hi>John</hi> 17. so <hi>John</hi> 10. 29. <hi>My father which gave them me is greater then all, John.</hi> 6. 39. <hi>And this is the Fathers will that of all that he hath given me I should loose nothing.</hi> And so, <hi>All that the Father hath given me shall come unto me.</hi> Oh Christian, doth not this assect thy heart? that the eternal Counsel of the great God should be taken up about thee? that God should be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining and agreeing with his Son about thee! that thou shouldst be mentioned <hi>by name</hi> from all eternity? <hi>Christ knows his sheep by name.</hi> And he bids such <hi>rejoice, because their names are written in heaven.</hi> O man, did God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign thee from all eternity by name! How should this affect thy heart? what did God
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62321:66"/>
build all this world for? It was that Christ might have a seed. And why do he continue the world? 'tis because Christ might have the elect sinished, when the elect are numbred the Trumpet shall sound, and away he comes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gather his elect. Christs coming, what was it for? that he might ransom his sheep. And his second comming, what is it sor, but that he might receive his elect? <hi>John</hi> 14. 3. <hi>I will come again and receive you to my self, that wher I am ye may be also, Math.</hi> 24, 31. <hi>He shall send his angels, with a great sound of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.</hi> What was the end of Christs low Humiliation, even to death, but to <hi>save his people from their sins? Math.</hi> 1. 21. And what is the end of Christs glorious exaltation, to all power and greatness? it was all for the elect, <hi>John</hi> 17. 2. Christ hath all power in heaven and earth delivered to him for your sakes; for the elect. <hi>That he might give eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life to the elect.</hi> Oh man, what a heart hast thou, if all this cannot move thee! if thou hadst stood by, when he laid the foundation of the fabrick of this world, wouldst thou not have said surely 'tis for some great end? if thou hadst stood by when Christ was Crucisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and known the mistery, wouldst thou not have said, surely this is for some great end? why all this was for thee.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>You are the first born of God, Heb.</hi> 12. 23. <hi>you are come to the general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, the Church of the first born which are
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62321:67"/>
written in heaven,</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks of our priviledges as if we were come to heaven al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. You [<hi>are] come</hi> &amp;c. you are Gods <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el;</hi> and beside, you areadmitted to have fellow ship with Jesus Christ, and by faith are made one with him. Now Christ is Gods first born, and we being joyned to him are made one with him. We are <hi>joynt heirs with Christ.</hi> Now the first born had many priviledges, As.</p>
            <p>(First,) The sirst-born had the <hi>dearest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festion, Zach.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>They shall be in bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as one for his</hi> sirst-<hi>born.</hi> There is the great sorrow, because there run out the great stream of affection, in this respect you are the first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of God: you are they that have his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 1. You are called the <hi>dear children of God.</hi> O the dear <hi>expressions,</hi> that he useth to you, and the dear <hi>affections</hi> that he hath for you! you are called the <hi>dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of his soul.</hi> O what drops of love doth God drop in these sacred leaves of this book? how full is the book of the <hi>Canticles? My love, My dove, My undesiled.</hi> God doth out bid the love of all the parents in the world. Can <hi>a woman forget her sucking child?</hi> sho may; but <hi>I will not forget thee, saith the Lord.</hi> The dearest mother when she lets her child out of her hands may forget it, but you are never out of my hands: you are engraven there. O what rouling bowels are there in those words, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 20. <hi>Is Ephraim my Son? is he a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant child? For since I spake against him I do earnestly remember him still: therefore My bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels are troubled for him, I will surely have
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62321:67"/>
mercy upon him saith the Lord.</hi> Oh man dost thou consider that all this is spoken to thee? All this love, God hath in his heart for thee; yea beyond all expression dear art thou to God.</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) The first-born do carry <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi> This is your case, the inheritance is for you. Though a man have many Sons, yet not many <hi>heirs:</hi> 'tis his first-born is his heir, though a King hath many Sons, yet but one King: 'tis the first-born that is King after him. In this refpect Gods children are the first-born: for they are all heirs, you are all Kings, you that are begotten again, you are begotten to <hi>an inheritance,</hi> to <hi>a heavenly, that fadeth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(Thirdly,) The first-born had a <hi>special bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. Gen.</hi> 27. 19. <hi>I am Esau thy first-born.</hi> And you know when <hi>Esau</hi> knew that <hi>Jacob</hi> had got the blessing of the first-born, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted himself undone: and he <hi>lifted up his voice and wept.</hi> Brethren, you have the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. Let others glory in their wealth and riches; who ever have these benefits 'tis you have the blessing. Beloved, you are the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs,</hi> when others are the <hi>Esaus:</hi> you carry the blessing of the first-born. Nay and God rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies the blessing on you as that upon <hi>Jacob. I have blessed him and he shall be blessed. Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> was sensible of this; <hi>He hath blessed and I cannot reverse it.</hi> You that are Gods first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, God hath made you unchangeably hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, you are unalterably blessed, God hath blessed you and it cannot be reversed.</p>
            <p>(Fourthly,) The first-born did carry <hi>the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:62321:68"/>
and were accounted the excellency and strength of the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ily. <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 3. <hi>Reuben, thou art first-born, my might and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power.</hi> And God says of his first born as <hi>Jacob</hi> of his. Thou art the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of dignity. So God sayes of you: I will make of you <hi>an eternal excellency.</hi> You know if a Knight have m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ny Sons, there is but one Knight. And so of a <hi>Lord</hi> 'tis the first-born is <hi>Lord</hi> after him: he carries the honor of the family. So you my Brethren, you carry the honor: you are the onely honorable persons in Gods account. <hi>Since thou hast been preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in my sight thou hast been honorable.</hi> And, <hi>those that honor me I will honor.</hi> Brethren, put this together, and see if there be not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to lift up the praise of God on high: and to say <hi>Now I will l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t up thine horn on high.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God hath listed up your horn on high.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>You are the first sruits of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Jam.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Of his own will beg at he us with his word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his Creatures.</hi> Now there were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things observable in the <hi>first-fruits,</hi> As.</p>
            <p>(First,) The fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t fruits, they were the <hi>choice of the fruits.</hi> And therefore God, that did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver require them to bring the best, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them to bring the fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t-fruites of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Beleivers are the first fruits of Gods works. And God sets more value upon this workmanship then upon any thing else beside. Other things they shew some footsteps of God: but the new cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ture th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t hath the very Image of God, and so is the fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t fruit of all. The
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62321:68"/>
first fruits are of a more higher price and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem than any other. So are you: you are those that he cals his excellent ones. Those whom he binds up amongst <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s Jewels. The Saints are the desire of his eyes, and the joy of his heart. Christians, I speak this to you and you must apply it. You are the desire of Christ <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 5. 11. He asks no other portion but you, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 8. And you are his <hi>delight</hi> as well as his <hi>desire. Prov.</hi> 8. The wisdom of the Father from all eternity, had <hi>his delight in the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of the earth. Isaiah</hi> 53. <hi>He shall see his seed, and he shall see of the Travail of his soul and be satisfied.</hi> You are his seed, you are the Travail of his soul. Christ is content and satisfied to have this portion. And as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man forgets her sorrow when she sees her seed, that a man child is born: so Christ forgets all his pain and trouble, when he sees his seed the travail of his soul.</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) The first fruits were but <hi>few in number,</hi> in comparison of the full number and harvest. So 'tis here, the <hi>Saints</hi> are but few <hi>Thou art the fewest in number of all people,</hi> saith <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Israel:</hi> so may I say to you, you are as <hi>two or three Olives upon the uppermost boughs, or four or five upon the outmost bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> Gods first fruits are but few. Ah Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, stand still and admire free grace, that thou shouldst be one of this few. Christ doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest himself <hi>to you, and not to the world.</hi> He prayes <hi>for you,</hi> and <hi>not for the world,</hi> you are a peculiar people to him. O what a little flock of kids hath Christ, in comparison of the herds
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62321:69"/>
and droves, and swarms that <hi>Satan</hi> drives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to destruction! and art thou one of that number that stand with the lamb upon mount <hi>Sion?</hi> O how shouldst thou cause the praises of the Lord to be heard? they are but few of the number of mankind that are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into this grace wherein you stand. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as you have special favor from God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the praise of God.</p>
            <p>(Thirdly,) The first fruits were <hi>holy to the Lord.</hi> These God did reserve for himself, as it were, for his own eating. As you know, the first fruits are preserved for to be presented to Kings at their table for their eating. So are you. Thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Know ye that the man that is Godly, God hath set apart for himself. God</hi> sayes as it were, set this man by for me. <hi>God</hi> says of his sirst fruits, these shall be set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side for me. These shall be mine, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. As God would put a special honor upon the <hi>Sabbath day</hi> above all other dayes, because up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this day he rested from his Labor: so you are the honor of all the Creation: because you are a people that God hath set apart for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Ah Brethren, here is your dignity and priviledge above all people, that you are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate to the Lord: that you have special rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him. This makes you to be above all other people, because the <hi>Sun</hi> of Gods favor shines peculiarly upon you.</p>
            <p>(Fourthly,) The first fruits were to be <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into the Sanctuary, Deut.</hi> 26. <hi>God</hi> had in his Temple, the Chambers into which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62321:69"/>
was to be gathered the first fruits, as peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dedicated unto God. So we read, in <hi>Neh.</hi> 12. 44. Thus you are Gods first fruits. And God will gather his first fruits into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, into his glory shortly. He shall gather <hi>his wheat into his garner, Math.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 30. The husbandman there, (who is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than God himself) he speaks to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that they should let alone the tares for a season, and <hi>in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, gather you together first the Tares, and bind them in bundles, and burn them but gather the wheat into my Barn.</hi> This harvest is the end of the world: and the angels are the reapers; and heaven is the barn; and you are the fruits, and God will send shortly, and gather you into his barn; when the wicked shall be turned into hell in bundles, they shall be cast into <hi>Tophet;</hi> but you shall be gathered into Gods barn; into his glory. God do but stay awhile till the fruits be ripe and ready, and then you shall be all brought safe into his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury.</p>
            <p>(Fifthly,) The first fruits were to be set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord <hi>as a monument of his faithfulness, Deut.</hi> 26. 1. &amp;c. Where you may observe these particulars. First, The first fruits, they were to be presented before the Lord as a <hi>thank-offering,</hi> so you. Secondly, The first fruits were to be brought <hi>to the priest,</hi> though you are the first fruits, yet you can expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God but at the hands of the priest, the Lord Jesus Christ. Thirdly, They were to be offered up <hi>with a thankful acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62321:70"/>
of Gods mercy,</hi> and their former misery, the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the Lord thy God; and thou shalt speak and say, <hi>A Syrian ready to perish was my Father, and he went down into Egypt and sojourned there with a few, and became there a Nation great, mighty, and populous.</hi> Fourthly, They were to be set before the Lord <hi>as a monument</hi> of his faithfulness: thus beleivers, my Brethren, they shall be taken by Christ, and presented by him unto God as a monument of his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>And thou shall profess before the Lord thy God, I am indeed come unto the Country concerning which the Lord sware unto me:</hi> surely the Lord is faithful in all that he hath promised: and there hath not one word failed of all that he hath said by the mouth of all his prophets.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>You are the remnant of escape,</hi> 'tis <hi>Ezrahs</hi> phrase. Brethren, you know that all mankind was interested in <hi>Adam:</hi> all in one common bottom. <hi>Adam</hi> miscarryed and so all mankind is shipwracked at once. And O how few are the number of those that escape! and art thou one of them? O how should you bless the Lord! methinks, you that God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of all the kindreds of the earth, you should run to God, as the several messengers to <hi>Job, Thy Sons and thy Daughters were eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking wine, and the house fell upon them, and they are dead; and I onely am e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped to tell thee.</hi> So should you say, oh so many of the <hi>Tribes</hi> of the earth are famished,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62321:70"/>
and I am lest alone to tell thee: to praise thee. O methinks so should the redeemed of the Lord compass him about. O methinks I should see you in the posture of those redeemed, lifting up your voices together as the voice of many waters. Oh Christians, look back to your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bondage.

               </gap> have made your escape, and now lift up the praise of your Redeemer. How should you stand upon the brink and look down into the horrible pit from which God hath plucked you! Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, you all suffered in that common ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack; yet, as in the voyage of <hi>Paul,</hi> they all escaped safe to land, so God hath ordered you, that all that were with Jesus Christ are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped. O methinks you are like the world full of corn, and in comes <hi>Satan,</hi> and mows down whole swarfs, and you are left as a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ear here and there upon a ridge. O re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

O while you see the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> drowned upon the shore and you escaped, how should you be much in praising the Lord? the deluge is coming down upon the world, and but one Ark of men shall be saved.

The <hi>archers have shot at thee, yet they have not hurt thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shall I particularize the mercies of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Taunton?</hi> why, consider he hath been a <hi>Savior</hi> to you: a <hi>shepheard</hi> to you: a <hi>keeper</hi> to you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He hath been a <hi>Savior</hi> to you. He hath saved your throats from the <hi>sword,</hi> your habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the <hi>flames,</hi> your lives from the <hi>plague</hi> your persons from the <hi>prison.</hi> (1.) He hath saved your Throat from the sword, have you forgotten that you were a people devoted to destruction, by the sons of violence? but <hi>God</hi> disappointed them and gave you your lives for a prey.</p>

            <p n="3">(3.) Your <hi>lives</hi> from the plague. It hath been devoured by the plague heretofore, and yet it hath not devoured you. How eminently hath God preserved you in this place in the time of common calamity that hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others. O think not that it was because those were greater sinners than are in <hi>Taunton:</hi> No, but because God hath a peculiar intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of saving you. Yet I say to you as <hi>Christ</hi>

            <p>(4.) Your persons from the prison. How often hath God preserved you? he hath been like the cloud upon Israel: and <hi>upon all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there hath been a defence.</hi> Once indeed some of you have tasted of a prison: but what a mercy was it, that it was but once? I might tell you what a mercy 'tis to you, that you have not been troubled with the <hi>prelates Courts.</hi> but,</p>
            <p>Secondly, God hath been <hi>a shepheard</hi> to you. Therefore you have not wanted. VVho is it that drives you by the still waters, though you are <hi>as a lamb in a large place,</hi> 'tis because God is your shepheard VVhence is it that you lye down in green pastures? 'tis because God is your shepheard. How hath God provided for you formerly and of late?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God hath been <hi>a keeper</hi> to you. VVhen you were sent to prison God did keep you. O do not forget the mercies of a prison. I beleive, that of all the passages of our lives, many of us have no such experience of Gods mercy as in a prison. O the provision that God did make for us there! O the constant meals, the sweet meals that God did make for us there.</p>
            <p>Brethren now let us thankfully <hi>commemorate</hi> all these mercies. Let me call upon you as the Psalmist, <hi>rejoyce in the Lord, ye righteous;</hi> and again <hi>rejoyce O ye people,</hi> let your voyce be heard on high. Let us <hi>worship and fall

            </p>
            <p>Brethren, I must needs commend the Grace of God to me this day, in making me the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of such news to you as this is. I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to bring you this news, it is for angels to bring this news, they were sent with this mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, as you see; yet <hi>God</hi> hath been pleased to send me as a Messenger with these tidings to you. Now I shall shew you that this is the best news that ever came to the ears of man, and that.</p>
            <p>First, If you consider the <hi>deplorable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> that he found man in.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you consider what <hi>a great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:62321:74"/>
he hath wrought for man.</p>
            <p>First, If you consider <hi>the deplorable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> that he found us in, we were all gone out of the way: we had fal'n among theeves; and between sin and Satan, we were robbed and wounded: and this <hi>Samaritan</hi> found us, and he cured us, and it cost him no less than his own blood. So desperate a disease is sin, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will cure us, but the death of Christ. He found us shut up in sin, and were not able to get out; and then he roll'd away the stone for us, and knock'd off our fetters, and wrought deliverance for us. This was the misery of mans condition, that he was in a helpless con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. There was no possibility for us ever to recover our selves. Neither was there help in any other, beside Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. Heaven nor earth could not find out a way to deliver man, till God found out a way. And because heaven and earth could not find out a way, God and man must come together; and as he was God he must satisfie; and as he was man he must suffer; and so we must come out. He found us stinking in our grave as he did <hi>Lazarus.</hi> The stinking carrion doth not stink more than we did when Christ found us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you consider what a <hi>great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> he hath wrought for us. This will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if you consider <hi>from what</hi> he hath saved us; and <hi>how</hi> he hath saved us.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>From what he hath saved us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, From the <hi>Roaring-Lion.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, From the <hi>King of terrors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>From the roaring Lion.</hi> So is our <hi>adversary,</hi> the Devil called, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. This is he that Christ hath delivered us from. We were all in the Paw of this lion, and Christ came and delivered us from him. This is the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> that slew the lion, and the bear, and saved us, when we were like to be destroyed. When Satan did think to triumph over Christ, then did Christ triumph over him. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. All the powers of hell did combine together, and labored to give Christ the overthrow; they had brought him to the cross, and there triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, and thought that then they had done all; and yet then did he overthrow them. Oh! what a mercy is this, to be delivered (not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but) from the <hi>spiritual Egypt! Col.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Who hath delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from the power of darkness</hi> &amp;c. My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we were fast shut up in prison, in the prison of which Satan was the Jaylor: and there was no possibility of getting loose from him. We were laid up as slaves under him, and were led <hi>captive by him at his will.</hi> Now what praise do we owe to him, that hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from such a Tyrant as this! this is our deliverance, (<hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18.) to be turned <hi>from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> This hath Christ done for us: he hath delivered us from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of <hi>Satan.</hi> We were once in his family, and did his work, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2, 3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>They are called the rulers of the darkness of this world.</hi> That is, poor ignorant souls,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62321:75"/>
that were lying in our ignorance. And that not some of us onely, but all of us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>From our raging lusts.</hi> As from the slavery of Satan, so from the dominion of sin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. By Christ we are freed from the dominion of sin. My brethren, Christ doth not onely free us from the <hi>damnation,</hi> but from the, <hi>dominion</hi> of sin. To be the servant of sin, is a most miserable slavery. What a mercy is it to be delivered from a master, whose work is <hi>drudgery;</hi> and whose wages is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction!</hi> such a one is Satan. Would it not have pittied us to have seen the <hi>poor man in the Gospel,</hi> going up and down among the tombs, and doing nothing but cutting and wounding himself? such a one is every unsanctified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: they go up and down wounding of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And though they feel not their wounds that sin gives them, yet there is a day coming, when (conscience being awakened) they will seel it. Do you know, my brethren, what the work is that sin sets us upon? it is to destroy our selves, <hi>John</hi> 8. the <hi>Jews,</hi> they plead that they were <hi>free;</hi> and what did our <hi>Savior</hi> tell them of making them sree? Oh! but they were servants to their lusts, which was the greatest slavery, my brethren, to be under the power of a mans lusts, is a most perfect slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Do but look upon a sinner that hath an enlightned conscience, and see how he rends and tears, and is in a worse condition than the most woofull galley-slave that is in the world. And then he vows and covenants against his sin, and then his sin eggs him on again, and then to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62321:76"/>
his conscience fals upon him. Oh, this is a sad condition! now this Christ hath delivered us from. Sin will <hi>be in us,</hi> but Christ hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised that it shall not <hi>raign in us.</hi> And this is the blessed deliverance he hath wrought in us; and this he will perfect at the last day. And by the way, you may see and try whether you have any part in Christ or no. Why how may we know it? are you delivered from your sins? though sin be in you, is it there against your consent? if so, you are they whom Christ dyed for. But if it be in you in its dominion, you have no part nor portion in this matter. A man were better be the most perfect galley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave in the world, than to be under the power of sin. Now this Christ hath delivered you from.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the slaming furnace.</hi> This is another thing that Christ hath delivered you from.

the <hi>Terrors of conscience,</hi> how do they wish for death, that they might know what their torment is? as <hi>Spira,</hi> and <hi>William Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi> Oh, can you tell what this terrible fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace is? this is that which Christ, hath delivered us from. When I consider what this gul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>not but wonder at my own and others stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, that we are not ever! ever, praising the Lord! if the terror of the Lord be so great, that when he doth let out but a drop of it upon a poor creature, how terrible is all that wrath, the treasure of that wrath that is laid up for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly! <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. 8. 9. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 3. Those wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rich men, there, they had, as they thought, heaped up treasures of riches by oppressing the poor: but the <hi>Apostle</hi> tels them they heaped up <hi>treasures of wrath.</hi> And this we were all born to, had not Christ cut off the entail. O man, woman, canst think of burning for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the fire of the Lords wrath, and not be praising the Lord that thou art yet out of hell? O bless the Lord, that delivered thee from so great a death: and hath endured such torments that thou mayst be set free. He did bear the rod of <hi>Gods</hi> wrath that thou mayst be saved to all eternity. If Christ had not been, where had we been! as the Son of God, coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the three children, saved them from bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; so 'tis here: 'tis Christs coming hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed us from burning in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> surnace. How terrible this furnace is, you may see, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 10. <hi>The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture into the cup of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> indignation, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62321:77"/>
he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the lamb: and the smoak of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ascendeth up for ever and ever. And they have no rest day nor night.</hi> O methinks the very sight of this surnace at a distance should startle our Souls, and make us list up our hands, and eyes, and souls and praise the Lord. O methinks we that are the redeemed of the Lord, we should stand together about the pit, and look down, and list up our hearts and praise the Lord.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>From the King of terrors.</hi> He hath saved you, as from the <hi>Devil,</hi> so from <hi>Death.</hi> You know death is the mortal enemy of man, 'tis his great and last enemy: and now this enemy hath Christ destroyed, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us from. And that both from the <hi>sting</hi> and <hi>victory</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>(First,) <hi>From the sting of death.</hi> He hath not delivered us from the <hi>stroke</hi> of death, but he hath from the <hi>sting</hi> of death. When the sting is out, the serpent may <hi>hisse,</hi> but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>sting.</hi> Death will put you into the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which Christ hath provided for you: so that death now is become desirable, now there is beauty in it. There is no friend can do that for you, that death can do. It will at once deliver you from sin and Satan, and give you a possession in heaven. The <hi>Apostle,</hi> looking upon death through Christ, longs for death: <hi>hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a desire to depart</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. This great robber, through Christ is become our greatest gain. That which would have marr'd us for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62321:77"/>
ever, will now make us for ever. O that this <hi>King of terrors</hi> should become desirable, what a mercy is this! O my beloved, did you know what the terrors of death be to an enlightned sinner, you would account it a great priviledge to be sree from the sting of death. When all his comforts are taking their everlasting fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of him, you would account it a great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation then. When he shall feel death putting in his cold hands, and pulling out his heart, when he s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ail see his house of his body falling down about his ears, and he cannot stay there any longer: and he sees the hell-hounds stand about him and waiting upon him to carry him to Hell, O what horror doth this work upon his heart! this hath Christ delivered us from. Death hath lest its sting in Christ, it can hurt us no longer.</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) <hi>From the victory of death.</hi> It is true we must lye in the grave for some time; yet Christ will fetch us thence, in <hi>John.</hi> 6. He promiseth no lesse than four <hi>times, I will raise them up at the last day.</hi> And this is the fruit of his purchase, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 14. Christs resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is a certain pledge of ours, so 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Therefore let us not fear death, but embrace it with comfort: for death cannot touch our souls: it cannot deliver us over into the <hi>second death. He that overcometh, shall not be hurt of the second death.</hi> Therefore let us not fear death, but let our <hi>slesh rest in hope.</hi> When we dye, we may commit our bodies to the dust with comfort: it cannot hurt our souls; and it shall keep our bodies but a little while neither.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62321:78"/>
God will receive our souls immediately; &amp; our bodies after a little while. How doth <hi>Job</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himself in this? <hi>I know that my redeemer liveth; and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my slesh shall I see God,</hi> &amp;c. Thus may we triumph over death, that in this flesh we shall see God. And though death for the present do make such work upon us, and cast us into the grave, yet the earth will be but the mould wherein we shall receive a glorious body, so that death shall conduce to our great advantage. This is no little victory, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to triumph with the <hi>Apostle. O death, where is thy victory?</hi> This is no small privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Bless your redeemer for this priviledge. VVhat a priviledge well this be, when all the Sons and daughters of God shall be brought sorth and made to stand up before him? then it shall appear that the grave was not able to hold them. Then will they triumph, and sing songs of salvation, when they shall set their feet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their last enemy, death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It will appear what blessed news this is, if you consider, <hi>how he hath saved you.</hi> He hath saved you two ways, by <hi>might,</hi> and by <hi>merit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>irst, <hi>By merit,</hi> Brethren, your salvation cost your redeemer dear, no less a price than his own invaluable blood. O believer, look upon thy self, art not thou a worthless thing to be redeemed with the price of Christs blood? O how should we admire the goodness of Christ here? we are not worthy that Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>end one of his <hi>thoughts</hi> upon us, much
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62321:78"/>
less that he should spend his <hi>blood</hi> for us.</p>
            <p>Seconly, <hi>By might,</hi> my brethren, it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely requisite for our salvation, that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. as he should be of infinite <hi>merit,</hi> so of infinite <hi>might.</hi> If he had not been of infinite <hi>merit,</hi> he could never have been purchaser of heaven for us. The soul of one man is more worth than a whole world: and then what worth or value must that be of, that is able to buy a world of souls? and yet this purchaser must be able to buy heaven too: and this hath Christ done for us. Could heaven and earth have done this? no, no, it would have broken them all if they had done it. But now Christ hath done all for us: and therefore he must be of insinite merit. And not infinite in merit onely but might too: for he was to bear all the wrath of God, and to bring us off with victory. If the wrath of Gods finger be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, that it makes poor creatures to cry out under it, what is the wrath of his loins? and if the wrath of God against one man is so great, what is his wrath against so many men?</p>
            <p>VVhen the price was laid down, the devil would not yield up his hold, till Christ must come and cast him down, and pluck us from him. And therefore it was necessary that our redeemer should be of infinite power. <hi>He hath destroyed him that had the power of death, that is the devil.</hi> Ah brethren, we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lord Jesus Christ upon the cross, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself as <hi>Sampson</hi> did, and pulling down the house about his enemies, and carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the posts and all, and setting us free. This is our <hi>Sampson</hi> that hath carryed all away, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62321:79"/>
destroyed our enemies for us. The price was sufficient to satisfie the justice of God for us: but when the price was paid, and paid to God; then Satan would not let us go: and therefore he must be overcome too.</p>
            <p>First <hi>Use,</hi> Is it such blessed news that to us is born a Savior? then my brethren, let this stir you up to <hi>Joy and thankfulness</hi> for this sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. O let me hear you say with <hi>Mary, my soul doth magnifie the Lord, my Spirit hath rejoyced in God my Savior, Luke</hi> 1. 46. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, methinks you should now meet your redeemer with songs of salvation. Methinks you should come forth to meet him, as they did <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> when they returned from their victory, <hi>the women came out, singing and dancing</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and they answered one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as they played, saying,</hi> Saul <hi>hath slain his thousands, and</hi> David <hi>his ten thousands.</hi> Thus should you meet your Redeemer. You should go forth to meet him as <hi>Miriam</hi> and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with her with timbrels and with dancings, <hi>and sing unto the Lord, Exod.</hi> 15. 20. 21. Oh brethren, with what joyful heart should you welcome Jesus Christ your Savior! this is glad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>idings to all them that are saved by him. Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be God that giveth us cause to triumph in him. 'Tis true, in many other things it goes sad with us: but here is cause always for us to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o triumph in Christ, for the Spiritual delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that he hath wrought for you; which is a sure pledge that Christ will deliver you in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward respects. How blessed a time was the year of <hi>Jubile</hi> to the slaves that were in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62321:79"/>
how did they reckon every day and week till it came? how glad was that <hi>sound</hi> that sounded their deliverance? methinks I see the prison doors open, and the prisoners running out and crying, <hi>salvation to our God.</hi> O me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks nothing but the songs of salvation should be heard in your tabernacles. O let not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining be heard for outward calamities. VVhat are those outward flea-bitings to that which our Savior hath delivered us from? go home and blesse the Lord: and what ever ill news you hear, let this comfort your heart that Christ hath made such a deliverance for you.</p>
            <p>Second <hi>Use,</hi> Is it such blessed news &amp;c. then this <hi>reproves our unthankfulness for Christ,</hi> and the news of Christ in the Gospel. Oh brethren, how is it that the praise of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer is no more in our hearts, and no more heard in our mouths? how is it that we can be so unmindful of, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>thankful for this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? hath God sent us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Saviour, and shall not we be thankful for him? It is a great sin to be unthankful for his <hi>creatures;</hi> but how much more to be unthankful for his <hi>Christ?</hi> he hath given you Christ, and what can he give you more? how is it that you are so seldome in blessing the Lord for this mercy? <hi>bless the Lord, O my soul,</hi> (saith <hi>David) and forget not all his benefits:</hi> that is, none of his benefits. If God had given you all this worlds goods, and had not given you <hi>Christ,</hi> what would it have done for you? what had it been, but a smooth and pleasant way to hell? what if the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62321:80"/>
Lord had given you honor, and made your brethrens sheaf to bow before yours, and had not given you Christ; what good would it have done you? if a man were condemned at <hi>London,</hi> to be hang'd drawn and quartered, and were to be brought down into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to be executed, and all his way should be strowed with rushes, and he attended with Musicians, what would all this have done him? O what should we have done, if Christ had had not step'd in and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ved us! none could have redeemed man but Christ. Heaven and Hell, and the Earth and the Sea would have said it is not in me: all the things in the world could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have satisfied for our sins. Wilt thou look to thy brethren? wilt thou look to the angels; they could not do it. The Spirits of just men made perfect could not save themselves: none could do it but Christ: and can you be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of this? the Heavens and the Earth will be astonished at this, if you are not thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for it.</p>
            <p>There are two things that will heighten this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>in.</p>
            <p>First, Because Christ hath given you <hi>so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny helps</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because thankfulness is <hi>all that he expects</hi> from us.</p>
            <p>First, Because he hath <hi>given us so many helps.</hi> All the calls and invitations of the Gospel are as so many helps to this duty. But more than these, he hath appointed a <hi>special day,</hi> and a <hi>special ordinance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, A <hi>special day.</hi> The <hi>Sabbath day.</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:62321:80"/>
Wherefore was this day changed? but that you may be mindful of this mercy?</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) A <hi>special Ordinance.</hi> The <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> of the Supper</hi> is appointed upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that we might remember this mercy to our souls.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is much aggravated by this, because <hi>this is all that he expects</hi> from you, for all that he hath suffered for you. Christ hath done and suffered beyond all you can conceive, or I can expresse to you: and what Homage doth he now expect from you? nothing but that you should be thankful to him. And will you be unthankful now for this mercy? This is that he expects by way of requital and return, that you be thankful, Had the Lord required some great thing of you, or some hard condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he would have dyed for you and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed you, would you not have done it? and how much more, now he hath done it, and and requires no more but this, that you be thankful? had you lain but one million of years in hell, with what gladness would you have heard that sound, that he would have redeemed you? would you have stood upon the terms? no, no, any terms then should have served.</p>
            <p>Third <hi>Use,</hi> Then prepare <hi>to receive your Saviour.</hi> Oh if he be come, take heed that you receive him in. Let him not complain of you as he did of his native Country-men the <hi>Jews, that he came unto his own,</hi> and <hi>his own received him not.</hi> When this news come, that there was <hi>a Savior born,</hi> one would have
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62321:81"/>
thought that all the world should have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with triumph: but there was no room for him in all the world, but he was thrust out in the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nger. Let it not be so with you.</p>
            <p>Question, But <hi>how shall we receive him?</hi> I shall shew you <hi>whither</hi> and <hi>how.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First. <hi>Whither you shall receive him.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him <hi>into your hearts;</hi> not in your stal, as he was at first, but into your parlour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your hearts. Your parlour, is but a stable. Thou mayst wonder that Christ will accept of thy heart, send the key of your hearts to Christ, let him take his choice where to lye: give him the upper room in your hearts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>How,</hi> or <hi>after what manner</hi> you should <hi>receive</hi> him.</p>
            <p>(First,) As the <hi>Centurion</hi> did, <hi>humbly. I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof.</hi> So should you receive him, with a deep sence of your everlasting unworthiness. Receive him with a lively sence of your sins, that you have wronged him. This is a right receiving of Christ, when he is received peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently. Thus did that woman entertain him: and Christ liked better of this, than of the <hi>Pharisce. Luke</hi> 7. She received Christ in her heart. This is the entertainment, that he is well pleased with: receive him thus, and this will be acceptable to him. Though thou hast nothing at all in thee, but the sence of thy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingness, Christ will be sure to accept of this.</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) Receive him, as <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>cheus</hi> did, <hi>Joyfully,</hi> When Christ call'd him down from
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62321:81"/>
the tree, and told him that salvation was come to his house, how glad was the mans heart? <hi>Luke</hi> 19. O methinks I see with what unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joy he received him. He thought not of <hi>Christ's</hi> coming to his house: his highest ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was that he might have a sight of <hi>Christ:</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> sees and takes notice of it, and tels him that <hi>Salvation was come to his house.</hi> O methinks, I should see thee looking as he did, when <hi>Christ</hi> will come this way where thou art. Why, now he is come in his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, now receive him joyfully, take him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy heart. Let thy joy break out, as the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> did; or as when the Lord broke up the fountain of the great deep. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, one would think, that one should need no arguments to perswade miserable captives to receive a <hi>Savior.</hi> O how welcome would such offers be to them that are in captivity? Brethren, if ever you have seen your lost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition without <hi>Christ,</hi> you cannot but receive him when he is offered to you. O methinks this Name of <hi>JESUS</hi> should be marrow to your bones, and wine to your hearts, and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick to your ears. Oh as God hath, so do you. give him <hi>a name above every name.</hi> This bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed name, the name of <hi>Jesus,</hi> methinks it should be as oynment poured forth upon you, giving a sweet smell.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. Receive him as old <hi>Simeon</hi> did, <hi>believingly.</hi> You must clasp the arms of your faith about him. O how sweetly did old <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:62321:82"/>
clasp him in his arms? but you must think that he did clasp him more gladly in his heart. If you will but entertain him, Christ and Salvation come to every one in this house.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Take him <hi>submissively.</hi> So as to be subject to him. He hath wrought out Salvation for you; therefore let him rule over you.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Application</hi> (<hi>my Brethren</hi>) is unto you. If <hi>God</hi> do expect that his people should do more than others, see that you do accordingly.

But 'tis not <hi>three years,</hi> but <hi>threescore years</hi> that <hi>God</hi> hath come wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on <hi>Taunton,</hi> notwithstanding all their praying, and their great unprositableness for the greatest part of them. I beseech you think of it. Is it a little mercy? there are many of you that have been <hi>born</hi> and <hi>bred</hi> under the powerful preaching of the Gospel. Look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many other places, and how many may you see left to <hi>blind guides?</hi> Oh, bless God that you have not been bred up under such
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62321:86"/>
Ministers, and in such places. It was the lot of many, and it might have been your lot to have been brought up there.</p>
            <p>How many places may you look upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, where there have been excellent <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi> and they have been flocked to from all about: but <hi>God</hi> hath put out those lights, and now if you come there, you shall scarce find the very <hi>foot steps</hi> of Religion. And <hi>God</hi> might have done so to you, but <hi>God</hi> hath sent you one Minister after another, one out of one Country, another out of another for you. Oh blesse the <hi>Lord</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>In the powerful success of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</hi> True it is, and sadly to be bewailed, the Gospel hath not had so desired an efficacy: but however, we must not forget Gods signal and singular mercy to this place, in that he hath brought <hi>so many</hi> to the profession of his Gospel. Oh, how many Parishes are there where professors are so thin, that they are for <hi>signs</hi> and <hi>wonders,</hi> to be pointed at? Oh bless the <hi>Lord</hi> that he hath cast <hi>your lines</hi> in that place, where there are so many to strengthen your hands. How doth <hi>David</hi> bemoan himself in the want of this mercy, that he dwelt in the tents of <hi>Kedar!</hi> you might have lived out in those places and Parishes where you might have had none to help you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>In the peace and unity of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.</hi> Here in <hi>God</hi> hath been singular in his mercy. This is a mercy not slightly to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued. Do but look abroad into other Cities and <hi>Towns,</hi> and see what work there hath been
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62321:86"/>
by the breaches that have been made one upon another. Oh, do but consider the mischief of <hi>strife</hi> and <hi>contention,</hi> and you will be raised to praise, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Where envying and strife is, there is every evil work.</hi> Oh blesse the Lord that the hearts of believers have been made one in this place, <hi>Psal.</hi> 133. 1. <hi>How good and beautiful is it to see Brethren dwell together in unity?</hi> blesse the <hi>Lord</hi> you his people, because the <hi>Lord</hi> hath <hi>blessed his people with peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>In the plenty and variety of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision.</hi> Oh remember this this day, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not how <hi>God</hi> hath provided for you all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long: and that at that day, when you did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that all was cut off. How little did we dream of such a mercy? had any told us then of these things, we should have replied as that Lord did, <hi>behold if the Lord would make win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in heaven might this thing be?</hi> Ah Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, should it have been told you before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand that for so many years after that <hi>fatal day</hi> you should spend so many <hi>Sabbaths</hi> in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>God,</hi> and so many <hi>Sermons</hi> in one Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath and so many <hi>Ministers</hi> sent to you, and so many <hi>Sacraments</hi> to feed you as you have had, you would have been ready to say, <hi>if the Lord should open windows in heaven could this thing be?</hi> and yet all this <hi>God</hi> hath done for you.

            <p>Fifthly, <hi>In the strange preservation of your Liberty.</hi> Herein hath <hi>God</hi> been singular in his mercy to you; hath not <hi>Christ</hi> fulfilled his word to you, <hi>he that loseth his life for my sake,</hi> (so he that loseth his liberty for my sake) <hi>shall

            <p>Consider he hath made you, <hi>the people of his choice. The pillars of his name. The vessels of his glory. The Temples of his presence. The Trumpets of his praise.

               </gap>he <hi>Lord</hi> indeed were I sure that all this were mine. How shall I know that this is my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</p>
            <p>Now lest <hi>unbeleif</hi> and distrust should damp your Joy, and spoyl your work of praise, let me shew you to whom I speak: and let you know, how you may know that you are those that I speak to. Let me shew you in two marks, whereby you may come certainly to know it: you may know it by your <hi>Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and by your <hi>Comforts.</hi> What is your chief care and your chief comfort? look upon your selves and judge of your selves by these two marks.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>By your Cares.</hi> Brethren, what is the chief care of your heart? what is it that lies with most weight upon your heart? or that you do prosecute with most care in your life? you are the people of God if this be your great care, to <hi>please God, eschew sin,</hi> and <hi>save your selves.</hi> If this be your great care, then you are the men. Methinks this should not be so hard to be discerned. Dost thou not know what is the <hi>main scope</hi> and drift of thy life?</p>
            <p>First, <hi>To please God.</hi> If this be your great endeavour whether you are present or absent, alone or in company, that you may please God, this is the true disposition of Gods servants. Do you study to watch over your hearts as in Gods sight? and carry it in your lives as of sincerity and in the sight of God? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. and 2. 17. Is your labor of love, and work of saith (that is, working faith) and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62321:89"/>
your patience of hope (in bearing the Crosse) not in vain-glory but in sincerity? do you stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy so to walk as to approve your hearts to God, that you endeavor to please him? that you might do those things that are pleasing in his sight? then know and be assured that you are the people to whom this doth belong. If God say well done, you have your hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, let the world say what they will to you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>To <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>chew sin.</hi> This was <hi>Jobs</hi> character, that he was a man <hi>fearing God and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>chewing sin, Job</hi> 1. 8. This was <hi>Davids</hi> mark, that he did <hi>not regard iniquity in his heart Psalm</hi> 66. 8. This was that did comfort <hi>Paul,</hi> as the sure evidence of his sincerity, though he did evil many times, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with temptation, yet <hi>he allowed it not, Rom.</hi> 7. 18. Brethren, what is your greatest fear? do you study <hi>duty</hi> more than <hi>safty?</hi> do you fear <hi>sin</hi> more than <hi>danger?</hi> do you keep up a constant watch against sin, all sin, little sins, secret sins, heart sins, especially are you afraid of your <hi>constitution</hi>-sin, your sweet sin? And do you prosecute against this with double diligence?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>To save your souls.</hi> This was <hi>Pauls</hi> care, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. latter end. <hi>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly: so fight I, not as one that be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62321:90"/>
come short of that salvation, that he had preached to others. So <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13, 14. <hi>One thing I do — I press toward the mark for the price of the high-calling.</hi> His eye was upon the Crown of Life. And this is so far from <hi>sinful mercenariness,</hi> that 'tis made the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eternal Life: that they are such who <hi>by patient continua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ce in well doing, seek for glory honor, immortality; eternal Life, Rom.</hi> 2. 7. Now Brethren, what say you to this? what is your great care, and what is your great enquiry that you enquire after? Is it what shall I do to be rich or great? Is it with the carnal compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>who will shew us any good?</hi> any outward good, a good bargain or the like, or with him, <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</hi> And with the convert in the <hi>Acts, Sir, what must I do to be saved?</hi> howshall I secure my soul? what can you say to this! <hi>Do you first and above all seek the Kingdom of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, As you may know it by your cares. so <hi>by your comforts.</hi> Is it the great comfort of your lives to <hi>converse with God?</hi> and is he your portion and treasure? a mans treasure may be known by his heart. Is it that that doth yeild the sweetest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and content to your hearts? are your sweetest hours, the hours that you spend with <hi>God?</hi> do you never more enjoy your selves, than when you most enjoy <hi>God.</hi> And is this your ordinary frame, except in a time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or under desertion? and when 'tis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise are you out of your center, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be quiet till you be otherwise? Is <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:62321:90"/>
your refuge and riches, your portion, your principal choice, your Treasure? and do you bless your selves in him? can you say there is more gladness in your hearts, in the favor and enjoyment of God, than when <hi>the Corn and Wine and Oyl increaseth?</hi> do you indeed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>a day in his Courts,</hi> before <hi>a thousand</hi> in the pleasures of the wicked, <hi>and tents of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi> If it be thus with you <hi>habitually,</hi> then you bear upon you the certain characters of Gods people. And rejoyce you with <hi>joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable and full of glory,</hi> and boast your selves in him: for all the things that I shall speak of, belong to you. And now if you find it thus with you, then apply to your selves these following comforts. And blesse your selves in your God, he hath done more for you, than for any others.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>You are the people of his choice,</hi> when others are but the <hi>refuse.</hi> O my Brethren, I may say to you, as <hi>God</hi> said to <hi>Israel</hi> by <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 7. 6. <hi>For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God, the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people to himself, above all people of the earth.</hi> This is your case, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you Christians, erect you faith, and let not your consideration be idle. Hear him speaking thus to you, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5. <hi>You shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above</hi> all <hi>people, for</hi> all <hi>the earth is mine.</hi> Ah, beloved I must call upon you to rejoyce in the Lord: and again must I call upon you to rejoyce: and lift up your heads before the Lord; you are the chosen vessels of the Lord. What! will

you hear these things with low Affections and common hearts. Do you believe or do you not? If you do not, why are you called <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?</hi> If you do, Oh what an extasie of Joy should your hearts be raised too? Oh look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the miserable condition of the perishing world, the reprobate world! look down, and see what burnings do betide them! better for them that they had never been born. And shall it but a little affect you that <hi>God</hi> hath se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated <hi>you</hi> from them all? I may say of you, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth with thankfulness of his <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>We are bound to give thanks to God for you Brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning chosen you to Salvation.</hi> Oh how should you bless the Lord for his <hi>eternal purpose,</hi> which he purposed toward you, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4.

Oh my brethren, I may say of you, of every one of you that are believers, as God speak concerning <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 9. 15. <hi>You are chosen vessels to bear Gods name before the world.</hi> Alas! for others! of how little use are they in the world? this is a miserable case to be of no use; better to have <hi>no being</hi> than to be of <hi>no use.</hi> How contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible doth the <hi>Lord</hi> speak of that wicked King <hi>Coniah?</hi> he calls him a <hi>despised broken Idol.</hi> Such a kind of one is every unsanctified person, they are but as broken useless pot-sheards: let them be so great as they will, yea they are worse than for no purpose, they are for bad purposes.

            <p>Thirdly, You are <hi>the vessels of his glory,</hi> when others are the vessels of his <hi>wrath,</hi> you are not as others, vessels of wood and stone; but you are all vessels of <hi>gold and silver:</hi> vessels not to <hi>dishonor,</hi> but to <hi>honor.</hi> Vessels <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and made meet for the Masters use, and prepared for every good work,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20, 21.

and whom he will he hardeneth. Hath not the potter power over the clay to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor? What if God willing to shew his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much long suffering the vessels of wrath sitted to destruction: and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afore prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto glory?</hi> Ah brethren, when others are vessels of wrath sitted to destruction, you are vessels of mercy, vessels of glory made for this blessed use and service that you may be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of <hi>Gods</hi> glory and mercy before the world: that <hi>God</hi> may take you and single you out at the great day, when you shall be seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a man severeth the <hi>sheep from the goats. God</hi> shall take you and single you out before the world, and tell the world, what a <hi>God</hi> can do for a <hi>poor</hi> creature: to make you the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his magnificence and bounty, to shew how he could exalt the dust of the earth. This is the use you serve for in the world. Do not live as if you were made for little things, and for little use: you are made for this use, that you should be vessels prepared to have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite fulness of God pouring into you, as ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels standing by for the same purpose, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over to all eternity. When you shall be ever full and running over with the glory of <hi>God.</hi> When the <hi>Al-sufficiency of God</hi> shall be for ever emptying it self into you. How is it that <hi>God</hi> hears no more of you? hath he done so for any other? no, he hath prepared them for vessels of wrath on whom he will be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his wrath to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

What! art thou of no meaner use then this to be a <hi>habitation of God through the spirit?</hi> What! art thou a Temple for God to dwell in? will God make of this Soul a Temple, where all

manner of lusts have dwelt? and say of thy soul, here will I dwell for ever, this is my rest for I have desired it? Oh, adore the riches of Gods condescending grace! others are the vessels of uncleanness, the coffins of rottenness, in whom <hi>Satan</hi> hath set up his throne, 'tis true of every wicked man, what God sayes of <hi>Coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Jer.</hi> 22. 28. <hi>He is a vessel wherein is no pleasure,</hi> He is a vessel of the most noisome fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyness in the world.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, You are <hi>the trumpets of his praise,</hi> when others are the instruments of <hi>unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi> O what base use are the others put too, in their bonds of wickedness? to the worst of drudgery. They are the vessels of sin, and slaves of Satan, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. a miserable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice! this is a miserable Master indeed! none have such miserable lives as those who have the work of sin to do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>They labor and sweat all their days to pile up faggots and fewel, pile upon pile, to fill <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> for their own burning.

            <p>Sixthly, <hi>You are the men of his Counsel,</hi> when others are <hi>strangers</hi> and aliens. You are no more foreigners and strangers, but fellow Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and of the houshold of God. You are the attendants of his person, you are of his privy Counsel. You are the friends of God. This was <hi>Abrahams</hi> priviledge, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. That he was called the <hi>friend of God.</hi> Brethren, all the long and magnificent titles of all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of the Earth do not signifie half so much as this that I am speaking to you. Now this is your prerogative. Henceforth I call you not servants but friends: and why so? because you are the men of his Counsel. The servant knoweth not what his Lord doth, but whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have heard of the Father that have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto you. Herein <hi>Christ</hi> hath put a marvellous distinction between you and the men of the world, I may say of you as <hi>Christ</hi> of them, <hi>blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear. The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him. So Psa.</hi> 147. <hi>He sheweth his word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>&amp; his statutes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

            <p>Seventhly, <hi>You are the Jewels of his Crown,</hi> when others are but the <hi>drosse</hi> and lumber. <hi>And they shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts in the day when I make up my Jewels, Mal.</hi> 3. 17.

But this is but little that you should be your Ministers Crown: I tell you, you are <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Crown and glory, Isa.</hi> 62. 3. <hi>Thou shalt also be a Crown of glory, in the hand of the Lord, and a Royal diadem in the hand of thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eightly, <hi>You are the inheritors of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> when others are the <hi>sons of perdition, Luk.</hi> 12. 32. <hi>Fear not little flock 'tis your Fathers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom, So come ye blessed of my Father inherit the Kingdome prepared for you.</hi> Who can utter the sweetness of that promise? 'tis our Saviors parting promise to his disciples at his last sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 28. 29, 30. <hi>You are they which have continued with me in my Temptations and I appoint unto you a Kingdome, as my Father hath appointed unto me, that you may eat and drink at my Table in my Kingdom, and sit upon thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> Oh how sweet are these words. Lay the mouth of Faith at these promises, and suck the sweetness of them. Look upon it as a reality,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62321:95"/>
that God prepared for you a Kingdome, 'tis so, why should God go to deceive you? and you may lay your claim to it boldly: God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to see your humble boldness. <hi>The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit beareth witness with our spirits that we are the sons of God, and if Sons, then heirs; joynt heirs with Christ: Heirs of his Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you look upon your selves <hi>as prisoners,</hi> and so God hath done more for you then he hath for others. Ah Christians, this is the meaning of this day that you might cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the kindness of God to you in prison. O remember and forget not how signally God hath owned you. Brethren, 'tis your privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and mercy that God hath given you hearts to own him in times of danger. And blessed be God he is not behind hand with you; he that owned you in your prison state. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren how hath God owned you in clearing your cause for which you are suffering here? If the Kingdome of heaven be promised to them that suffer for righteousness sake, then sure it is promised to you: for you are suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here upon that account. And then for your call: how sweetly and joyfully did we come hither? though God knows we had not enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into what we entended, as to our subsistance here; yet God sent us all hither joyfully toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and I hope God will send us home as joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully again.</p>
            <p>But let me shew you, in some particulars wherein God hath done more for you then for others, as you are prisoners.</p>
            <p>First, You are <hi>better fed</hi> then others. Who
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62321:95"/>
do live upon the bounty of Gods extraordinary providence like you? may not God almighty speak to you, as the <hi>Apostie</hi> to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9, 7. <hi>Who of you goeth a warfare at his own charges?</hi> VVhen our Saviour sent forth his disciples without scrip or shooes, sayes he, <hi>lacked ye any thing?</hi> they answered, <hi>nothing.</hi> May not we say so? if he say to us, lacked you any thing? we must say no, he hath poured out his kindness upon us. O how sweetly did the holy prophet, think you, rellish every bit of meat when God provided every bit so extraordinarily for him, 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 17. 6. <hi>And the Ravon brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening, God</hi> doth not send it to us by a Raven; but by friends: but all he sends: bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening without our care. And is not God to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in this? you know there is a kind of a Famine abroad, but God will not have it a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine here. VVho ever wants, God will be sure that his prisoners shall not want. As the King took care of <hi>Jeremiah, Jer.</hi> 37. 21. <hi>Then Zedekiah the King commanded, that they should commit Jeremiah to the Court of the prison, and that they should give him dayly a piece of bread out of the Bakers-street untill all the bread in the City was spent.</hi> VVhen <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was in prison, God would be sure that he should not want as long as there was any bread to be had in the City. So God commands concerning his prisoners; though there be a kind of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine abroad, God will not suffer his prisoners to want.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:62321:96"/>Secondly, <hi>You are better taught</hi> than others. VVho is like to you O people, about whose tents the <hi>Mannah</hi> raineth, not every morning onely, but morning and evening: week dayes, and Sabbath dayes, God doth open his door to you, and make every day as a Sabbath to you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>You have more promises</hi> than others. Now there are come in to us a whole shoal of of promises, that we would not not so proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly claim before, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>If when you do well and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 13. 14. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in as much as ye are partakers of Christs sufferings, that when his glory shall be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy. If you be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye, for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you, Jam.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Blessed is the man that endureth Temptation; for when he is tryed he shall receive the Crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. If you suffer with him you shall also raign with him,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Blessed are they that suffer for righteousness sake: for theirs is the Kingdome of heaven. Blessed are you when men shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsly for my name sake, rejoyce and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven, Math.</hi> 5. 10, 11, 12. Time would fail me to go over all those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises that are come in now upon us all at once. Oh we are an unthankfull people, if all these promises do not raise our faith and joy. Is it a light thing my brethren, that you should be heirs of the promises?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:62321:96"/>Fourthly, <hi>God hath hath honored you more</hi> than others. To others with you 'tis gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to believe; but to you 'tis given to suffer for his sake; which the Apostle reckons up as a step higher than others attain to, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 29.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>God hath intrusted you with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> more than others. God hath put more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your hands, than into the hands of any other. Gods glory is trusted morewith the sufferers of Christ than with any others. O be infinitely tender of Gods honor! O see that you love him more than others: praise him more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

            <p>(Secondly,) <hi>Your King is come.</hi> God sends his Ministers to you with that glad newes, that he put in the Prophets mouth, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. 9. <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce greatly O daughter of Zion, behold thy King cometh.</hi> Brethren, this is that which should cause you to rejoyce and shout for joy, that your King is come.

            </p>
            <p>(Thirdly,) <hi>The deliver is come, Rom.</hi> 11. 26. Brethren, I know good news must needs be welcome to you at such a time as this: why hear you then the blesseds news that ever came to the ears of man, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people for unto you is born — a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.</hi> Ah Brethren! that the Savior is come, the deliverer is come this is the blessedst news that ever man heard.

should such as this be received when he comes? how welcome was the news to the captives, that brought the news of their liberty? why, such should be the welcome, that you should give to the news the Gospel brings you of a deliverer. Now is your Jubilee, blessed are the people that hear the <hi>joyful sound Psa.</hi> 89. 15. He alludes to the sound of the Trumpets, in the time of the <hi>Jubilee:</hi> but it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the joyful sound of the Gospel. It is blessed news that Christ the deliver is come.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I am to shew you, <hi>how he is come,</hi> There is a two fold coming of Christ: his <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> and his <hi>glorious</hi> coming. His <hi>glorious</hi> coming is not till hereafter, at the <hi>last day.</hi> This is the coming that he speaks of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7. He speaks of it as if it were present: because 'tis as certain as if it were present. <hi>Every eye shall see him.</hi> But then there is his gracious coming, and that is two fold <hi>corporal,</hi> or <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</hi> His <hi>corporal</hi> coming, in his admirable <hi>Incarnation:</hi> his <hi>spiritual</hi> coming in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel <hi>Invitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(First,) <hi>His corporal coming in his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble incarnation.</hi> And this is blessed news to the world, at this his coming there were a quire of angels to celebrate his praise, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 13, 14. <hi>And suddenly, there was with the angel a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the heavenly host; praising God &amp; saying, glory to Godin the highest, and on Earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> We read that the great and glorious works of God, they are celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the angels. And there are these four great works celebrated by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:62321:99"/>First, <hi>The work of Creation.</hi> So that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Job.</hi> 38. 7. <hi>When the morning stars sang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all the sons of God shouted for Joy.</hi> It is spoken with reference to the Creation, the angels did list up their voices, and sang the praise of their Creator.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The work, of conversion, Luke</hi> 15. 10. <hi>There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.</hi> The work of conversion is a great and admirable work: and therefore celebrated by angels.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>At Christs incarnation,</hi> so <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>At the resurrection.</hi> Then all the angels of God shall appear, then shall be a most glorious and general appearance of the angels to celebrate that work, heaven shall empty it self of all its glorious inhabitants.</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) There is the <hi>spiritual coming of Christ:</hi> and this is in his <hi>Ordinances.</hi> This is his Chariot wherein he rides on conquering, <hi>Psa.</hi> 45. 3, 4. <hi>Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, and in thy Majesty ride prosperously.</hi> This is to be understood of Christs going forth in the sound of the Gospel, which is his sword, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he rides on to conquer the world. Now in this respect Christ is come, exhibiting himself in the voice of the Gospel: there Christ doth shew himself, and impart himself to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. I am to shew you <hi>whence</hi> he is come. He is come <hi>from the throne of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> From the <hi>court of his Angels.</hi> From the <hi>hosome of his Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:62321:99"/>(First,) <hi>From the Throne of his glory.</hi> O what a wonderful descent was this! that he should come from the Throne of his glory, to the manger among the beasts? from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the angels, to be crucified among the theeves! he came among the beasts; the world would not receive him, but he was thrust out among the beasts. Man by his Apostacy had brought himself among the beasts; and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did Christ come to find him. But he was humbled more yet; from the throne to the cross. From the height of his glory, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of <hi>shame.</hi> O how should we think of the strange abasure of Christ, that he that was heir to the Crown of glory, should become man, and viler then any of the Sons of men, in some respect! this should have your great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) <hi>From the Court of his angels.</hi> The Lord Jesus Christ, he was the brightness of his Fathers glory, the express image of his person, that made his angels spirits and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters a flaming fire. All the angels you must know were his Messengers. And what aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was here, that he should come from the company of angels to be contemned by the bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of men!</p>
            <p>(Thirdly,) <hi>From the bosome of his Father.</hi> The Lord Jesus Christ, he was the Son of Gods delight: his darling; the beloved object of his soul, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 27. Christ is he that lyes in the bosome of the Father; and he alone is able to reveal the secrets of the Lord to the world, so <hi>John</hi> 1. 18. Now that the Lord Jesus Christ
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62321:100"/>
should come from the bosome of God, to the belly of hell, that he should leave the glory of heaven, for the torments of hell, and all for our sakes; what a strange wonder of Love was this! hence was it that Christ came for us. This is <hi>the bread</hi> that came down from heaven, that a man may eat of and not dye.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I shall shew you <hi>why</hi> he is come. And that is <hi>To seek and to Save.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(First,) <hi>To seek.</hi> That is one end of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 10. And who do you think that he is come to seek? It is us that were lost. <hi>All we like sheep have gone astray,</hi> now Christ is that great &amp; good sheapherd that came to seek and to save that which was lost, in <hi>Luke</hi> 15 you read of the lost <hi>groat,</hi> the lost <hi>sheep,</hi> and the lost <hi>Son:</hi> and who do you think this was; this was the lost sinner, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. who was it, think you, that sought us, and found us when we were lost? It was Jesus Christ: it was he that sought us. We had never found him, had not he sought us. <hi>I am found of them that sought me not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 65. 1. If Christ had stayed for us till we sought him, our salvation had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been wrought. The Lord Jesus Christ he sought us not, and laid hold on us. <hi>He took not hold of angels, but of the seed of Abraham.</hi> In effectual calling, there he takes hold of the sinner, he is fain to run after them and stop them, or else they would run into perdition.</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) <hi>He is come to save,</hi> so the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to Timothy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 15. <hi>This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62321:100"/>
am chief.</hi> He puts in for one. Oh brethren, this is that should make the coming of Christ welcome to you, he came to seek and save you. O therefore welcome him at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> Is it so, that Christ is come? then <hi>go you forth to meet him. Math.</hi> 25. 6. That was the cry there, this is that which God sends his Messengers to call upon you for, that you may go forth to meet him.</p>
            <p>But how should you go forth to meet him? First, as a <hi>Bride</hi> doth her bridegroom. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as redeemed <hi>Captives</hi> do their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Thirdly, as dutiful <hi>subjects</hi> do their King.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>As a Bride doth her Bridegroom.</hi> This I shall open to you in three particulars. First, Put off the rayment of your captivity. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, put on the wedding Garment. Thirdly, trim up all your Lamps.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Put off the rayment of your Captivity.</hi> If the poor Captive woman were to <hi>shave her head, and pair ber nails, and put off the rayment of her captivity,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 13.) before she was to be married to any one of the Tribes of Israel: how much more should you put off the old man and your sinful deeds, that are to be married to Christ? If so be the Children of Israel were to wash and sanctifie themselves, and wash their cloaths, when the Lord was to come down upon Mount <hi>Sinai, Exod.</hi> 19. how much more should you, when the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> comes down to you? you know that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62321:101"/>
Children may not come at their fathers Table with unwashed hands: neither must you to eat of the dainties spread in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) <hi>You must put on the wedding garment.</hi> You will say, what is this? it is a <hi>conjugal love</hi> to Jesus Christ. And this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a garment: for we are bid to <hi>put on charity,</hi> or love. And its set forth as the best part of the Christian rayment: and <hi>above all things put on Charity;</hi> for what more fits a marriage than a conjugal affection? you should bring forth your most strong and ardent affections and love to him, you should meet him with songs, and what songs? such as the Psalmist doth <hi>Ps.</hi> 45. title. <hi>A song of Loves,</hi> let your eyes be fixed upon Christ in the Gospel, till your eyes affect your heart: and while your heart is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, the fire will be kindling; where will you bestow your love, but where the bridgroom is so lovely?</p>
            <p>(Thirdly,) <hi>You should trim up all your Lamps,</hi> you should snu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>f all your lights, and trim up all your lamps, to go forth to meet him, And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him and feed upon him when he is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: he is held out to you on purpose, in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, for you to take and receive him. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been ardently set forth cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied among you.</hi> But you will say was Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in <hi>Galatia?</hi> he was in the preaching of the word: he was crucified among them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You must meet him <hi>as redeemed cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives do their deliverer,</hi> would you know how
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62321:101"/>
this is? it is with <hi>palms of victory</hi> in your hands with <hi>garments of salvation;</hi> with <hi>songs of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</hi> These are the three things wherein this stands. you have all together, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 7, 9, 10. <hi>They were in white robes,</hi> the garments of Salvation: and <hi>palms</hi> of victory, and they had the <hi>songs of salvation</hi> too, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Oh Brethren, if you have any sence of your spiritual bondage and captivity, to be the servants of sin, under the fear of death, under the King of terrors; then be glad in your redeemer meet him with songs of praise. O how should the high praises of God be heard in your mouths? you should meet him as the virgins did <hi>David</hi> at his return from his victory, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 6. with <hi>singing and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing — with joy,</hi> &amp;c. Thus should you meet your deliverer, you should <hi>compass him with songs of praise.</hi> O my Brethren, you that are the redeemed of the Lord, look down into the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible pit, and then look up and sing songs to the Lord. O it is a glorious salvation that Christ hath wrought for us. How welcome was he to good old <hi>Simeon?</hi> how sweetly doth he hug Christ in his arms? (and much more, you must think in his heart) <hi>now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace: for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.</hi> This we have seen, we have seen Christ coming to us in the Gospel. We have seen him like <hi>Sampson,</hi> pulling down the house about our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and carrying away the posts, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them up as Trophies of his victory. It was he that was condemned, that you might be freed. O let your lips praise him, and the <hi>souls which he hath redeemed,</hi> let me call upon with
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62321:102"/>
the Psalmist, <hi>Psalm</hi> 98. A psalm on purpose to Jews and Gentiles to sing to the Lord for their deliverance, <hi>vers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi> 3. <hi>He hath remembred his mercy and truth toward the house of</hi> Israel: <hi>all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</hi> And what use doth the Psalmist make of this? <hi>vers.</hi> 4. <hi>make a joyful noise unto the Lord all the earth,</hi> &amp;c. He goes on calling upon all the Creatures to praise God for this. If the <hi>Sea must roar,</hi> and <hi>the floods clap their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nds,</hi> how much more should you do it, that are the redeemed of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Meet him <hi>as dutiful subjects do their King.</hi> This is the news sent to Zion, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy King cometh.</hi> Then meet him as a King, receive him with acclamation and praise, as they did when <hi>Solomon</hi> was proclaimed King, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 39, 40. <hi>They blew the Trumpet, and all the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>oplt said God save the King. And the people piped with pipes and returned with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</hi> O if they met <hi>King</hi> Solomon with such joy, how should you meet <hi>Christ?</hi> It is another manner of King that comes to you than <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was, you should say to Christ as they did to <hi>Gideon, Judg</hi> 8. 22. <hi>Rule thou over us: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.</hi> Thus should you say to Christ, rule thou over us: for he hath delivered you, not from the hand of <hi>Midian,</hi> but from <hi>Satan.</hi> But how should we meet our King? <hi>prepare the way, bow the knee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(First,) <hi>Prepare the way, Math.</hi> 3. 3. Christ had his fore-runner going before him, that was <hi>John,</hi> saying, <hi>prepare you the way of the Lord,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62321:102"/>
make his paths straight.</hi> How must the way of the Lord be prepared? <hi>every Mountain must be brought low</hi> &amp;c. every Mountain of pride and opposition that are in our hearts must be laid low. O if there be such preparing for the King, where he is to lodge and go, how much more should you for the King of glory where he is to lodge!</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) <hi>Bow the knee,</hi> we read of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> (and you know he was a type of Christ.) that when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had exalted him from the prison to such dignity, he prepares some to go before him, and cry, <hi>bow the knee.</hi> So God hath set up Christ and exalted him, and given him a <hi>name above every name;</hi> now let me call upon you (and my self with you) that you bow the knee to him. I speak not of the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knee: it is more than your cap and knee that he requireth. He will have you to bow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. O then see that you bow before him, see that you do him homage. Now your King is set up in another manner than he was upon the Crosse, <hi>behold your King.</hi> That is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that I would perswade you to now: behold your King and look that you bow to him. Let your souls and all that is within you bow to him. Let your understandings bow to him, by a right apprehension of him, by a right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of him, as worthy to be loved and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let your wills bow, by an utter rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your sins: and a most ardent desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ. Let all your affections come in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62321:103"/>
and bow, and not dare to stir more than his commands give you leave. In a word let all that is within you bow before him, and give place to Jesus Christ. Now down with the world, out with your lusts, and make ready for Christ. Let all your worldly business bow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and give place to Jesus Christ, away with this foolish deceitful world; let all be at the seet of Christ: and let all your souls be in subjection to him. This will be an acceptable meeting with him, if you so meet him.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There are so many wonders that meet together in Christ, that tis no wonder at all, that he should have this name, <hi>wonderful.</hi> Christ was every way <hi>wonderful.</hi> He was wonderful in his <hi>Person;</hi> wonderful in his <hi>Passion.</hi> Wonderful in his <hi>Conception,</hi> being conceived by the power of the holy Ghost: wonderful in his <hi>Birth,</hi> being born of a pure virgin: wonderful in his <hi>Life;</hi> wonderful in his <hi>death,</hi> and the effects of it: wonderful in his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> that a dead per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62321:104"/>
should be raised and that by his own power: wonderful in his <hi>Ascension.</hi> In a word he was every way wonderful: wonderful in his <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi> and <hi>Exaltation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah Christians if you would see a wonder, look upon Christ, and here see a wonder, here is a wonder, above all that the world can shew. There are two <hi>sorts of wonders</hi> that God hath to shew, the wonder of <hi>his power;</hi> and the wonder of <hi>his grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, The <hi>wonder of his Power.</hi> What a wonder is it, to see such a fabrick as heaven and earth, all come out of nothing by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God. Christians 'tis a great evil in us that we do no more wonder at this great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. What a wonder is the Sun, in its bigness and brightness, flying many Millions of miles in a minute of an hour!</p>
            <p>Secondly, But all these wonders are nothing to what his <hi>wonder of grace</hi> is. In Christ you may see all these wonders swallowed up. Let me shew you a little of this wonder. In Christ are to be seen these following wonders. 1. <hi>God manifest in the slesh.</hi> 2, <hi>God suffering in the slesh.</hi> 3. <hi>Justice and mercy sweetly r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>conciled.</hi> 4. <hi>The greatest good coming out of the womb of the greatest evil.</hi> 5. <hi>Perfect justice raging against perfect innocence.</hi> 6 <hi>Infinite wisdome at cost upon me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r worthlessness.</hi> 7. <hi>The Son of the blessing made to be a curse.</hi> 8. <hi>The Father of mercy forgetting his bowels to his own Son.</hi>

               </gap>irst, <hi>God manifest in the flesh, John</hi> 1. 14. <hi>And the word was made flesh and dwelt among
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62321:104"/>
us, and we beheld his glory,</hi> &amp;c. O brethren, this is a wonder indeed. The <hi>Apostle</hi> tells you, that <hi>without controversie this is a great Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> should be manifest <hi>in the flesh.</hi> Here we may cry out deservedly, with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and astonishment, God is come down to us in the likeness of man. <hi>God manifest in the flesh!</hi> why, what is flesh? all <hi>flesh is grass,</hi> that is, fading, withering, dying. What! <hi>the word made flesh!</hi> shall the immortal put on mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality? and incorruption, put on corruption? O what a wonder is this! O behold and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; see if Christ do not deserve the name of <hi>wonderful.</hi> Holy <hi>Abraham,</hi> was ashamed of his meaness in this respect, when he came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, because he was but <hi>dust and ashes. Behold, I have taken upon me to speak to the great God, who am but dust and ashes.</hi> O then how is it to see God clothed with the flesh of man? This was the wonder of angels. O how did they wonder to see their maker clothed with flesh! O come to the cross of Christ, to the cratch of Christ, and there bow and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Let not the Humble abasure of Christ, hinder you from adoring him in his greatness. The wisemen found Christ in poverty &amp; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; yet they knew what glory was vailed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this meannesse: and fell down and offered <hi>gold, frankincense, myrrhe,</hi> &amp;c. go ye and doe likewise.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>God suffering in the flesh,</hi> well may he have his name <hi>wonderful</hi> upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. 'tis said that the <hi>Philosopher,</hi> observing the <hi>unnatural cclipse of the Sun</hi> at the suffering
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62321:105"/>
of Christ, cryed out, <hi>either the God of nature is suffering, or the world is at an end.</hi> When Christ was suffering, it was God that suffered, though he did not suffer in the Godhead, but in the Manhood. Beloved, if you should have seen the judgement, that befel, <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> would you not have been asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at such a sight as this was? much more if hell should have opened, and you have seen the torments of the damned, would you not have been astonished, and wonder at this? but in this that God should suffer, is more then if all the men in the world should have suffered to all eternity. O how did the angels stand by the Crosse, wondering, to see him whom they adored and worshipped, to be mocked and Crucified.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Justice and mercy sweetly reconciled.</hi> The Justice and mercy of God, seemed to be, as it were, at a controversie about fallen man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Darius,</hi> you know, had made a decree, that <hi>he that did offer any petition to any God or man, except to himself,</hi> within such a time, <hi>should be cast into the den of Lions. Daniel</hi> comes within the danger of this decree: and what must be done now? either <hi>Daniel</hi> must be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and then, what would become of the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians?</hi> or, else <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> must be devoured; and then the King would have been cruel to himself. Yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence did so order it, that the Law was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and <hi>Daniel</hi> spared.</p>
            <p>So here, man had sinned; and God said that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62321:105"/>
he should dye, and now either man must dye, or God must be false of his word. Now what shall be done? The <hi>wisdome</hi> of God steps in, and finds out a person that should dye, and so Gods <hi>truth</hi> be saved, and his <hi>mercy</hi> magnified. But where shall this person be found? the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> could not do it: nor <hi>man</hi> could not do it. But God would take the humane nature upon him, and that should suffer, that God and man might be reconciled. <hi>Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed each other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mercy and truth are met together,</hi> how can this be? it seems they were at a great distance, &amp; could not be brought together. Truth said, that man should dye: &amp; mercy said that man should be saved. Truth said, if he dye not, I am a liar; and where then is the honor of my truth? but mercy pleaded, if he dye, where is the honor of my Grace and mercy? Why now, wisdome puts in a surety, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>oes for the principal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Righteousness and peace have kissed each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> How can this be? Gods justice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness did require that man should give satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: but this is all reconciled in Christ, he reconciled God and man together.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>The greatest good coming out of the womb of the greatest evil.</hi> Sin, is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all evil. You will say, can any good come out of such a womb as this? It is true, it cannot <hi>naturally</hi> come; but God did so order it, that it should be the occasion of it. Were it not a wonder, to see grapes come of thorns? and Olives of thistles? such a wonder you may
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62321:106"/>
see in Christ. You may see, out of the sin of man, comes <hi>great glory to God, and good to man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>Great glory to God:</hi> for had not man sinned, neither Gods <hi>justice</hi> nor <hi>mercy</hi> had been so magnified. His <hi>justice</hi> had not been seen at all, in a manner, in punishing the offenders; but 'tis eminently seen in punishing of Christ, who dyed for sinners. This is a louder demon. stration of the Justice of God, than if God had turned all heaven and earth into confusion upon the sin of man.</p>
            <p>Again, hereby is way made for magnifying Gods <hi>mercy.</hi> The sin of man, as God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, hath given way to God in the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of his mercy in forgiving, and his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in punishing It could not have bin thought, that God had been of so gracious a nature, able to put up such great affronts as man had given him, had not sin given him occasion to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> his mercy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Again, as the sin of man hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven occasion to the advancing of Gods glory, so <hi>for the promoting of mans good.</hi> By this man is raised to a higher state of happiness and felicity than ever he should have been. Now there is a nearer conjunction between God and man, than ever was before the fall, or ever should have been had it not been for the sin and fall of man. Before it was said, that man was made a little lower than the angels: but now it may be truely said, that he is so much higher than the Angels: more nearly joyned to God. Had man continued in innocence, he had had onely a lengthening out of his temporal life in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62321:106"/>
paradise but now by his sin Christ hath opened the door of heaven to him. O then wonder at the power of Christ!</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Perfect justice, raging against perfect innocence.</hi> You know that God is perfect in his Righteousness and justice. <hi>A God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.</hi> And yet notwithstanding, his perfect Justice was set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his own son, in whom there was nothing but perfect innocence. He was the <hi>Lamb of God:</hi> a lamb without spot and blemish; <hi>full of grace and truth. No guile was sound in his mouth;</hi> and yet you know how the wrath of God brake out upon him. It brake out upon him to the very uttermost: that if he would but put himself into the room of man, he must dye for it, tho Justice it self said I find no fault in him, yet he must dy: all could not save him: but if he will stand between God &amp; offending man, and take our sins upon himself, though he had none of his own, yet justice takes hold of him. Let me say as the <hi>Apostle behold the goodness &amp; severity of God. Goodness</hi> to thee, but <hi>severity</hi> unto Christ. O what had come upon you, if you had been to bear the blow! you see how Justice runs upon the Son of God, and fals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and tears him to the ground, and lets out his <hi>blood,</hi> and would not spare him, though he were the only belovedSon of God. O con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, <hi>how fearful a thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You read, how when <hi>Daniels</hi> enemies were cast into the Lions den, that they brake all their bones before they came to the bottome of the den. O how wouldst thou have been torn, had
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62321:107"/>
the Justice of God taken hold of thee!</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Insinite wisdome at cost upon meer worthlessenesse. God</hi> expects the <hi>blood</hi> of his own Son, which was of insinite value, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem worthless man. Would you not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to see a wise man to be changing <hi>Pearls</hi> for <hi>pebbles?</hi> yet here it is a greater wonder: the wise God, redeeming by the death of his own Son, sinful man out of the hands of his own ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. Why what is man? are not <hi>all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world as nothing before him?</hi> and yet upon this nothing, this vanity, is Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinite wisdome at this cost, that he might save us from eternal death.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>The Son of the Blessing made to be a curse, Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us.</hi> Observe it, 'tis not said he was <hi>AC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CURSED</hi> for us, but a <hi>CURSE for us. Christ hath delivered us from the curse:</hi> but how? <hi>by taking the curse upon himself.</hi> You know the curses of the Law that were denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against sinners: all these curses met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon one Jesus Christ. How is the book of Gods word full from one end to the other with Curses against sinners! what a load then was there upon the back of Christ, when all these curses met together upon him? what a wonder is it that God should be cursing of his own Son! to hear God say, all my curses shall meet upon thee: cursed <hi>shalt thou be in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and cursed shalt thou be in thy soul.</hi> To hear the great God speaking thus to his own Son, <hi>go thou Cursed,</hi> I will engage my Justice
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62321:107"/>
and wrath against thee, to torment thee and put thee to death. O what a sight was this! yet thus it was with Jesus Christ. He had as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>torments as members:</hi> and all the torments that he endured had the curse of God in them.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, <hi>The Father of mercy forgetting his Bowels to his own Son.</hi> VVe read of a very strange thing that was done by the <hi>King of Moab,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 27. <hi>When he saw that the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel was too sore for him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he took his own Son that should have reigned in his stead, and osfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him for a burnt offering,</hi> what a strange sight was this? yet there is a greater wonder than this to be seen in Christ: to see God sacrificing his own Son, and offering him up for a burnt-offering, to appease his wrath against sinful man: O shall not your hearts stand a wondering at this! to see, he that was a God of mercy to have no mercy for his own son? he that had bowels of pity for you, to have no pity for his Son; O behold and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. By this time I hope you are convinced that Christ is <hi>wonderful.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> WHerein doth the <hi>Love of Christ</hi> appear to be a <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing love?</hi> This appears in his putting <hi>himself</hi> into our <hi>Nature.</hi> His putting <hi>himself</hi> into our <hi>room.</hi> Putting <hi>our lives</hi> into his <hi>purchase,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>his name</hi> into our <hi>bond.</hi> Putting <hi>our names</hi> into his <hi>will.</hi> Putting <hi>his spirit</hi> into our <hi>hearts.</hi> Putting <hi>his glory</hi> into our <hi>hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, It appears in <hi>putting himself into our nature.</hi> What admirable love and condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was this? as we were <hi>Creatures</hi> there was an infinite distance between us and Christ: much more as we are <hi>sinners,</hi> but this infinite
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62321:109"/>
condescention was nothing to the love of Christ. He stept from the Court of his angels, to the reproaches of men at one step. O what a step was this! for Christ to take our nature upon him, is more than for an Emperour to become a beggar. Yea there is no comparison that can express it. This was love indeed; surpassing love, that the Lord Jesus Christ should have such a love to man: that he should become of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to sinners: flesh of our flesh, and bone of our bone; here is matchless unparallel'd love.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It appears in <hi>putting himself in our room.</hi> Christ did not onely become man with us, he doth not onely take the rags of our <hi>Nature</hi> upon him, but our <hi>condition</hi> upon him, the pain, shame, curse that was due to us upon him. He was content to be in our stead: to su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>er, dy for us: herein is love, <hi>Christ</hi> knew, before hand, what it would cost him if he would become surety for us: he knew the death we had deserved, the wrath that was our portion; and yet he was content to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into our room, that we might be exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and excused, <hi>Christ</hi> hath put in himself for us, not to be bound for us for a time: but did engage himself, resolving to pay for us that we might be excused. It was much that <hi>Christ</hi> did become man for us: but now that he should not onely take our nature upon him, but <hi>our curse</hi> upon him too, and become sin for us, and a curse sor us, this makes it more wonderful. It is strange that <hi>Christ</hi> should take our nature upon him; but if you consider the <hi>end why</hi> he
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62321:109"/>
did it, this would be more wonderful: it was that he might be miserable, and become capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be accursed for us! that he might be cursed and killed by the wrath of God! He had not become man, had it not been for this end. Now that he should become man for this end, how great was this? and yet this was his end. When Justice must have <hi>blood,</hi> that he would take his <hi>blood</hi> and give it for us: and that he might, he would take himself a humane body and soul.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It appears <hi>in putting our lives into his purchase.</hi> This is another strange expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the love of <hi>Christ.</hi> O if <hi>Christ</hi> had dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for others and not for us: if he had put in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers names and not ours, then we might have passed our days with sorrow: and gone into the Mountains, and pined away in sadness. But now that he should leave out any others names and put in ours, O here is distinguishing love! did you ever hear of a man that took in a beggar from the door to be his heir? but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such a thing might be done: did you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hear of a man that took in his enemy to be his heir, and made over all that he hath to him? thus hath <hi>Christ</hi> done for us. Ah Brethren, how may we stand astonished at this love, and say, as he, <hi>John</hi> 14. <hi>Lord whence is it that thou dost manifest thy self to us and not to the world?</hi> That thou hast put in our names and not others? surely here is great grace. O the free grace of God to us! though <hi>Christ</hi> hath dyed, yet you know the greatest part of the world shall be never the better for his death.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62321:110"/>
Though he hath dyed for man, yet the most of men, through the obstinacy and hardnesse of their hearts do resist him: but he hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com the obstinacy of our hearts and hath made us partakers of his death.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It appears <hi>in putting his name in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our bonds.</hi> Herein is the love of <hi>Christ</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested, in that he should become surety and bound for us. You know that the surety is to set his name to the bond. Now a man will be very wary sor whom he is bound; the man is not a man that is insufficient. Did you ever hear of a man that bound himself for one, that he knew that he should pay it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? thus hath <hi>Christ</hi> done for us: he knew that all our debts would come upon him; and yet notwithstanding he did engage himself for us. Beloved, the debt of sin is a very <hi>formidable debt:</hi> it is such a debt as if so be, the debt of the least sin had been laid upon all the Saints and Angels in glory to give satisfaction for it, they had bin drowned in everlasting perdition. But now <hi>Christ</hi> undertook to pay for all out of his own stock, though he knew what it would cost him, if he did become bound for us, O what love is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>!</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It appears <hi>in putting our names into his will.</hi> Brethren, herein is the love of <hi>Christ</hi> seen towards his people, in that he hath distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished between them and others. When he made his last VVill and Testament, he put in believers names and left out the rest, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. <hi>There shall in no wise enter any thing that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But they which are written in the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62321:110"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>mbs book of Life.</hi> This is a priviledge indeed to have your names written in his book, upon his will. Our Saviour bid his disclples <hi>rejoyce in this that their names were written in heaven,</hi> in Christs book, and upon his will: this is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of joy. But how shall we know whether our names are written in heaven? who shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend up into heaven to fetch it down from thence? I answer; we have the copy of his will here upon earth: <hi>This word is the copy of his will</hi> that is in heaven. If our names be in <hi>this book,</hi> our names are in <hi>his heart.</hi> Now let us go to the Law and Testimony, what saith that? that saith, if thou <hi>believe thou shalt be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> If thou <hi>repent and be converted, thy sins shall be blotted out Act.</hi> 3. 19</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>It appears in putting his spirit into our hearts, Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. <hi>And I will put my spirit within you.</hi> Brethren, herein is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodness and love of Christ seen, that he should bestow so great a gift upon so unworthy a receiver. O what love is this, that those hearts that have been the stables of unclean <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that Christ should take up his abode there! here is strange love indeed. Is it true indeed, <hi>will God dwell on earth,</hi> 1 Kings 8. 27. And if it were matter of wonder to <hi>Solomon,</hi> that God should shew some Token of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in so excellent a fabrick as that was; what matter of wonder is it that he should come, and make shew of his presence in our hearts!</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>In putting his glory into our hands.</hi> This is the greatest trust that can possibly be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> into our hands, this is more worth
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62321:111"/>
than all the world: for all the world was made for this end, to promote Gods glory. Yea, it is better than the <hi>blood of Christ:</hi> for the end is better than the means. Now the blood of Christ was shed to this end, for the glory of God. Now then what a great trust is this, that is intrusted with you in your hands? sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he loves you well, that trusts his glory with you. Your unworthy walking will more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor Christ, than any thing in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side. None can honour <hi>Christ</hi> as you; and none can dishonor him as you: let me put in that by the way. They that have such a Jewel put into their hands, had need be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. I hope by this time you are fully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that the love of <hi>Christ</hi> is a surpassing love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use,</hi> There are two things that I shall hence presse you to. 1. <hi>To Remember.</hi> 2. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> and <hi>imitate this</hi> love of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>To Remember this Love.</hi> O Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, be sure that you never forget such love <hi>as this, Cant.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>We will remember thy love more than Wine: this is</hi> the duty that I am pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing you to, thus to remember Christs love. Brethren, methinks it should be impossible for you to forget such love <hi>as this.</hi> Methinks it should be needlesse to bid you remember <hi>this</hi> love. Let my right hand forget her cunning rather than I should forget the love of Christ. Let my tongue forget to speak, rather than not to speak of this love. We should sooner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to eat than for get <hi>Christ.</hi> And yet how apt are we notwithstanding, though we have to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> much reason to remember him, to have
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62321:111"/>
the memory of Christ and his love out of our minds! the memory of <hi>Christ</hi> should be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon us in Marble and Brasse, never to be blotted out. Consider <hi>this</hi> love <hi>is a mindful,</hi> and a <hi>memorable</hi> love.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>A mindful love.</hi> Never had persons so mindful a friend <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> we have in <hi>Christ:</hi> our names are ever before him, they are engraven upon the palms of his hands. He can <hi>as</hi> soon forget himself <hi>as</hi> forget <hi>us:</hi> he can <hi>as</hi> soon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>his</hi> heart <hi>as</hi> forget <hi>us. Exod.</hi> 28. 29. <hi>And Aaron shall bear the names of the Children in the breast-place of Judgement, upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial before the Lord continually.</hi> Here you may see what a mindful friend <hi>Christ</hi> is, for these things were typical of <hi>Christ.</hi> Observe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, (1.) The <hi>place</hi> where the names were to be written; upon the <hi>breast-place</hi> of judgement upon his heart. (2.) <hi>The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> why they were written there: For a <hi>memorial</hi> before the Lord. He hath your names there that he might never forget you. (3.) Observe the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>petuity</hi> of <hi>this;</hi> for a memorial before the Lord <hi>continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> And observe, these were to be carryed by the high priest before <hi>God</hi> when he went into the high place. <hi>Christ</hi> hath not forgotten our names, now he <hi>is</hi> gone into the high place. You know how it was with the <hi>Butler</hi> when he was gone into <hi>Pharoahs</hi> presence, he forgot <hi>Joseph and all his afflictions.</hi> But <hi>Christ,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members <hi>Joseph and his afflictions</hi> all the while, though he be in heaven.</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) It is <hi>a memorable Love.</hi> As
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62321:112"/>
               <hi>Moses</hi> spake of the night of Israels deliverance, <hi>it is a night much to be remembered:</hi> so say I of <hi>this</hi> love of <hi>Christ;</hi> it <hi>is</hi> a love never to be forgotten. If <hi>Christ</hi> do bear your names upon <hi>his</hi> heart, methinks that you should ever bear <hi>his</hi> name upon you hearts. The love of <hi>Christ</hi> is worthy to be for a perpetual memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al upon our hearts. And therefore I may say to you of Christ, as they of him, <hi>he is worthy for whom thou shouldest do this.</hi>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> But what <hi>kind of remembrance</hi> should we have of this love?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It must be a <hi>feeling,</hi> and a <hi>lasting</hi> remembrance.</p>
            <p>First, A <hi>feeling remembrance,</hi> it should not be a bare <hi>Historical</hi> remembrance of <hi>Christ,</hi> but all your affections should be drawn out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Christ.</hi> He did not onely remember you, <hi>his</hi> remembrance of you was an <hi>affectionate</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; he hath made it to appear with a witnesse. Such should our remembrance of Christ be.</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) <hi>A lasting remembrance,</hi> it should not be at the quickning of a Sermon or the like, but an abiding remembrance of him. Brethren, our remembrance of <hi>Christ</hi> should be a living remembrance. It should be with <hi>us as</hi> with a loving husband that hath lost his wife; it seems that where ever he <hi>is,</hi> she should be with him: thus it should be with <hi>us,</hi> we should have <hi>Christ</hi> ever with <hi>us.</hi> VVhat <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> we should say of the <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christ. When we go it should lead us, when we awake it should talk with us,

Prov.</hi> 26. 22. So <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>A bundle of Myrrhe is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lye all night betwixt my breasts.</hi> That <hi>is,</hi> say the <hi>Dutch Divines,</hi> the love of my beloved, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of his death and sufferings, shall continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially be upon my heart; and I will keep it close with me, to be my <hi>Nose-gay:</hi> and the like. He shall lye between my breasts; that is, I will keep the remembrance of his love upon my heart to comfort me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As you should remember, so you should be careful to <hi>imitate and answer his love.</hi> Beloved, <hi>as</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> says of Gods love to you; <hi>what manner of love is this,</hi> &amp;c. So it should be said of your love to <hi>Christ,</hi> what manner of love <hi>is this</hi> that you bear to <hi>Christ?</hi> It should be such a love, <hi>as</hi> that people may be forced to say, what manner of love <hi>is this</hi> that they bear to <hi>Christ?</hi> Labor to have such a love to <hi>Christ,</hi> so great a love, as that all other things may be nothing to you in comparison of the love of Christ. And when you have loved <hi>Christ as</hi> much <hi>as</hi> you can, <hi>weep</hi> that you can love him no more.</p>

               <q>But walk in love as Christ also hath lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice unto God.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>MY beloved, this subject, of the <hi>love of Christ</hi> to sinners, <hi>is</hi> indeed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable Subject. I have been backward to medle with it, for how shall I speak of that which I do not know? For <hi>the love of Christ passeth all knowledge.</hi> Yet I shall a little open it to you, and shall make it appear that the love of Christ <hi>is</hi> great to his people: though I cannot comprehend it in the length and breadth, and height and depth of it, yet this we may know, that he hath a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tender love to us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>To him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood. Christ</hi> hath <hi>loved us:</hi> and would you
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62321:114"/>
have a proof of his love to us? he hath loved us <hi>and washed us.</hi> He found us in our sins as swine in the mire; and yet he loved <hi>us</hi> and washed <hi>us,</hi> when he was fain to stop his breath as it were and hold his nostrils, yet he would come and wash <hi>us:</hi> yea he would make a bath of his <hi>own blood. Christ</hi> commended <hi>Mary,</hi> that she washed his feet with her tears: but how <hi>is</hi> the love of <hi>Christ</hi> commended in that he hath washed <hi>us in his blood? Christ</hi> hath our names down upon his book, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. <hi>There shall in no wise enter into it any thing that desileth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But they that are written in the book of life.</hi> Mark, <hi>Christ</hi> keeps his book for you, lest you should be forgotten, or there should be any mistake. It is a <hi>metaphor</hi> taken from men that keep their books, because they will not let any thing be mistaken or forgotten. Yea, but <hi>books</hi> may be mislaid: therefore <hi>Christ</hi> hath your names written <hi>on his breast.</hi> The <hi>High preist</hi> was to have the names of the twelve Tribes upon his breast. So doth <hi>Christ,</hi> he hath you, for remembrance sake, engraven upon his hands, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 4. 9. 15. <hi>Can a woman sorget her sucking child,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>She may forget: but I have engraven thee upon my hands:</hi> yea he hath you upon <hi>his heart.</hi> He challengeth all the world for his love to you. He tels you that a woman may forget her child, but he will not forget you. A woman cannot chuse, but have a very tender respect for her child: for this child (saith she) have I born many a bitter throw and pain: now, for you did <hi>Christ</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 53. 11. And so the <hi>Apostle Peter,</hi>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:62321:114"/>
speaking of the Resurrection of <hi>Christ</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.) he tels <hi>us,</hi> that he being freed from <hi>the pains of death,</hi> it being impossible he should be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of them. The word in the <hi>Greek</hi> signifies <hi>birth-pains.</hi> Believers, they did as it were, come forth of the womb of his love. There <hi>is</hi> the very picture of a believer upon the heart of <hi>Christ.</hi> So that he cannot look upon his hands or <hi>his</hi> heart but he must be put in mind of us: so dear was was <hi>his</hi> love to us. What characters of love be ther that cannot be found in <hi>Christ? Love covereth a multitude of faults.</hi> And O how may this be seen in <hi>Christ?</hi> we have may sins; and yet <hi>Christ</hi> passeth by them all. <hi>Thou art all fair, there is no spot in thee, Cant.</hi> 4. 7. Again <hi>Love is strong as death.</hi> And so it was in Christ, his love was stronger than death: he under went death it self for us. He was not afraid to passe under the pangs of death that he might redeem us. Again, love fils the heart with love to the person beloved what a dear respect hath <hi>Christ</hi> for his spouse! every thing of theirs <hi>is</hi> sweet to him. <hi>Come my Love that art in the clefts of the Rock, in the secrets places of the stairs, let me see thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, let me hear thy voyce, for sweet is thy voyce, and thy countenance is comely, Cant.</hi> 2. 14. The Church says she <hi>is black</hi> but Christ says she <hi>is comely.</hi> But more <hi>particularly,</hi> I shall shew you some evidences of the greatness of <hi>Christ's</hi> love. His letters, are letters of Love. His <hi>lips,</hi> they are lips of Love. His <hi>Tokens,</hi> are the <hi>tokens</hi> of Love. His <hi>Test<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ment, is</hi> the evidence of Love. His <hi>Blood is</hi> a stream of Love.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>His letters are the letters of Love,</hi> the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62321:115"/>
Gospel, <hi>is</hi> the book sent down from heaven, wherein every <hi>chapter is</hi> a letter of love. Thou art ready to faint sometimes, Christian, and unbelief <hi>is</hi> ready to prevail: here thou mayst read the promises under <hi>Christs</hi> own hand, sent down srom heaven to thee. Here thou mayst read how love did care sor thee, when thou wast in thy <hi>blood;</hi> he said <hi>Live.</hi> Here thou mayst read what expressions of love there was between <hi>Christ</hi> and thee, when he was <hi>woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of thee: here are the letters of <hi>his</hi> love. Here thou mayst read those loving, melting passages of <hi>his,</hi> whereby he <hi>woo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi> thee and prevailed with thee. Here he shews, though he be absent for a while, yet he will come again. Here he hath set the time and the day when thou shalt be marryed to him: even when the body of <hi>Christ is</hi> compleat. O how canst thou hear these letters of love, and not be in love with <hi>Christ</hi> again?</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>His lips are lips of love,</hi> the <hi>kisses of his mouth are sweeter than wine;</hi> the words of <hi>his</hi> mouth are better <hi>than life. His lips drop as the Honey-comb. Never man spake like this man:</hi> all <hi>that heard him bare him wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and wondred at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth.</hi> Well did <hi>Mary</hi> chuse to sit at the seet of <hi>Christ,</hi> rather than at the feast: she found more sweet in the Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb of <hi>Christs lips,</hi> than at the feast. Let <hi>us</hi> but look over the last sermon of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the last prayer of <hi>Christ,</hi> and how may this set <hi>us</hi> a loving of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look over his last sermon, <hi>John</hi> 14. 15 and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62321:115"/>
16. <hi>chapters,</hi> how lovingly doth he dispute down the unbelieving fears of our hearts? <hi>Let not your heart be troubled.</hi> And he propounds loving arguments: though he be gone, he will send us <hi>the comforter:</hi> and he will not be long from <hi>us</hi> neither, and then we shall be in no worse a case or place than he himself. And in the mean time, <hi>his</hi> going from <hi>us is</hi> out of love to <hi>us:</hi> not because he wanted love for <hi>us,</hi> but because he <hi>went to prepare a place for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look into his last prayer, and how lovingly doth he carry <hi>us</hi> in <hi>his</hi> arms to <hi>his</hi> Father, when he was going out of the world, begging <hi>his</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that he would sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ie <hi>us,</hi> and keep <hi>us</hi> from the evil of the world, and that he would at length bring <hi>us</hi> to enjoy <hi>his</hi> glory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>His tokens are tokens of love. As</hi> a woman will be often looking over her tokens, because in these she sees the heart of her belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; so if you would be in love with <hi>Christ</hi> be often looking over the love-tokens of <hi>Christ.</hi> Thou canst not turn thy eye but thou must see his tokens. But there are three or four to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens especially that you should be looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>(First,) He hath sent thee <hi>a pardon for thy sins.</hi> O what a blessed token <hi>is this? Psa.</hi> 32. 1, 2. <hi>Blessed is the man whose sin is for given,</hi> &amp;c. He <hi>is</hi> blessed and blessed again: over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver blessed; he <hi>is</hi> a thrice happy man that hath got <hi>his</hi> pardon, why, <hi>this is</hi> the token that <hi>Christ</hi> hath sent thee that art a believer. O look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy pardon, and thou shalt find that thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62321:116"/>
               <hi>is</hi> written in the blood of <hi>Christ:</hi> for it was <hi>his blood</hi> that made satisfaction. He loved thee, and therefore washed thee from thy sins in <hi>his blood.</hi> O with what joy and sweetness shouldest thou look over thy pardon, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an! it <hi>is</hi> that which must carry thee through all thy dissiculties. Doth the Devil assault thee? do but shew thy pardon and this will worst him. Doth the Lord frown upon thee? shew him thy pardon, this will silence him. Doth thy Conscience accuse thee? shew it thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and that will quiet it.</p>
            <p>(Secondly,) He hath sent thee a <hi>Patent for heaven,</hi> this hath Christ given you that are believers: he hath made over to you in <hi>his</hi> Gospel a sirm conveyance of heaven. So that I may say a believer hath <hi>as</hi> true a right to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>as Christ</hi> can make him; yea <hi>as</hi> Christ hath himself. <hi>You are they that have endured in my temptations, and I appoint unto you a Kingdom as my Father hath appointed me,</hi> &amp;c. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, can you tell the worth of <hi>this</hi> token? can you cast up the worth of endlesse glory? can you tell what God and heaven <hi>is</hi> worth? then you may tell me what this token <hi>is</hi> worth; never was there such a token sent <hi>as this is?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(Thirdly,) He hath sent thee the golden chain of the <hi>Jewels and bracelets of thy graces.</hi> As when the servant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> went to take <hi>Rebeckah</hi> for wife to <hi>Isaac</hi> he gave her brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, &amp;c. So hath <hi>Christ</hi> to you: he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you the chain of all the graces. These are the Jewels he hath adorned you with. Dost thou find any faith, love, &amp;c. in thee? though
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62321:116"/>
it be like a grain of Mustard-seed, and like a spark on the hearth? O blesse the Lord Christ upon the bended knees of thy soul, that he hath given thee this. He hath done more for thee in this, than he hath done for all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side. O how thankful should you be, that have received such a token from him? Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, when ever thou dost feel the operation of the spirit of Christ within thee, let this mind thee of the love of him that hath sent thee all this.</p>
            <p>(Fourthly,) He hath sent thee the <hi>seal and testimony of his spirit.</hi> Hast thou received the spirit of adoption teaching thee to cry <hi>Abba Father?</hi> It was he that sent it. Hast thou so sure a guide, as the sweet compassionate spirit? so loving a Counseller as the spirit of Christ in thee? O take notice of the love of Christs in sending him to thee.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>His testament is the evidence of love,</hi> beloved, it is impossible for me to utter, or you to conceive the riches of Christs love expressed to you in <hi>his</hi> testament, <hi>his</hi> Covenant: herein, Christian, thou mightest read the strange love of Christ to thee, in that he hath given thee his testament, and delivered it to thee <hi>as</hi> his act and deed, sealed with his own blood. O how much did <hi>David</hi> make of <hi>this?</hi> It was the last words of that sweet singer of <hi>Israel. Although my house be not so with God, yet be hath made with me an everlasting Covenant, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in all things and sure and this is all my sa'vation and all my desire,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. He had all that heart could wish sor in this Covenant.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62321:117"/>
O Christian, hath Christ given thee his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? O make much of this covenant, 'tis a sweet token indeed. O the great priviledges and sweet immunities that are conveyed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers here! freedome from sin; from the guilt and power of sin. Freedome from mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; from the wrath of God, the curse of the law, from the sting of death, from the evil of the world, from the danger of hell. And beside all this, what legacies hath he given thee in the covenant? God for thy Father, himself for thy Saviour, his spirit for thy comforter and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, his Ministers for thy teachers, his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for thy furtherance in grace: there he hath given thee thy adoption and assurance for heaven. Do but look over this, and say if thou canst, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath not loved thee.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>His Blood is a stream of love,</hi> dost thou doubt of the love of Christ? do but look upon him on his crosse, how his feet and hands and heart are pierced: thou mayst see the love of Christ flowing out of every part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use,</hi> Now since Christ hath so loved you, you that are his people do you love <hi>him again</hi> O where should you bestow your love, place your affections, fix your hearts but here? I shall give you two motives. He <hi>desires</hi> your love: and he <hi>deserves</hi> your love.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Consider he desires your love.</hi> You have seen a little how Christ doth love you; and what doth he expect, but that you should love him again? and can there be any thing less that he could require! O methinks thou
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62321:117"/>
shouldest give up thy heart to <hi>Christ.</hi> This is all that he expects for this love, that you should love him again. This <hi>Christ</hi> will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and nothing short of this will he accept. Love cannot be satisfied, but by love again. It must be paid in its own coyn, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 7. <hi>If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would be utterly contemned.</hi> As no Treasure in the world can buy love, purchase love; so no sufficiency in the world will be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for love, unlesse, you give love your love again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. Now Christian, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded then to give away thy heart out of hand to <hi>Christ.</hi> O bestow thy love upon him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hast thou such a thing in thee, but that thou shouldst love <hi>Christ?</hi> doth any man plant a vineyard, and not expect to eat of the fruit of it? hath he put love into thee, and doth not he expect that thou shouldest love him?</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>He deserves your love.</hi> I may say of him as they of the <hi>Centurion: he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thou shouldst do this thing for him; for he loveth our nation. Worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive honor and strength,</hi> &amp;c. He is worthy to receive all, that you can give unto him. If there were any thing else that were worthy of your love, there might be some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse that you did not bestow it upon <hi>Christ.</hi> But alass there is nothing here that doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve your love. As <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>was Paul Crucified for you,</hi> &amp;c. so may I say were these things crucified for you? but Christ was crucified for you: he hath deserved your love. This is he that came in to the world <hi>to seek and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62321:118"/>
to save.</hi> That came and found you naked and dead and wounded: and then let out his blood and cured you. This is he that when he came, you spit upon him, and refused him; yet he would not be put off from you so, but he would do you good. How often hath he come and refreshed you with the refreshings of his love? how often hath he taken you into his galleries and filled you with his secrets? you that are believers may remember the places where he hath given you visits, and made you tast of the powers of the world to come.</p>

               <q>O woman, great is thy faith.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WE have read many noted and remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable stories of sundry great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, that have been done by the renowned worthies of the world: but there are no exploits nor atchievements, so renowned as those that been done by <hi>faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scripture give us many instances of this kind; and shews us how greatly the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ was pleased with the lively actings of his peoples faith. Faith is of great price with, and shall obtain great praise from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>chapter,</hi> you have a most notable vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory that was obtained by a poor woman, by the power and strength of her faith, Here a poor weak woman by the strength of her faith
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62321:119"/>
wrestling with Jesus Christ, obtains the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that he could no longer hold but grants her request. Her faith did notably discover it self in putting her upon <hi>saing to Christ.</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will send men in their distresses to <hi>natural helps;</hi> but faith will send them to Christ, to seek their help in him. And then her faith dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it self in putting her upon <hi>pursuing of Christ.</hi> Christ seems to give a repulse to her faith, <hi>he answereth her not a word;</hi> he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to put her faith to it: that he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise her faith. Yea when the <hi>Disciples</hi> came to speak for her; he answered, <hi>I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</hi> But she makes another onset upon <hi>Christ.</hi> Then came she, and <hi>worshipped, saying, Lord help me.</hi> Well, but he gives her another repulse, he seems to put her off with a check; 'tis not meet to give the <hi>Childrens bread to dogs.</hi> But behold the importunity of faith; she pursues the victory still, she confesses that she was but a dog, but she pleads that she might have the priviledge of a dog: even the <hi>dogs have the crumbs that fall from their masters table,</hi> and though I be a dog, yet let me have the crumbs. Well now, he could no longer hold, but, as <hi>Joseph</hi> he breaks out in the praise of this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans faith. <hi>O woman great is thy faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Luke</hi> 5. you have the <hi>sick of the Palsie</hi> suing to Christ for cure and observe how earnest he is, when they could not find which way to come to Christ, they <hi>went to the house top and let him down in the midst before Jesus.</hi> Here was a lively faith indeed, it could by no means
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62321:119"/>
be kept off from Christ, and how greatly was Christ pleased with this? <hi>Be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee.</hi> O this was the voice that faith would have had: this was the word that faith looked for. As Christ <hi>is</hi> pleased with faith, so he gratifies it, and gives it the answer that it would have, what word can be so sweet to faith, <hi>as Son thy sins are forgiven thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But why is <hi>Christ</hi> so greatly <hi>pleased with his peoples faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, Because this is the <hi>great thing commanded by him. Christ</hi> layes more stresse upon this command than upon all the rest: to wit the command of believing, <hi>John</hi> 6. 29. <hi>This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. This is THE work of God.</hi> THE work with an emphasis, none to this; This is the great command, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. <hi>This is his command, that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ.</hi> There are many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commands, but this is the great command of all. And therefore 'tis that Christ doth so generally please himself in, his peoples faith: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>causes this is the great thing that he requires of us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because this is that which doth <hi>set so great esteem upon him. Christ</hi> prizes faith, for faith above all things prizes Christ, and gives glory to Christ. Christ is not mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and glorified in any thing so much, as by his peoples faith. Faith empties <hi>us</hi> of our selves, and gives all the glory to Jesus: makes <hi>us</hi> vile in our own eyes, and magnifies Christ

Now for a lively faith, to lay hold of Christ. Where is thy faith, Christian, try now what thy faith can do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest. But wherein should your faith act so vigorously, that you may please Jesus Christ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, <hi>In a way of Anmhilation.</hi> Or emptying your selves of your selves. This was the way, the <hi>Centurious</hi> faith did please Christ so much, making him so little in his own eyes. And this was the way the <hi>woman of Canaan</hi> did please Christ with her faith. Faith is a grace that will exceedingly little us, and abase us, it will make thee that art as big as a Camel, to be little enough to go through an eye of a needle. It will make thee seem less and worse then nothing. It will make thee not onely to cease admiring thy self, but to abhor thy self, and repent in dust and ashes. It will shew thee what <hi>Christ</hi> is; and seeing him by thee, thou shalt disappear, and see nothing in thy self but unworthiness. The glow-worm shines in the night; but when the day Springs it cannot so much as be seen. When this Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Sun <hi>Christ</hi> ariseth, to the eye of faith, then self will not be seen, it will not appear. Faith will lay thee where thou shouldst be, in the dust And then <hi>Christ</hi> will be where he should be, in the Throne. When man stands for a Cypher th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n Christ signifies somewhat indeed. When man sets down himself for a Bankrupt, then he
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:62321:121"/>
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es out for the <hi>unsearchable riches of Christ.</hi> O be much in exercising thy faith, and that will empty thee to purpose. This is the language of faith, Lord I am undone, do thou set me up, I am a Bankrupt, do thou pay my debt. Lord, my rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ousness is but rags: my beau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y, is but rottenness: my pedigree, is but baseness: my portion, meer poverty: my power, meer infirmity: Lord, here is work for thee: help Lord! This is the language of faith: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that Christ and faith do fit so well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Faith hath need of every thing that Christ hath, and Christ hath a supply for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry want that Faith hath. As for unbelievers, they make light of Christ, they are rich, and need not his gold: they are well, and have no need of his salve. But now faith, that empties and humbles the man, and makes him to sue out to Christ: faith will fetch out all that is in Christ. Lord, here is a beggar for thy bounty Here is a <hi>Lazarus,</hi> for thy cure. Here is a palsie hand, a blind eye, here is a wound for thy salve. Christ, he comes as an open foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and faith brings an empty vessel. Christ comes with a full purse, and faith with an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand. Christ comes with an open hand, and faith with an open mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>. Christ comes giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and faith comes gaping. Faith comes, Lord, here is a belly for thee to fill: here is a back for thee to cover. I am poor and am rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of all, I have not a penny left, and none can help me but thee, I starve unlesse thou help. Thus faith comes as a hungry child fixes his ey upon the eye of his Father, earnestly looking
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62321:121"/>
upon him, when some relief will come to him: so doth faith upon Christ, looking when somewhat will come to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>By way of acceptation,</hi> receiving of Christ, <hi>To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>od even to them that believe on his name, John</hi> 1. 12. Faith sits like the <hi>cripple</hi> at the beautiful gate of the <hi>Temple</hi> to receive an alms. Beloved, the Gospel is the great Mart, and your Souls are the ship, and faith is the receiver, to take in the lading. O let your faith be active, that you may go away greatly loaden. As Christ said, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you the holy Ghost,</hi> so do you receive Christ: accept of Christ, while he tenders himself to you. While he is tendering himself to you, let your Souls answer, Lord, with my whole heart do I accept thee, I take thee at thy word to all intents and purposes. I take thee not onely to receive thy pay, but to fight under thy banner: not onely to be justified by thy righteousness, but to be governed by thy laws. This is the great and vital act of faith, that is of absolute necessity to salvation. The Lord Jesus Christ is offered to you. In the name of the eternal God I offer him to you all; see that you take him by faith. O saith faith Lord I accept thee, you will all say we will have Christ, we must perish else: but consider it, be not rash, know the manner of your husband: if you will have Christ, you must not live as you list: you must be under government, and strict government, you must not have him and the world too; you must cast your worldly
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62321:122"/>
hopes over board. You must take him upon his own conditions. His condition is very low sometimes in the world, sometimes he hath a bed, and sometimes he hath none: you must run all hazards with him; you must <hi>suffer with him if you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> reign with him.</hi> Now what saith your faith to this? O saith faith, I will take him with all my heart. Faith saith as <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Naomi, Ruth</hi> 1. 16. <hi>whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge, thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how must your faith accept of Christ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(First,) <hi>Accept the person of Christ.</hi> The Lord Jesus Christ is offered in a marriage covenant to you in the Gospel: and a marriage, is not between a <hi>person</hi> and <hi>patrimony;</hi> but <hi>person</hi> and <hi>person:</hi> true faith is not onely for the <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits</hi> of Christ but the <hi>person</hi> of Christ. There is great difference between the <hi>sick man,</hi> and the <hi>sick spouses</hi> taking the <hi>physician:</hi> the sick man takes him for his <hi>skill,</hi> but the spouse for his <hi>person.</hi> The sick man taks him till the cure be done, and than values not the physician: but the spouse for hers in all conditions for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; she takes his person. Thus must your faith do; you must chuse the Lord Jesus Christ, not for the <hi>salvation</hi> onely that he brings, but the <hi>excellency</hi> that is in him. As Christ will not be contented with any thing of yours, but you: so should you do, be contented with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Christ, but himself.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You <hi>must accept the pardon of Christ.</hi> Christ, with his person doth offer you all his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. And as 'tis in marriage
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62321:122"/>
that then, and then onely, and not otherwise shall the wife have the State. So take Christ and you have all the benefits that come by him. He comes with his pardon in his hand, and if you will accept him, you shall have his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don by him.</p>
            <p>(Thirdly,) <hi>The promises of Christ.</hi> All the <hi>promises are in him yea, and in him Amen.</hi> Take Christ and you may lay hold of all the promises as yours.</p>
            <p>(Fourthly,) <hi>The purchase of Christ.</hi> 'tis a Kingdome that is offered to you all, in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: take Christ, and you shall be heirs of a Kingdom. Lay hold of Christ, and you do at the same time <hi>lay hold of ettrnal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>By way of exultation,</hi> rejoycing in Christ, triumphing in Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Thanks be to God, that giveth us always cause to triumph in Christ.</hi> Your faith should be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing, you should triumph in the victory, mercy, merit, promises, riches, kingdom of Christ. O you that are believers, you have cause indeed always to triumph in Christ. what! have you received the Lord Jesus Christ? are you married to such a Husband? O how sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ld you boast of him, O how should you please him? how should you glory in the booty that you have got? you have got a prize indeed. Thou that hast got Christ, hast a husband indeed: let your hearts rejoyce in him Thou art a believer, thou are really e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoused to Jesus Christ: thou mayst make as real a claim to the Lord Jesus Christ, as a wife to her Husband. And thou mayest make as
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62321:123"/>
real a claim to the purchase of Jesus Christ, as a wife to the state and goods of her Husband. These are not vain and empty words: no, no, there is the greatest reallity in the world in this; 'tis as true as any thing in the world can be true. Thou hast a real interest in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and may'st boldly make thy claim to him as thine own Husband: do I speak any thing but what the Lord hath spoken? <hi>you are mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Christ that was raised from the dead, that you might bring fruit unto God, Rom.</hi> 7. 4. mark, 'tis not my word, 'tis Gods word. Take heed thou dost not blaspheme: dost thou think that God doth go to deceive thee? far be it from thy thoughts. Believer, 'tis so: of a truth Christ is thine; thy husband, and thou mayst boldly lay claim to him. Consider what a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Christ is: is not he the King of the Kings of the earth? This is he unto whom Angels, and authorities and powers are made subject: This is he whom all the Angels of God do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: Heaven and earth are at his beck: he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above all heavens, and hath a name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every name that is named: this is thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and friend. O should not thy faith tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in him?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>By way of resignation,</hi> in giving up your selves to Jesus Christ. Faith, as it takes Christ, so it delivers up the soul to Christ. Faith makes a happy exchange for us, giving away the man to Christ, and receiving Christ for us. Thus, between Christ and a believer, there is a mutual delivery of themselves over to one another. As faith receives Christ, so
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62321:123"/>
it gives up the soul to Christ, and all that it hath; Lord, saith faith, I here resign to thee: I quit all claim to my self, I am not my own: and will own it henceforth, that I have no right to my self. I give up soul and body to thee: I will hold back no part of the price. And as faith takes first the <hi>person</hi> of Christ, and then the <hi>benefits</hi> of Christ: so it gives away the <hi>person</hi> of the man to Christ, and then with the person it gives <hi>all the rest;</hi> the estate, interest, <hi>and</hi> all to Jesus Christ, thus you should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising your faith.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>By way of Adoration,</hi> thus saith should put forth its self upon Christ: casting our <hi>Crowns</hi> before him: setting up the Lord Jesus Christ in the throne of his own excellency, and we should admire nothing but him, breaking in pieces all our Idols, and pulling them down, that Christ alone may be exalted.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>By way of Appreciation,</hi> prizing and esteeming of Christ, debasing self and all other excellencies in comparison of Christ: account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things but dung for Christ, such was <hi>Pauls</hi> faith.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, By way of <hi>Appropriation,</hi> so your faith should put forth it self. It should not only put forth it self in a way of <hi>Affiance</hi> onely, leaning upon Christ: but in a way of <hi>assurance.</hi> You should labor to come up to this, not only to believe that Christ dyed for his people in general; but to believe his death was intended for you in particular to appropriate him to your self. Thus faith acts upon Christ. This was
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62321:124"/>
               <hi>Thomas,</hi> his faith when once it was stirred up. <hi>My Lord,</hi> and <hi>my God.</hi> Applying Christ to himself as his. Lord, saith faith, I am weak, but thou art my strength. I am a sinner, but thou art my righteousnesse, I am unclean, but thou art my sanctisication. I am miserable, but thou art my redemption.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>MY dearly beloved brethren, you have often heard our Savior preaching to you by his Ambassadors: but now he is come to preach to you, as it were, in his own person. What was said of <hi>Abel</hi> is true of Christ, <hi>he being dead yet speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> Christ being dead yet preacheth to you.</p>
            <p>But what doth Christ preach to you, now he is dead?</p>
            <p>Why, he preacheth no other thing to you, now he is dead, than he did in his life: Repent, and believe the Gospel. That, Christ preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to you, faith and repentance, repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Repentance towards God,</hi> see here
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62321:125"/>
Christian what thy sins hath done. Now is a time to have your hearts filled with sorrow, and your faces with shame, to see what you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ave brought upon Jesus Christ. Look upon him, every wound in his body, and thorn in his head, calls upon the to repent. The wounds in his side, and the blood that flowed from thence, calls upon thee to repent. Now let thy repentance by stirring, seeing he calls thee to repentance, what shall stir thee up to repent, if this shall not? here you may see the Lords severe wrath against sin. See it here in the belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Son of God, who is slain before your eyes for your sins. Ah, Christian, if thou hadst stood with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and seen the fire of <hi>Sodom.</hi> Or with <hi>Adam,</hi> and seen God commanding, and then thrusting them out of the garden. If thou hadst been in heaven, and seen what the wrath of God did there, what work it made when the <hi>Angels</hi> sinned. Or if thou hadst been in hell, and seen and heard the damned there, how wouldst thou look upon thy sin? O see here, more than all this; Gods wrath burning against his own Son, for thy sin.</p>
            <p>O see here the love of Christ! in vain were all thy tears and sorrow, had not Christ made way for thee. O see him, and hear him speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the crosse, my wounds shall heal thy soul, if thou wilt but repent. These hands shall work out thy salvation, if thou wilt but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and repent. Ah sinner! what is not thy soul melted yet? methinks I should hear thee making thy submission, and return to the Lord, as one that melteth at the word of his Lord.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:62321:125"/>
Lord is thy mind thus? shall I have all this if I will but repent? behold, I cover my head with sackcloth. I am the offender, as for this lamb what hath he done? O Lord it repenteth me of my rebellions: I lay down my w pons: I swear, I will be a resolved enemy against sin, as long as I live.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Another thing that Christ in his costly death preacheth to you, is faith.</hi> Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, he calls upon you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve now he is upon his crosse. Methin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hear him calling upon you from the crosse. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the reality and greatness of my love. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the infiniteness of my power. The full expiation of all thy sins. The truth of all Gods threatnings. The certainty of all my promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Thy unquestionable right and title to the Kingdom of glory.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Believe the reality and greatness of my love.</hi> Methinks he speaks thus to thee, O man, what should I have done more to testisic my love to thee than I have done? read all the Antiquities, and see whether there was any love like mine! thou canst not believe, but that thy parents love thee, when they take eare of thee: but whose love is like mine? did these ever suffer for thee or do for thee what I have done? what are all these sufferings that I have suffered for thee? did I despise my fathers glory, and leave it for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>? O slow of heart to believe all that I have done and suffered for thee! if I did not love thee, what should move me to dye for thee? did any thing in thee? no, did any profit from thee
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62321:126"/>
move me? no, I knew that man is not profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God. Was it any returns from thee? no, I knew how thou wouldst be: how unkind thou wouldst be to me. O Christian, doubt not of my love to thee. Doubt not of my help, dost thou think that I would give my self for thee, and will not give my hand for thee? do not doubt that I will cast thee off, dost thou think that I have su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ered all this for thee, and that I will cast thee off at last? no, no.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Believe the infiniteness of my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</hi> This is the language of Christ from his crosse, believe the exceeding greatnesse of my power. He speaks thus: O man, what if thou shouldst have no friend but I, cannot I up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thee? These shoulders, that did bear up under all that Hell could invent against me, shal not they uphold thee? fear not to commit thy self with considence to me. See, I am able to keep what thou committest to my trust.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Believe the full expiation of all thy sins.</hi> I am here a satisfaction for thy sin. Fear not, I am thy atonement, thy peace, thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation of thy sins, what though thou art emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? behold the fulness of my satisfaction, what am I here for? I am cut off, but not for my self, 'tis for thee. This is my meaning in my death: this is the end why I am upon the crosse, to make expiation for sin, and bring in everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteousness. All you like sheep are gon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Believe the truth of all Gods threatnings:</hi> here thou seest all the threatnings of God executed upon me. See here, and believe what God will do to those that go on in their trespasses. If he laid so much on me, what will he do to them? believe also his threatnings of correcting you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> you sin: for he will punish your sins with rods, and your iniquities with chastisements.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Believe the certainty os all my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi> this is another word that Christs crosse and death speaks to you, what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this death of mine, and of this blood and satisfaction of mine, but that the covenant might be ratified, and all the promises sealed, and nothing diminished, but all my Testament and covenant might he ratified for ever? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, this blood that flows from my wounds is sprinkled upon the people for the purifying of them. All is as sure as my death and blood can make them. Here thou seest all ratisied in my blood. Man, thinkest thou that I would dye with a lye in my mouth? dost thou think that I would suffer all this for thee, is I meant not to do thee good?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Believe thy unquestionable right and title to the Kingdom of glory.</hi> Why here thou dost see the price and ransome, the money paid down: and what meaneth all this thinkest thou, but to buy in thy name into the inheritance?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:62321:127"/>Now Christians, where is your faith? O methinks your sails should be up. Methinks you should be triumphing, though you are here in the world. As <hi>Paul, Who is he that condemns? it is Christ that died.</hi> Why? what objections can be made? what can unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief say, that cannot be answered here in the death of Christ? shall I muster up all its force, &amp; tell you what the death of Christ doth speak to it? give me leave to touch upon some of them.</p>
            <p>First, methinks I hear unbelief objecting from the <hi>terribleness of Gods threatnings.</hi> O sayes the soul, my heart melteth within me, while I hear the wrath of God threatned against sin, methinks I come lately from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> wher I heard the Law given withthe Trumpet, &amp; a shout, and a curse pronounced upon all that kept not the words of this Law. O how can my soul bear up against all these curses?</p>
            <p>But now how sweetly doth the crosse of Christ, and death of Christ answer thy fears? Hear thy Saviors language.</p>
            <p>O soul be not afraid, do not thou fear and flag: all these threatnings were intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me; all wer fulsilled upon me. Justice hath nothing to say to thee: all the curses are met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon me. That is the meaning of it: that thou mayst be free, though I take in the wrath of the Lord into my own body. Oh! behold me, behold me: see how full I am of the wrath of God in body and soul: <hi>my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Methinks I should hear thee say, now Lord,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62321:127"/>
I see my liberty, in thy bonds. My salvation, in thy torment and pain. I have seen thy sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and out-cry, and understood the meaning and intent of all: that it was to remove the curse from me. Now arise O my soul and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the blessing. Therefore was Christ <hi>made a curse that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles.</hi> What was the blessing of <hi>Abraham? I will bless thee, and make thee a blessing. I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee.</hi> And again, <hi>I esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish my Covenant between me and thee.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, O my soul rejoyce, and let my soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in God my Saviour. O my soul, God hath blessed thee, and shall bless thee. Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>r not, now the mouth of the Law is for ever stopt thou shalt never hear one curse more of the flaming mouth of the Law. O soul, what canst thou wish for that is not laid up in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting covenant? he hath said, he will be a God to thee. Canst thou be able to know the immensity of his covenant? all is made over to thee.</p>
            <p>Second, <hi>Object.</hi> But sin begins to rise up. The soul begins to cry out of his sins: O the <hi>multitude, multitude of my sins!</hi> they are gone over my head, and I am sore afraid, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to pay my debt.</p>
            <p>But hear now what Christ speaks to thee. This is the language of his death and wounds, fear not sin. <hi>Have I been so long with thee and dost thou not know me, Philip?</hi> so saith he to thy soul, what! been here so long with me, and conversed with me so long, and dost thou
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62321:128"/>
not know me yet? are thy sins infinite, and are not my merci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s infinite? are thy sins great, and am not I God above all, equal with the father? O look unto me, and rest in the fulness of my satisfaction: I am thy surety. All thy debts be upon me: all thy wants are upon me, what if thou hast nothing to pay? I have enough for me and thee. I am the <hi>Scape-goat</hi> that have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away thy sin into a land of <hi>forgetfulness,</hi> I have slain the enmity of sin upon the crosse, and have reconciled you to my Father. Here is redemption, full redemption, plentiful redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, behold, my blood speaketh peace to you. Wilt thou not believe the voyce of my death and blood to thee? thus Christ's death can speak sufficiently to all that thy sins can say' against thee.</p>
            <p>Now doth not thy faith stand upright yet, Christian? methinks I should hear thee say, Lord 'tis enough, thou hast laid down thy life for a ransome: I see my cure in thy wounds. I doubt not butthy blood is sufficient to cleanse me from all my sins.</p>
            <p>And who now shall appear-against me? Ah Justice, once a terrible word, now I can see thy face with comfort. Once Justice was so terrible, as never was the face of a judge more terrible to the prisoner at the bar, than that to me, but now 'tis pleasing to me. Once, I had rather have fallen into the lions mouth, than to come to it. O how did my soul grow pale, and my heart ready to dye like <hi>Nabals</hi> within me, when I saw the <hi>ballance</hi> held up in one hand, and the <hi>sword</hi> in the <hi>other!</hi> but now, I see, that the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62321:128"/>
death of Christ and his blood shall be put into the ballance with me, I am not afraid. Here now see a great wonder: the pure holyness of God taking pleasure in a sinner: and the strictest justice shaking hands with the off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, now the justice of God is become my friend.</p>
            <p>Third, <hi>Object.</hi> O but unbelief seems yet to object from the <hi>multitude, and strength, and policy of the enemy.</hi> Methinks I see the trembling soul in the posture of the prophets man, who beheld the mountain beset with Charriots and Horses, and crying out <hi>O Master! what shall we do?</hi> If it were but flesh and blood it were not altogether so much: but 'tis princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, and powers; who can break thorow the <hi>host of these Philistines?</hi> But Christian, look to this crosse: look to a dying <hi>Christ,</hi> look what his death speaks to thee, wherefore art thou ready to fall with these fears, and ready to sink under them? methinks, I see him taking thee by the hand as he did <hi>Peter, O thou of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle faith, why didst thou doubt?</hi> look here by my cross, and see all thine enemies lye slain by my death: and what wilt thou be afraid, that thy slain-enemies will rise again, and pursue thee? methinks, soul, I should hear thee triumphing and crying out, what can you do, O my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? I have seen <hi>captivity led Captive:</hi> and for whom did he overcome but for me? as for me, now I will throw out the gantlet, and bid defiance to my enemies. Who <hi>is he that condemns? It is Christ that dyed, who shall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate us from the love</hi> (or death) <hi>of Christ? shall tribulation, or distresse,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nay in all

these things we are more than conquerors</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For I am perswaded, that neither death, nor life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall be able to seperate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</hi> I see now all overcome in the death of Christ. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, I fear you not; I behold all your legions in chains, and made captives by Christ. Death, I fear thee not; for I know that thou art slain, by him that had the power of death and devils.

And I cannot but tell you, you are the people of my cares, the desire of my eyes, the people of my delights, &amp; of my prayers. My labors with you for many years, though some time attended with difficulty, and danger, yet were not tedious; but my time passed like <hi>Jacobs,</hi> when he served for <hi>Rachel</hi> and my sufferings for you are not irksome, through grace, because I trust they are for your edisication, and are <hi>a seal</hi> of my love to you, and more especially of the doctrine of our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> which I have long preached among you.

The prison sounds sorth to you the same doctrine, that the pulpit ever did: the Lord give you to hear; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve from the <hi>prisoner,</hi> that which was not so thorowly embraced from the <hi>preacher.</hi> But what doth the prison preach? it preaches <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> to you. God hath called to you from the pulpit often, and now he sendeth to you from the prison, that you should repent. Who is so deaf, as not to hear the louds cals of the living God to <hi>England,</hi> that they should repent? you have long had <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> but now the Lord hath sent you; as it

From the dead, I say for you know, that in the sence of the <hi>Law,</hi> your Ministers are dead. But being dead we yet speak; yea our death; our removal, our silence doth speak; and all speaks the same thing, that you should repent. O that I could lift up my voyce to you; that your streets, your houses, your ears, your hearts might be fil'd with this cry, repent O <hi>Taunton;</hi> repent and turn. Repent O profane, or else your iniquities will be your ruine. Repent O pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors or else the Lord will not repent of the evil that he is about to bring upon us.

My time <hi>is</hi> gone, and my labor done, but my Oyl <hi>is</hi> wasted in the work of God. I
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:62321:138"/>
have spent my Fathers allowance in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers business. This will make you to arise and say, I will go to my Father, with boldness and confidence: and not <hi>as</hi> the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> (when he had spent the portion of goods which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had allotted him) with diffidence, and fears of his being rejected. You know my business is but to bespeak you for Christ. I have four requests to present you for him. Thus are my requests, but his Commands.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Let the ballance be turned by Christ.</hi> Let Christ and his interest turn the scale against all the world. Let him be the Pearl, and the world the dung. Let Jesus be King, and Mammon <hi>as</hi> a despised broken Idol, or <hi>as</hi> the stamped Calf. Let Christ be the prize, &amp; the rest but losse. Let gain give way to godliness. Let credit crack ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Conscience stretch, be no body with the world rather than dishonor Christ, to keep up your reputation with men. Let all the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of pleasures wither, the paint fall off this harlots face, when set by Christ. Let the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shrines and great <hi>Diana</hi> be <hi>as Nehushtan.</hi> 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 4. And the crown fall from the head of honour, and the great Idol to come down into the dust before Jesus Christ, and lye like <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Ark, with head and hands broken off upon the threshold. Keep the world <hi>at your feet as a servant,</hi> or rather <hi>under foot as an enemy.</hi> But if it hath the heart you are undone. Where Christ hath not the swaying-interest all <hi>is</hi> rotten at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Let the Byass of your wils be set towards Christ.</hi> The <hi>needle of the will</hi> was at
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:62321:138"/>
first touched with a <hi>magnetick</hi> verttue, which turn'd it towards God, <hi>as</hi> the needle <hi>is</hi> turned towards the pole: but now by the fall it hath quite lost its vertue: and will stand any where, but where it should. But God by fanctifying grace doth new-touch this needle. &amp; though it may (by an accidental violence) be too too easily shakenyet it will <hi>never rest</hi> at a wrong point, but be unquiet and in continual restlessness and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation till it stand direct towards Christ. If any thing but Christ would content you, you are none of his. Can you acquiesse no where but in him? do your wils cleave to him? <hi>is</hi> he your setled, resolved choice against all competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors? if so, doubtlesse it <hi>is</hi> well between you and him. Thus it must be, Christ must have your <hi>assent &amp; consent.</hi> The judgement must <hi>prize</hi> him and the will must <hi>chuse</hi> him <hi>as</hi> the chief good.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Let the bent of your affections be to Jesus Christ.</hi> Look upon the height of his stature, and the goodlinesse of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and you will say surely he <hi>is</hi> worthy. Surely this <hi>is</hi> the <hi>Lords annointed.</hi> Frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and throughly view his excellencies, till your eye affect your heart. Let me set him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the other objects, like <hi>Saul</hi> among the people. and I must say to you <hi>as Samuel, see you him whom the Lord hath c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>osen. There is none like him.</hi> O let all your affections, be moved at the sight of him, and shout with the joyful people, let the King live, let Christ have all. Let <hi>Sorrow</hi> sit with the melting pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, weeping at her Saviours feet. Let your strongest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>urning <hi>love</hi> be kindled, when
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:62321:139"/>
you do but think of <hi>Christ,</hi> and fire your hearts, and so bring them forth <hi>as</hi> a flaming sacrifice to welcome him. Let <hi>fear</hi> make her obeysance, and with humble reverence and lowliest vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration bow the knee of the soul to Zions King. Let <hi>Joy</hi> be triumphant when you meditate on <hi>Christ.</hi> And call upon the daughters of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick to praise and celebrate his excellency. Let <hi>desire</hi> be upon the wing, and spread the hands, and open the mouth wide, and pant for him. Let the most lively and pregnant <hi>hope</hi> sit by the way and look for him, and wait for his coming. And get up in every Ordinance like <hi>Zacheus</hi> on the <hi>Sycamore-tree</hi> that he might see Jesus <hi>as</hi> he passeth by; and big with earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est expectation of enjoying him. In a word, you must see to it that <hi>Christ</hi> be <hi>chief</hi> in your affections; That he be your <hi>chief desire;</hi> Your <hi>chief joy:</hi> And this will evidence you to be his: and without this all is unsound.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Let the Butt of all your Actions be no other but Christ. Whatsoever you do, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Here take your aim. Here let all your designs meet. Hither let all your motions tend. That <hi>Christ may be magnified in you, Phil.</hi> 1. 20. This <hi>is</hi> a mark undeniable. But he that hath more eye to the pleasing of men, his own advantage, or any worldly good, than to the pleasing and honouring of <hi>Christ, is</hi> no better than a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.</p>
               <p>I must do <hi>as</hi> much <hi>as</hi> I can in a little time, 'tis time now to close. I have given you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

in these four heads the highest duties and surest characters of every true believer.

               <hi>Q. HOw may we come to make Religion our business?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule.</hi> 1. You must throughly acquaint your selves with the rule and the compass that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion steers by. Unless the Mariner know every point of his Compass, he is like to make but foul work of it. The word is a believers Compass, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>As many as walk according to This rule,</hi> &amp;c. A believer walks by Rule, and by this Rule, the Rule of the word; you can never mannage the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of Religion, except you do throughly know, and often eye your Rule, and put the rule to your work. How can you trade religiously unless you know the Rules you are to deal by? Or pray rightly, if ignorant of the Rules you are to pray by? Beloved,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:62321:143"/>
the commandement is exceeding broad, and prescribes you Rules for your whole Man, and sor the right behaving of your selves in every part of your conversation; Oh hide the word in your hearts! lay up the Rules you are to work by; and the Rules that you are to give by; the Rules that you are to speak by; and the Rules that you are to hear by; and the Rules that you are to examine your selves by: Be sure there be no part of your conversation, but that you have some Rules that you doe set to your selves about it.</p>
            <p>How can you carry your selves Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously in your Relations, unless you doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scienciously observe the Rules that you are to carry your selves by? If wives do not know their Rules, and husbands their Rules, and servants their Rules, and children their Rules, how can you bring your profession to any thing? beloved as ever you would make any thing of Religion, know the Rules of your places, set it down with your selves, you husbands, you wives, you children, you servants; these be the Rules that I will walk by, and wherein I sail of these Rules I will seé my errour, and study to come up to what is lacking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resp.</hi> 2. You must have the whole lump of the heart leavened and seasoned with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 33. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto leaven which a woman hid, &amp;c.</hi> The word is this leaven, The heart is this lump in which this leaven is hid: now
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:62321:143"/>
when the whole lump is throughly seasoned, then their will be such a suitableness between the heart and the work, that Religion will become a pleasure. A true Christian hath the law of the Spirit of Life within him, he hath a transcript of the word in his soul. Now where the law of Religion is in the heart, there will be a love of, delight in, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity to the work of Religion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>I delight to doe thy will, thy law is within my heart, Psal.</hi> 40. 8. <hi>who naturally careth for your state, Phil.</hi> 2. 20. where Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath taken deep root in the heart, the concerns of Christ will become its natural care. Now that which is natural is delightful, and when a man loves his work, he will be much in it. Again, that which is natural is constant, so that when the heart is naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and habituated to Religion, the man will constantly follow it. To a heart throughly sanctified, Religion is the very Element it lives in, whereas a carnal heart in holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises is like a fish out of the water, it cannot away with the strictness of a holy self-denying life, when the heart is renewed, and made spiritual, twill naturally mind the things of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule.</hi> 3. You must have these six Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples inwrought and deeply engraven into your souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prin.</hi> 1. That Religion is the very end of your being, that you were made and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for. This is the end and use of all your powers and faculties, That you may serve
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:62321:144"/>
and glorisie the God that made you, He made you for himself, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4. <hi>For his pleasure you are and were created, Rev.</hi> 4. 11. Oh man look upon thy self; think whence thou art, and for what a little while since thou wast not, how camest thou to be? hath not the hand of God framed thee? Think with thy self, wherefore serve all these powers and faculties? To what end were they given me? what to eat, and drink, and sleep, and sport? If I had been a brute, I could have done this, why should it repent the Lord that he hath made me a man, that he hath given me an understanding soul? wherefore have I reason above the rest of the Creatures? but that I should understand the Law of my Creation, and the end of my being, and know my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers ends, and doe his pleasure? Better I had never been born, than not to answer my end. Better I had been a Brute, than a Man, unless I glorifie God with my understanding and imploy my powers and faculties in his service.</p>
            <p>Oh let these thoughts live dayly upon your hearts, fix it upon your selves that you are of no use nor worth in the world, except you serve your makers ends: that he is the Potter, and you the Clay; and that you are good for nothing, except you are for the use of him that formed you: think with your selves; Is it not pitty so excellent a peice of Gods workmanship, as man is, should be all in vain? That God should lay out so much of his power and wisdom, and grace upon thee, and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:62321:144"/>
loose his end at last? That he should furnish Man compleatly for the end he was made for, and send him into the world to dispatch his business, and Man should forget his errand, and neglect the very end of his being?</p>
            <p>Beloved, the reason why men do mind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion no more, is beause they do mistake their business. And is it not pitty, that when Man only of all the vissible Creatures hath an understanding to know his end, he onely should mistake and miss his end?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prin.</hi> 2. That look as you do mannage the business of Religion, so are you made or marred to all Eternity, settle it upon your hearts, that if this business doth miscarry, you are undone for evermore; you may mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in any other business, and yet doe well enough at last; your goods may be wreck'd, your friends disingaged, your times spilt, and yet you may be happy; but if you do not go through with the business of Religion you are undone men. This made <hi>Paul</hi> to ply the Oars, and follow it with such dilligence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 26, 27. <hi>So run I, so fight I, &amp;c.</hi> This made him engage with might and main, and put forth every limb in the race, because his Eternal undoing lay upon it: He runs through fire and water, he doth not beat the Air, and brandish his sword like a vapouring coward; he is not like the Fencers that strike as if they could kill each other at every blow, but mean one another no hurt: no, he is ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, he fights as for the precious Life, least otherwise after all his Preaching and paines
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:62321:145"/>
he should prove a Castaway, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. Sirs, you had need look how you doe carry it now, Immortallity, Eternity hangs upon it, your patient continuance in well doing, will bring forth Eternal life; but you miss all, if you doe not keep doing, and doing well, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently continue so doing; If you come short of this, your portion is indignation and wrath.</p>
            <p>Sirs, consider where you are, and look about you. Oh you careless sinners, you remiss and Luke-warm Christians, consider what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you. The furnace is ready heat for you, if you go not through with your work. The Crown is ready prepared, if you hold out in your race; you are speeding on to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as fast as the wings of time can carry you; and that is more swiftly, than the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle flying in the Air.</p>
            <p>Believe it, Religion is no trisling matter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>If thou be careless and idle, and remiss here, thou art a damned Man. If a Man be upon trial for his Life, I warrant you will find him serious here. If a man have a business that will prove his utter ruine, if it miscarry, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending; be sure he will stretch his wits, and engage his interest, and turn every stone. Beloved the reason why Religion is minded with so little care, is because Men do not consider the consequence of Religion. Sirs, can you dye, can you burn? If not, take heed of trisling in Religion, and selling Heaven for want of a little Pains-taking. Oh where ever you be unserious, be sure you
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:62321:145"/>
be serious and in earnest in the business of Religion, and that you may be so, let this ever dwell upon your hearts, that halving and trisling will undo all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prin.</hi> 3. That nothing is well done ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be Religiously done. <hi>Do all in the name of the Lord Jesus. Whatever you do, do all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 17. Remember, that the rules of Religion do not onely reach your praying, hearing, almesgiving, &amp;c. but your eating, drinking, trading, marrying. You must not think to put off God with an hour in the morning, and an hour in the evening; you must be serving him throughout the day, managing your callings, visits, discourses, according to his rules. Count that arrow lost, that is not levelled at some Religious end; that hour lost that is not spent Religiously, that visit lost, in which you have not promoted the ends of Religion in your selves and friends. Count that you eat amiss, unless you eat Religiously. So much of Religion as there is in your actions, so much there is of true gold, so much as there is of self and carnal ends, so much embasing mettle is mingled therewith; your lying down, and rising up must be managed Religiously, or else they are not well managed; and you must impose it upon your selves, to be serving God not onely on your knees, but in your shops, at your Tables, in your journeys, that God
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:62321:146"/>
may be glori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Prin.</hi> 4. That the Trade of Religion of all others, yields the sweetest pleasure, and surest gain. A true Christian is a Merchant Man that dealeth in no small matters, but for goodly Pearls, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 45. A holy Life is a spiritual trading, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 16. Now there is no Trade to this. A Believer Trades for Grace and Glory: Oh how glorious is the prize, and how excellent and unvalluable is the income of Religion! <hi>Wisdom is more precious than Rubies, all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared to her,</hi> Read <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 11. &amp; <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. to the 19. They that come from the <hi>Indies</hi> laden with Gold and Spices, with Pearls and Diamonds, have but a poor Trade in comparison of a Christian: follow the work of Religion to purpose, and you will find the true Riches flowing in upon you; your faith will grow exceedingly, and your love will abound, and as riches increase, your hearts will be set upon them, and your gaines will increase your diligence. Every man will be dealing in that commodity, that yields great profit. The reason why Men have so little heart for Religion is because they have secretly an oppinion that there is little to be got by it. They reckon an hour spent in Religion, to be an hour lost. They say in their hearts. <hi>It is in v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and like the wise Merchant imploy all his stock here, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 44, 46.</p>
            <p>Beloved, as ever you would go through with the work of Religion, you must have your hearts throughly possessed with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and profit that comes in by Religion. when a man doth think he can benefit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self more other where, he will have little heart to follow after Christ, but when he knows not where to be better, then he will stick resolvedly to him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 66, 67, 68. There are two great Pillars upon which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion stands; The one is a belief that God is, and the other <hi>that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him, Heb.</hi> 11. 6. Well let this dwell upon you then, that you cannot better your state, nor promote your happiness any way in all the world, so much as by Religion. No pleasure, nor profit to that of Religion, <hi>Riches and honour are with her, all her ways are pleasantness, she is a tree of Life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is he that retaineth her, Prov.</hi> 3. 17, 18. <hi>Here is true delight, Psal.</hi> 40. 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22.

               <hi>Pr.</hi> 5. That your time is short, and your work great, and must be done now or never. Our Saviour made Religion his business, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 49. And Oh how busie was he! <hi>He went up and down doing good;</hi> and so much was he taken up with his work, that he had not time to take his bread; yea his carnal friends,

seeing how earnest he was, said he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides himself, and began to lay hold on him, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 38. <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 20, 21. And what did put him upon this earnest diligence? The sense of the shortness of his time, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 4. Oh Sirs remember with him, that now you have a day to work in, and you have but a day, and the night is hasting upon you, when there is no work to be done: no more pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no more hearing, no more exhorting, nor admonishing. Now serve your genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now exhort one another dayly; doe good with your Estates; call upon your friends dayly, for it must be now or never, let it ever dwell upon you, <hi>That there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Be convinced of the weight of your work, and that will make you answer intervening disturbance that would take you off, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 3. Then remember of what dreadfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence tis, your salvation is at stake, and therefore you must work it out with fear and trembling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prin.</hi> 6. That except you make it your business, all your Religion is in vain. While you halt and halve it in Religion, you come but half way to heaven. Settle it upon your hearts, that except you are throughout Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, you are Religious to no purpose. Be sure you shall never come to heaven ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

you seek it in Gods order, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>First seek,</hi> &amp;c. It were not suitable to the wisdom of God, so to undervalue his Christ and glory, as to throw them away on those that account other matters better worth their pains and care.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule.</hi> 4. You must have the love of God and Religion, lying next your hearts; Love is a busie Grace, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Your labour of Love.</hi> We may say of Love, as <hi>Solomon</hi> of the vertuous woman, she layeth her hands <hi>to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff, she eateth not the bread of idleness, she worketh willingly with her hands, Prov.</hi> 31. Love will constrain you, and put you upon a willing and dilligent keeping Gods commandements, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 3. Get your hearts in love with the Laws and Waies of God: who more busie than <hi>David?</hi> Morning, even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and noon, he was praying and praising, yea talking and thinking of God and his ways, all the day, and all from his love to them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 17. &amp; 119. 147. &amp; 118. &amp; 71. 24. <hi>Oh how I love thy Law! Psal.</hi> 119. 97. <hi>Lord I have loved the habitation of thy house, Psal.</hi> 26. 8.</p>
            <p>You must beware of taking too much of the world into your hands. When a mans heart and head is full as it can hold of worldly care and businesses, and he cannot tell which way to turn himself, in a crowd and throng of worldly affairs, how can the care of Religion live in such a ones heart? <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 41, 42. If <hi>Martha</hi> will trouble her self about many
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:62321:148"/>
things, the <hi>ONE THING</hi> needfull shall be neglected. You must buy, and marry, and weep, and rejoyce, and trade, and care for these things, as if you did it not; not laying too much stress upon these things, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging too eagerly in seeking after them, or else you will neglect the better things, and learn to pray, and hear, and read, as if you did it not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 30. Tis true that the work of your callings is part of your business for Heaven; but then you must be sure to keep your affairs so at command, as that you may have so much room for dayly Prayer and Meditation, and self-reflection, as may season your worldly business with Religion, and sanctisie it to you, that it may become a help, and not a snare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule</hi> 6. You must alwaies work as under your Masters eye. When the Masters eye is known to look on, there is as much work done in an hour, as many times is done in two, when the sence of his oversight doth not quicken the workman, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 8. <hi>I have set the Lord alwaies before me.</hi>

               <hi>Rule</hi> 7. You must ever carry your eye upon your mark. So did <hi>Paul</hi> in the text, <hi>I press towards the Mark, for the prize of the high-calling of God in Christ,</hi> The mark that a Believer ay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

All the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reproaches that attended Gods poor people and wayes, in the time of their thrall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, could not discourage <hi>Moses,</hi> when he eyed the <hi>recompence of reward, Heb.</hi> 11. 25. 26. Keep heaven in sight, and your work will go on with pleasure, and all your diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties will seem light and easie, and not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy once to enter into comparison with the expected bliss, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule</hi> 8. You must at the entrance of every action, remember the Rules that you are to act by. Else in vain doe you receive and lay up Rules, if when occasion is, you doe not apply them to the particular Case. To what purpose have you rules for prayer, if you do not remember and use them when you come to prayer? To what purpose have you rules to examine your selves by, if you do not observe them in examining your selves accordingly? As ever you desire to make any thing of your Religion, remember when you come to your tables, the rules that you are to eat by; when you go to your callings, make visits, read, or hear the word, be sure you think on the rules that you are to read by, or discourse by, or hear by, &amp;c. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think of God in every motion, but with a little pains, watchfullness, and prayer, you
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:62321:149"/>
may come to this, to mind your rule and your end at the entrance of every solemn action. And this I desire you to enjoyn upon your selves, and take a daily account of your selves, how tis performed. This would be indeed to keep up the power of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Oh be at the pains to put to this, and you will know what it is to walk with God, and to be in the fear of the Lord all the day long, and will have learnt that happy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> him down. So <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 5. <hi>Verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity:</hi> Not <hi>vain,</hi> but <hi>vanity</hi> it self: yea <hi>every,</hi> yea <hi>altogether,</hi> yea <hi>at his best state,</hi> he is <hi>altogether vanity. Job</hi> 11. 11. <hi>For he knoweth vain men.</hi> That is the proper Epethite that belongs to man. Man is a <hi>vain</hi> thing, and that in two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. He is <hi>Worthless,</hi> and <hi>Useless.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He is a worthless thing, Iob</hi> 11. 12. <hi>For vain man would be wise.</hi> In the original 'tis <hi>Empty man.</hi> Man is by Nature <hi>empty</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good thing. So the Apostle, <hi>in me, that is in my slesh dwelleth no good thing.</hi> There is nothing that is spiritually good left; all is lost by mans Apostacy from God. Yea, man is not onely nothing worth, but worse than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. We use to say that a man that is over head and ears in debt, is many thousands (it may be) worse than nothing: so is man, he is insinitely in his makers debt, and cannot
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:62321:152"/>
come out, as we acknowledge in that petition <hi>forgive our debts;</hi> where we acknowledge two things. (1) <hi>That we are in debt to God.</hi> (2) <hi>That we cannot pay him.</hi> This is the condition of man, he is infinitely in God's debt, &amp; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pay any thing: he hath nothing to pay.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He is a useless thing.</hi> Able to doe the Lord no service, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. Yea when he is recovered by grace, 'tis very poor service, that he can doe for his maker. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour teacheth his disciples to say they are unprofitable servants when they have done their duty. Yea we are so far from doing him any acceptable service, that we cannot but sin against him, and offend him. Now put these things together, and doth it not appear to be <hi>a wonder that God should make such account of man?</hi> Is he a <hi>vain thing, Worthless</hi> and <hi>Useless,</hi> and yet will God set his heart upon him? what a wonder is this!</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Man is a vile thing.</hi> If he were onely empty of good, this were something; but now he is not onely empty of all that is good, but he is full of all that is displeasing to God, <hi>Job</hi> 15. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Man drinketh in iniquity like water.</hi> This is the condition of man, he drinketh in sin as the fish drinks in water: Sin is his proper Element. The filthy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case lying before us is not more loathsome to us than we are to God in our sins. Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in himself is like a carcase lying in its crawling worms. Now is it not strange that so <hi>vain,</hi> yea, so <hi>vile</hi> a thing as man
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:62321:153"/>
have any room in Gods heart? How should we cry out with the <hi>Psamist</hi> here in the text, <hi>Lord what is man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. This will appear by considering <hi>What great account this great God hath of this poor thing man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What great account God hath of him, will appear (1) In what he hath laid out upon him. (2) In what he hath <hi>laid up for him.</hi> (3) By the <hi>near union he hath taken him into, with himself.</hi> (4.) By his <hi>near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him.</hi> (5) By his <hi>entertaining such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar communion with man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First. If you consider what God hath laid out upon him. The <hi>care,</hi> and the <hi>cost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>care.</hi> Ah brethren, this is strange grace, that the infinite God should lay out his care, his thoughts upon such a thing as man is, yet thus he doth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>For he careth for you.</hi> Now this will appear worthy of your admiration, if you consider what this care is. 'Tis a <hi>Paternal</hi> care, a <hi>Personal</hi> care, a <hi>Perpetual</hi> care.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a Paternal care. A Fatherly care. As a father pittieth his children, so the Lord pittieth them that fear him.</hi> So <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. God calls them his <hi>Iewels.</hi> Now if a mans house be on fire, he will be sure to save his Jewels. But if a mans children be in the house, he will rather loose his Jewels than his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And if he saveth any Child, then that that is the dutifull child. <hi>So God will spare them as a son that serveth him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Paternal care is, upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:62321:153"/>
               <hi>Natural, Constant, Vigorous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>It is a natural care which is in fathers,</hi> and this is in God. This the <hi>Apostle</hi> commend ed <hi>Timothy</hi> for, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>That he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> rally cared for their state.</hi> That which is n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural is delightful: so is Gods care of his people; he takes pleasure in it, in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and designs to bring his people to glory. Yea God is so Ambitious (as we may so speak,) that he is angry when we will not cast our cares upon him. He would have us be carefull for nothing.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) Upon this account, <hi>it is also constant and uninterupted.</hi> That whis is Natural is constant. As the fire doth naturally give heat, therefore it alwaies doth so. But that which is contrary to Nature is quickly gone: As if you heat water over the fire, the heat is quickly gone again; because it is against na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now Gods care is Natural, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Constant.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) That which is Natural <hi>is vigorous.</hi> That which is done against Nature is done slowly. As when you cast a stone upward. Now Gods care is a <hi>Natural</hi> care, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>vigorous</hi> care.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is a Personal care.</hi> God will look to us himself, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 2. It is true God doth put others to look to us, but he will not trust us with these, but he will look to us himself.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It is a perpetual care.</hi> As when <hi>Daniel</hi> was to be cast into the Lions Den, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>The king set his heart upon Daniel to deliver
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:62321:154"/>
him, &amp;c.</hi> So Gods heart is set upon us. He is bent for our good, he is still designing for us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 5. <hi>Many O Lord — are thy thoughts to us ward,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As it appears by the <hi>care,</hi> so <hi>by the cost that God hath laid out upon man.</hi> (1) <hi>The Riches of his love.</hi> (2) <hi>The gold of his grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The riches of his love.</hi> The free grace, favour and love of God is called <hi>Riches</hi> in Scripture, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 7. The Apostle speaking of the <hi>Riches</hi> of Christ shews how unsearchable they are, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 8. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33. <hi>O the depth of the Riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God.</hi> Now all these were laid out to determine mans deliverance. They are glorious Riches that God doth lay out upon his sons and servants, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. And well may these be called <hi>Riches.</hi> There must be two things to make Riches, there must be (1) <hi>Plenty.</hi> (2) <hi>Preciousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First. There must be <hi>Plenty.</hi> For a little of never so good, will never make a man Rich.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There <hi>must be Preciousness,</hi> for abundance of that which is worthless will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make a man Rich. Now both of these are in Gods Mercy, there is <hi>plenty,</hi> and <hi>'tis precious.</hi> The Mercy and Grace of God is very precious. <hi>David</hi> sought most for this, when others set their hearts upon other things, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. And as 'tis of great worth, so 'tis of great plenty. It is abundance of grace that God doth put forth in repairing mans Nature, and making him a New Creature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:62321:154"/>But this great cost of God upon us will further appear, in that he hath laid out upon us. (1) <hi>His Creatures.</hi> (2) <hi>His Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>His Creatures upon us.</hi> That he should lay out all these Creatures upon us, These Heavens, and this Earth to be for the comfort of man, Oh how doth this discover Gods goodness to man! This made <hi>David</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. 5, 6, 7, 8. Here you may see what an account God doth make of man, in that he should make him a little god among the Creatures; that their sheaf should bow to his sheaf; that they must spend and be spent for man: yea, the invisible Creatures, the Angels, they must be ministring spirits, <hi>for them who are the heirs of Salvation, Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In that he hath laid out his Christ upon us.</hi> This was a costly gift indeed. It is much that God should give his Creatures to dye for us, to give us food: but oh that he should give us his <hi>Christ</hi> to dye for us, Oh how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibly hath the Lord advanced man in this! In this he hath abundantly shewed how man was esteemed by him. This shews that he had a great regard to us. We were redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blood of Christ, which was the blood of God himself, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. Now is it not an admirable thing, that so mean a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase should be made with so great a price? This was that which God did commend his strange love with, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16.) that he laid down his life for us. Look into thy self man, what hast thou that thou shouldest have this
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:62321:155"/>
great purchase to be laid out for thee? Oh How should man be continually in the prais<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> of God!</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In the gold of his grace, that God hath la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d out upon m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>n.</hi> Grace is call'd the true Riches, and this hath been laid out upon man, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. It is called gold, yea 'tis much more precious than gold. When you see the Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n attired in Gold, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. all this is to set forth the Grace that is upon the Saints of God. I tell thee Christian, thou that hast but one dram of Grace, he hath give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> thee more than if he had given thee a whole world. In the Creation there were some footsteps of God upon other Creatures; but upon man there was his Image. And now that God should distinguish thee from others by one dram of Grace, this is admirable!</p>
            <p>Secondly. It appears what great account this great God hath of this poor thing, Man, <hi>in what he hath laid up for him.</hi> This makes the <hi>Psalmist</hi> to cry out as one overcome with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31. 19. <hi>O How great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee!</hi> It is much that God hath laid out for us, but more that he hath laid up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>or us. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> could not express it, he could but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it onely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> heard, neither have entred into the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rt of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. Eye hath no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> seen.</hi> The eye of man hath seen much; especially those that have travailed in other
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:62321:155"/>
Countries. But the eye of man hath not seen any thing that may be compared with this that God hath prepared. Nor <hi>ear heard.</hi> We have heard o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> more than we have seen; We have heard of gold Mines and the like, that are in other parts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the world; but the ear hath not heard of any thing like this. And though the eye hath seen much, and the ear hath heard more; yet the heart of man can conceive of more again; yet <hi>the heart of man cannot conceive</hi> of what God hath laid up for them that love him.</p>
            <p>Now lay these two together, what God hath laid out upon man, and what he hath laid up for him, and will it not appear that the great God makes a great account of man? How can you chuse but cry out in the words of the <hi>Psalmist, What is man, &amp;c.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly. This will appear by <hi>that near uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he hath taken him up into, with himself.</hi> Oh how wonderfully hath God dignified man in this? By uniting his Nature to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, as 'tis in the second person of the Trinity, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us,</hi> or, <hi>in us.</hi> That God should take up the nature of man into personal union with himself, what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable dignity is this! So the Apostle, <hi>he took not upon him the nature of Angels, but the seed of Abraham, Heb.</hi> 2. 16. Herein is man dignified above the Angels of glory, in the near union between God and man in the Godhead. This is that <hi>which the Angels do desire to pry into:</hi> well may the Apostle say,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:62321:156"/>
               <hi>great is the mystery of godliness:</hi> and this is the top of it, <hi>God manifest in the flesh.</hi> Greatly hath God dignified man in these two things, that Man should be <hi>partaker of the Divine Nature;</hi> and that <hi>God should partake of the Humane Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Man should partake of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Oh this is a great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge that we should bear the Image of God. Let the world scorn at holiness; yet I tell thee, Man, that hast one dram of grace, he hath done more for thee, than he hath done for all the world. How ever this is out of fashion in world, I am sure 'tis not in heaven. O glory in this, you that are made partakers of Gods Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In his taking upon him our Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> In this, mans Nature is more exalted yet. The Nature of Man in Christ is lifted up <hi>far above all Principalities and Powers,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. Angels, and Authorities, and Powers being made subject unto him.</hi> This is spoken of Christ, not onely in his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but his Humane Nature, for his Divine Nature was there before: therefore it must be understood of his Humane Nature. And he hath all power of Angels and Authorities, and he sends them forth to Minister at his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples need, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Ephes.</hi> 1, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead, and set him a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, and power, and might, and dominion- And hath put all things under his feet, and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:62321:156"/>
gave him to be head over all things to the Church.</hi> Mark, the Man Jesus Christ is head and Lord over all things: for it is spoken of Christ as to his Humane Nature (as I told you before) for 'tis spoken of him as <hi>raised from the dead,</hi> which was his Humane Nature. So that you see how wonderfully mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is exalted in Christ.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. <hi>It appears by his near Relation to him.</hi> This is another way by which God hath signified what a great account he hath of man, that he will take him near to himself. You know 'tis a great honour to be next to the King. Now what a great honour is it for a man to be next to God? now he hath taken man near to him. (1) <hi>As a husband.</hi> (2) <hi>As a father.</hi> (3) <hi>As a friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>As a Husband. They twain shall be one flesh.</hi> God hath owned man in this Relation, <hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 5. <hi>Thy Maker is thy husband, the Lord of hosts is his name.</hi> O what a thing is this that he should not be ashamed to own us in that Relation! <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>I am married unto you, Eph.</hi> 5. 30. We are flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth thee unto me for ever.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>spoused you unto one husband.</hi> O what a great exaltation is this, that we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>bride</hi> of Christ, the <hi>wife</hi> and <hi>spouse</hi> of Christ! what honour hath the Bride, the Lambs wife! A believer is espoused to Christ: and therefore the Apostle propounds the example of Christ to his Church, unto men towards their wives, to imitate his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:62321:157"/>
in the performance of their duties to them. Now what a wonder is this that such beggars as we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>hould be taken from the dunghil &amp; be made a bride prepared for him!</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As a Father.</hi> So he is nearly related to us. This is an astonishing consideration, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1. O what a wonder is this, that he should take such a thing as man, so near to himself as to make him become his son! That he should take him from the dunghil of sin, From the dungeon of darkness, The family of Satan, The furnace of hell.</p>
            <p>There be two dignities confer'd upon man here. (1) <hi>He is taken into his family.</hi> (2) <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to sit at his Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>He is taken into his family, Ephes.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.</hi> Mark, the Lord is a great <hi>house-keeper,</hi> and all believers are his <hi>family.</hi> And though these be in different degrees and orders, some glorified in heaven, and some here on carth; yet we are all but one family; so that we are taken into the same family and houshold that the Saints in glory be in. And what a dignity is this! <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the Saints, and of the houshold of God.</hi> We that were sometimes <hi>strangers,</hi> are now by our Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion become of <hi>Gods houshold.</hi> You may think they shall not want good keeping, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>He that provides not for those of his own house, is worse than an infidel.</hi> God
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:62321:157"/>
will be sure to provide for those that be of his own house. Now we that are his children, shall thus be provided for. O how doth <hi>David</hi> commend their state that shall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to dwell in Gods house? He prefers it above all the honour of Princes dignity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. This is our priviledge. We are in Gods house, of his family. If the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did think the servants of <hi>Solomon</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, how much more blessed are they that are the servants of Jesus Christ? <hi>Happy</hi> (said she) <hi>are those thy servants,</hi> &amp;c. but how much more may this be said of Gods children.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>We are admitted to sit at his Table.</hi> God doth admit his children to his own Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This is the childrens portion; and when he hath fed them a while at his table here, he will translate them to an upper-table in the other world, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 28, 29, 30. <hi>Ye are they which have continued with me in my Temptations. And I appoint unto you a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as my father hath appointed unto me; that ye may eat and drink at my Table.</hi> This is the priviledge of Gods children, O what a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is this, to sit and eat and drink with Christ at his Table! This is in part given us here, and shall be perfected upon us hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. God sayes to believers as <hi>David</hi> said to <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 7. <hi>I will surely shew thee kindness, &amp;c. and thou shalt eat bread at my Table continually.</hi> And therefore sith we are admitted to this priviledge to eat and drink at God's Table, let us do as he, and say with him, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>And he bowed himself

            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Relation of a friend.</hi> This you know is a very familiar and loving relation. Among<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and opened his mind to them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 6 8, 14. Christ doth open and reveal the fathers mind and will to believers. And as he is pleased to converse familiarly with us, so he doth let us converse with him.

            <p>MY beloved this text is so full of mercy, on Gods part, and so full of comfort for us, that methinks I may close the book, and have done as soon as I have begun: me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the text might be a Sermon of it self. In it you have set before you the joy and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of heaven for the recovery of poor, dead, lost sinners.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You have heavens joy and triumph for them.

            <p>There are four Observations that I shall commend to you from the words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Observ. <hi>That a Sinner in his Natural condition, is not onely diseased, but dead: not onely strayed, but lost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Obs. <hi>That there is a possibility even for dead Sinners to be raised, for lost sinners to be recovered.</hi> Consider this you that are here, that are touched with the sense of your mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. If any souls are touched with the sense of their misery and undone condition, consider this that you may be found. It hath been thus with all the saints of <hi>God.</hi> They were <hi>dead and lost;</hi> and yet are <hi>alive and are found:</hi> and why may not you as well as they? Oh pray and use the means: Why should not you be turned too?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Obs. <hi>That it is a most glorious and blessed change that God doth work in the state of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:62321:161"/>
when he bringeth him to himself, from the state that he was in; no less than from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead to be alive; from being lost to be found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Obs. <hi>That it is mateer of Heavens joy and triumph, when poor dead Sinners are revived; and lost Sinners are recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Bring hither the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>It is the third of these Observations that I intend to insist upon. <hi>That it is a most blessed and glorious change that God doth work in the state of a believer, &amp;c.</hi> I shall open this in its several parts. It is a great change that <hi>God</hi> doth work.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>From being dead to be alive.</hi> Regeneration is not such a change as doth consist in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a duty, or leaving such a sin that thou could'st not well live in. It is pittiful to think, how many take the leaving of one sin to be the new birth; No, it is no less than from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead to be alive again.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>It is such a change, as from being lost to be found.</hi> A sinner, in his Natural state is a <hi>lost</hi> man, in a lost condition: but when he is recovered by conversion he is <hi>found</hi> again. <hi>The Son of man is come to seek and save that which was lost.</hi> And so in this <hi>Luke</hi> 15. What was this <hi>lost sheep,</hi> and <hi>lost groat,</hi> and <hi>lost Son?</hi> What was the meaning of all this, but the <hi>recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of lost Souls?</hi> So that its a great change, a coming from death to life; from being lost to be found. <hi>If our gospel be hid, 'tis hid to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:62321:161"/>
those that are lost:</hi> (that is, for the present they are lost,) but when they are converted, then, of lost they are found.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> Is it so blessed and glorious a change, that <hi>God</hi> doth work in the condition of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, when he bringeth him to himself; no less than from being dead to be alive, from being lost to be found? <hi>Then you that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers rejoyce in, and be thankfull for that blessed and happy condition that God hath tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated you into.</hi> Ah brethren, how may you look one upon another, and consider what <hi>God</hi> hath done for you?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How that you were dead, and are alive again;</hi> You were diseased, yea dead crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. diseased, full of all that may render you miserable: all diseases are met together in a poor sinner. Now that <hi>God</hi> hath reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thy diseased soul, yea, thy dead soul, and brought thee to life again, Oh what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of joy is this! How should you wonder at so great a change as this? We read that at the Miracles that our Saviour did upon the diseased, there was great astonishment among the people; they were amazed at this, but here are more miraculous cures than those; the cure of dead souls is more than the cure of dead bodies. O Brethren, if all the diseased that Christ had cured should have confer'd together, what strange stories would they have told? One would have said, I was born deaf; and he said <hi>Ephatha,</hi> and my ears were opened. Another I was born
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:62321:162"/>
blind and he anointed mine eyes, &amp; I washed and received my sight. Another, I was thirty eight years under a disease, and by a word of his mouth I was healed. Another, I was eighteen years in a sad condition, and by a touch of his garment I was cured. And so of the rest. Ah brethren, you were not onely diseased, but dead; and Christ hath recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you. O! what matter of thankfulness is here? You that are believers, should not look one upon another without wondering. What should move you to wonder if not this? It will be a strange change when we shall see all the sons of <hi>Adam</hi> come forth at last out of their graves; when we shall see those that were buried in the great deep, brought forth by the power of Christ; and made all appear together, this will be a strange change. But the change of dead bodies is not so great as the change of dead souls. O how should you praise <hi>God</hi> that hath raised you from so great a death as this! How is it that we are taken up no more with wonderment for this that he hath done for our souls? God doth rejoyce over it; it is heavens joy when a lost sinner is found. And doth <hi>God</hi> and Angels take notice of it, and rejoyce, and do you not take notice of it? O what ingratitude is this!</p>
            <p>This should excite sinners to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eed their return to <hi>God;</hi> for this will rejoyce heaven and earth. Shall I leave my wine (saith the Vine) whereby I make glad the heart of <hi>God</hi> and man? I may say truly, the recovery of a sinner makes glad the heart of God and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:62321:162"/>
man; not onely will Christians and Ministers rejoyce over thee when thou turnest to God: but God himself will rejoyce over thee, when thou returnest: he will call for <hi>the fatted Calf, &amp;c.</hi> O the Mirror of unthankfulness, that is upon our hearts, that we should be no more moved with any work that God hath done upon our souls! You that are convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wrought upon by Sanctification, one would think that you should be able to enter upon no other talk than this, to tell what God hath done for your Souls. My brethren, if while we are here together, we should see our dead friends, that have been dead ten, or twenty, or thirty years agoe, to eat and drink, and walk, and talk, and converse with us, how should we be astonished at it? And how would they wonder one at another? One that dyed at such a time; and another, that dyed at such a time and here they live again, and talk again. But now here is a greater wonder than this; here are dead souls, and they are brought together and live again, and talk again. O! me thinks you should wonder to see one another restored from so great a death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will say, how shall I know that I am recovered from death to life?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I shall give together the Characters, and the priviledges of you that are recovered from death to life, that so your evidence and comfort may be promoted together.</p>
            <p>And there are these four that belong to you First. <hi>He hath raised you from a state of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:62321:163"/>
corruption and rottenness, to a state of health, and holiness.</hi> You know a state of death is a state of corruption: the grave is a place of rottenness and putrifaction. You that lye in your old lusts still, certainly you have no portion or part in this matter. But you that are changed are brought from this state: a state of <hi>sin,</hi> is a state of <hi>corruption.</hi> The Scripture e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where speaks of sin by the Metaphor that carries in it the highest pitch of filthiness, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 3. <hi>They are altogether become silthy,</hi> or <hi>stinking.</hi> And so in <hi>Job</hi> 15. 16. <hi>How much more abominable and silthy is man, which drinketh in iniquity like water?</hi> Man in his natural state is a most silthy creature: no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to set forth the odiousness of his condition, before he is sanctified by grace; and the reason is, because he <hi>drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in iniquity like water.</hi> As the fish doth swim in, and take in water naturally: so sin is his very element wherein he doth natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly live as it were. Thus the <hi>Apostle, Rom.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Their throat is an open Sepulchre.</hi> And so our Saviour compares the Pharisees to to <hi>whited Sepulchres.</hi> But now you that are believers, God hath raised you from a state of <hi>Rottenness</hi> to a state of <hi>health and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Grace is the health of the soul; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness is the soundness of the soul. An upright heart, is a sound heart. O beloved, what a priviledge is this to be translated from a state of corruption, to a state of holiness? O what cause have you of thankfulness, that can find the stamp of God again upon your
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:62321:163"/>
souls? you are highly favoured indeed whom God hath priviledged with this. There is all that is desirable in grace and holiness; Riches, Wealth, beauty, all. How often do we read of the <hi>beauty</hi> of <hi>Holiness?</hi> And so of its <hi>Riches</hi> too; <hi>I counsel thee to buy of me gold, that thou mayest be Rich, Rev.</hi> 3. 18. 'Tis the true Riches. And so it is <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> too, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>It shall be health to thy Navel, and marrow to thy bones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>From a state of darkness, to a Land of Light.</hi> You know the grave is a place of darkness; and death, a state of darkness. Thus is it in the Spiritual death. Dead souls are all in darkness, under the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. The grave for our dead bodies is a place of darkness: but the grave for dead souls, is a place of utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, of everlasting darkness. The grave is Formidable, and deep. You know when a body is dead, it must be buried, that it may not annoy us. God hath provided a grave to bury dead souls in out of his sight; and where do you think that this grave is? Why Hell is the grave for dead souls. The rich man was dead, and was buried, but where was he bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried? His soul was in Hell, so some translate this place, <hi>And being buried, in Hell he lift up his eyes, Luke,</hi> 16. 22, 23. Hell is a place of darkness, and thick darkness. O that is horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indeed, that is reserved for poor impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sinners; <hi>the blackness of darkness for ever, Jude</hi> 13. He doth not onely say <hi>darkness,</hi> but <hi>blackness of darkness for ever.</hi> Ah brethren,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:62321:164"/>
this is that which Christ hath recovered you from, from death to life. If you go down into the grave, and see how the dead do lye in darkness, and silence, how formidable is that! But oh how will it be, to see the grave of hell where dead souls are buried! This was your place before you were sanctified. Ah brethren, what manner of praise, what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of deliverance should you compass the throne of Gods grace withal, who have such a change wrought upon you?</p>
            <p>Thirdly. <hi>From a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Impotence, to a state of power.</hi> A natural state is an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent state, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>When we were yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out strength, in due time, Christ dyed for the ungodly.</hi> As a dead man is not able to move a finger to put off the worms that crawl upon his body and face: So a dead soul cannot get the victory over his flesh, and lusts. He is under an impossibility of doing any thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable before God. But now God hath given you strength, that you should <hi>leap and walk, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> praise God.</hi> God did put strength into thy feet when he recovered thee from death to life, that tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> be able to go thorow dissiculties for his names sake. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, those that are altogether without strength were certainly never brought to a true and spiritual life. If thou art brought from death to life, thou hast some strength. it may be it is but a little strength; But every Saint hath a little strength, so that he doth not live in the wilsul practice of any sin. If thou hast not thus much thou art dead in thy sins.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:62321:164"/>Fourthly, <hi>From a state of Insensibleness, to a state of Sense.</hi> A Dead man is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sense; He hath Eyes, but he seeth not; and Ears, but he heareth not: And thus it is with a dead soul. But now you that are believers, you are raised from this miserable state. I may say to you, Blessed are your Eyes, for you see; and your Ears, for you hear. O what a change hath he wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you!</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. He hath opened your eyes, when others are in blindness.</hi> Brethren! what a change is this? How many do you see that live where the Gospel is Preached, and yet remain ignorant? O! what thankfulness should this provoke you to? You are restor'd to your spiritual sense. Before, you thought it the smallest matter in the world to sin against God: Now, you look upon it after another manner. O how should you bless God in those words of our Saviour, <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.</hi> O! How many be there of the wise men, &amp; great men of the world that have their eyes closed? God hath hid these things from them that they cannot see them: But your eyes see, give God the glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He hath bored your Ears, when others are in deafness.</hi> When others are like the deaf Adder, he hath given you the hearing Ear, the obedient Ear; O! consider this, and be thankful. Thou hast of thy self a heart

as obstinate as any other heart i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> the world. Now if God hath given thee ears to hear, O bless his Name! How often may we call upon a Dead man, and he never hear? so we may call upon dead souls, and they hear not, with their souls at least, though they hear with their ears.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>God hath loosed your Tongues, when others are dumb and silent.</hi> O what mercy is this? Beloved, you could not breath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God your Prayers and Requests with lise and fervour as you do, unless God did unlose your tongues, and open your mouths. Man's lips are locked up, and his tongue tyed up, that he cannot utter himself be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>NOw will I make known to my dearest Friend, some of the thoughts of my heart this morning, besore I begin to write to thee; There was once a poor soul imprisoned in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Well, he sets open the Floodgates, and in he dives into the fathomless depths of an evil heart, but there he could sind no bottom; Then up he springs, and begins to take the Dimentions, and view the Massie weight of the Crown incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible: His heart grew hot within him, and while he was musing, the fire burned, and on a sudden he pathetically smites on his breast, and out he breaks into this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</p>
            <p>Ah wretch, what a sight is here! methinks my heart is like the Chambers of Imagery, I can turn me no way, but the loathsom sight and silthy stench of my Corruptions comes up into my Eyes and Nostrils, my pollutions are so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

some filthy Ulcer, which makes me filthy in my own eyes, and how much more to the pure eyes of my spotless maker; when I turn my eye inward, and go about from Cell to Cell, I pass from one to the other, and am fain to write, <hi>Lord have mercy upon me</hi> on every dore: Every faculty is as a cage of unclean Birds, and O the noysome lusts that lodge and live within them! I look'd into my memory, and O what a Magazine of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was there! weak I find it, and slippery when any good is committed to it: Alas, methinks I am like a narrow mouthed bottle, that takes in but drops when the bounty of Heaven pours down by showrs. Though the dew of Heaven distill as the rain, yet how little do I take in? how much is spilt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides? but yet this is not all, there is a leak in my Vessel that lets all that is good run out, only the dregs are left behind. 'Tis little good that I take in amongst a world of evil, and presently my Rudder lets go the good corn, and the chaff is kept behind: Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious it is to receive, faithful to retain what should be forgotten: well thought I, I will shut up this, but I heard the voice, as to the Prophet of old, speaking to me, <hi>turn thine Eyes, and thou shalt see yet greater Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then these.</hi> Look into thine understanding.

and wander in the path of error, and though the light shine in darkness; yet the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness comprehendeth it not: How mean and shallow is my capacity? so dull that I cannot conceive, nor apprehend the mysteries of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, but am ready to ask with unskilful <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> what do these things mean? what Riddles are many Gospel truths to my soul? I am apt rather to dispute them, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them; as if I had rather judge of things by the light of reasons candle, than God's Sun: O fool that I am, and slow of heart to believe, how is my understanding tyed to my senses, that I am apt to believe little but what I see? what poor low conceptions have I of God, how little a portion do I know of him? he goeth by me, and I see him not; he passeth on, and I perceive him not; how little is it that my understanding will reach too? and how grossely do I apprehend and conceive that little? Although Christ hath anointed my eyes, yet my imperfect sight of the things of the Gospel is like his we read of, who saw men walking as trees. But you, O Blessed Souls who are now in Glory, you see face to face what I see in a glass darkly; your Sun is risen, you see by the clearest Meridian light, what I am fain to grope for in the dark; those mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

O when shall that which is in part be done away? when shall the day dawn, and the day star arise in my heart? my soul waits for the Lord, more than they that wait for the morning, yea, more than they that wait for the morning. Alas, how doth my spirit sink oftentimes, when I consider the imperfections of my understanding? how I am at every turn baffled and posed in my own thoughts, and perplex'd in a labyrinth of difficulties, out of which I cannot extricate my self. Oh when will the time come that I shall see as I am seen; and that I shall have all my objections answered, my doubts resolved, my difficulties removed? Ah this cloud of flesh, what glory dost thou keep from shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon me? how can I see through all this dirt? well but in thy light Lord I shall see light: In the mean while I should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, if I could walk up to that dim light I have; but alas: I have so stubborn, so head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong a will, that it will not use the light I

I preach up diligence, and I live in sloth; I preach up humility, and live in pride; I speak of the vanity of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet I idolize it; of the sinfulness of sin, yet I cherish it; of the lise of faith, yet am a stranger to it. I believe that sin is the greatest evil, and that Gods wrath is the greatest Curse; but alas! how strangely do I live below these principles! how am I apt and ready notwithstanding, to choose sin, rather than affliction, and venture the displeasure of the Almighty, to gain credit and applause amongst men? If it be hard to believe, how much harder is it to practise? I know but little, and yet how little do I of what I know? The flesh is still lusting against the spirit, so that I cannot do the things that I would; yet though my strength be but weak, how short do I come of doing all I can? and what a
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:62321:168"/>
secret Antipathy is there in my heart against the truths of God, and the wayes of God? though my understanding be over-powred with the evidence of truth; yet I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in the love of it. O the deep enmity that there is in my heart against Christ, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the personal excellencies that I know to be in him, and all the benefits I have received from him! he shed his heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood for me, and yet I do begrudge any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for him. Oh how willingly did he bear the Cross for me! Yea, was exceedingly straitned till that Baptism was accomplished, <hi>I delight</hi> (saith he) <hi>to do thy will O God,</hi> and yet he tells us this was the will of his Father, that he should lay down his life for his Sheep; yet do I murmur to bear any thing from or for him. Alas, he did far more readily part with his life for me, than I do with a lust for him; Yea, those sins that were my Saviours Murtherers, do I entertain and cherish in my heart, and yet I say I love him; but how can I love two Masters? so much of the love of sin as there is in my heart, so much enmity is there against Christ; and O how much is there then in my heart? to this day I flatter my self that I love him, but alas! where is my tenderness of his honour, my care to please him, my zeal for him, my delight in him, my longing after him: Ah where are these fruits of my love to him? Alas! what a stranger am I to these things! well may he reply upon me, as she upon <hi>Sampson, How canst thou say thou lovest me, when thy heart

blessed Arms, you are all the Beloved Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and have the priviledge to lean on his Breast; you are alwayes in the Lap, and are warmed continually in his bosom, when my affections freeze with cold, you feel the beatings of his heart, and see the tender wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings within, the warm influence whereof melts you into the like affection; and thus are you for ever Blessed, receiving, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning love; when my wretched heart to this day retains abundance of enmity against him, who loved me, and gave himself for me. A great misery it is not to have a return of love, but my misery is not to return love for love. Ah wretched heart, who can but be out of love with such a heart, as will not be in love with such a Saviour? Oh it troubles me, not so much that I receive no more Love Tokens from him, but that I can send him no more. I beg not so much to be beloved by him, as that I may love him: I could be content to have fewer expressions of love from him, so I might have more love wrought in my heart towards him: well, but the time will come when my spark shall be all in a flame, and I shall be all love, when I shall for ever dwell in God, and dwell in Love. I shall shortly be where no nipping winter shall cool the heat of my affections, where no waters shall be able to quench my flame, no, my fire shall never go out more; But I shall be continually taken up in loving and admiring, and my soul shall be for ever possessed with perfect Love: I shall
