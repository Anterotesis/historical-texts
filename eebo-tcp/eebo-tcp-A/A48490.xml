            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yea, he made all things, and in through and by all our Sences, he informs ſuch as are Veſſels fit for the Maſters uſe; it is meer Atheiſm to think God, when he had made this World, went out of it, and left it to his Creatures to dwell in it without him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh no, in him we live, move, and have our being: He is the Fountain of all Life, and is All-hearing, All-ſeeing, All-ſmelling, All<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>taſting, and All-feeling, and we are and have all from him who is and filleth all things; but ſo far is Man gone outward and become Duſt, that he is inſenſible of the life of God, and knoweth not that God liveth in his Life; and therefore when the Scriptures ſay God purchaſed his Church with his Blood, we underſtand it only imputatively; when the Scriptures ſay it repented God that he made Man to dwell on the Earth, we are apt to think him to be altogether ſuch a one as our ſelves; and when we read, God is not as man, that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, then we think that all the Evil we meet with was by him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, ſhould come upon us from all Eternity: and all this, and almoſt every Text elſe we abuſe for want of knowing Mans going out of Gods will into his own, is the real cauſe he ever knew Evil; and by a continual progreſs of going out from God into himſelf, from <hi>Adam</hi> even to this day the Proverb is verified, He that lives longeſt muſt fetch his Wood fartheſt: Happy days all men would have, but few was ever perſwaded to go into that Countrey where true happineſs is only to be found: If then it be yet poſſible to perſwade any to return to God, he is told demonſtratively that he is not far from every one of us: we cannot pronounce or ſpell one word good or bad without him, which ſhews the Word, which is God, is in our mouths, as well as good thoughts proves him in our hearts; return then to God and make him no longer ſerve your ſins, by harbouring hard thoughts of God and thy Brother, nor ſpeaking ill of any thing, but ſtudy to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt thy love to God by doing good to thy Brother, and thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive good from him that is all good: Farewell.</p>

               <p>Note, <hi>aeiou</hi> being taken from between the Conſonants, the Conſonants are found in five Diviſions: The firſt two Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons conſiſt of three Letters, as appears, <hi>bcd,</hi> and <hi>fgh.</hi> The third Diviſion of four Letters, <hi>klmn.</hi> The fourth of five, as <hi>pqrst.</hi> And the fifth of four, as <hi>wxyz;</hi> take then the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Letters out of each diviſion, and they are <hi>cglmrxy,</hi> where we find juſt the number ſeven and no more, then what remains are <hi>bdf, hkn, pqs, twz,</hi> which are twelve in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and no more: the five Vowels being the Letters that ſpells the Great Name of God <hi>Jeova,</hi> are thus placed, the Centeral Letter is <hi>I,</hi> and the firſt is <hi>A,</hi> put that which in the Alphabet is firſt, laſt, and the Centeral Letter firſt, and then they ſtand in this order, <hi>Jeova:</hi> Alſo this World having but the Number nine in its Arithmetick, we underſtand the firſt diviſion aptly ſhadows out the Divine <hi>Sol, Sul,</hi> and <hi>Mercury:</hi> The next divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being three, ſignifies the natural <hi>Sol, Sul,</hi> and <hi>Mercury:</hi> The third diviſion of four, ſhadows out the four forms to fire, that conſtitutes the great Soul of the World, from whence each Creature in the three Kingdoms of Minerals, Vegitables, and Animals, have their immediate Life and Power of Motion, either Augmentation or Dimunition. The fourth diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five, ſhadows out the five Sences which every Creature hath the Exerciſe of, according to its nature and property and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree he ſtands in: The laſt diviſion being four, rightly ſhadows out the four Elements; ſo that God, the Divine Nature, and this whole World, is truly diſcerned in the Alphabet, that this World is made living, and is maintained in life by the Word of God, may not be denied, Chriſt in and through whom the Word was made Fleſh, ſaith, <hi>I am the Life of the World:</hi> Now to ſuppoſe that God ſpake this word naked in Nature, is to leave no place for a Mediator, for the word is God, who is the true Golden Apple, and the Divine Nature is the Silver Picture in which the word was ſpoken into this World as it's Caſe, or Vaile; and ſo long as God in Chriſt is in this World, this World is an Adequate ſhadow of the Original World, or elſe how ſhould the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto any thing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110332:4"/>
here, or we be able to underſtand the things that are Inviſible by the things that are ſeen; and by the things that are made his Eternal Power and God-head; that is, the maker thereof: by the 12 Signs we underſtand the 12 Gates of the <hi>New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> by the 7 Planets, the 7 Spirits of God, who are the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars upon which Wiſdom hath built her Houſe, and ſtand in an Eternal Unity of Will: by the Sun Moon and Stars we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand God to be the head of Chriſt, and Chriſt the head of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and every Man, who as Stars ſhall ſhine forth in our true Native Countrey, as the Angels do now, if we attain the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, through proving our ſelves to be the Called of God, by obeying his Calls, ſo as to work out our Salvation with fear and trembling, and ſo make our Calling and Election ſure. But if God in Chriſt were not in this World to be underſtood, then our higheſt Number is but nine, and the ninth Plague of <hi>Egypt</hi> was darkneſs; ſo that, as it is true, Chriſt is the life of the World; he is alſo the light of the World, and is that light that is true, and enlightens every man that cometh into the World, and is our power of diſcerning; by him Kings Raign, and Princes Decree Juſtice: God according to his Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Divine Nature, is called Chriſt: Chriſt according to his appearance in this World's Fleſh is called Man. Thus God was manifeſt in the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>Alſo, our Letters being twice 12, rightly points to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal World, where the Number 12 is found, and makes this Worlds Glory a ſhadow: And that we have the Croſs placed before the Alphabet, rightly ſignifies, That the Father offered up his Son, that he might reconcile by, in, and through him, this World from the very Foundation, or ever God could be manifeſt therein, before the being of any Creature, who are ſhadowed out by our Letters, as may be known; for where the uſe of Letters have not been, they imaged their mind by <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliphicks,</hi> uſing Creatures inſtead of Letters: Alſo that we muſt Crucify our minds to Senſuality, before we can attain the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Underſtanding, or underſtand the Spirit vailed by the Letter: Alſo that we have a little <hi>a</hi> in our Alphabet rightly ſhadows out God received up into Glory in the Perſon of our Lord Jeſus, through his Aſcention to the right hand of the Majeſty on high, to appear for his Brethren that live by the ſame Faith, called the Faith of the Son of God: Alſo all Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thongs
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110332:5"/>
rightly ſhadows out God in Chriſt in us, when uſed in the Spelling of any word, which ſhould teach us it is in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the word, which is God, we form our words. Theſe things the Antients no doubt did well underſtand, who firſt devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the uſe of Letters, for it is unreaſonable to believe that they were placed in this moſt Exellent and Significant Order by meer chance, though it hath perchance by us been little underſtood; is it to our praiſe, that we ſo little value our Anceſtors, as to throw away what we underſtand not, under the Notion of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, but ought to try all things, and hold faſt that which is good: And if the Learned will look into this work, they may, and I quection not, but more will be found, to the glory of God.</p>
               <p>Alſo, It is ſeen there is but two Numeral Letters in the five Vowels that ſpells the for ever Bleſſed Name <hi>Jeova,</hi> and they are <hi>J</hi> and <hi>V,</hi> which make the Number ſix and no more, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out that Gods Reſt is not in this World, but that hitherto (as Chriſt ſays) <hi>The Father worketh in Nature, and therefore Christ worketh;</hi> and till we are gathered up into the Spirit, we are ſtrangers to Gods Reſt, and toyl and labour, eating our Bread in the ſweat of our Brows, and have need of Litteral Verbal teaching: Alſo it is hereby evidently underſtood, that all that this World gives or can give, is but Beaſtial, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the number of a Man, that is a Child of this World only, is 666, for he hath all the three Principles, and is a continual worker for life, ſo that he cannot attain the Seventh day, but is ſhut up under the Covenant of works; notwithſtanding he is a worſhipper, it is but in the Worldly Sanctuary he worſhips, and only knows God Manifeſt in the outward Nature and Creature at the beſt, and cannot ſee within the Vaile; and the moſt, only worſhips the Beaſt or his Image; all which is promiſed to be Lively Explained in our next, if this be bid welcome: Alſo <hi>C</hi> being the Centeral Letter of the firſt diviſion which ſhadows out the Divine <hi>Sol, Sul,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> and ſignifies the firſt Planet <hi>Saturn,</hi> which is the Coagulating Power that makes all things Viſible and Tangeable: And <hi>R</hi> the Centeral Letter of the fourth diviſion that ſhadows out the Planet <hi>Mercy,</hi> which ſignifies Speech. It is yet far more Evident, that God is both the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all things, and is the power of Speech; his word being the Articulator, elſe no ſenſe could be ſpoken by us more then by the Beaſt that periſheth, but through Gods word we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to ſay, <hi>Fear God, and Honour the King.</hi>
