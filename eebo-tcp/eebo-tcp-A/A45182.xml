         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

glories, so we are too apt,
through ignorance, or pusil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity,
to undervalue our
selves in respect of our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
condition; wee are far
more noble and excellent
then we account our selves.
It is our faith that must raise
our thoughts to a due estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our greatnesse; and
must shew us how highly we
are descended, how royally
we are allied, how gloriously
estated: that onely is it, that

and bring heaven down to us:
Through the want of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
whereof, it comes to
passe, that, to the great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of our souls, we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to think of Christ Jesus
as a stranger to us: as one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loof

off in another world;
apprehended onely by fits,
in a kind of ineffectuall spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,

by the powerfull operation
of this grace in our hearts, to
finde so heavenly an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation
of Christ to our

may truly say, I am one with
Christ, Christ is one with
me. Had we not good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

it could bee no lesse then a
blasphemous arrogance to
lay claim to the royall bloud

pleased the God of heaven so

as in the multitudes
of his mercies to admit and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96769:10"/>

to passe over this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant

and perfunctory glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but, let thy heart dwell
upon it, as that which must
stick by thee in all extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and chear thee up, when
thou art forsaken of all
worldly comforts: Doe not
then conceive of this union,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96769:11"/>
as some imaginary thing,
that hath no other beeing
but in the braine; whose
faculties have power to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
and bring home to
it self, far remote substances;
possessing it self in a sort of
whatsoever it conceives: Doe
not think it an union meerly
virtuall, by the participation
of those spirituall gifts and
graces which God worketh
in the soul; as the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
effects of our happy
conjunction with Christ;
Doe not think it an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
union in respect of some
circumstances and qualities
wherein we communicate
with him who is God and
man; nor yet a metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
union by way of figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
resemblance; but know
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96769:11"/>
that this is a true, reall, essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
substantiall union,
whereby the person of the
beleever is indissolubly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the glorious person of
the Son of God; know, that
this union is not more mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
then certain; that in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
unions there may bee
more evidence, there cannot
be more truth; neither is
there so firm and close an
union betwixt the soul &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as there is betwixt Christ
and the beleeving soul: for
as much as that may be seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by death, but this, never:
Away yet with all grosse car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality
of conceit; this union
is true, and really existent,
but yet spirituall; and if
some of the Ancients have
tearm'd it naturall and bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96769:12"/>
it hath been in respect of
the subject united, our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,

not in respect of the

is it the lesse reall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
spirituall. Spirituall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
neither have, nor put
forth any whit lesse vertue,
because sense cannot discern
their manner of working;
Even the Loadstone though

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96769:12"/>
Oh Saviour, thou art more

my sense feels that present,
but so as that I must lose it;
my faith sees and feels thee
so present with mee, that I
shall never be parted from
thee.</p>
                  <p>There is no resemblance,<note place="margin">§ 4. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by the head &amp; body.</note>
whereby the Spirit of God
more delights to set forth
the heavenly union betwixt
Christ and the beleever, then
that of the head and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
The head gives sense
and motion to all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the body; And the
body is one; not onely by the
continuity of all the parts
held together with the same
naturall ligaments, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with one and the same
skin; but much more by the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96769:13"/>
animation of the same soul
quickning that whole frame;
in the acting whereof, it is
not the large extent of the
stature, and distance of the
lims from each other, that
can make any difference;
The body of a child that is
but a span long, cannot bee
said to be more united, then
the vast body of a giantly son
of <hi>Anak</hi> whose height is as
the Cedars; and if we could
suppose such a body as high
as heaven it self, that one
soul which dwels in it, and
is diffused through all the
parts of it, would make it
but one entire body: Right
so, it is with Christ and his
Church; That one Spirit of
his which dwels in, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives
every beleever, unites
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96769:13"/>
all those far-distant members,
both to each other, and to
their head; and makes them
up into one true mysticall
body: So as now every true
beleever may, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
but with all holy
reverence, and all humble
thankfulnesse, say to his God
and Saviour; Behold, Lord,
I am (how unworthy soever)
one of the lims of thy body;
and therefore have a right to
all that thou hast, to all that
thou doest; Thine eye sees
for me; thine ear hears for
me; thine hand acts for me;
Thy life, thy grace, thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
is mine: Oh the
wonder of the two blessed
unions! In the personall u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
it pleased God to assume
and unite our humane nature
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96769:14"/>
the Deitie; In the spirituall
and mysticall, it pleases God
to unite the person of every
beleever to the person of the
Son of God: Our souls are
too narrow to blesse God
enough for these incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
mercies: Mercies,
wherein he hath preferred us
(be it spoken with all godly
lowlinesse) to the blessed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of heaven;<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>For verily he
took not upon him the nature of
Angels, but he took on him the
seed of</hi> Abraham; Neither
hath he made those glorious
spirits members of his mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

whom he hath (as it were) so
incorporated, that they are

theirs; according to that of

either more frequent, or more
full of lively expression, then
that of the conjugall union

Some wilde fancies there

he that ordained it in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,

Here is no contract in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

are of one substance with our
Saviour; and branching out
from him, and receiving the
sap of heavenly vertue from
his precious root, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be acceptably fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
But if the Analogie
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96769:21"/>
seem not to be so full, for
that the branch issues natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
from the tree, and the
fruit from the branch, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
we by nature have no part
in the Son of God; take that
clearer resemblance which
the Apostle fetches from the
stock and the griffe, or cion:
The branches of the wilde
olive are cut off;<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> and are
graffed with choice cions of
the good olive; those impes
grow, and are now, by this
insition, no lesse embodyed
in that stock then if they had
sprouted out by a natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation:
neither can be any
more separated from it then
the strongest bough that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
puts forth: In the mean
time that cion alters the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of that stock; and whiles
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96769:22"/>
the root gives fatnesse to
the stock, and the stocke
yeelds juice to the cion, the
cion gives goodnesse to the
plant, and a specification to
the fruit: so as whiles the
impe is now the same thing
with the stock, the tree is
different from it was; So it
is betwixt Christ and the
beleeving soul: Old <hi>Adam</hi>
is our wilde stock, what
could that have yeelded but
either none, or sowre fruit?
we are imped with the new
man, Christ; that is now
incorporated into us, we are
become one with him; our
nature is not more ours, then
he is ours by grace; now
we bear his fruit and not
our own; our old stock is
forgotten, all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96769:22"/>
new; our naturall life
we receive from <hi>Adam;</hi> our
spirituall life and growth
from Christ; from whom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the improvement of this
blessed insition we can be no
more severed, then he can be
severed from himself.</p>
                  <p>Look but upon thy house
(that from vegetative
creatures, thou maist turne
thine eyes to those things
which have no life) if that
be uniform, the foundation
is not of a different matter
from the wals; both those
are but one piece; the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructure
is so raised upon
the foundation, as if all were
but one stone; Behold,
Christ is the chiefe corner
stone,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 6.</note> elect and precious;
neither can there be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96769:23"/>
foundation laid then
that which is laid on him;
we are lively stones built
up to a spirituall house,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 11</note> on
that sure and firm founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 5.</note>
some loose stones
perhaps that lye unmortered
upon the battlements, may
be easily shaken down, but
whoever saw a squared mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
laid by line and levell in
a strong wall upon a well-grounded
base, flye out of
his place by whatsoever vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
since both the strength
of the foundation below, and
the weight of the fabrick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
have setled it in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
utterly unmoveable?
Such is our spirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
O Saviour; thou art
our foundation, we are laid
upon thee, and are therein one
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96769:23"/>
with thee; we can no more
be dis-joyned from thy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
then the stones of thy
foundation can be dis-united
from themselves: So then,
to sum up all; as the head
and members are but one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as the husband and wife
are but one flesh, as our meat
and drink becomes part of
our selves, as the tree and
branches are but one plant,
as the foundation and wals
are but one fabrick; so Christ
and the beleeving soul are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisibly
one with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

dreaming of the

paradoxes of the
totall and finall Apostasie of
saints: Certainly, these men
have never thorowly dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
the meditation of this
blessed union whereof wee
treat: Can they hold the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
soul a lim of that
body whereof Christ is the

of dissolution? Can
they affain to the Sonne of

his lims? Even in this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
body the best joynts
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96769:24"/>
may be subject to strains, yea,
perhaps to some painfull and
perilous luxations; but, as
it was in the naturall body of
Christ, when it was in death,
most exposed to the cruelty
of all enemies, that (upon
an over-ruling providence)
not a bone of it, could be
broken; so it is still and ever
with the spirituall; some
scourgings and blows it may
suffer, yea, perhaps some
bruises, and gashes, but no
bone can be shattered in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
much lesse dissevered
from the rest of the body:
Were we left to our selves,
or could we be so much as in
conceit, sundred from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
whereof we are, alas we
are but as other men, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96769:25"/>
to the same dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and deadly miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
but since it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the God of heaven to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
us to himself, now it
concerns him to maintain
the honour of his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
by preserving us entire.</p>
                  <p>Can they acknowledge the
faithfull soul married in
truth and righteousnesse to
that celestiall husband; and
made up into one flesh with
the Lord of glory; &amp; can they
think of any Bils of divorce
written in heaven? can they
suppose that which by way
of type was done in the
earthly Paradise, to be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
undone in the heavenly?
What an infinite power
hath put together, can they
imagine that a limited power
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96769:25"/>
can disjoyn? Can they think
sin can be of more prevalence
then mercy? Can they
think the unchangeable
God subject to after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts?
Even the Jewish
repudiations never found
favour in heaven: They
were permitted, as a lesser

had so much as that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration

That they all may be one, as

it will be time to bend
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96769:28"/>
thine eyes upon those most
advantageous consequents,
and high priviledges, which
doe necessarily follow upon,
and attend this heavenly
conjunction. Whereof the
first is that, which we are
wont to account sweetest,
<hi>Life:</hi> Not this naturall life,
which is maintained by the
breath of our nosthrils; Alas,
what is that but a bubble, a
vapour, a shadow, a dreame,
nothing? as it is the gift of
a good God, worthy to be
esteemed precious; but as it
is considered in its own tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitorinesse,
and appendent
miseries, and in comparison
of a better life, not worthy
to take up our hearts. This
life of nature is that which
ariseth from the union of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96769:29"/>
the body with the soul, many
times enjoyed upon hard
tearms; the spirituall life
which we now speak of, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from the union betwixt
God and the soul, is that
wherein there can be nothing
but perfect contentment, and
joy unspeakable and full of
glory. Yea, this is that life
which Christ not only gives,
but is: he that gave himself
for us, gives himselfe to
us, and is that life that
he gives us; <hi>When Christ,
which is our life,</hi>

                     <hi>I
am crucified with Christ;
Neverthelesse I live; yet not
I, but Christ liveth in mee;</hi>
Lo, it is a common favour,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96769:29"/>
that in him we live but it is
an especiall favour to his
own, that he lives in us:
<hi>Know you not your own selves,</hi>

(saith the Apostle) <hi>how that
Jesus Christ is in you, except

we have not a dead Saviour,
but a living; and where he
lives, he animates: It is not
therefore Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> case a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
it is every belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
who may truly say, <hi>I

worth thy carefullest consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
                  <p>Know then, my son, that

in there are twins: a rough
<hi>Esau,</hi> and the seed of promise;
the old man, and the new; the
flesh, and the spirit; and these
have their lives distinct from
each other; the new man
lives not the life of the old,
neither can the old man live
the life of the new; it is not
one life that could maintain
the opposite struglings of
both these: Corrupt nature
is it that gives and continues
the life of the old man; It is
Christ that gives life to the
new; we cannot say but the
old man, or flesh, is the man
too:<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 18</note> 
                     <hi>For I know</hi> (saith the

life of our regeneration, like
as he is also the life of our
glory; the life that follows
our second resurrection: <hi>I
am</hi> (saith he) <hi>the resurrection
and the life.</hi> What is it then
whereby the new creature
lives? surely no other then
the Spirit of Christ; that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is it, that gives beeing
and life to the renued soule.
Life is no stranger to us,
there is nothing wherewith
we are so well acquainted;
yea, we feel continually what
it is, and what it produceth;
It is that, from whence all
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96769:31"/>
sense, action, motion flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
it is that, which gives
us to be what we are: All
this is Christ to the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
man: It is one thing
what he is, or doth as a man;
another thing what he is, or
doth as a Christian: As a
man, he hath eyes, ears, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
affections, understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
naturally as his own:
as a Christian he hath all
these from him with whom
he is spiritually one, the Lord
Jesus; and the objects of all
these vary accordingly: His
naturall eyes behold bodily
and materiall things; his
spirituall eyes see things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible;
His outward eares
hear the sound of the voice;
his inward ears hear the voice
of Gods Spirit, speaking to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96769:31"/>
his soul; His bodily feet
move in his own secular
ways; his spirituall walk
w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> God in all the ways of his
Commandements. His natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
affections are set upon
those things which are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thereunto; he loves
beauty, fears pain and losse,
rejoyces in outward prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
hates an enemy; his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
affections are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and more happily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed;
now he loves good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for its own sake; hates
nothing but sin, fears onely
the displeasure of a good
God, rejoyces in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
which is better then
life: His former thoughts
were altogether taken up
with vanity, and earthed in
the world; now he seeks the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96769:32"/>
things above, where Christ
sitteth at the right hand of
God;<note place="margin">Col. 3. 1.</note> Finally, he is such, as
that a beholder sees nothing
but man in him; but God

                  <p>See then and confesse how
just cause we have to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the dead-heartednesse
wherewith we are subject to
be possessed: and how many
worthy Christians are there
in the world who bear a part
with us in this just blame;
who have yeelded over
themselves to a disconsolate
heartlesnesse, and a sad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection

through a naturall disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
inclining to dumpish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and partly through the

prevalence of temptation:
For Satan well knowing
how much it makes for our
happinesse chearfully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon our interest in
Christ, and to live in the
joyfull sense of it, labours
by all means to withdraw
our hearts from this so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable

us with a pensive kinde of
spirituall fullennesse: accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it no small mastery if

as to be reave us of this habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
joy in the holy Ghost,
arising from the inanimation
of Christ living, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
within us: So much
the more therefore must we
bend all the powers of our
souls against this dangerous
and deadly machination of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96769:35"/>
our spirituall enemy; and
labour, as for life, to maintain
this Fort of our joy against
all the powers of darknesse;
and, if at any time we finde
our selves beaten off, through
the violence of temptation;
we must chide our selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

both of them meet at once
in the penitent soul: at once
doth the hand of our faith lay

hold on Christ, and the

the soul to justification: so
as the sinnes that are done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
can be no barre to our

sinnes can pretend to an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance?
All our other weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
are no eye-sore to God,
no rub in our way to heaven;
What matters it then how
unworthy wee are of our

that is our righteousnes:
and that obedience cannot

cannot but be both justly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted

                     <hi>we

be truth in us, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse

if we have sin, we violate

that our surety hath paid
our debt: It is true, we lay
forfaited to death; Justice
had said,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 4</note> 
                     <hi>The soul that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

us:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33 34.</note> And now, <hi>Who shall lay
any thing to the charge of
Gods elect? It is God that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth,
who is he that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth?
It is Christ that died, yea,
rather that is risen again, who
is even at the right hand of
God, who also maketh intercessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for us.</hi> Our sin, our death is
laid upon him, and underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by him;<note place="margin">Esa. 53. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>He was wounded
for our transgressions, he was
bruised for our iniquities; the
chastisements of our peace were
upon him, and with his stripes
we are healed;</hi> His death, his
obedience is made over to
us; So then, the sin that we
have committed, and the
death that we have deserved
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96769:48"/>
is not ours; but the death
which he hath endured, and
the obedience that he hath
performed, is so ours, as he is
ours, who is thereupon made
of God our righteousnesse.
Where now are those ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of grace that scoffe at
imputation; making it a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
paradox, that a man
should become just by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans righteousnesse?
How dare they stand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the word of truth,
which tels us expresly that
Christ is made our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse?
What strangers
are they to that grace they
oppugn? How little do they
consider that Christ is ours?
his righteousnesse therefore
by which we are justified, is
in him our own; Hee that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96769:48"/>
hath <hi>borne the iniquitie of
us all</hi> hath taught us to call
our sinnes our <hi>debts;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esa. 53. 6.</note> those
debts can be but once paid;<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 12.</note>
if the bounty of our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
hath staked down the
sums required, and cancelled
the bonds; and this payment
is (through mercy) fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our own hands,
what danger, what scruple
can remain? What doe we
then, weak souls, tremble
to think of appearing before
the dreadfull tribunall of the
Almighty? we know him
indeed to be infinitely, and
inflexibly just; we know his
most pure eyes cannot abide
to behold sin; we know wee
have nothing else but sinne
for him to behold in us:
Certainly, were we to appear
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96769:49"/>
before him in the meer shape
of our own sinfull selves, we
had reason to shake and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
at the apprehension of
that terrible appearance; but
now that our faith assures us,
we shall no otherwise bee
presented to that awfull
Judge then as cloathed with
the robes of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
how confident
should we be, thus decked
with the garments of our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
brother, to carry away a
blessing? whiles therefore
we are dejected with the
conscience of our own vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
we have reason to lift
up our heads in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of that perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
which Christ is
made unto us, and we are
made in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:96769:49"/>
At the barre of men many
a one is pronounced just who
remains inwardly foule and
guilty;<note place="margin">§ 15. Christ made our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> for the best of men
can but judge of things as
they appear, not as they are;
but the righteous Arbiter of

The same mercy therefore
that makes Christ our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
makes him also
our sanctification; of our
selves, wretched men, what
are we other at our best,

can there be anything more
abhorring from his infinite

learnt Christ, who would
draw over Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
as a case of their
close wickednesses; that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
holinesse from justice,
and give no place to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
in the evidence of
their justifying: Never man
was justified without faith;
and wheresoever faith is
there it purifieth and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth;<note place="margin">Acts. 15. 9</note>
But besides that the
Spirit of Christ works thus
powerfully (though gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally)
within us, <hi>That he may
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96769:50"/>

so as that inchoate holinesse,
which by his gracious ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
grows up daily in
us towards a full perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is abundantly supplyed
by his absolute holinesse,

we finde just cause to bee

vvhich (in vvay of applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it) hee shall bee ever
accomplishing, till he shall
deliver up his Mediatory

in this he finishes the great

For those who in this life
are enlightned by his vvis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
justified by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,

He therefore, vvho

implies a captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
We are naturally under
the vvofull bondage of the
Law, of sin, of miseries, of
death: The Law is a cruell

                  <p>But take heed, my son, of
mis-laying thy claime to
what, and in what manner
thou ought'st not. There is a
civill right, that must regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
our propriety to these
earthly things; our spirituall
right neither gives us posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of them, nor takes away
the right and propriety of
others; Every man hath and
must have what by the just
Lawes of purchase, gift, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
is derived to him;
otherwise there would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
an infinite confusion in

This right is not for the
direption or usurpation of
that which civill titles have
legally put over to others;
there were no theft, no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,
no oppression in the

might be every mans: But

may justly possesse as we have
them legally made over to us

vainly fancied the founding
of Temporall dominion in

mistaking outed the true

the just and godly in the

which whether they
be worse Commonwealths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

utterly uncertaine; sure I am
they are enemies to both;
whiles on the one side, they
destroy all civill propriety,

retch the extent of the
power of Christianity so far,
as to render it injurious, and

Christ, by his spirit diffused

to them: the beleever,
laying hold by faith upon

and these doe so re-act upon

each other, that from their
mutuall operation results this

treat. Here is a spirituall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
betwixt Christ and the
soule: The liking of one part
doth not make up the match,
but the consent of both. To
this purpose Christ gives his
spirit; the soule plights her
faith: What interesse have we
in Christ but by his spirit?
what interesse hath Christ in
us but by our faith?</p>
                  <p>On the one part; <hi>He hath

If ever therefore we looke for
any consolation in Christ, or
to have any part in this beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall
union, it must be the
maine care of our hearts to
make sure of a lively faith in
the Lord Jesus, to lay fast

and so to make him ours, and

                  <p>Hitherto wee have treated

that happy communion of
Saints, which wee professe
both to beleeve and to partake
of; This mysticall body of
Christ is a large one, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>
                     <hi>We have reason to begin at

of our union and blessednesse:
There was never place for

were cast out thence; the

                     <hi>neither can it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,

thoughts is, when we minde

In vain shall any man pretend

these stones are fast joyned

to dis-joynting by those vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
tempests of opposition,
wherewith it is commonly
beaten upon: There is no
place for any loose stone in
Gods edifice; The whole
Church is one entire body,
all the lims must be held to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the ligaments of
Christian love; if any one
will be severed, and affect to
subsist of it self, it hath lost
his place in the body; Thus

what (think wee)

would hee not aske, Is

what is become of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?
How doe evill spirits

Creed w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we have always

he not too much dismaid, my

principles of Religion, there
is an universall and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
consent of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and these are they that
constitute a Church: Those
that agree in these, Christ is
pleased to admit (for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of doctrine) as members
of that body whereof he is
the head: and if they admit
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96769:72"/>
not of each other as such, the

And if any vain and

sever themselves, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

that the union of Christs

in heaven;<note place="margin">§ 24. The uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Saints on earth with those in heaven.</note> and a union
(though imperfect) betwixt
the Saints on earth: So there
is an union partly perfect, and
partly imperfect, between the
Saints in heaven, and the
Saints below upon earth:
perfect, in respect of those
glorified Saints above, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imperfect,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96769:78"/>
in respect of the
weak returns we are able to
make to them again. Let
no man think that because
those blessed souls are out of
sight farre distant in another
world, and we are here toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in a vale of tears, wee
have therefore lost all mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
regard to each other: no,
there is still, and ever will be
a secret, but unfailing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
between heaven
and earth. The present hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
of those heavenly Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
cannot have abated
ought of their knowledge,
and charity, but must needs
have raised them to an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
pitch of both: They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
who are now glorious
comprehensors, cannot but in
a generality, retain the notice
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96769:79"/>
of the sad condition of us

pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting towards our rest toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and, in common,
wish for the happy consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of this our weary
pilgrimage, in the fruition of
their glory; That they have
any Perspective whereby
they can see down into our
particular wants, is that
which we finde no ground
to beleeve; it is enough that
they have an universall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the estate of
Christs warfaring Church
upon the face of the earth;<note place="margin">Rev. 6. 10.</note>
and as fellow-members of the
same mysticall body, long for
a perfect glorification of the
whole.</p>
                  <p>As for us wretched pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims,
that are yet left here
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96769:79"/>
below to tugge with many
difficulties, we cannot forget
that better half of us that is
now triumphing in glory;
O ye blessed Saints above, we
honour your memories so
far as wee ought; wee doe
with praise recount your
vertues, wee magnifie your
victories, we blesse God for
your happy exemption from
the miseries of this world,
and for your estating in that
blessed immortality; Wee
imitate your holy examples,
we long and pray for an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
consociation with you;
we dare not raise Temples,
dedicate Altars, direct pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to you; we dare not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
offer any thing to you
which you are unwilling to
receive, nor put any thing
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:96769:80"/>
upon you, which you would
disclaim as prejudiciall to
your Creator, and Redeemer.
It is abundant comfort to us,
that some part of us is in the
fruition of that glory; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
we (the other poor labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
part) desire, and strive
to aspire: that our head and
shoulders are above water,
whiles the other lims are yet
wading through the stream.</p>

if ever thou look for sound
comfort on earth, and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in heaven; unglue thy
self from the world and the
vanities of it; put thy self
upon thy Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ; Leave not till
thou findest thy self firmly
united to him; so as thou
art become a limb of that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96769:80"/>
body whereof he is head, a
Spouse of that husband, a
branch of that stemme, a
stone laid upon that founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Look not therefore
for any blessing out of him;
and in, and by, and from him
look for all blessings; Let
him be thy life, and wish not
to live longer then thou art
quickned by him; find him
thy wisdome, righteousness,
sanctification, redemption;
thy riches, thy strength, thy

all that thy Saviour is, or
hath done;<note place="margin">Hier. Zanch. loc. com. 8. de Symbolo Apost.</note> Wouldst thou

have redemption? fetch it

thou have absolution? fetch

Freedome from the curse?

And as thy faith shall thus
interesse thee in Christ thy

thee to his body the

holy and blessed fraternity.
Sever not thy selfe from it
either in judgement, or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
Make account there is
not one of Gods saints upon

thee: and thou maist chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the same in each of

but be sensible of their passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and be freely commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative
of all thy graces, and

thine eyes to heaven, think
of that glorious society of

triumphing, and reigning in

them, and wish thy self with

Apostle,
what is it, for
which thou dost
so earnestly
bow thy knees (in the behalf
of thine <hi>Ephesians)</hi> unto the
Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ? Even this, that they
may know the love of Christ
which passeth knowledge.<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 14. 19.</note>
Give me leave first to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at thy suit; and then,
much more, at what thou
suest for: Were thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96769:86"/>
raised so high to thine
<hi>Ephesians,</hi> that thou shouldst
crave for them impossible fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours?
Did thy love so far
over-shoot thy reason, as to
pray they might attain to the
knowledge of that which
cannot be known? It is the
love of Christ which thou
wishest they may know, and
it is that love which thou
sayest is past all knowledge;
What shall we say to this?
Is it for that there may be
holy ambitions of those
heights of grace, which we
can never hope actually to
attain? Or is it, rather, that
thou supposest, and prayest
they may reach to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that love, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
whereof they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
aspire to know: Surely,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96769:86"/>
so it is, O blessed Jesu; that
thou hast loved us, we know;
but, how much thou hast lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us, is past the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of Angels: Those
glorious spirits, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to looke into the deep
mystery of our redemption,
so they wonder to behold
that divine love whereby it
is wrought, but they can no
more reach to the bottome
of it, then they can affect to
be infinite. For surely, no
lesse then an endlesse line can
serve to fadome a bottomlesse
depth: Such, O Saviour, is
the abysse of thy love to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
man: Alas, what doe
we poor, wretched, dust of
the earth goe about to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
it by the spans, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of our shallow thoughts. 
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96769:87"/>
Far, far, be such presumption
from us; Onely admit us, O
blessed Lord, to look at, to
admire and adore that which
we give up for incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible;
What shall wee
then say to this love; Oh
dear Jesu, both as thine, and
as cast upon us; All earthly
love supposeth some kinde
of equality, (or proportion
at least) betwixt the person
that loves, and is loved;
Here is none at all; so as
(which is past wonder) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
meet without a mean:
For, lo, thou, who art the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
and absolute Beeing,
God blessed for ever, lovedst
me that had no beeing at all;
thou lovedst me both when I
was not, and could never
have been but by thee: It
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96769:87"/>
was from thy love that I had
any beeing at all: much
more that when thou hadst
given me a beeing, thou
shouldst follow mee with
succeeding mercies? who
but thou (who art infinite
in goodnesse) would love
that which is not? Our
poor sensuall love is drawn
from us by the sight of a
face, or a picture; neither is
ever raised but upon some
pleasing motive: thou
wouldst make that which
thou wouldst love, and
wouldst love that which
thou hadst made; O God,
was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there ever love so free,
so gracious, as this of thine?
Who can be capable to love
us but men or Angels? Men
love us because they see
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96769:88"/>
something in us which they
think amiable; Angels love
us because thou dost so: But
why doest thou (O blessed
Lord) love us, but because
thou wouldst? There can
be no cause of thy will, which
is the cause of all things; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
so Lord, since this love
did rise onely from thee, let
the praise and glory of it rest
onely in thee.</p>
                  <p>Yet more,<note place="margin">§ 2. How free; of us that had made our selvs vile and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> Lord; we had
lost our selves before we
were, and having forfaited
what we should be, had made
our selves perfectly misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
even when wee were
worse then nothing, thou
wouldst love us; was there
ever any eye enamoured of
deformity? Can there bee
any bodily deformitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96769:88"/>
to that of sin? yet,
Lord, when sin had made us
abominably loathsome, didst
thou cast thy love upon us:
A little scurf of leprosie, or
some few nastie spots of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
or, but, some unsavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sent sets us off; and turns
our love into detestation.</p>
                  <p>But for thee, (O God)
when we were become as
foul, and ugly as sinne could
make us, even then was thy
love inflamed towards us;
Even when we were weltring
in our blood, thou saidst,
Live, and washedst us, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointedst
us, and cloathedst
us with broidered work, and
deckedst us with ornaments,
and graciously espousedst us
to thy self, and receivedst us
into thine owne bosome:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:96769:89"/>
Lord, what is man that thou
art thus mindfull of him, and
the son of man that thou thus
visitest him? Oh what are
we in comparison of thine
once-glorious Angels? They
sinned and fell, never to bee
recovered; never to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from those everlasting
chains, wherein they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to the judgement of
the great day: Whence is it
then, O Saviour, whence is
it that thou hast shut up thy
mercy from those thy more
excellent creatures, and hast
extended it to us, vile sinfull
dust? whence? but that
thou wouldst love man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou wouldst? Alas, it
it is discouragement enough
to our feeble friendship, that
he to whom we wisht well,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:96769:89"/>
is miserable: Our love doth
gladly attend upon, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
his prosperity; but
when his estate is utterly
sunke, and his person expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to contempt and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
yea, to torture and death;
who is there that will then
put forth himself to owne a
forlorn, and perishing friend?
But for thee, O blessed Jesu,
so ardent was thy love to us,
that it was not in the power
of our extream misery to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
it; yea so, as that the
deplorednesse of our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
did but heighten that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flame; What speak I of
shame or sufferings? Hell
it self could not keep thee
off from us; Even from that
pit of eternall perdition didst
thou fetch our condemned
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96769:90"/>
souls, and hast contrarily
vouchsafed to put us into a
state of everlasting blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>The common disposition
of men pretends to a kind of
justice in giving men their
own;<note place="margin">§ 3. How yet free; of us that were professed enemies.</note> so as they will repay
love for love; and thinke
they may for hatred return
enmity; nature it self then
teacheth us to love our
friends, it is onely grace that
can love an enemy: But, as
of injuries, so of enmities
thereupon grounded, there
are certain degrees; some
are sleight and trivial, some
main and capitall; If a man
doe but scratch my face, or
give some light dash to my
fame, it is no great Mastery
upon submission to receive
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96769:90"/>
such an offender to favour;
but if he have endevoured
to ruine my estate, to wound
my reputation, to cut my
throat, not onely to pardon
this man, but to hug him in
my arms, to lodge him in
my bosome as my entire
friend, this would be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then an high improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my charity. O Lord
Jesu, what was I but the
worst of enemies, when
thou vouchsafedst to embrace
me with thy loving mercy?
how had I shamefully rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
against thee, and yeelded
up all my members as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of unrighteousnesse
unto sin? how had I crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee the Lord of life?
how had I done little other
then trod under foot thee the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:96769:91"/>
blessed Son of God, and
counted the blood of the
Covenant an unholy thing;
how had I in some sort done
despight unto the spirit of
grace? yet even then, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
of all my most odious
unworthinesse, didst thou
spread abroad thine arms to
receive me, yea, thou ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedst
thine heart to let me
in: O love passing not
knowledge onely, but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
also! O mercy, not inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
into any thing lesse then
infinite; nor, by any thing
lesse,<note place="margin">§ 4. The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull effects of the love of Christ: His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> comprehensible!</p>
                  <p>But, oh dear Lord, when
from the object of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
I cast mine eyes upon
the effects and improvement
of thy divine favours; and
see what thy love hath
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:96769:91"/>
drawn from thee towards
the sons of men, how am I
lost in a just amazement?
It is that which fetcht thee
down from the glory of the
highest heavens, from the
bosome of thine eternall
Father to this lower world,
the region of sorrow and
death: It is that which (to
the wonder of Angels) cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
thee with this flesh of
ours, and brought thee (who
thoughtst it no robbery to be
equall with God) to an estate
lower then thine own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Oh mercy transcending
the admiration of all the
glorious spirits of heaven,
that God would bee incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate!
Surely, that all those
celestiall powers should be
redacted to either worms, or
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96769:92"/>
nothing; that all this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
frame of creation should
run back into its first confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or be reduced to one
single atome; it is not so
high a wonder as for God
to become man; those chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
(though the highest that
nature is capable of) are yet
but of things finite; this is
of an infinite subject, with
which the most excellent of
finite things can hold no
proportion: Oh the great
mystery of godlinesse; God
manifested in the flesh, and
seen of Angels! Those hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
spirits had ever since
they were made, seen his
most glorious Deity, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored
him as their omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Creator; but to see that
God of spirits invested with
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96769:92"/>
flesh, was such a wonder, as
had been enough (if their
nature could have been capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of it) to have astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
even glory it self; And
whether to see him that was
their God so humbled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
themselves, or to see hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
thus advanced above
themselves, were the greater
wonder to them, they onely
know: It was your foolish
misprison, O ye ignorant
<hi>Listrians,</hi> that you took the
servants for the Master; here
onely is it verified (which
you supposed) that God is
come down to us in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of man; and as man
conversed with men: What
a disparagement doe wee
think it was for the great
Monarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96769:93"/>
years together, as a beast
to converse with the beasts of
the field? Yet alas, beasts
and men are fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
made of one earth,
drawing in the same ayre, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
(for their bodily
part) to the same dust; sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizing
in many qualities;
and in some, mutually tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
each others: so as
here may seem to bee some
tearms of a tolerable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
sith many men are in
disposition too like unto
beasts, and some beasts are
in outward shape somewhat
like unto men: But for him
that was, and is, God, blessed
for ever, eternall, infinite,
incomprehensible, to put on
flesh, and to become a man

One rules and glitters in all

passes the time of his life

another wears out his days
in sorrow and discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
Blessed Jesu, since
thou wouldst be a man, why
wouldst thou not be the King
of men? since thou wouldst
come down to our earth, why
wouldst thou not enjoy the
best entertainment that the
earth could yeeld thee? Yea,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96769:94"/>
since thou who art the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Son of God, wouldst
be the son of man, why didst
thou not appear in a state
like to the King of heaven,
attended with the glorious
retinue of blessed Angels? O
yet greater wonder of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
The same infinite love
that brought thee down to
the form of man, would also
bring thee down, being man,
to the form of a servant. So
didst thou love man that thou
wouldst take part with him
of his misery, that he might
take part with thee of thy
blessednesse: thou wouldst
be poor to enrich us, thou
wouldst be burdened for our
ease, tempted for our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

thee, who art the Lord

who art the eternall Son of
God, strugling with thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

said, I and my Father are one,
sweating drops of bloud in
thine agony, and crying out
on the Crosse, My God, my

me? thee, who hast the keys
of hell, and of death, lying
sealed up in another mans

hath thy love to mankinde
carried thee? what sighs,

what thou hast suffered for
me, I shall cast mine eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what thou hast done for
my soul; how is my heart
divided betwixt the wonders
of both; and may as soon
tell how great either of them
is, as whether of them is the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96769:96"/>
greater. It is in thee that I
was elected from all eternity;
and ordained to a glorious
inheritance before there was
a world: we are wont (O
God) to marvell at, and blesse
thy provident beneficence to
the first man, that before thou
wouldst bring him forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, thou wert plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to furnish such a world
for him, so goodly an house
over his head, so pleasant a
Paradise under his feet, such
variety of creatures round
about him for his subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and attendance; But how
should I magnifie thy mercy,
who before that man, or that
world had any beeing, hast so
far loved me as to pre-ordain
me to a place of blessedness
in that heaven which should
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96769:96"/>
be, and to make me a co-heir
with my Christ of thy glory:
And oh, what an heaven is
this that thou hast laid out
for me: how resplendent,
how transcendently glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
Even that lower Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
which thou providedst
for the harbour of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
and holinesse, was
full of admirable beauty,
pleasure, magnificence, but
if it be compared with this
Paradise above, which thou
hast prepared for the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
entertainment of resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
souls, how mean and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
it was? Oh match too
unequall, of the best peece of
earth, with the highest state
of the heaven of heavens. In
that earthly Paradise I finde
thine Angels, the Cherubim;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:96769:97"/>
but it was to keep man off
from that Garden of Delight,
and from the tree of life in
the midst of it; but in this
heavenly one I finde millions
of thy Cherubim, and Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim
rejoycing at mans bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse,
and welcomming
the glorified souls to their
heaven: There I finde but
the shadow of that, whereof
the substance is here; There
we were so possessed of life
that yet we might forfait it;
here is life without all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of death: Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
could finde accesse thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
here is nothing but a
free and compleat fruition of
blessednesse: There were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
fit for earthly bodies;
here is glory more then can
be enjoyed of blessed souls:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96769:97"/>
That was watered with four
streams, muddy, and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous;
in this is the pure ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of the water of life clear
as Crystall, proceeding out
of the throne of God, and of
the Lamb: There I finde
thee onely walking in the
cool of the day; here manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
thy Majesty continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
There I see onely a most
pleasant Orchard, set with
all manner of varieties of
flourishing and fruitfull
plants; here I finde also the
City of God infinitely rich,
and magnificent; the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the wall of it, of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper;
and the City it selfe
pure gold, like unto cleare

of the wall garnished with
all manner of precious

stones: All that I can here
attain to see, is the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thy celestiall habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and, Lord, how glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
it is; how bespangled
with glittering starres; for
number, for magnitude equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admirable? What is the
least of them, but a world of
light? and what are all of
them, but a confluence of so
many thousand worlds of
beauty and brightnesse met
in one firmament? And if
this floor of thine heavenly
Palace be thus richly set
forth, oh, how infinite glory
and magnificence must there

to be caught up thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to see that divine
state, (whether with bodily,

No, Lord, it were not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

far short also; He that saw
it, says; Eye hath not seen,

                  <p>Yet is thy love,<note place="margin">§ 7. His love in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death &amp; hell.</note> O Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,

the greatest contentment
which this world is capable
to afford unto mankind, to
be preferred to the joys of

but from the depth

addes so much more to
the blessing, as the evill from
which we are delivered is
more intolerable: Oh bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Jesu, what an hell is this
out of which thou hast freed
me? what dreadfull horror
is here? what darknesse?
what confusion? what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
of souls that would,

tormentors? what utter
despair of any possibility of
release? what exquisitenesse,
what infinitenesse of paines
that cannot, yet must be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured?
Oh God, if the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
displeasure of weake
men have devised so subtile
engines of revenge upon their
fellow-mortals for but petty
offences; how can wee but
think thine infinite justice
and wisdome must have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
such forms and ways
of punishment for hainous
sins done against thee, as
may be answerable to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation
of thy divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty?
Oh therefore the most

of damned spirits, never

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:96769:100"/>
Oh those unquenchable

wherewith it is kindled; Oh

oh never pitied, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

From hence, O Saviour, from
hence it is that thou hast
fetcht up my condemned
soul; This is the place, this

hast snatcht me up into thy

more deep then those depths

Now,<note place="margin">§ 8. Christs love in giving us the guard of his Angels.</note> whereas in my pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage

undertaken to secure my soul
from all these deadly perils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
both without, and within:
without, by the guardance of
thy blessed Angels: within,
by the powerfull inoperation
of thy good Spirit which
thou hast given me? Oh
that mine eyes could be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with <hi>Elishaes</hi> servant,
that I might see those troops
of heavenly soldiers, those

horses and chariots of fire,
wherewith thou hast encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
mee! every one of
which is able to chase away
a whole host of the powers
of darknes: Who am I, Lord,
who am I, that, upon thy
gracious appointment, these
glorious spirits should still
watch over me in mine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising,
and down lying; in my

that they should bear me in

Behold, such is their
majesty and glory, that
some of thy holiest servants
have hardly been restrained
from worshipping them; yet
so great is thy love to man, as
that thou hast ordained them
to be ministring spirits, sent
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:96769:101"/>
forth to minister for them
who shall be heirs of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Surely they are in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
far more excellent then
man; as being spirituall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,

meet to stand before the

this, that thou, who wouldst
humble thy self to be lower
then they, in the susception
of our nature; art pleased to
humble them in their offices
to the guardianship of man,
so far, as to call them the
Angels of thy little ones up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Neither hast thou,<note place="margin">§ 9. His love in giving us his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit.</note> O God,
meerly turn'd us over to the
protection of those tutelary
spirits; but hast held us still

not so strongly defenced as

within; Since that, is
wrought by thine Angels,
this, by thy Spirit; Oh the

of thy holy Ghost;
whereby wee are furnished
with all saving graces,
strengthned against all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
heartned against all
our doubts and fears; enabled
both to resist, and overcome;
and upon our victories, crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Oh divine bounty, far
beyond the reach of wonder!
So God (the Father) loved
the world, that he gave his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:96769:102"/>
onely begotten Sonne, that
whosoever beleeveth in him
should not perish, but have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
life: So God the
Son loved the world of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
that he gave unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
holy Spirit of promise, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are sealed unto the day
of redemption; wherby accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the riches of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
they are strengthned with
might in the inner man; by
the vertue whereof shed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in their hearts, they
are enabled to cry, <hi>Abba,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Oh gifts; either of
which are more worth then
many worlds; yet through thy
goodnes, ô Lord, both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
mine: How rich is my soul
through thy divine munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
how over-laid with
mercies? How safe in thine
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96769:103"/>
Almighty tuition? How
happy in thy blessed possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Now therefore I dare
in the might of my God, bid
defiance to all the gates of
hell; Doe your worst, ô all
ye principalities and powers,
and rulers of the darknesse of
this world, and spirituall
wickednesses in high places;
doe your worst; God is mine,
and I am his; I am above
your malice in the right of
him whose I am; It is true, I
am weak, but he is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
I am sinfull, but he is
infinite holinesse; that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that holinesse in his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
application is mine; It
is my Saviours love that
hath made this happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
of his righteousnesse
for my sin; of his power for
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:96769:103"/>
my infirmity; Who then
shall lay any thing to the
charge of Gods elect? It is
God that justifieth: Who
shal separate us from the love
of Christ? Shall tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or distresse, or persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or famine, or nakednesse,
or perill, or sword? Nay, in
all these things we are more
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conquerors through him
that loved us: So as, neither
death, nor life, nor Angels, nor
principalities, nor powers,
nor things present, nor
things to come; nor height,
nor depth, nor any other
creature shall be able to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
us from the love of God
which is in Christ Jesus our
Lord. Lo, where this love
is placed; were it our love
of God, how easily might
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:96769:104"/>
the power of a prevalent
temptation separate us from
it, or it from us; for, alas,
what hold is to be taken of
our affections, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>, like unto
water, are so much more apt
to freeze because they have
been heated; but it is the love
of God to us in Christ Jesus,<note place="margin">§ 10.

                  <p>All this, O deare Jesu,
hast thou done, all this hast
thou suffered for me; And
oh now for an heart that
might be some ways answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to thy mercies! Surely,
even good natures hate to be
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:96769:104"/>
in debt for love; and are
ready to repay favours with
interest; Oh for a soul sick
of love, yea, sick unto death!
why should I, how can I be
any otherwise, any whit lesse
affected, O Saviour? this
onely sicknesse is my health,
this death is my life, and not
to be thus sick, is to be dead
in sins and trespasses. I am
rock and not flesh, if I be not
wounded with these hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
darts: Ardent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is apt to attract love even
where is little or no beauty;
and excellent beauty is no
lesse apt to enflame the heart
where there is no answer of
affection; but when these
two meet together, what
breast can hold against
them? and here they are both
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:96769:105"/>
in an eminent degree. Thou
canst say even of thy poore
Church (though labouring
under many imperfections)
Thou hast ravished my heart,
my sister, my Spouse, thou
hast ravished my heart with
one of thine eyes, with one
chain of thy neck; how fair is
thy love, my sister, my Spouse?
And canst thou, O blessed
Saviour be so taken with the
incurious and homely fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of thy faithfull ones;
and shall not we much more
be altogether enamoured of
thine absolute and divine
beauty? of whom every
beleeving soul can say; My

the chiefest among ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand;
his head is as the most

eyes of doves by the rivers
of waters, his cheekes are
as a bed of spices, as sweet
flowers; his lips like lillies,
dropping sweet smelling
myrrhe, &amp;c. It hath pleased
thee, O Lord, out of the
sweet ravishments of thy
heavenly love, to say to thy
poor Church, Turn away
thine eyes from mee, for
they have overcome me; but
oh let mee say unto thee;
Turn thine eyes to me, that

and that death, which
thou hast sweetned? With
vvhat comfortable assurance
shall I look upon the face of
that mercifull Justice vvhich
thou hast satisfied? But oh
vvhat a blessed inheritance
hast thou in thine infinite
love provided for me? an
inheritance incorruptible,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:96769:108"/>
and undefiled, and that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not away, reserved in
heaven for me; so as when
my earthly house of this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
shall be dissolved, I
have a building of God, an
house not made with hands
eternall in the heavens: An
house? Yea, a Palace of
heavenly state and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence;
neither is it lesse then
a kingdome that abides there
for mee: a kingdome so
much more above these
worldly Monarchies, as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is above this clod of
earth: Now, Lord, vvhat
conceits, vvhat affections of
mine can be in the least sort
answerable to so transcendent
mercy? If some friend shall
have been pleased to bestow
some mean Legacy upon me;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:96769:108"/>
or shall have feoffed me in
some few acres of his Land;
how deeply doe I finde my
self obliged to the love and
memory of so kinde a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor?
Oh then, Lord,
how can my soul be capable
of those thoughts and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
vvhich may reach
to the least proportion of
thine infinite bounty, vvho
of a poor worm on earth, hast
made me an heir of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven. Wo is me,
how subject are these earthly
Principalities to hazard, and
mutability, whether through
death, or insurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but this
Crown w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> thou hast laid up
for me is immarcescible; and
shall sit immoveably fast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my head, not for years,
not for millions of ages, but
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:96769:109"/>
for all eternity; Oh let it
be my heaven here below, in
the mean vvhile, to live in a
perpetuall fruition of thee,
and to begin those Allelujahs
to thee here,<note place="margin">§ 12. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our love to Christ for the mercy of his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull working of his good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> vvhich shall be
as endlesse as thy mercy, and
my blessednesse.</p>
                  <p>Hadst thou been pleased
to have translated me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy
former Paradise, the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
seat of mans origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
integrity and happinesse,
to the glory of the highest
heaven, the preferment had
been infinitely gracious; but
to bring my soul from the
nethermost hell and to place
it among the Chore of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
doubles the thank of
thy mercy, and the measure
of my obligation: How
thankfull was thy Prophet
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:96769:109"/>
but to an <hi>Ebedmelech,</hi> that by
a cord and rags let down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that dark dungeon, helpt
him out of that uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
pit wherein he was
lodged; yet, what was there
but a little cold, hunger,
stench, closenesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obscurity?
Lord, how should I blesse
thee, that hast fetcht my soul
from that pit of eternall hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
from that lake of fire
and brimstone, from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
torments of the
damned, wherein I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to perish for ever? I
will sing of thy power; unto
thee, O my strength will I
sing; for God is my delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
and the God of my mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</p>
                  <p>But, O Lord, if yet thou
shouldst leave me in my own
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:96769:110"/>
hands, where vvere I? how
easily should I be rob'd of
thee with every temptation?
how should I be made the
scorn and insultation of men
and devils? It is thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
mercy that thou hast
given thine Angels charge
over me; Those Angels
great in power, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in Majesty are my sure
(though invisible) guard:
Oh blessed Jesu, what an
honour, what a safety is this,
that those heavenly spirits
which attend thy throne
should be my champions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Those that ministred to
thee after thy temptation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
are readie to assist and relieve
me in mine; they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
neglect their charge,
because they are perfectly
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:96769:110"/>
holy, nor fail of their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
because they are (under
thee) the most powerfull. I
see you, O ye blessed Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
I see you by the eye
of my faith, no lesse truly,
then the eye of my sense sees
my bodilie attendants; I do
truly (though spirituallie)
feel your presence by your
gracious operations, in, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and for me; and I doe
heartilie blesse my God and
yours, for you, and for those
saving offices that (through
his mercifull appointment)
you ever doe for my soul.
But as it was with thine <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>
of old, that it would
not content them that thou
promisedst, and wouldst send
thine Angel before them, to
bring them into the Land
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:96769:111"/>
flowing with milk and hony,
unlesse thy presence, O Lord,
should also goe along with
them; so is it still with me
and all thine, wert not thou
with, and in us, what could
thine Angels doe for us? In
thee it is that they move and
are; The same infinite Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which works in, and by
them, works also in me:
From thee it is, O thou bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and eternall Spirit, that I
have any stirrings of holy
motions, any breathings of
good desires, any life of grace,
any will to resist, any power
to overcome evill; It is thou,
O God, that girdest me with
strength unto battell; thou
hast given me the shield of
thy salvation; thy right hand
hath holden me up; thou
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:96769:111"/>
hast also given me the necks
of mine enemies. Glory and
praise be to thee, O Lord,
which alwaies causest us to
triumph in Christ; vvho
crownest us with loving
kindnesse, &amp; tender mercies;
and hast not held us short of
the best of thy favours.</p>
                  <p>Truly, Lord, hadst thou
given us but a meer beeing,
as thou hast done to the
lowest rank of thy creatures,
it had been more then thou
owest us: more then ever
we could be able to requite
to thy divine bountie; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
beeing is good, and the
least degree of good is farre
above our worthinesse; But,
that to our beeing thou hast
added life, it is yet an higher
measure of thy mercy; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96769:112"/>
of thy common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
life is the most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
yet this is such a benefit
as may be had and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
for even the plants
of the earth live and feel it
not; that to our life, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou hast made a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
accession of sense, it is
yet a larger improvement of
thy beneficence: for this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
hath some power to
manage life; and makes it
capable to affect those means
which may tend to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of it, and to decline
the contrary; but this is no
other then the brute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
enjoy equallie with us,
and some of them beyond us:
that therefore to our sense
thou hast blessed us vvith
a further addition of reason,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:96769:112"/>
it is yet an higher pitch of
munificence; for hereby we
are men; and, as such, are
able to attain some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of thee our Creator, to
observe the motions of the
heavens, to search into the
natures of our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to passe judgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
actions, and events, and to
transact these earthlie affairs
to our own best advantage.
But when all this is done,
wo were to us if vve vvere
but men; for our corrupted
reason renders us of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
the most miserable: that
therefore to our reason thou
hast superadded faith; to our
nature grace; and of men
hast made us Christians; and
to us, as such, hast given
thy Christ, thy Spirit; and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:96769:113"/>
thereby made us of enemies,
sons, and heirs; co-heirs with
Christ of thine eternall and
most glorious kingdome of
heaven; yea, hast incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
us into thy self, &amp; made
us one spirit with thee our
God; Lord, what room can
there be possibly in these
strait and narrow hearts of
ours for a due admiration of
thy transcendent love and
mercy? I am swallowed up,
O God, I am willingly swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up in this bottomlesse
abysse of thine infinite love;
and there let me dwell in a
perpetuall ravishment of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
till being freed from this
clog of earth, and filled with
the fulnesse of Christ, I shall
be admitted to enjoy that,
which I cannot now reach
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:96769:113"/>
to wonder at, thine incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
blisse, and glory,
which thou laid up in the
highest heavens for them that
love thee, in the blessed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of all thy Saints, and
Angels, thy Cherubim, and
Seraphim, Thrones, Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Principalities, and
Powers; in the beatificall
presence of thee the ever-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, the eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of spirits, Father, Son,
holy Ghost, one infinite Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in three, co-essentially,
co-eternally, co-equally glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
persons; To vvhom
be blessing, honour, glory,
and power for ever and ever.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vt of infallible rules
and long experience
have I gathered up
this true character
of a Christian: A labour (some
will think) might have been well
spared: Every man professes both
to know and act this part; Who
is there that would not be angry,
if but a question should be made
either of his skill, or interest?
Surely, since the first name give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
at <hi>Antioch,</hi> all the beleeving
world hath been ambitious of the
honour of it; How happy were
it, if all that are willing to wear
the livery, were as ready to doe
the service. But it fals out here,
as in the case of all things that
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96769:119"/>
are at once honourable, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
every one affects the title,
few labour for the truth of the
atchievement. Having therefore
leisure enough to look about me,
and finding the world too prone
to this worst kind of hypocrisie,
I have made this true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
not more for direction, then for
tryall. Let no man view these
lines as a stranger; but when he
looks in this glasse, let him ask
his heart whether this be his own
face; yea, rather when he sees
this face, let him examine his
heart whether both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agree
with their pattern. And where
he findes his failings, (as who
shall not?) let him strive to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them; and never give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
whiles he is any way lesse
fair then his copy.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, I would it
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96769:119"/>
were lesse easie, by these rules, to
judge even of others besides our
selves; or, that it were uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
to say, there are many
Professors, few Christians; If
words and forms might carry
it, Christ would have Clients <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

is the man that hath obtained
the mastery of his corrupt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and to be the Lord of his

heart in heaven, whiles his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96769:120"/>
to whom he is spiritually
united? That hath subdued his
will and reason to his beleef; that
fears nothing but God; loves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but goodnesse; hates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but sin; rejoyceth in none
but true blessings? Whose faith
triumphs over the world; whose
hope is anchored in heaven:
whose charity knows no lesse
bounds then God, and men:
whose humility represents him
as vile to himself, as he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
in the reputation of
God; who is wise heaven-ward;
however he passes with the world;
who dares be no other then just,
whether he win or lose; who is
frugally liberall, discreetly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous,
holily temperate: who
is ever a thrifty menager of his
houres, so dividing the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
his God, and his Vocation,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:96769:120"/>
that neither shall finde fault
with a just neglect, or an unjust
partiality: whose recreations
are harmlesse, honest, warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
such as may refresh nature,
not debauch it: whose diet is
regulated by health, not by
pleasure, as one whose table shall
be no altar to his belly, nor snare
to his soul: who in his seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
repose lies down, and awakes
with God, caring only to relieve
his spirits; not to cherish sloth.
Whose carriage is meek, gentle,
compliant, beneficiall in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
station; In Magistracy
unpartially just; in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
conscionably faithfull; in
the rule of his family, wisely
provident, and religiously exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary;
Shortly, who is a discreet
and loving yoke-fellow, a tender
and pious parent, a dutious and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96769:121"/>
awfull son: an humble and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequious
servant, an obedient
and loyall subject. Whose heart
is constantly setled in the main
truths of Christian Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so,
as he cannot be removed; in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigious
points, neither too cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,
nor too Peremptory:
whose discourse is such as may
be meet for the expressions of a
tongue that belongs to a sound,
godly, and charitable heart;
whose breast continually burns
with the heavenly fire of an holy
devotion; whose painfull suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
are overcome with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and chearfull resolutions;
whose conflicts are attended
with undaunted courage, and
crowned with an happy victory:
Lastly, whose death is not so full
of fear and anguish, as of strong
consolations in that Saviour,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:96769:121"/>
who hath overcome and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it; nor of so much dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in it self, as of joy in the
present expectation of that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
issue of a glorious immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which instantly succeeds it.
Such is the Christian whom we
doe here characterize, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to the world both for trial,
and imitation; neither know I
which of these many qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
can be missing in that soul,
who lays a just claim to Christ,
his Redeemer. Take your hearts
to task, therefore, my dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
into whose hands soever
these lines shall come: and, as
you desire to have peace at the
last, ransack them thoroughly;
not contenting your selves with
a perfunctory, and fashionable
over-sight (which will one day
leave you irremediably misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:96769:122"/>
but so search, as those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
not to give over till you
finde these gracious dispositions
in your bosomes, which I have
here described to you: so shall
we be, and make each other hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in the successe of our holy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;

of his Maker, and Redeemer;
the abstract of Gods Church
on earth: a modell of heaven
made up in clay; the living
Temple of the holy Ghost.
For his disposition, it hath in
it as much of heaven, as his
earth may make room for;
He were not a man, if he
were quite free from corrupt
affections; but these he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:96769:123"/>
and keeps in with a
strait hand; and if at any
time they grow resty and
headstrong, he breaks them
with a severe discipline, and
will rather punish himself,
then not tame them; Hee
checks his appetite with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
but strong denials, and
forbears to pamper nature,
lest it grow wanton, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous;
He walks on earth,
but converses in heaven; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his eyes fixed on the
invisible, and enjoying a
sweet communion with his
God, and Saviour; Whiles
all the rest of the world sits
in darknesse, he lives in a
perpetuall light; the heaven
of heavens is open to none
but him; thither his eye
pierceth, and beholds those
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:96769:123"/>
beams of inaccessible glory,
which shine in no face but
his: The deep mysteries of
godlinesse which to the great
Clerks of the world are as a
book clasped and sealed up,
lye open before him fair and
legible; and whiles those
book-men know whom they
have heard of, hee knowes
whom he hath beleeved: He
will not suffer his Saviour to
be ever out of his eye; and if
through some worldly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
he lose the sight of
that blessed object for a time,
he zealously retrives him, not
without an angry check of his
own mis-carriage; and is now
so much the more fixed by
his former slackning; so as
he will henceforth sooner
part with his soul, then his
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:96769:124"/>
Redeemer. The tearmes of
entirenesse wherein he stands
with the Lord of life, are
such as he can feel; but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expresse, though hee
should borrow the language
of Angels: it is enough that
they two are one spirit: His
reason is willingly captivated
to his faith; his will to his
reason; and his affections to
both: He fears nothing that
he sees, in comparison of that
which he sees not; and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
is more dreadfull to
him then smart: Good is
the adequate object of his
love; which he duly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of its eminence; affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the chiefe good, not
without a certaine ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of spirit; the lesser
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:96769:124"/>
with a wise and holy mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
Whether he do more
hate sin, or the evil spirit that
suggests it, is a question;
Earthly contentments are too
mean grounds whereon to
raise his joy; these, as hee
baulks not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they meet him
in his way, so he doth not too
eagerly pursue; he may taste of
them, but so, as he had rather
fast then surset. He is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
of those losses w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualty,
or enmity may inflict;
but that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> lyes most hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
upon his heart, is his sin:
This makes his sleep short &amp;
troublesome, his meals sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macklesse;
his recreations list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse;
his every thing, tedious;
till he finde his soul acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his great Surety in
heaven: which done, he feels
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96769:125"/>
more peace and pleasure in
his calm, then he found hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in the tempest. His
heart is the store-house of
most precious graces: That
faith whereby his soul is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished,
triumphs over the
world, wvether it allure, or
threaten; and bids defiance to
all the powers of darknesse;
not fearing to be foiled by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
opposition: His hope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be discouraged with the
greatest difficulties; but
bears up against naturall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities;
and knows how
to reconcile contradictions;
His charity is both extensive,
and fervent; barring out no
one that bears the face of a
man; but pouring out it self
upon the houshold of faith:
that studies good constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:96769:125"/>
of men, and actions; and
keeps it self free both from
suspicion, and censure: Grace
doth not more exalt him,
then his humility depresses
him: Were it not for that
Christ who dwels in him,
he could think himself the
meanest of all creatures; now,
he knows he may not dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the Deity of him, by
whom he is so gloriously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited;
in whose only right
he can be as great in his own
thoughts, as he is despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the eyes of the world.
He is wise to God-ward,
however it be with him for
the world; and well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he cannot serve two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
he cleaves to the better;
making choice of that good
part which can never be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:96769:126"/>
from him; not so much
regarding to get that which
he cannot keep, as to possesse
himself of that good which
he cannot lose. He is just in
all his dealings with men; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to thrive by injury, and
oppression; and will rather
leave behinde something of
his own, then silch from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers
heap. Hee is not
close-fisted, where there is
just occasion of his distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
willingly parting with
those metals which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
onely for use; not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for either their colour,
or substance; earth is to him
no other then it self, in what
hiew so ever it appeareth.
In every good cause hee is
bold as a Lion; and can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fear faces, nor shrink at
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96769:126"/>
dangers: and is rather heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with opposition, pressing
so much the more where he
findes a large door open, and
many adversaries; and when
he must suffer, doth as reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
stoop, as he did before
valiantly resist. He is holily
temperate in the use of all
Gods blessings, as knowing
by whom they are given, and
to what end; neither dares
either to mis-lay them, or to
mis-spend them lavishly: as
duly weighing upon what
tearms he receives them; and
fore-expecting an account.
Such an hand doth he carry
upon his pleasures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
that they run not away
with him; he knows how to
slacken the reins without a
debauched kind of dissolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96769:127"/>
and how to straiten
them without a sullen rigour.</p>
                  <p>He lives as a man that
hath borrowed his time,<note place="margin">§ 2. His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the day.</note> and
challenges not to be an own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of it; caring to spend the
day in a gracious and well-governed
thrift; His first
mornings task, after he hath
lifted up his heart to that
God who gives his beloved
sleep, shall be to put himself
into a due posture, wherein
to entertain himself, and the
whole day: which shall be
done, if he shall effectually
work his thoughts to a right
apprehension of his God, of
himself, of all that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
him. The true posture
of a Christian then, is this;
He sees still heaven open to
him, and beholds &amp; admires
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:96769:127"/>
the light inaccessible; he sees
the all-glorious God ever
before him; the Angels of
God about him; the evill
spirits aloofe off enviously
groyning, and repining at
him; the world under his
feet, willing to rebell, but
forced to be subject; the good
creatures ready to render their
service to him; and is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
affected to all these;
he sees heaven open with joy
and desire of fruition; he
sees God with an adoring
awfulnesse; he sees the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
with a thankfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement,
and care
not to offend them; he sees
the evill spirits with hatred
and watchfull indignation;
he sees the world with an
holy imperiousnesse, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96769:128"/>
it for use, and scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to stoop to it for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance;
Lastly, he sees the
good creatures, with gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and care to improve
them to the advantage of
him that lent them.</p>
                  <p>Having thus gathered up
his thoughts, and found
where he is, he may now be
fit for his constant devotion;
which he fals upon, not
without a trembling venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that infinite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
Majesty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom he is prostra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e;
now he climbes up into that
heaven, which he before did
but behold; and solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pours out his soul in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thanksgivings, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
supplications into the
bosome of the Almighty;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96769:128"/>
wherein his awe is so tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
with his faith, that
whiles he labours under the
sense of his own vilenesse, he
is raised up in the confidence
of an infinite mercy; now
he renues his feeling interest
in the Lord Jesus Christ his
blessed Redeemer; and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to get in every breath
new pledges of his gracious
entirenesse; so seasoning his
heart with these earely
thoughts of piety, as that
they stick by him all the day
after.</p>
                  <p>Having thus begun with
his God, and begg'd his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:
he now finds time to
addresse himself to the works
of his calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any vocation, to live in
an unwarrantable vocation,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:96769:129"/>
not to labour in the vocation
wherein he lives, are things
which his soul hateth: These
businesses of his calling
therefore, he follows with a
willing and contented indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry;
not as forced to it by
the necessary of human Laws,
or as urged by the Law of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
out of the sense or
fear of want: nor yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily,
out of an eager desire
of enriching himself in his
estate; but in a conscionable
obedience to that God, who
hath made man to labour as
the sparks to flye upward;
and hath laid it upon him
both as a punishment, and
charge: In the sweat of thy
browes shalt thou eat thy
bread. In an humble alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he walks on in the way,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:96769:129"/>
wherein his God hath set
him; yet not, the while, so
intent upon his hands, as
not to tend his heart; which
he lifts up in frequent eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
to that God, to
whom he desires to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
in all his endevours;
ascribing all the thanks both
of his ability, and successe
to that omnipotent hand: If
he meet with any rubs of
difficulty in his way, hee
knows who sent them, and
who can remove them; not
neglecting any prudentiall
means of remedy, he is not
to seek for an higher redresse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he have occasion of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with others; his will
may not be the rule of his
gain, but his conscience; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dares he strive for what
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:96769:130"/>
he can get, but what he
ought: Equity is here the
Clerk of the Market; and the
measure w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he would have
others mete out to himself,
is the standard whereby he
desires to be tryed in his
mensurations to all other.
He hates to hoise prices up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occasion of his neighbours
need; &amp; to take the advantage
of forfaits by the clock. He
is not such a slave to his
trade, as not to spare an hour
to his soul; neither dares be
so lavish as utterly to neglect
his charge upon whatever
pretence of pleasure, or devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Shortly, he takes his
work at the hand of God, and
leaves it with him: humbly
offering up his services to his
great Master in heaven; and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:96769:130"/>
after all his labour sits com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
down in the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of having faithfully
done his task, though not
without the intervention of
many infirmities.</p>
                  <p>His recreations (for even
these humane frailty will
sometimes call for) are such,<note place="margin">§ 3. His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note>
as may be meet relaxations
to a minde over-bent, and a
body tired with honest and
holy employments; safe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offensive,
and for time and
measure fitly proportioned
to the occasion; like unto
soft musick betwixt two long
and stirring Acts; like unto
some quick and savory sauce
to a listlesse and cloyed sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach;
like unto a sweet nap
after an over-watching. He
is farre from those delights
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:96769:131"/>
that may effeminate, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the minde; abhorring
to sit by those pleasures, from
which he shall not rise better:
He hates to turn pastime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
trade; not abiding to
spend more time in whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
then till his edge
be sharp; In the height of
his delectations he knows to
enjoy God; from whom as
he fetches his allowance, so
he craves and expects a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
acceptation, even when
he lets himself most loose.
And if at any time he have
gone beyond his measure,
he chides himself for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
and is so much the
more carefull ever after to
keep within compasse. He
can onely make a kinde of
use of those contentments,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:96769:131"/>
with light mindes are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported:
and can manage his
disports without passion; and
leave a loser without regret.
A smile to him is as much as
a loud laughter to the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
neither doth he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
mirth as his ordinary
attendant, but as his retainer
to wait upon his serious oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions:
and finally, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth,
as if he rejoyced
not.</p>
                  <p>His meals are such as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
requires,<note place="margin">§ 4. His meals.</note> and grace mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates;
not pinching him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with a penurious rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardlinesse,
nor pampering
his flesh with a wanton ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse:
His palate is the least
part of his care; so as his fare
may be wholesome, he stands
not upon delicacy. He dares
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:96769:132"/>
not put his hand to the dish
till he have lookt up to the
owner; and hates to put one
morsell into his mouth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blessed;
and knows it his
duty to give thanks for what
he hath paid for; as well
considering, that neither the
meat that he eats, nor the
hand and mouth that receives
it, nor the mawe that digests
it, nor the metall that buyes
it, is of his own making: And
now having fed his belly, not
his eye, he rises from his
board, satisfied, not glutted;
and so bestirs himself upon
his calling, as a man not more
unwieldy by his repast, but
more chearfull; and as one
that would be loth his gut
should be any hindrance to
his brain, or to his hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:96769:132"/>
If he shall have occasion to
entertain himself and his
friends more liberally, he
dares not lose himself in his
feast; he can be soberly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and wisely free; onely in
this he is willing not to be
his own man, in that he gives
himself for the time to his
guests. His Cator is friendly
thrift; and Temperance keeps
the boards end, and carves
to every one the best measure
of enough: As for his own
diet, when he is invited to a
tempting variety, he puts his
knife to his throat; neither
dares he feed without fear, as
knowing who over-looks
him: Obscenity, detraction,
scurrility, are barred from
his table; neither doe any
words sound there that are
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:96769:133"/>
lesse savoury then the dishes.
Lastly, he so feeds, as if he
sought for health in those vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands,
and not pleasure; as if he
did eat to live; and rises not
more replenished with food,
then with thankfulnesse.</p>
                  <p>In a due season he betakes
himself to his rest,<note place="margin">§ 5. His nights rest.</note> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
not to alter the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of day, and night, nor
dares confound, where distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is made by his Maker;
It is not with him as with
the brute creatures, that have
nothing to look after but the
meer obedience of nature;
he doth not therefore lay
himself down as the swine
in the stye, or a dog in a ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,
without any further pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to his desired sleep, but
improves those faculties
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:96769:133"/>
which he is now closing up,
to a meet preparation for an
holy repose: for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
he first casts back his
eye to the now-expired day;
and seriously considers how
he hath spent it; and will
be sure to make his recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
even with his God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he part. Then he lifts
up his eyes and his heart to
that God, who hath made
the night for man to rest in;
and recommends himself ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
to his blessed protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and then closeth his eyes
in peace, not without a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
meditation of his last
rest; his bed represents to
him, his grave; his linnen,
his winding sheet; his sleep,
death; the night, the many
days of darknesse: and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96769:134"/>
he so composeth his
soul, as if he lookt not to
wake till the morning of the
resurrection: After which,
if he sleep, he is thankfully
chearfull; if he sleep not,
his reins chasten, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
him in the night sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
and if sleep be out of
his eyes, yet God and his
Angels are not: Whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he awakes, in those hands
he findes himself, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rests sweetly, even when
he sleeps not. His very
dreams however vain, or
troublesome, are not to him
altogether unprofitable; for
they serve to bewray not
onely his bodily temper, but
his spirituall weaknesses,
which his waking resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
shall endevour to correct.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:96769:134"/>
He so applies himself to
his pillow, as a man that
meant not to be drowned in
sleep, but refreshed, not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his rest by the insatiable
lust of a sluggish and drowzie
stupidnesse, but by the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of his health, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitation
to his calling; and
rises from it (not too late)
with more appetite to his
work, then to a second slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
chearfully devoting the
strength renued by his late
rest, to the honour and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the giver.</p>
                  <p>His carriage is not strange,<note place="margin">§ 6. His car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note>
insolent, surly, and overly
contemptuous, but familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meek, humble, courteous:
as knowing what mold he is
made of; and not knowing
any worse man then himself;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:96769:135"/>
He hath an hand ready upon
every occasion to be helpfull
to his neighbour; as if he
thought himself made to do
good; He hates to sell his
breath to his friend, where
his advice may be usefull;
neither is more ambitious of
any thing under heaven, then
of doing good offices; It is
his happinesse if he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
quarrels, and make
peace between dissenting
friends. When he is chosen
an Umpire, he will be sure
to cut even betwixt both
parties; and commonly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaseth
both, that he may
wrong neither; If he be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
forth to Magistracy, he
puts off all private interests,
and commands friendship to
give place to justice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:96769:135"/>
he knows no couzens, no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies;
neither couzens for
favour, nor enemies for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
but looks right for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to the cause, without
squinting aside to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
No flattery can keep
him from brow-beating of
vice; no fear can work him
to discourage vertue: Where
severity is requisite, he hates
to enjoy anothers punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and where mercy may
be more prevalent, he hates
to use severity; Power doth
not render him imperious
and oppressive, but rather
humbles him in the awfull
expectation of his account.</p>
                  <p>If he be called to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Gods Embassie to his
people, he dares not but be
faithfull in delivering that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:96769:136"/>
sacred Message; he cannot
now either fear faces, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
persons; it is equally
odious to him to hide and
smother any of Gods
counsell, and to foist in any
of his own; to suppresse
truth, and to adulterate it;
He speaks not himself, but
Christ; and labours not to
tickle the ear, but to save
souls: So doth he goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his flock as one that
means to feed them no lesse
by his example, then by his
doctrine; and would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
himself, if he did not
live the Gospel, as well as
preach it; He is neither too
austere in his retirednesse,
nor too good-cheap in his
sociablenesse; but carries so
eaven an hand that his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:96769:136"/>
affablenesse may be free
from contempt, and that he
may win his people with a
loving conversation; If any
of his charge be mis-carried
into an errour of opinion,
he labours to reclaim him
by the spirit of meeknesse;
so as the mis-guided may
reade nothing but love in
his zealous conviction; if
any be drawn into a vicious
course of life, he fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
him back with a gentle,
yet powerfull hand; by an
holy importunity, working
the offender to a sense of
his own danger, and to a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
penitence.</p>
                  <p>Is he the master of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
he dares not be a Lion
in his own house; cruelly
tyrannizing over his meanest
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:96769:137"/>
drudge: but so moderately
exercises his power, as
knowing himself to be his
apprentices fellow-servant;
He is the mouth of his mei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to God, in his daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions;
offering up for
them the calves of his lips,
in his morning and evening
sacrifice; and the mouth of
God unto them in his whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
instructions, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admonitions: he goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them in all good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of piety, and holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and so governs, as one
that hath more then meer
bodies committed to his
charge.</p>
                  <p>Is he the husband of a
wife? He carries his yoak
even; not laying too much
weight upon the weaker
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:96769:137"/>
neck; His helper argues him
the principall, and he so
knows it, that he makes a
wise use of his just inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
so remembring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be the superiour, as
that he can be no other then
one flesh: He maintains
therefore his moderate au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with a conjugall
love, so holding up the right
of his sexe, that in the mean
time he doth not violently
clash with the britler vessel:
As his choice was not made
by weight, or by the voice,
or by the hiew of the hide,
but for pure affection groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon vertue; so the
same regards hold him close
to a constant continuance of
his chast love; which can
never yeeld either to change
or intermission.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:96769:138"/>
Is he a father of children?
he looks upon them as more
Gods, then his own; and
governs them accordingly:
He knows it is onely their
worse part which they have
received from his loins;
their diviner half is from
the father of lights, and is
now become the main part
of his charge. As God gave
them to him, and to the
world by him: so his chief
care is, that they may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
again to God; that
they may put off that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature which they took
from him, and be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of that divine nature
which is given them in their
regeneration. For this cause
he trains them up in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and religious educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:96769:138"/>
he sets them in their
way, corrects their exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances,
restraines their
wilde desires, and labours to
frame them to all holy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;
and so bestows
his fatherly care upon, and
for them, as one that had
rather they should be good
then rich, and would wish
them rather dead, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht:
he neglects not all
honest means of their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but the highest point
he aims at, is to leave God
their patrimony. In the
choice of their calling, or
match, he propounds, but
forces not, as knowing they
have also wils of their own,
which it is fitter for him to
bow, then to break. Is he a
son? he is such as may be fit
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:96769:139"/>
to proceed from such loins.</p>
                  <p>Is he a servant? he cannot
but be officious: for hee
must please two masters,
though one under, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the other; when his
visible master sees him not,
he knows he cannot be out
of the eye of the invisible;
and therefore dares not be
either negligent, or unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
The work that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes,
he goes through,
not out of fear, but out of
conscience; and would doe
his businesse no otherwise
then well, though he served
a blinde master; He is no
blab of the defects at home,
and where he cannot defend,
is ready to excuse: He yeelds
patiently to a just reproof,
and answers with an humble
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:96769:139"/>
silence: and is more carefull
not to deserve, then to avoid
stripes.</p>
                  <p>Is he a subject? He is aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
affected to Soveraignty,
as knowing by whom the
powers are ordained; He
dares not curse the King, no
not in his thought; nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
the Ruler of his people,
though justly faulty: much
less dare he sclander the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of Gods anointed. He
submits not onely for wrath,
but also for conscience sake,
to every Ordinance of God;
yea, to every Ordinance of
man for the Lords sake; not
daring to disobey in regard
of the oath of God; If he
have reacht forth his hand
to cut off but the skirt of the
Royall robe, his heart smites
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:96769:140"/>
him: He is a true paymaster,
and willingly renders tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to whom tribute, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
to whom custome,
honour to whom honour is
due; and justly divides his
duties betwixt God and
<hi>Caesar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, in what ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
he stands, he is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
faithfull, consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
observant of his rule,
and carefull to be approved
such, both to God and men.</p>
                  <p>He hath fully informed
himself of all the necessary
points of religion;<note place="margin">§ 7. His reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in matter of Religion.</note> and is
so firmly grounded in those
fundamentall and saving
truths, that he cannot be
carried about with every
winde of doctrine; as for
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96769:140"/>
collaterall and unmateriall
verities, he neither despiseth,
nor yet doth too eagerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
them; He lists not to
take opinions upon trust;
neither dares absolutely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
any guide, but those
who he knows could not
erre; He is ever suspicious
of new faces of Theologicall
truths; and cannot think it
safe to walk in untroden
paths: Matters of specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are not unwelcome to
him; but his chief care is
to reduce his knowledge to
practise, and therefore he
holds nothing his own, but
what his heart hath appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated,
and his life acted:
He dares not be too much
wedded to his own conceit;
and hath so much humility,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:96769:141"/>
as to think the whole Church
of Christ upon earth wiser
then himself; However he
be a great lover of constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
yet upon better reason
he can change his minde in
some litigious, and un-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
truths, and can be
silent where he must dissent.</p>
                  <p>His discourse is grave, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
pertinent,<note place="margin">Prov. 3. 27, 28.</note> free from
vanity, free from offence;
In secular occasions nothing
fals from him but seasonable
and well-advised truths; In
spirituall, his speech is such,
as both argues grace, and
works it: No foul and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoury
breath proceeds out
of his lips; which he abides
not to be tainted with any
rotten communication, with
any slanderous detraction:
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:96769:141"/>
If in a friendly merriment he
let his tongue loose to an
harmlesse urbanity, that is
the furthest he dares goe;
scorning to come within the
verge of a base scurrility.</p>
                  <p>He is not apt to spend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in censures, but as for
revilings, and cursed speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
against God, or men,
those his soul abhorreth. He
knowes to reserve his
thoughts by locking them
up in his bosome under a
safe silence, and when hee
must speak, dares not be too
free of his tongue, as well
knowing that in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of words there wanteth
not sinne. His speeches are
no other then seasonable,
well fitted both to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and occasion; Jigges at
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:96769:142"/>
a funerall, Lamentations at a
feast, holy counsell to scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
discouragements to the
dejected, and applauses to the
prophane, are hatefull to
him; He meddles not with
other mens matters, much
lesse with affairs of State;
but keeps himself wisely
within his own compasse:<note place="margin">§ 8. His dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</note>
not thinking his breath well
spent, where he doth not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
teach, or learn.</p>
                  <p>He is so perpetually resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in heaven,<note place="margin">§ 9. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</note> that he is
often in every day before
the throne of Grace; and he
never comes there without
a supplication in his hand;
wherein also he loves to be
importunate; and he speeds
accordingly, for he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
empty; whiles other
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:96769:142"/>
cold suiters that come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but in some good fits
of devotion, obtain nothing
but denials; He dares not
presse to Gods foot-stool in
his own name, (he is consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
enough of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse)
but he comes
in the gracious and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
name of his righteous
Mediatour, in whom hee
knows he cannot but be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted;
and in an humble
boldnesse for his onely sake
craves mercy; no man is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more awfull, or more
confident; When he hath
put up his petition to the
King of heaven, he presumes
not to stint the time, or
manner of Gods condescent;
but patiently and faithfully
waits for the good hour, and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:96769:143"/>
leaves himself upon that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
wisdome and goodnes.
He doth not affect length so
much as fervour; neither so
much mindes his tongue as
his heart.</p>
                  <p>His prayers are suited ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the degrees of the
benefits sued for; He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
begs grace absolutely;
temporall blessings with
limitation; and is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
affected in the grant:
Neither is he more earnest in
craving mercies, then he is
zealously desirous to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributory
to God, when he
hath received them: not
more heartily suing to bee
rich in grace, then to improve
his graces to the honour and
advantage of the bestower:
With an awfull and broken
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:96769:143"/>
heart doth he make his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to that infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
from whose presence
he returns with comfort and
joy: His soul is constantly
fixed there whither he pours
it out; distraction and distrust
are shut out from his closet;
and he is so taken up with
his devotion, as one that
makes it his work to pray:
And when he hath offered
up his sacrifices unto God,
his faith listens and looks in
at the door of heaven to
know how they are taken.</p>
                  <p>Every man shows fair in
prosperity;<note place="margin">§ 10. His suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</note> but the main
triall of the Christian is in
suffering; any man may
steer in a good gale, and clear
sea, but the Mariners skill
will be seen in a tempest:
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:96769:144"/>
Herein the Christian goes
beond the Pagans, not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
onely, but admiration;
We rejoyce in tribulation,
saith the chosen Vessel; Lo
here a point transcending all
the affectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Heathenism.
Perhaps some resolute spirit,
whether out of a naturall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
or out of an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of fame or earthly glory,
may set a face upon a patient
enduring of losse, or pain;
but never any of those he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
Gentils durst pretend
to a joy in suffering; Hither
can Christian courage reach;
knowing that tribulation
worketh patience, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
experience, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
hope, and hope maketh
not ashamed.</p>
                  <p>Is he bereaved of his goods
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:96769:144"/>
and worldly estate? he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
himself in the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of a better treasure that
can never be lost; Is he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with sicknesse? his
comfort is that the inward
man is so much more renued
daily, as the outward perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
Is he slandered and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
disgraced? his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
is that there is a blessing,
which will more then make
him amends; Is he banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
he knows he is on his
way home-ward; Is he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned?
his spirit cannot
be lockt in; God and his
Angels cannot be lockt out;
Is he dying? To him to
live is Christ, and to dye is
gain; Is he dead? He rests
from his labours, and is
crowned with glory: Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:96769:145"/>
he is perfect gold that
comes more pure out of the
fire then it went in; neither
had ever been so great a
Saint in heaven, if he had
not passed through the flames
of his triall here upon earth.</p>
                  <p>He knows himself never
out of danger;<note place="margin">§ 11. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts.</note> and therefore
stands ever upon his guard;
neither of his hands are emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
the one holds out the
shield of faith; the other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageth
the sword of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
both of them are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in his perpetuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict.
He cannot be weary of
resisting, but resolves to dye
fighting: He hath a ward
for every blow; and as his
eye is quick to discern temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
so is his hand and
foot nimble to avoid them:
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:96769:145"/>
He cannot be discouraged
with either the number or
power of his enemies know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his strength is out
of himself, in him in whom
he can doe all things; and
that there can be no match
to the Almighty; He is
carefull not to give advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to his vigilant adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and therefore warily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voids
the occasions of sinne:
and if at any time he be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken
with the suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or subtilty of a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
he speedily recovers
himself by a serious repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
and fights so much
the harder because of his
foil. He hates to take quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of these spirituall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
nothing lesse then death
can put an end to this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell;
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:96769:146"/>
nor nothing below vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
                  <p>He is not so carefull to
keep his soul within his
teeth,<note place="margin">§ 12. His death.</note> as to send it forth
well addressed for happinesse:
as knowing therefore the last
brunt to be most violent, he
rouzeth up his holy fortitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to encounter that King of
fear, his last enemy, Death;
And now after a painfull
sicknesse, and a resolute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the fiercest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault,
it fals out with him as
in the meeting of the two
hostile brothers, <hi>Jacob</hi> and
<hi>Esau,</hi> in stead of grapling
he findes a courteous saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for stabs, kisses; for
height of enmity, offices of
love; Life could never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend
him so much, as Death
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:96769:146"/>
offers to doe: That tenders
him (perhaps a rough, but) a
sure hand to lead him to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and receives a welcome
accordingly: Neither is there
any cause to marvell at the
change; The Lord of life
hath wrought it; He having
by dying subdued death,
hath reconciled it to his
own; and hath (as it were)
beaten it into these fair
tearms with all the members
of his mysticall body: so
as, whiles unto the enemies
of God, Death is still no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then a terrible execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
of divine vengeance,
he is to all that are in Christ,
a plausible and sure convoy
unto blessednesse; The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
therefore now laid upon
his last bed, when this grim
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:96769:147"/>
senger comes to fetch him to
heaven, looks not so much at
his dreadfull visage, as at
his happy errand: and is
willing not to remember
what death is in it self, but
what it is to us in Christ;
by whom it is made so use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and beneficiall, that we
could not be happy without
it; Here then comes in the
last act, and employment of
faith; (for after this brunt
passed, there is no more use
of faith, but of vision) that
heartens the soul in a lively
apprehension of that blessed
Saviour, who both led him
the way of suffering, and is
making way for him to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
glory: That shews
him Jesus the Authour and
finisher of our faith, who for
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:96769:147"/>
the joy that was set before
him, endured the Crosse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising
the shame, and is set
down at the right hand of
the throne of God; That
clings close unto him, and
lays unremoveable hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his person, his merits, his
blessednesse; upon the wings
of this faith is the soul ready
to mount up toward that
heaven, which is open to
receive it; and in that act
of evolation puts it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of those blessed
Angels, who are ready to
carry it up to the throne of
Glory.</p>
