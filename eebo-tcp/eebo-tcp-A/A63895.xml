         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
DISCOURSE
ON
FORNICATION.</head>
            <head type="sub">Shewing the Greatness of that Sin, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
the Excuses pleaded for it from
the Examples of Ancient Times.</head>
            <p>WHile all good Men lament the Wickedness and
Debauchery of this Age and Nation, and
justly dread the heavy Judgments of God for
the notorious Iniquities every Day commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
among other Circumstances that increase their Grief,
and enhanse their Fears, They have this Discomfort; that
the Looseness of Mens Manners had corrupted their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and defaced their Sense of Good and Evil. So that
instead of Humiliation before God, some Men justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and are so far from abandoning their Vices that they
plead Innocence, and upon the Perpetration of the vilest
Crimes, cry out with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Harlot, that <hi>they have done
nothing amiss.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is in no Sin more practised than in those of Adultery
and Fornication. Adultery may possibly be allowed to have
somewhat of Ill in it; especially on the Womans Side,


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98885:4"/>
where there is a manifest Injury to a whole Family; and yet
it is an Argument that this makes no great Impression on
some Peoples Consciences, because it is so openly and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly
practised. But Fornication, by the leud Persons of
this Age, is avowed to be innocent and harmless. And yet
there must be a great share both of Confidence and Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in that Christian who disputes the Unlawfulness of a
Vice, which in the whole New Testament is frequently
and expresly declared to shut Men out of the Kingdom of
God. If the Authority of the Gospel was but submitted to
by these Men, and suffered to guide their Consciences as it
ought; no more would be needful to convince and restrain
them, than any one of these Texts, wherein it is said, that
<hi>no Whoremonger, or unclean Person, has any Inheritance in the
Kingdom of Christ and of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this alone will not now prevail; They appeal from
the Gospel to the Law, and tell you how, as they imagin,
was the Practice of ancient Times. They expostulate with
you how it comes to pass, that what was anciently tolerated
and allowed, comes now to be reckoned such a dreadful and
enormous Crime; so that they make it a matter of Debate
and Controversy, and must have their Objections and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
answered, before the Gospel shall be heard, or they can
become sensible of their Wickedness, and give any Hope of
their being reclaimed. The Preachers may say what they
will in their Pulpits about the Justice and Severity of God,
and the Vengeance which he threatens against Sinners.
This is never like to move Men, while they conceit their
Actions justifiable, and perswade themselves that they do not
come within the Verge of those Menaces.</p>
            <p>At a time therefore when the Piety and Wisdom of our
Governors seem resolved to check and restrain the intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Growth of Impiety: It may not be unseasonable to
treat with these Men, and lay open the Heinousness and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Immorality of one of the most predominant Sins of this


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98885:4"/>
Age; and if I mistake not, one of the great Occasions and
Promoters of a Spirit of Atheism, Profaneness, and Irreligion.</p>
            <p>I hope, what I shall say on this Subject may be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to those whose Consciences are not feared, and who are
not wholly given unto vile Affections and a reprobate Mind.
But they who resolve to do any thing that gratifies their
Lusts, though never so expresly forbidden, may believe any
thing that favours those Pleasures, tho' never so evidently
false and absurd.</p>
            <p>If I do not say all that might be said to the Advantage of
so considerable a Subject; I hope at least that it may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
invite or provoke better Judges to take so good a Cause
in hand.</p>
            <p>The certain Immorality of this Practice, and the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this Sin, I shall endeavour to make appear by these
Arguments.</p>
            <p>I. That Fornication is a Violation of God's positive Law,
in the original Institution of Marriage.</p>
            <p>II. That it is expresly forbidden in the Gospel, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
inconsistent with that pure and holy Life, which the
Christian Religion requires from us.</p>
            <p>III. Lastly, From the natural Turpitude of it, and the
Evils and pernicious Consequences that attend it.</p>
            <p>I. The first Assertion is, that Fornication is a Violation of
the positive Law of God in the original Institution of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
and this I shall endeavour to prove from <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 23, 24.
where, in the Relation of <hi>Eve</hi>'s being formed out of <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Side, there are these Words: <hi>Adam said, This is now Bone
of my Bones, and Flesh of my Flesh, she shall be called Woman,
because she was taken out of Man: And therefore shall a Man leave
his Father and Mother, and shall cleave unto his Wife, and they
shall be one Flesh.</hi> And for the better clearing of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I shall proceed thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98885:5"/>
1. I shall shew, that God, to provide against the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of Man's fal'n State, when he had lost the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Perfection of his Reason by Sin, did assist him in some
Cases by Divine Positive Laws.</p>
            <p>2. That these Words mention'd <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 24. have in them
the Force and Authority of a Divine Law.</p>
            <p>3. I shall consider what the true Sense and Purpose of this
Law is.</p>
            <p>4. I shall shew that Fornication is a certain Violation of it,
and must therefore be an heinous Sin, and highly offensive
unto God.</p>
            <p>5. Lastly, I shall consider the Objections that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
made against this Argument, from the Practice of
some particular Men in ancient times, that are nevertheless
recorded to have had a singular share in God's Favor.</p>
            <p>1. I shall shew that God, to provide against the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Man's fal'n State, when he had lost the original
Perfection of his Reason by Sin, did assist him in some Cases
by Divine Positive Laws. But here I would not be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in my Meaning of a Positive Law; By which Expression
is commonly understood such a Command or Precept as ties
Man up to Obedience in things of an indifferent Nature,
and where he was left at Liberty by the Laws of Reason.
This is the common meaning of this Phrase, and things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by Positive Laws in this Sense, are therefore supposed
to have no real Evil or Immorality in them. And though it
is certain, that God did very early give Mankind some such
positive Institutions, yet I do by no means intend the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Institution of Marriage to be positive in such a Sense, as
to suppose that it has no Foundations in the Laws of Nature,
or the Principles of Reason, for that it most certainly has.
But my Meaning is, that to prevent either Ignorance or any
Misconstruction of the Laws of Reason in favour of Man's
Lusts: God was pleased to confirm some of the Principles of
Reason by Revelation, and strengthen the Laws of Nature by
Positive Institution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:98885:5"/>
For we must consider, that the Laws of Nature or Reason
are either, 1. Such general Precepts and obvious Inferences
from them, as every considering Man may see and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of their Obligation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or else, 2. Such Remoter Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Virtue and Goodness, which though they have their
Foundation in Reason, yet they lie at a greater Distance
from the first plain Notices, and consequently must be found
out by a more careful and difficult Deduction. And tho' I
do not at all doubt but that Man, in that Perfection of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in which he was originally created, was then a sufficient
Guide unto himself in all these Cases: Yet, when humane
Nature was corrupted and depraved, he did then require
some farther Help. Then, either Sloth, Inconsideration,
Prejudice, the Imperfection of his Reason now impaired by
Sin, and the Influence of his Passions and Affections to bribe
and pervert his Judgment: Might easily make him ignorant
of such more distant Principles, although they had their
Foundation in the Laws of Nature. For which reason our
wise and good God, of his wonderful Compassion and Love
to Mankind, was pleased to come in to our Assistance, and
to prevent the Influence of our Lusts, enlightned our Minds
by Revelation, and confirmed and establish'd the Authority
of some such natural Laws, by making them also express and
positive Institutions. And this is the Sense in which I wou'd
be now understood to speak of Divine Positive Laws.</p>
            <p>Now the Jews were of opinion that God gave <hi>Adam</hi> seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
such Laws to direct him in things that were in themselves
Good or Evil: Because that Good or Evil of them, was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
enough to the common Observation of Mens depraved
Minds. Such they esteemed the Case of incestuous Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
which, they say, God forbid by express Law to <hi>Adam,</hi>
therein ordaining, that after Mankind was so far multiplied,
that the Marriage of Brother and Sister was no longer neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to the Propagation of Human Race; they shou'd all
from thenceforth become unlawful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98885:6"/>
And when it shall be consider'd, that the natural Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of them has been a Subject of Debate in several Ages: It
will be the more reasonable to conclude that there was some
very early Positive Law that prohibited all such. Because
this is one of the Sins charged upon the Canaanites, and
their Example alleged as a Caution and Warning to the
Israelites, <hi>Lev.</hi> xviii. 24. <hi>Defile not your selves in any of these
things, for in all these the Nations are defiled which I cast out
before you.</hi> Now when it shall be consider'd how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
it has been thought in all Ages, to evince the certain
Immorality of such by the clear Evidence of any natural
Law only, in the Transgression of which the Canaanites
were guilty: It is more probable that God added the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of some Positive Law, restraining both them and all
Mankind in this respect.</p>
            <p>And tho Sacrifices were not so in their Nature Good,
as to be of Perpetual Use and Everlasting Obligation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet as
they made up a considerable Part of the divine Worship of
almost all Nations, until the Incarnation of our Saviour; so
I think they also are no improper Instances in our present
purpose. What Law of Nature only shou'd dictate them
is very hard to shew. Reason indeed teaches to worship God
after the best manner that we can. But I cannot imagin
that any Principle of Reason only teaches that to burn the
Fat of Beasts, or the Fruits of the Earth, can be an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
way of honouring God, or of expressing our Dependance
and Thanks. Or that the Light of Nature only cou'd ever
guide and determin Mankind so universally to such Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices:
Which our best Reason teaches us are in themselves
not acceptable, but only valued as Types and Figures of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sacrifice to come.</p>
            <p>Nor can I believe, but that the setting apart one Day in
seven, for the Worship of God our Creator, was what he
Ordained and Commanded from the beginning. For tho
some wou'd have those Words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2, 3. to be spoken by


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98885:6"/>
way of Anticipation; yet that is precariously asserted, and
without any Proof. Whereas there are several good Reasons
to be alleged for the more early Original of that divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>1. Because the reason of keeping that Day holy is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
founded on the Consideration of God's resting from
his Work in the Creation. For it seems odd, that God
shou'd compleat the Creation of the Universe in six Days,
and rest on the seventh; only to give Authority to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
temporary Ordinance, of one Particular Little Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that too, that was not to Commence till about two
thousand Years after.</p>
            <p>2. Because it is not to be supposed, that God all that
while took no care for the establishing public Worship in
memory of the Creation; to which the appointing some
set Time was in a great measure necessary.</p>
            <p>And 3. Because it is mentioned again, <hi>Exod.</hi> xvi. 23. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ever God gave the Law to the Jews from <hi>Mount Sinai:</hi>
And which, for that reason, I conjecture not to have been
the original Institution, but only the Reviving an ancient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Ordinance, which by their long sojourning and Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they had neglected and lost.</p>
            <p>All this together, I hope, puts it out of doubt that God
very early assisted Man's Reason by some express Positive
Laws.</p>
            <p>The second thing is,</p>
            <p>2. That these Words above mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 23, 24.
have in them the Force and Authority of a divine Institution
or Law. For the Confirmation of which, I shall add no
more than this single Reflection; that our blessed Saviour
and his Apostles, in all the Questions put to them about the
Validity of Marriage, and the Unlawfulness of Divorce: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
refer to this original Institution, and by the soie Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of that, determin the Controversies, and decide all
Disputes about them. Which shews without Contradiction,


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98885:7"/>
that Christ knew these Words to have in them the obligatory
Force of a divine Law; or otherwise, the Determinations
which he gave from the Authority of them, cou'd not have
had that Force and Weight which he intended. Whatever
is farther needful for the Proof of this, will occur as we
proceed,</p>
            <p>3. To consider what the true Purpose, Design, and
Meaning of this Law is. Now the most obvious and first
Sense of it without doubt is, to enjoin a Perpetual and Inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Cohabitation of Man and Wife. They shall dwell
together, and <hi>leave both Father and Mother</hi> to that very end,
if need so require. But this is not all. The full Scope of the
Place must be fetcht from the near Relation and close Union
that is here pronounced to be between them. <hi>They two shall
be one Flesh,</hi> which the Generality of Interpreters expound
by the Love and sincere Affection which they ought always
to have for each other. And tho this, no doubt, is a
very good and useful Construction of the Place, yet neither
is this all. St. <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> v. 28, 29. lays down this as a just
and necessary Foundation of their mutual Love; <hi>so ought
Men to love their Wives as their own Bodies; he that loveth his
Wife loveth himself. And no Man ever yet hated his own Flesh.</hi>
But that there is more in this than a bare Union of Affections,
is evident by what is here urged by <hi>Adam</hi> as the Ground of
it. <hi>She is Bone of my Bones, and Flesh of my Flesh, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shall a Man leave his Father and Mother, and shall cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Wife, and they shall be one Flesh.</hi> From whence it is
plain, that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were one Flesh in a more litteral
Sense, in that she was a Part of him, and by the Almighty
Power of God made out of him.</p>
            <p>And tho every Wife is not thus formed out of the Side
of her Husband, yet every Man and his Wife are esteemed
of God, and ought to think themselves made as much <hi>One</hi>
Flesh by Marriage, as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> themselves were. And
the great Purpose and Design of this Place is to proclaim and


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98885:7"/>
declare them to be so. And whatever the Nature of their
Union may be, which St. <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> 5. 32. intimates <hi>is a
great Mystery:</hi> the Foundation of that Union seems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in their Cohabitation, and the mutual Partnership of
each others Bed. By which they become so much one, that
they ought never to separate from each other: Till God who
by this Ordinance and Law joins them together and makes
them one, shall by Death dissolve that Union, and part
them asunder.</p>
            <p>And that this is the true Meaning and Design of these
Words I am able to make appear from the Authority of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. Who upon this very Consideration, and this
Argument thus stated, proves to the Jews the inseparable
Union between a Man and his Wife, and the Unlawfulness
of a Divorce or Separation upon any account. The Place I
refer to is <hi>Matt.</hi> xix. 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where we are told that the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi>
came to him tempting him and saying, <hi>Is it lawful for a
Man to put away his Wife for every Cause?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In answer to whom, he takes no notice at all of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Pretences usually alleged, but refers them to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Institution of Marriage mentioned in these Words, <hi>v. 4.
Have ye not read, that he that made them in the beginning made
them Male and Female, and said, for this cause shall a Man leave
his Father and his Mother, and shall cleave unto his Wife, and
they two shall be one flesh? What therefore God has joined together
let no Man put asunder.</hi> This is <hi>Christ</hi>'s Decision of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
The Force of which Answer turns all upon these
Points. 1. That the Union between Man and Wife is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their Cohabitation, and the Partnership of each others
Bed. 2. That God from the beginning Ordained that this
Union shou'd be inseparable and inviolable. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that it
shou'd continue during the whole Life of both. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is that Divorce becomes unlawful, and contrary to
God's Original Institution. For <hi>whom God hath joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
let no Man put asunder.</hi> 3. That this Union which


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98885:8"/>
God has made thus inseparable, shou'd be between Man and
Wife only, exclusive of all others. And therefore every
Man or Woman by thus uniting to any Second Person, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Life of the First, does thereby break that Union
with the First which God commanded, when once made,
that it shou'd be perpetual. Upon this it is, that <hi>Christ</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
all such Marriages upon Divorce to be Adultery.
<hi>Matt.</hi> xix. 9. <hi>I say unto you whosoever shall put away his Wife,
except it be for Fornication, and shall marry another, committeth
Adultery. And whosoever shall marry her that is put away com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
Adultery.</hi> In which Words there is a double Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of what I now maintain.</p>
            <p>1. That marrying upon Divorce, or marrying a Person
divorced is Adultery. Because he that marries upon Divorce,
takes a Second Wife, while his Union and Obligation to the
First, by God's Original Institution is still in force. And he
that marries a Woman that is divorced marries another
Man's Wife in the Sense of God's Law, and in that commits
Adultery. Both these Cases are a Violation of that Union,
which God decreed shou'd not be violated.</p>
            <p>2. The second thing is, the Exception which <hi>Christ</hi> makes
to these Cases. <hi>Except it be for Fornication.</hi> Where he
seems to tolerate Divorce upon Adultery; because the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
Person has first violated that Union which God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to have been perpetual. Upon these things turns the
whole Stress of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Answer to the Jews. And from this
Account which he has here given it manifestly appears, that
this Original Institution did not only ordain, that the Union
of Man and Wife shou'd be perpetual, but moreover that
this Union shou'd be made between them two only, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of all others whatsoever. And this God sufficiently sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by making but one Man and one Woman; which
without all question, was designed to Illustrate and give Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to this, as the true Purpose of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98885:8"/>
3. And if this be the true meaning of that Divine Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Law, as I think I have shewn that it is: from
hence it will be easie to prove,</p>
            <p>4. Lastly, That Fornication is a manifest Transgression of
the Law, and by consequence an Heinous Sin. For, that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which is founded in the Partnership of the Bed, and is
thereupon declared to be Perpetual, and Inseparable, and
Exclusive of all others; is as inconsistent with the rambling
Amours of Fornicators as Light with Darkness. For at the
same time that God ordains that all Persons who are so made
one, shou'd preserve that Union Perpetually and Inviolably:
In so doing he to all sufficient Intents and Purposes decrees,
that no Persons shou'd so come together, but upon a Sincere
Purpose, and Solemn Contract of Perpetual Union and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation
between them two only, and exclusive of all
others. What then can be more directly contrary to such a
Law, than the Roving Loves of Fornicators? Who never
intend, much less enter into a Solemn Contract, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of that Perpetual Cohabitation which God ordain'd.
And who, instead of such mutual Constancy between
them two only, exclusive of all others, only contrive to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
their Lusts, like Brutes, without any Restraint, or
any Regard to such an Ordinance. What is more evident,
than that all such Practices are absolutely forbidden by this
Law of God, and therefore offensive to him? The Purpose
and Design of God in this Law I say was, not only to decree,
that the Union between Man and Wife shou'd be perpetual:
But also to ordain that no Man or Woman whatsoever shou'd
so come together, but upon a Solemn Contract of that Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and Inseparable Union first made.</p>
            <p>And that I may not seem to assert any thing of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without good Authority: I must here observe to you,
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> says the same thing, and urges this same Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
to this very purpose, and to dissuade Men from this
very Sin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 15, 16. <hi>Shall I take the Members of Christ


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98885:9"/>
and make them the Members of an Harlot? God forbid. For
know you not that he that is join'd to an Harlot is one Body? For
two saith he shall be one flesh.</hi> In which Words it is evident
and plain, that he alludes to this Original Institution of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 24. And that he makes the Union to
consist in the Partnership of the Bed. <hi>He that is join'd to an
Harlot is one body. (i.e.)</hi> is one flesh with her, as Man and
Wife are one, and by that Union which God ordained to be
the Foundation of perpetual and inseparable Cohabitation.
And by this Consequence he declares, that they who thus
come together without such a solemn Contract of Perpetual
Union and Cohabitation; are certainly guilty of a Great Sin,
and do what God has forbid, and what does not at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Christians, and Members of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Mystical Body.
<hi>Shall I take the Members of Christ and make them the Members of
an Harlot? God' forbid.</hi> This is unlawful; this is contrary
to God's Original Institution and Command. And if this be
so, I think this is as clear a Proof of the Sinfulness of Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as if it had been expresly said in <hi>Genesis, thou shalt not
commit Fornication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now let us reflect, how this one Argument alone dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
both the Sinfulness, and the Danger of this Practice.
Suppose that we were in the dark as to the Evidences of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
against this Sin, yet why shou'd not the Will and Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God influence and determine Mens Consciences?
What better Proof can we have of any thing's being a Sin,
than that it is a certain Violation of God's Express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and Laws? Or what Shadow of Reason can any Man
produce why the Decree of God at our first Creation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by a new Sanction of <hi>Christ;</hi> shou'd not bind him to
the Observance of it, as firmly as any the clearest Law of
mere Nature only? Or why shou'd not the Danger of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing
it be as great? To imagin that God will not exact
Obedience to his Laws, is to charge him with Folly in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
them. And if he will punish Transgressions and Sin;


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98885:9"/>
how will Leud Men deliver themselves out of his Hand? So
that if Fornication be such a Violation of God's Institution
and Law, as I think it already appears to be: This so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discovers the Sin and Danger of it; that I cannot see what
Rational Hope these Men can entertain, but upon Repentance,
of escaping his Vengeance for so vile a Transgression. But,</p>
            <p>5. Lastly, I proposed to consider the Objections that are
commonly made against all this. The Sum of what they
object against this Inviolable Union is, that <hi>David,</hi> celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for a Man after God's own Heart, not only committed
Adultery with <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> and murder'd her Husband; but
also had many Wives at once, and might divorce them at
his Pleasure; and consequently did not Live up to this Rule.
That <hi>Solomon</hi> also, who is fam'd in the Old Testament for
an inspired Gift of Wisdom from God: And <hi>Abraham,</hi> the
Father of the Faithful; and in short, all or most of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Patriarchs,</hi> are recorded to have had many Wives or
Concubines. And why, say they, may not we think our
selves innocent, and safe in the nonobservance of such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution:
If the same was done by those very Persons, who
are honour'd with the Titles of <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and celebrated
for their extraordinary Share in God's Favour?</p>
            <p>And as for keeping Constant to those Wives or Concubines
they chose, it is nothing so. Divorce was allowed, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Heathens, but even by God's Laws given to the
Jews, and that upon Small Dislike. And why, say they,
shou'd we imagin any Sinfulness in that which God himself
allowed?</p>
            <p>And as for Fornication, they plead it has been held Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
both by Heathens, Jews, and some Christians. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
say they, every where allow it, nor do we find the
Jewish Law directly to forbid it. Why then shou'd we be
frighted from so dear a Pleasure, by the Cavils of a Tribe of
Men, whose Trade and Livelyhood it is to preach against
us? This is the Sum of what they plead, and I think I have


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98885:10"/>
set down the Objections with all the Fairness and Advantage
to their Cause, which they themselves can in Justice claim.
Now if it shall appear, that there is nothing in all this, however
plausible and promising it may look; that will either prove
Fornication Harmless and Innocent, or exempt those who
live in it, either from great Guilt or severe Punishment:
This Objection will do them no good at all. And that this is
the Truth of the Case, I doubt not will be very Evident.</p>
            <p>The full Force of the Objection is drawn. 1. From the
Practice of such Men as the Scripture celebrates for Holy
Men. 2. From the Laws of Jews and other Nations, not
strictly and severely forbidding this Vice, and binding Men
up to the Strictness of this Law. But,</p>
            <p>1. As for that Part of the Objection which is built upon
their Remarks on the Actions of Good and Holy Men: I
have often wonder'd that the Debauches of our Age, shou'd
ever mention <hi>David</hi>'s Miscarriage with <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> as they
do, to excuse and countenance them. For is it not as good
an Instance to prove the Lawfulness of Murder and Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as of Adultery? Or is there any thing in that whole Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
that proves the Innocence of either? Is there not a
plain Declaration both of God's heavy Displeasure for this
Sin of <hi>David</hi>'s, and also of his Signal Repentance? 'Tis true,
<hi>David</hi> is called <hi>a Man after God's own Heart:</hi> But not for any
such Action as this. For it is said expresly, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> xi. 27.
<hi>The thing that</hi> David <hi>had done displeased the Lord.</hi> And God's
Anger is at large declared against him in the xii. Chapter.
All then that these Men can infer from hence is, that the
best of Men, by the common Frailty of Human Nature,
and for want of due Vigilance and Circumspection over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
may sometimes fall into very great Transgressions.
The Consideration of which shou'd never be alleged for our
Justification; but shou'd rather teach us to be the more
Watchful and the less Censorious, and whenever Men do
fall, it shou'd engage them to return to God by Repentance


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98885:10"/>
as <hi>David</hi> did. Without this, he had not been <hi>the Man after
God's own Heart,</hi> but instead of that, had found the dire Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of God's Displeasure, and heavy Vengeance against this
Sin. And I wou'd earnestly recommend it to all those who
have been guilty of <hi>David</hi>'s Transgression, to follow his
Example in his Repentance, and Contrition, and Devout
and Exemplary Humiliation.</p>
            <p>As for the other Instances they mention of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
<hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Jephtha</hi> that had Concubines, and
yet are Characterized in Scripture for Good Men, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
favour'd of God: I must observe one thing by the way,
<hi>viz.</hi> That what the Scripture calls Concubines, were not
Women that prostituted themselves, but such as they took
upon a Solemn Contract and Covenant as Wives. And
sometimes they are expresly so call'd. As particularly, <hi>Gen.</hi>
xvi. 1. Sarah <hi>had an Hand-maid, an Egyptian, whose Name
was</hi> Hagar, <hi>and she gave her to her Husband</hi> Abraham <hi>to be his
Wife.</hi> And again, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxv. 1. Abraham <hi>took a Wife, and
her Name was</hi> Keturah. And yet in Verse the 6th. she is
called a Concubine, and also 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 32. To the better
understanding of which it is remarkable, what a Jewish
Doctor has said upon this Place, as a<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bishop</hi> Patrick <hi>on</hi> Gen xxvi.</note> Reverend Father of
our own Church has cited him out of Mr. <hi>Selden, She was his
Concubine because of her Servile Condition, but his Wife, because
married with Covenants to provide for her and her Children.</hi> So
<hi>Grotius</hi> tells us, that they were such Servants, or others of
a low Rank, whom they married upon Contract giving
them a Dowry; and tho' their Children did not inherit,
they had Portions allotted them out of their Father's Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and were inferior to other Wives, only in their Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>(i. e.)</hi> because they once were Servants. Agreeably to
this we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxv. 5. Abraham <hi>gave all that he had, (i. e.)</hi>
the Sum of his Inheritance, <hi>to</hi> Isaac; <hi>but unto the Sons of the
Concubines he had, he gave Gifts, and sent them away.</hi> All
therefore that can from hence be concluded is that Polygamy,


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98885:11"/>
or the having many Wives was then practised and allow'd.
But this will make nothing at all for Fornication, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a vast Difference between such a Married Concubine and
a Common Prositute. The most that can possibly from
hence be drawn to their Advantage is, that these good Men
and highly favour'd of God, did not observe the Law we
mention in any such Sense as we now put upon it.</p>
            <p>For a farther Answer therefore to this whole Objection, I
wou'd offer these three things to be seriously consider'd.</p>
            <p>1. That tho' it shou'd be granted that Polygamy, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
and even Fornication it self was tolerated by the
Laws of the Heathens, Jews, or by the Customs of Ancient
Times; it does by no means from hence follow that any of
these were in themselves Innocent and without Offence to
Almighty God.</p>
            <p>2. That Fornication especially was never so tolerated by
any of them, as thereby to be absolutely Approved; nor
ever had so much Countenance, but that we may find clear
Evidence of its being accounted an Hateful and Detestable
Vice.</p>
            <p>3. That whatever Connivance, Indulgence, or Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from Punishment God was pleased to grant upon the
Transgression of this Law in Ancient Times; he has now
absolutely Revoked, and made void all such, and brought
us to this his Original Institution. We are under a more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Law, and a better Dispensation; and therefore we are
justly tied up to stricter Rules as the indispensable Condition
of Salvation.</p>
            <p>If these things can be clearly made out, as I hope they
may, no Just Countenance, or Excuse for this Wicked Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
can there be drawn from such Examples.</p>
            <p>1. That tho' it shou'd be granted that Polygamy, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
and even Fornication it self was tolerated by the Laws
of Heathens, Jews, or by the Customs of Ancient Times:
It does by no means from hence follow that any of these were


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98885:11"/>
of themselves innocent, and without Offence to Almighty
God. And that because none of these were perfect Rules for
the Government of Life in all things exactly according to
God's Will.</p>
            <p>1. As to the Heathens, if we speak of their General Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and exempt the particular Virtues of some few Men:
we know very well that they had deviated from the Ways
of Truth and Virtue, and were fal'n into very great and
abominable Corruptions. They scarce retained any Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the True God, and are therefore said to <hi>live as with
out God in the World, Eph.</hi> 2. 12. They had Gods many,
but their Notions of them were so monstrously Vile and
Gross: that instead of Restraining, they rather. Tempted
and Invited them to the most Flagitious Immoralities. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such Men as these tolerated Whoredom and Adultery,
and all Uncleanness: is their Conversation fit to be drawn
into a President? How cou'd it be otherwise with them,
unless their own Natural Modesty restrained them? They
had the Examples of their very Gods to countenance them,
and such Abominable Practices made up a chief Part of those
Religious Rites with which they worshipped their Deities.
For these things they were Abandoned of God, who in the
Greatness of his Anger and Indignation withdrew from them
that ordinary Grace which he wou'd always afford Mankind,
and left them to themselves and the Lusts of their own Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Hearts. <hi>Rom. 1. 21. &amp;c. Because that when they knew God,
they yet glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
vain in their Imaginations, and their Foolish Hearts were
darkned: therefore God also gave them up to Vncleanness,
through the Lusts of their own Hearts, to dishonour their own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
And again, <hi>v. 26. For this cause God gave them up to
Vile Affections.</hi> And <hi>v. 28. As they did not like to retain God
in their Knowledg: God gave them over to a Reprobate Mind,
to do those things that are not seemly, being filled with all Vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
Fornication, Wickedness.</hi> So that the Loose Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98885:12"/>
and Corrupt Conversation of Men so far degenerated
from the Principles of True Religion, are very unfit to be
mentioned either for the Vindication, or the Excuse of Evils
committed in a Christian State. But,</p>
            <p>2. They perhaps may expect better Success in their Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from the Mosaical Law; because that is God's own,
given to his chosen People to be a Rule to them. And if God
himself tolerated any such Practices; is it not a Fair Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
from hence to conclude, that all such Practices are not
in their Nature Sinful? I answer, no not at all; because the
Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was Imperfect, and no Certain Absolute
Standard to determin the true nature of Good and Evil. I
do by no means grant that Fornication was allowed by that
Law, but only supposing that it had, I say it cou'd not
from hence follow by any necessary Consequence that there
was no Evil in it. And that because, tho' it was God's own
Law given to <hi>Moses</hi> by the Ministry of Angels, for the Use
of that People whom he had chosen out from the rest of the
World: yet it was far from being a Compleat Rule for the
good Government of Life, or from teaching Virtue in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>That Part of it which concerns Divine Worship establish't
a Gross and Pompous Worship, which chiefly consisted in
Shew; and was very different from that which is in it self
most pleasing and best acceptable unto God. A Spiritual
Worship is most agreable to his Nature; for <hi>God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jo. iv. 24.</note>
               <hi>and must be worshipped in Spirit and in Truth. (i. e.)</hi> with
Simplicity, and Sincerity of Heart; with a Pure and Holy
Conversation; both which are inconsistent with Adultery,
Fornication, and all manner of Leudnes and Sensuality.
Their Ceremonial Law, was either to be their Guide to bring
unto <hi>Christ,</hi> and by Figures and Representations to prepare
them for the Gospel, or else as a means by Condescention,
and humouring their Gross and Moody Tempers: to keep
them from falling into Abominable Idolatry, and that more


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98885:12"/>
Horrid Leudness with which the Gentile World did notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
pollute themselves.</p>
            <p>As for the ten Commandments, or any other Part that
concerned their Life and Manners; God 'tis true, forbid
the most heinous, and highest Degrees of Impiety and Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
among the rest as I shall shew by and by: but there
were several things truly Good and highly Commendable in
Religion; and several Evils, Hateful and Blameable before
both God and Man, about which this Law was in great
measure silent. Of these <hi>Christ</hi> has furnish't us with several
Instances. The Mosaical Law did expresly forbid only Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us that all Causeless and Immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Anger is offensive to God. That Law chiefly prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Perjury; But God detests also all Profaneness, by vain
Swearing, and needless Imprecations, some Degrees of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
then were allowed; tho' God approves that we shou'd
rather <hi>forgive Injuries</hi> and <hi>love our Enemies.</hi> And, which
more nearly concerns the Case before us, the Mosaical Law
expresly prohibits only Adultery, but God desires that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
both our Thoughts and Desires, and be <hi>pure both in
Heart and Mind.</hi> So that the Silence of the Mosaic Law is no
good Argument for any such Practice, that there is no certain
Evil or Immorality therein. So far from it, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon the account of these Concessions and Permissions,
which in a Prudential Regard to their Carnal Tempers he had
made, says expresly that he <hi>gave them Statutes that were not
good,</hi> Ezek. xx. 25.</p>
            <p>That this is the Case of Divorce, Christ has assured us,
<hi>Matt. xix. 8. For the Hardness of your Hearts, God hath suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you to put away your Wives, but from the beginning it was not
so.</hi> God's Allowance of this then manifestly appears not to
have proceeded from either the Innocence or Indifference of
this Practice; for he declares plainly that it was contrary to
the Original Institution. <hi>From the beginning it was not so.</hi>
But it was because he, who searcheth the Hearts, knew them


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98885:13"/>
to be a Subborn and Inflexible People, and who if they had
not had this Permission, wou'd perhaps have fal'n into Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or Adultery. God suffer'd this <hi>for the Hardness of their
Hearts;</hi> It was always offensive to him, tho' of his Great
Goodness and Compassion to Man's Weakness, he did then
connive at it, which indeed is what wise and good Lawgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are sometimes forced to do.</p>
            <p>As to Polygamy,<note place="margin">Grotius de jure B. &amp; P. l 2. cap. v. §. ix.</note> I find <hi>Grotius</hi> of Opinion, that that was
not contrary to God's Original Institution, which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
to have ordained that the Union, or Consociation of
Married Persons shou'd be inseparable and perpetual: but
not to enjoin the Marrying of one Person only. Either of
these Opinions is absolutely against Fornication, for those
who Prostitute themselves, violate this Law in both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.
But yet I must confess my self not satisfied with this
Account, nor with the Reason given for it, which is only
this; because Polygamy was anciently so much in use among
very good Men, from whence he wou'd conclude that it was
not contrary to the Will of God. He owns that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<hi>Deo gratissimum,</hi> most agreeable to God's Will that one
Man shou'd have but one Wife, but does not think that it
was absolutely unlawful to have more, because very good
Men had more. But with all due respect to his great Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
this does not satisfie me. And as I shall shew
anon that it is no good Consequence on which he grounds
this Opinion, so at present I have this Objection against it.
That Divorce was as much in use under the Law, as Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy
before it, nay more evidently permitted and allowed.
And yet Divorce is as contrary to one Part of the Institution,
as Polygamy to the other. And by consequence, it having
been the Custom in some Ages for good Men, to marry
more Wives than one, is no more a Proof that God's Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Law did not forbid it, than the Permission of Divorce
will prove that this Law did not ordain an inseparable Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and perpetual Cohabitation. God who allowed the one


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98885:13"/>
under the Law, might for the same Reason connive at the
other before the Law, and yet they might be both by a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of the Primitive Institution and Ordinance.</p>
            <p>And that this is in truth the case, I think will be very
plain, if we consider that it is from the words of Christ in
this very same discourse, that Polygamy is now made unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
under the Gospel. The question indeed was put by the
Pharisees about Divorce: but our Saviour's Answer, by clear
and necessary Consequence extends also to Polygamy. His
words are these,<note place="margin">Mat. xix 9.</note> 
               <hi>I say unto you, whosoever shall put away his
Wife, except it be for Fornication, and shall Marry another,
committeth Adultery. And he that Marrieth her who is put
away, committeth Adultery.</hi> Now the Reason of all this is
plain, if we suppose Polygamy, as well as Divorce, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Gods first Institution: For then he that Marries a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Divorced, Marries her who by the Law of God is
still esteem'd the Wife of her Husband; and this is Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
He that only puts away his Wife, is not said to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Adultery; but <hi>he that puts her away, and Marries another.</hi>
Divorce only may be a Sin, but it is the Marrying again
that makes the Adultery. Of which the only good Reason
to be given, is because it is not lawful to have more than one
Wife.</p>
            <p>Now when it shall again be consider'd, that all this part
of our Saviour's Discourse is an Explanation, and Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Original Institution and Law mentioned, <hi>v. 4, 5.
Have ye not read, that he which made them in the beginning,</hi> &amp;c.
we must conclude, that Polygamy as well as Divorce is a
Violation and Transgression of it.</p>
            <p>This plainly shews, that whatever Permission of, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance
at these Practices may be observed in the Jewish Law,
there are so many Imperfections in it, and Defects of that
compleater Righteousness, which God now requires, and
wou'd then, had that People been able to bear them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:98885:14"/>
3. And this will teach us last of all, what Answer is to be
given to that part of their Objection which is taken from the
Example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or any other of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before
the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> who, contrary to the purpose of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
had many Wives or Concubines. The sum of
whose case in short is this, that though they were noble Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns
of Faith and Obedience in those Trials, which God
made of them, and blessed, and highly favour'd for their
singular Confidence in him; yet they were not Patterns of
Universal Righteousness, and of all Virtue and Goodness in
Perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> had been brought up in an Idolatrous Country,
God calls him out from it, and engages him to worship him
alone, promising him great Blessings if he wou'd do so. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
believes Gods Promises, and obeys them; and God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,<note place="margin">Jo viii. 56. Heb. xi. 19.</note>
for his Illustrious Faith, declares, that <hi>in him all the
Nations of the Earth shou'd be blessed,</hi> by that <hi>Messiah</hi> which
was to descend from him. Thus <hi>Abraham believed in Christ,</hi>
and approved his Faith <hi>in the Resurrection from the Dead,</hi> by
his readiness to sacrifice his Son in whom these Blessings
were promised to him. These were eminent Instances of
Confidence and Obedience, with which God was so well
pleased, that he resolves to favour and bless him in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
manner. It is no where said in Scripture, that
<hi>Abraham</hi> was perfect in his Righteousness,<note place="margin">Gen xv. 6.</note> but that <hi>he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
God, and that was imputed to him for Righteousness.</hi> In
other things then he lived according to the Customs and
Manners of that Age in which he lived; among whom, it
seems, that Polygamy and Divorce had now prevailed. And
though God was not at all pleased with these Practices,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Bishop Patrick <hi>on</hi> Gen. xv. 6.</note> nor
did approve them; yet he was graciously pleased for the sake
of his other Virtues, and particularly of this singular Faith,
not to impute them to him, nor to punish them. This is all
that can be observed from the case of the Patriarchs, which
does by no means prove, that what they did was Innocent,


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98885:14"/>
or without Offence. The most that can be drawn from hence
is, that God in Regard to the different Ages, and Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
under which Men live, has not always discovered to
them what is best in it self, or most agreeable to his Holy
Will. But no Practice, or Custom, or Manners of antient
times can be improved into a just Vindication of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of either Polygamy, or Divorce, and much less of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication;
nor will any of these Examples prove that what
has formerly been done against the purpose and design of
this Original Institution, was for that reason free from guilt,
or inoffensive to Almighty God. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Argument will yet have greater force,
when we shall consider that we have now supposed more
than is indeed to be granted. For however the case was as
to Polygamy and Divorce, yet Fornication was never so to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated
as to be approved; nor ever had so much counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
but that we have clear Evidence that it was always
counted an hateful and detestable Vice.</p>
            <p>And to make this out, it will be requisite to consider that
there is a great deal of difference between <hi>Licita,</hi> and <hi>Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta,
(i. e.)</hi> between things tolerated in Governments to pass
unpunish'd, and things in their Nature Innocent and without
Evil.</p>
            <p>This is a rational distinction, and founded on one of the
<hi>Maxims</hi> of <hi>Civil Law;</hi>
               <note place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot. de Jure B. &amp; P. 342.</note> 
               <hi>Licitum dicitur quod Legibus non puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
In this sense every thing is <hi>Licitum quod fit impune;</hi>
which the Laws have not prohibited with a Punishment.
And whosoever shall consider the defects of all human Laws
whatever, will soon see that they can be no certain Standard
to distinguish the Good or Evil of Human Actions by. By
the Law of the xii Tables the Creditors might divide the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvent
Debtor's Body among them: It was tolerated, but
common Reason will tell us how much against all Rules of
Piety and Religion. Accordingly the Romans had a wise
Distinction,<note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gest. Lib. 1. Tit. 17 §. 144.</note> 
               <hi>Non omne quod Licitum est, honestum est. Every


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98885:15"/>
thing must not be esteemed Good and perfectly innocent; for the
restraint of which the Laws make no good Provision by assigning
Punishments.</hi> Governments may tolerate what Governors
do by no means Allow and Approve. That therefore is in
this Sense Lawful, which the Letter of the Law has not
made Penal in the Offender, which may happen in many
Cases against the Approbation and Good Liking of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver.
Thus it was in Divorce among the Romans, which
was permitted by their Law, but we are told that it was not
put in Practice for five hundred and twenty Years; their
own Sense of the Turpitude of it proving to them an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Restraint. Laws then may Tolerate, but Honesty
ties us up to act by Principles and Offices of Humanity. I
think therefore that it will be sufficient to my present Design
to shew, that notwithstanding any Toleration of this wicked
Practice among the Heathens, yet they were not insensible
of the Turpitude and certain immorality of it. By the Laws
of the <hi>Athenians</hi> then,<note place="margin">Ter. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph. A. iv. Sc. 5.</note> tho' Strangers <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Women of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countries were tolerated in this Practice, yet it was
an Infamous and Flagitious Crime to corrupt one that was
free-born, and the Offender who shou'd so transgress, was
by the Law compell'd to marry her.<note place="margin">M D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cier in Ter.</note> For this reason <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grina</hi>
or a <hi>Strange Woman,</hi> was the usual and common Phrase
for one that did thus prostitute her self. And for the same
reason the Scripture seems to have used the same Language,
<hi>Judges</hi> xi. 2. <hi>Thou shalt not inherit in our Father's House for
thou art the Son of a strange Woman.</hi> Among the Romans,
tho' <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Defence of <hi>Caelius,</hi> Excuses this Iniquity
and says, <hi>Quando hoc non factum? Quando reprehensum? Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
non permissum? &amp;c.</hi> Yet this indeed is but labouring to
make the best of a bad Cause, in behalf of his Client; for
in his Accusation of <hi>Cataline</hi> and his Morals, he makes it up
a considerable Part of their Charge, that He and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
were <hi>Aleatores, Adulteri, Impuri, impudici; Gamesters,
Adulterers, Vnclean, Vnchast.</hi> And again, <hi>ut comessationes,


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98885:15"/>
&amp; scorta quaererent, they hunt after Revels and Vnchast Women.</hi>
And how come so many sharp Reflections upon all such
Manners: if there had not been some great Evil, some
known certain Immorality therein? I will add but one Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
more out of Heathen Authors, and that I shall tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
for its great Confirmation of the Difference between
Lawful and Innocent things, on which I ground my present
Argument. It is out of <hi>Porphyry de Abstinentiâ, &amp;c.</hi> his
Words are these. <hi>The Law does not forbid the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to have Harlots, but lays a Tax upon such Women for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
and Permission, and yet it is accounted <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> but moderately
Vertuous, to have any Conversation with such.</hi> Which plainly
shews that whatever prevailed among the Heathen to the
Permission of such a Vice; was only Evil Custom, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Practice introduced contrary to the Dictates of their
Mind and their Natural Sense of Good and Evil.</p>
            <p>As to the Jews, I am of Opinion that all Fornication
was absolutely forbidden by their Law. For <hi>Deut.</hi> xxiii. 17.
it is commanded, <hi>There shall be no Whore of the Daughters of</hi>
Israel.<note place="margin">Spencer de Legibus <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

understand this Place to speak of, and forbid any Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelitish
Woman to prostitute her self in the Idolatrous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
as the Custom of some Gentiles was: yet as this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is chiefly raised from the lxxii. Paraphrastic Translation
of these Words, so the Reason they allege for this Law comes
up directly to our present Purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> that God wou'd
have his own People to abstain from the Leudness and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness
of the Gentiles, as well as from their Idolatry.</p>
            <p>And if they were not allowed to commit Leudness with
their own Women, much less with Strangers, because then
the Danger was greater as well as the Sin, in that by their
Sensual Communication they might be seduced to Revolt,
and by their Leudness fall into Apostacy and Idolatry. Thus
it happened in their Abode in the Wilderness, <hi>Numb</hi> xxv. 1, 2.


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98885:16"/>
               <hi>The People began to commit Whoredom with the Daughters of</hi>
Moab, <hi>and thereby they call'd the People unto the Sacrifices of
their Gods, and the People did eat and bowed down to their Gods.</hi>
Which Aggravation of their Crime so incensed God, that he
sent a Plague among them. And <hi>Phinehas,</hi> in a singular Fit
of Zeal, slaying one of their own Princes and the <hi>Midiana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
Woman caught in that Fault, was applauded and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of God, whose Indignation was thereby appeased,
and a Covenant of an Everlasting Priesthood given to <hi>Phineas</hi>
on that Account. And it is remarkable that St. <hi>Paul</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
to this Passage, charges the Guilt upon their Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 8. <hi>Neither let us commit Fornication, as some
of them committed, and fell in one Day three and twenty thousand.</hi>
And to make appear that I have now put no stricter meaning
upon the Jewish Laws than they themselves allowed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed:
I shall give you one Passage which <hi>Grotius</hi> has tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
out of <hi>Philo in vitâ Josephi.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Matt. v. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Other Nations,</hi> says he,
<hi>are allowed after fourteen Years of age in Cells and Stews to desile
themselves with Women that are Prostitutes for Gain: but we are
not allowed any such. With us Death is the Punishment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
against her that shall prostitute her self.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>So that before
Lawful Marriage we have no Communication with Women, but
but come pure and chaste to the Marriage of pure Virgins; not
meerly to please our Lusts, but for the Increase of our Offspring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the Ages before the Law, I shall only mention
the Action of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> who when <hi>Shechem</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
<hi>Dinah</hi> their Sister: slew not only him, but all his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and plunder'd their City, and vindicated this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Vengeance, by the Notorious Heinousness of the
Crime committed; <hi>shou'd he deal with our Sister as with an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot?</hi>
Gen xxxiv. 31.</p>
            <p>So unfit then are the Licentious Practices of former Times
to be drawn into a President, or to be alleged for the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or Extenuation of this Vice: that upon a little Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
we may easily discover what a Lively Sense all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98885:16"/>
both Jews and Gentiles, both before and after the Law,
have had, of its being an Hateful, Infamous, and Detestable
Practice.</p>
            <p>I have one Step farther yet to go, for</p>
            <p>3. Lastly. It must be consider'd too, that whatever Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
or Connivance God was pleased to grant in former
Times to this his first Law, and Original Institution: he has
now Revoked and Repealed all such by the Gospel, and
bound us up to his Primitive Ordinance. Divorce it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
he did permit; not by Choice, but for the <hi>Hardness of
their Hearts</hi> to whom that Law was given. Polygamy he
did at most but Connive at, not directly Tolerate or Allow.
And <hi>from the beginning it was not so:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt.</note> there is the manifest Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his great Dislike of it. And now he says, <hi>whom
God hath Joined together let no Man put Asunder:</hi> There's the
Revocation of all former Indulgence and Connivance; and a
Reestablishment of the first Law in its ancient and primitive
force. Thus God at first decreed that Man shou'd live. And
however those in an Obscurer Light have gone astray; we
Christians are now once more brought back to God's first
Rule, and must walk by it without any such wilful Deviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
or we have no just Hope of the Mercy of God, and the
Salvation of our Souls by Jesus Christ. And whatever we
may observe either Practised or Countenanced, either before
or under, or after the Jewish Law: we must say of it as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> did of the Idolatry of the Gentiles, <hi>Act.</hi> xvii. 30. <hi>The
Times of that Ignorance God winked at, but now hath commanded
all Men every where to repent: in that he hath appointed a Day in
which he will judg the World by Jesus Christ, who has brought us
out of that Darkness into his Marvellous Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore Preposterous, and vain for us to shelter our
selves under the Examples and Customs of any Ages, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that have been before us. We are under a Better, and
Nobler Dispensation of Grace, and therefore we are tied up
to Stricter Rules, and Nobler Degrees of Virtue. Our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98885:17"/>
teaches a more Compleat and Perfect Scheme of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Righteousness; and therefore it admits none of these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions,
Defects, and Imperfections, which are found in
other Laws. Ours gives us a better Hope, and promises us
a more exceeding great and glorious Reward, than any
other Religion ever did: And therefore it gives no Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any wilful Offence, but requires us to perfect Holiness,
and conform to the whole Will of God in every thing that is
Commendable and Good.</p>
            <p>Did not God, when he vouchsaf'd to <hi>Abraham</hi> those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Manifestations of his Will, by the Ministry of
Angels; instruct him in the full Sense of this Law also? It
was because he reserved this, with the other more perfect
Manifestation of our Duty, till the Revelation of his whole
Will by <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> thro' whom also he intended a fuller
Discovery of that future Recompence, which might Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Invite us to aspire towards that exalted Degree of
Purity and Goodness. And hence also it was, that in the
Law of <hi>Moses</hi> there were found so many Tolerations of
things not at all Pleasing to, or Approved by Almighty God.
It was Agreeable to the Hardness of their Stubborn Hearts,
and the present Felicity of this Transient Life, which their
Law promised, and at which they chiefly aimed: but not
to those Diviner Spirits that <hi>live by Faith,</hi> and in a Prospect
of Eternal Bliss, <hi>have their Conversation now in Heaven.</hi> Did
that God then indulge them, who has now restrained us?
Their Indulgence was <hi>after the Law of a Carnal Commandment:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. vii. 16.</note>
And our Restraint is <hi>after the Power of an Endless Life.</hi> Let
not then the corrupt Practices, and loose Conversation of
former Times, become a Snare and a Temptation to you;
and allure you to the Imitation of bad Examples, and an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that will not justifie you. I shall conclude this Head
with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>This I say
then and testifie in the Lord, that ye walk not henceforth as other
Gentiles walk in the Vanity of their Mind, having their Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98885:17"/>
darkned, being Alienated from the Life of God thro' the
Ignorance that is in them, because of the Blindness of their Heart.
Who being past Feeling have given themselves over unto Lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
to work all Vncleanness with Greediness. But ye have not
so learned Christ, if so be that ye have heard him, and have been
taught by him, as the Truth is in Jesus.</hi> That Holy Profession
requires from you a quite different Conversation. And this
brings me to what I proposed</p>
            <p>II. Secondly; Which was to prove the Greatness of this
Sin from Christian Principles, by shewing how contrary this
Practice is to the Precepts and Commands of God in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> and how absolutely inconsistent with
all sound Hope of Mercy and Salvation thro' him. And here
I shou'd have a very easie Task, if Men had but a due Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Esteem for that Faith into which they have been
baptized. But the Misery is, that there is so much Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Lukewarmness, and Indifference in Religion; that
neither the Laws, nor the Threatnings, nor the Promises of
the Gospel, make a due Impression on Mens Minds. So that
they can hear the Vengeance of God denounced against their
Sins, and yet not tremble; and Death, and Hell, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Burnings threatned, and yet not be afraid. They read
God's Solemn Declarations of punishing all impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<hi>with Everlasting Destruction from the Presence of the
Lord;</hi> and yet, by I know not what Mysterious Arts, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themselves, that they shall escape, and find Uncovenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Unpromised Grace and Mercy at the last. And what
shall we do when <hi>the Terrors of the Lord,</hi> with which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
used to <hi>perswade Men,</hi> have lost their Force; and the severest
Threatnings of Divine Vengeance come to be despised?
Among Primitive Christians, Faith was strong, their Love
sincere and cordial, and their Zeal affectionate and warm.
Then Men did so believe the Gospel, as to receive it as the
Guide of their Consciences, and the Rule of their Lives, and


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98885:18"/>
the only Foundation of their Hope, and Expectations of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Then they so desir'd that Celestial Recompence
which God has promised, as to be willing to come up to the
most exalted Degrees of Goodness, that they might attain
to it; and so dreaded, and trembled at the least Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Displeasure, as with a Scrupulous and Conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Care to avoid and abhor every thing that is by him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
and discountenanced.</p>
            <p>Were such an Heart and such a Spirit in us, it wou'd be
easy from a very Texts of the New Testament to baffle
all the vain Apologies and Excuses for this Hateful Sin. For,</p>
            <p>1. It is expresly forbidden, and the <hi>Apostles</hi> do in a very
earnest and affectionate manner dehort and dissuade all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
from it. <hi>Christ</hi> in his Discourses with the <hi>Jews,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
what was God's Original Purpose and Intention at the
first Creation; and the <hi>Apostles</hi> in the very first of all their
Constitutions and Decrees, when assembled together in
Council at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> peremptorily prohibit this Vice, <hi>Act.</hi>
xv. 28, 29. <hi>It seemed Good to the Holy Ghost, and to us to
lay upon you no greater Burden than these necessary things; That
ye abstain from Meats offer'd unto Idols, and from Blood, and
from things strangled, and from Fornication.</hi> Where by the
way we have a clear Argument to prove that Fornication
was esteem'd contrary to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law.</p>
            <p>For the Question in debate was, how far the <hi>Gentile</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
shou'd comply with the Customs and Manners of the
<hi>Jews.</hi> And this is the Result of the Debate, that they shou'd
<hi>abstain from the Pollutions of Idols, and from Fornication, and
from things strangled, and from Blood.</hi> Which is as much as
tho' it had been said,<note place="margin">v. 20.</note> we require from you no greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
to the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> than in these particular things.</p>
            <p>But some Scruples may possibly arise concerning the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency
of this Sanction to our present Purpose; in that it's
here joined with some things that were not in themselves
evil and sinful; but only prohibited to prevent Offence and


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98885:18"/>
Scandal to the <hi>Jews.</hi> Such is their Abstinence from <hi>things
strangled and from Blood;</hi> the eating of which, is not in it self
a Sin, tho' it were forbidden by the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law.</p>
            <p>To remove this seeming Difficulty, it will be necessary to
look a little closer into the true purpose and Design of this
Apostolical Decree. To the right understanding of which,
we must observe, that when the <hi>Apostles</hi> thought fit not to
impose the Jewish Ordinances upon the <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts;
they had yet some evil and corrupt Opinions to provide
against. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> had been taught that tho' they were
Vile and Flagitious Persons that did prostitute themselves to
others; yet that 'twas not a Sin to use such. And as <hi>Grotius</hi>
observes, tho' the Apostles found it easy to convince the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
in Matters of Divine Worship, and Common Honesty:
yet the Prejudices of their former corrupt Conversation stuck
so fast upon them, that they were not easily brought up to
this Noble Degree of Christian Purity. To oppose which
Prejudice they expresly prohibit Fornication by this unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Command.</p>
            <p>Another Opinion of theirs was, that seeing all Creatures
of God are in themselves good, and were created for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Men, therefore they though it was lawful for
them to eat all Meat whatsoever, and wheresoever they
found it. And in their full Persuasion of the Innocence of
this Liberty; they made no Scruple to be present at the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Idolatrous Feasts; and under that Pretence communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with them in Idolatry. This therefore the <hi>Apostles</hi>
absolutely forbid.</p>
            <p>And though this which they alledged might possibly be a
good Argument for their not abstaining from <hi>things strangled,
and from blood;</hi> yet the <hi>Jews</hi> having a certain Tradition,
that these things were forbidden before the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
and had been held unlawful ever since the days of <hi>Noah;</hi>
they could not be satisfied that they were innocent. And
therefore in compliance to their Perswasion and Opinion, the


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98885:19"/>
               <hi>Apostles</hi> restrain the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the use of that liberty, in those
two cases; to give no Offence unto the <hi>Jews.</hi> So that they
had a two-sold end in this their Sanction. And though some
of these things were forbidden, upon Prudential Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to prevent Offences; Fornication was one of the
Real Evils and prohibited for its great and certain Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to evidence the Truth of this, do but consider, after
what an earnest and affectionate manner, St.</hi> Paul <hi>disswades
from this notorious Vice,</hi> 1 Cor. <hi>vi. 9, 10. he addresses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with a great deal of Zeal, as to Men that were yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to believe that there was any great evil, or danger
in this Practice; and he warns them to have a care of this
Delusion.</hi> Be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters,
nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor Abusers of themselves with
Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers,
nor Extortioners, shall inherit the Kingdom of God. <hi>And
again, 13, 14, &amp;c.</hi> Now the body is not for Fornication, but
for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. Know you not that your
bodies are the Members of Christ? Shall I then take the Members
of Christ, and make them the Members of an Harlot? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.
What, know you not, that he that is join'd to an Harlot, is
one body? For two, saith he, is one flesh; but he that is joined
unto the Lord is one Spirit. Therefore flee Fornication, every
other Sin that a Man doth is without the body; but he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
Fornication, sinneth against his own body. <hi>Again, Gal.
v.</hi> 19, 20, 21. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are
these, Adultery, Fornication, Vncleanness, Lasciviousness, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
Witchcraft, and such like, of which I tell you before as I
have told you also in time past; that they which do such things
shall not inherit the Kingdom of God. <hi>And Eph. v.</hi> 3, 5, 6, 7.
But Fornication, and all Vncleanness, or Covetousness, let it not
be once named among you, as becometh Saints. For this you know,
that no Whoremonger, nor unclean Person, nor covetous Man,
who is an Idolater, hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98885:19"/>
and of God. <hi>And then he alludes to the delusive Notions,
whereby they did excuse and extenuate this Vice.</hi> Let no
Man deceive you with vain Words, for because of these things
cometh the Wrath of God upon the Children of Disobedience. Be
ye not therefore Partakers with them. <hi>And</hi> Col. <hi>iii.</hi> 5, 6. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
therefore your Members which are on the Earth, Fornication,
Vncleanness, Inordinate Affection, Evil Concupiscence and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness
which is Idolatry. For which things sake the Wrath of
God cometh upon the Children of Disobedience. <hi>Where the</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>declares, that whatever Pleas Men may allege, these are
all hateful Sins, and such which provoked the Indignation of
God even against the Heathens themselves; and therefore
Christians are under greater Obligations to abstain from
them.</hi> 1 Thes. <hi>iv.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 7. This is the Will of God, even your
Sanctification that you shou'd obstain from Fornication, That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of you shou'd know how to possess his Vessel in Sanctification
and Honour; not in the Lusts of Concupiscence, as the Gentiles
which know not God; for God hath not call'd us to Vncleanness,
but to Holiness, <hi>and</hi> Heb. <hi>xiii.</hi> 4. Marriage is honourable, and
and the Bed undefiled, but Whoremongers, and Adulterers God will
Iudge. <hi>'Tis the Charge against the Church of</hi> Pergamos,
<hi>that it was Corrupt, and had them there</hi> that hold the Doctrin
of <hi>Baalam,</hi> who taught <hi>Balac</hi> to cast a Stumbling Block before the
Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> to eat things sacrificed unto Idols, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Fornication, <hi>Rev. 2. 14. And against the Church of</hi> Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria;
<hi>that it</hi> suffer'd the Woman <hi>Jezabel,</hi> which calleth her self
a Prophetess, to teach and seduce my Servants to commit Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And I gave her Space to repent of her Fornication, and she
repented not: <hi>upon which follow several severe Threatnings
of God's heavy Judgments; in case they were not seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
prevented. And</hi> Rev. <hi>xxi.</hi> 8. The Fearful, and Vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
and Abominable, and Murderers, and Whoremongers,
and Sorcerers, and Idolaters shall have their Part in the Lake
which burneth with Fire and Brimstone, which is the Second Death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:98885:20"/>
Now after such numerous Declarations, and so great a
<hi>Cloud of Witnesses;</hi> with what Countenance, and on what
Grounds can Men conceit their roving Pleasures innocent,
or free from the extremest Danger of everlasting Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
These Texts are so positive, so plain, so intelligible,
and so express; that I cannot but wonder how those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any Reverence for the Gospel of <hi>Christ,</hi> can pretend to
any Hope of Salvation by it, while they continue in this Sin.</p>
            <p>II. The Reasons which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here alleges do farther
shew that this Practice must be both Offensive and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
            <p>1. He answers the most plausible Suggestion that was
pleaded by the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for the Vindication of it. They
pleaded that their Bodies were their own; and that every
Man was so far Lord of himself, that it was in his Power and
Right to use it as he pleas'd. To which St. <hi>Paul</hi> replies
No; their Bodies were not so absolutely their own, nor had
they any such incontrolable Authority, or Dominion over
them. God that made them, and with Divine Wisdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
their Frame, had a better, and more Natural Right
than they; And by Virtue of that, might lay upon them
what Restraints he shou'd think convenient. Their Bodies
too when by Sin become Mortal, and subject to Corruption,
are Redeemed by the Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> and entitled to Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
again. And <hi>Christ</hi> by Virtue of the Price which he
paid for them on the Cross, has a Title in, and a just Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over them. So that the Foundation of this Pretence is
delusive and vain. As Creatures of God we must be subject
to his Dominion, and as the Redeemed of <hi>Christ</hi> we must
receive from him what Laws, Injunctions and Commands he
pleases. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 19, 20. <hi>Ye are not your own, for ye are bought
with a Price; therefore glorifie God both in your Body and in your
Spirit, which are God's Right and Property.</hi> And this is the
very same thing that he urged, <hi>v. 13, 14. Now the Body is
not for Fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the Body.</hi>


               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:98885:20"/>
i. e. <hi>Christ</hi> was raised from the Dead, that he might raise us
also to Immortality: and therefore we are bound <hi>not to live
unto our selves,</hi> by giving up our Bodies to Pleasure in the
Lusts of the Flesh; but to devote our selves to the Service
of that Great God who made us, and to the Obedience of
<hi>Christ,</hi> who died to expiate our Guilt.</p>
            <p>2. He argues in the next place, from the great Uncomeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Indecency of this Practice, in Consideration of our
close and near Relation to Christ, <hi>v. 15, 16. Know you not
that your Bodies are Members of Christ, shall I then take the Members
of Christ and make them the Members of an Harlot? God forbid,</hi> &amp;c.
In which Words he declares what our Liturgy has truly and
properly express'd; that we <hi>Christians are one with Christ, and
Christ with us.</hi> And that Union is not only in the way of
<hi>Polity Ecclesiastical,</hi> as we are Members of his Church, and
intitled to the Spiritual Privileges and Offices thereof: but in
a much Nobler and Diviner Sense, He has taken upon him
our Flesh, and he has communicated to us his Spirit; and
this Spirit is the Bond and <hi>Medium</hi> of that Unity betwixt us.
<hi>For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body,</hi> 1 Cor. xii. 13.
And as the Soul of Man is the Foundation of Life, and of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Union in all the Members of the Body; so is the Spirit
of God the Foundation and common Principle of Spiritual
Life and Grace in all true Christians whatsoever. And as
certainly as <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> has taken on him our true and real
Flesh; so certainly has the same <hi>Christ</hi> communicated to us
of that Holy Spirit which abides in him. For which reason
our Apostle says, <hi>v. 17. He that is join'd to the Lord is one
Spirit with him,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 9. <hi>If any Man hath not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, he is none of his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now having instructed the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in this Doctrin, he
recommends it to their own Serious Consideration, how
Unseemly, and Shameful, and Unworthy it is, for Men in
so near a Relation to God, and so close an Alliance to the
Son of God, to have Fellowship and Union with the most


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98885:21"/>
Infamously Vile and Detestable of all Human Creatures.
<hi>Shall I take the Members of Christ, and make them the Members
of an Harlot? God forbid.</hi> This is an Evil that ought not to
be done. This is scandalous and abominable. He appeals to
the common Sentiments of Mankind. It must be preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and absurd to pretend Union with <hi>Christ,</hi> and to
profess that Union, the Foundation of our Hope of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Salvation by him: and at the same time to conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
with the most hateful of all Creatures, by a Vice for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
under the Penalty of everlasting Condemnation.
The very Nature of God, who is <hi>Holiness,</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> and
<hi>in whom there is mo Darkness at all,</hi> is a sufficient Proof how
disagreeable all such sinful Practices are, how offensive,
how hateful, and how dangerous.</p>
            <p>3. He argues from the great Dishonour which a Man
does hereby to his own Body. He debases and reproaches
himself. He becomes <hi>one Flesh</hi> with such a Person, as he is
ashamed to own his Relation to; and for which all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
besides will despise him, tho' he does not scorn, and
loath himself. He becomes in every sence polluted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.<note place="margin">Ver. 18.</note>
               <hi>Every other Sin that a Man doth is without the Body,
but he that committeth Fornication sinneth against his own Body.</hi>
The Prophane is injurious to God, and the Fraudulent to his
Brother, and the Mischief of all other Sins falls first at a
distance from ones self. But the Mischief of Fornication
falls more immediately on the Offenders own Head; his own
Body is debased in the very Trespass he has committed.</p>
            <p>Nay the Apostle has improv'd this Consideration from
the former; and tells us, that by the Residence of that <hi>Holy
Spirit</hi> within us; our Bodies are so honour'd by Almighty
God, as to be esteem'd and valued as his <hi>Temples,</hi> Places
of his Residence, dedicated to his Use, and devoted to his
Service, <hi>v. 19. Know you not that your Bodies are the Temple
of the Holy Ghost which is in you, and which you have of God.</hi>


               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:98885:21"/>
And again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 16. <hi>Know you not that ye are the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you.</hi> From
whence he takes occasion to warn them of the Danger of
dishonouring of themselves by Fornication; because, <hi>v. 17.
If any Man desile the Temple of God, him will God destroy: For
the Temple of God is holy, which Temple are ye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the Arguments which <hi>St. Paul</hi> makes Use of to
convince and to dissuade all Christians from this Vice.
These indeed are Christian Arguments, founded upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Doctrines, and Spiritual Reflections, but of very great
Force, and not at all to be despis'd.</p>
            <p>For this Union with Christ, by the means of his Spirit,
is one of the great Priviledges of a Christian; one of the
great Benefits of our Redemption; and our only Hope of
Mercy and Peace, and Comfort, and Reconciliation thro'
his Blood. Does then Fornication break off this close Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with Christ, destroy this Union? that is to the Soul
in a Spiritual Sense, like loping off an Arm or a Leg from
the natural Body. 'Tis alienating the Man from Christ,
and cutting off all his Hope of Reconciliation in him. 'Tis
in effect rejecting him from the Covenant of Grace; and
<hi>blotting out his Name from the Book of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, does St. <hi>Paul</hi> say, that by <hi>Fornication a Man disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth
his own Body,</hi> and <hi>desileth</hi> those <hi>Temples</hi> which God
has consecrated to himself, to be the Habitations of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit. God, who has punish'd the Pollutions of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> with the Death of the profane Offender,
will certainly punish the defiling these living Temples with
Eternal Death, and the most dire Effects of his severest Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
and Indignation. Besides, in desiling the Habitation
of God's Holy Spirit, we must <hi>grieve that Spirit,</hi> and resist,
and repel it, and drive it away from the intended place of
its Residence and Abode. And how can a Practice be either
innocent or safe: that so provokes our God, that we become
abandon'd of the true Principle and Foundation of all Grace,


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98885:22"/>
Spiritual Life, and Sanctification? Especially, when <hi>St.
Paul</hi> has so solemnly declar'd, <hi>That if any Man have not the
Spirit of God he is none of his.</hi> But to add yet more force to
these Considerations, consider,</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Lastly,</hi> That this Sin in particular is absolutely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with those Qualifications which the Gospel requires
from us, as the indispensable Condition of Salvation. To
this purpose we all know very well, that when <hi>Christ</hi> came
into the World to redeem Mankind from Eternal Death,
he at the same time intended to destroy the Power of Sin in
us, and call us back from the Perpetration of those Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which had been the Original Occasion of our Misery.
For this reason, together with his Promises of Grace, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Peace; he has added several Holy Precepts and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and strict Injunctions, and Rules of living well;
which every one who comes into this Covenant, and desires
to be a Partaker of this Hope, is bound to observe. And
that we might have a due and deep Sense of the Necessity of
this Obedience: he has inserted it into our Covenant, and
made it the Indispensable Condition of his Promises, without
which we have no Hope, no Title to any of the Blessings,
Benefits, or Comforts of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Now among the several Qualifications which the Gospel
on this Account requires from us; there are those two emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
recommended, and strictly exacted, that we should
be <hi>Pure,</hi> and that we should be <hi>Holy.</hi> So that a sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
needs no better Argument, no stronger Proof of the
Greatness of this Sin, and the danger that attends it; than
to consider with himself how contrary it is to, and how ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
inconsistent with both these Qualifications.</p>
            <p>1. We are commanded to be <hi>Pure,</hi> Mat. v. 8. <hi>Blessed are
the Pure in Heart, for they shall see God.</hi> And it was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Advice to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. v. 22. <hi>Keep thy self pure.</hi> And
<hi>Phil.</hi> iv. 8. there are recommended to us, <hi>whatever things are
pure:</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> declares both the Nature, and the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98885:22"/>
of this Purity. <hi>He that hath this Hope in him, must purifie
himself as God is pure,</hi> 1 Joh. iii. 3. Now this word Pure, in
its natural and proper Signification, denotes the being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Mixture, that may make a thing worse than it is in
it self. The Vessel is said to be pure that is without Soil or
Taint, and the Wine is said to be pure that is neither mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by its own Lees, nor by any Adulteration. From hence
it is used in a Moral and Religious Sense, for being without
those Pollutions and Desilements which make us hateful,
and unacceptable to our God. And tho' under the Law,
and among the Superstitious Heathens, there were many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Defilements; yet in the true, proper, Gospel Sense,
nothing pollutes, nothing makes us unclean, and unacceptable
to God, but what is a Sin, contrary to his pure Nature,
and makes us unfit for his Divine Conversation in Heaven.</p>
            <p>All Sin whatever does thus corrupt, and defile, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
us; yet it it remarkable, that this sensual Vice is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
singled out, as one of those that has an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Malignity in this Respect. And the repeated Mention
of Uncleanness, that so frequently occurs in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is directly levell'd at Adultery, Fornication, and all
unlawful Lusts. Thus <hi>St. Paul</hi> speaking particularly of the
abominable Lewdness of the <hi>Romans,</hi> says of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> i.
24. that <hi>God gave them up to Vncleanness through the Lusts of
their Hearts.</hi> And 2 Cor. xii. 21. he speaks of those who had
<hi>not repented of their Uncleanness, Fornication and Lascivious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which they had committed.</hi> For this reason they are
joyn'd together, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 19. The Works of the Flesh are
these, <hi>Adultery, Fornication, Vncleanness, Lasciviousness.</hi>
And <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 5. <hi>Fornication, Vncleanness, Inordinate Affection,
and evil Concupiscence.</hi> These are the Defilements, and Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
which destroy that Purity, that <hi>Christ</hi> has made the
Indispensable Condition of our <hi>seeing God.</hi> And in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the New-Testament to be Pure is to be Chaste; and
Chastity is the Virtue very often particularly intended
when the Gospel speaks of Purity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:98885:23"/>
2. We are commanded also to be Holy; and Holiness is
expresly declared to be that qualification <hi>without which no Man
shall see the Lord, Heb.</hi> xii. 14. Now in whatever it is that
this Holiness consists; it is observable, that to avoid, and
abstain from Fornication makes up one necessary part of it.
This is undeniably evident from St. <hi>Paul, 1 Thes.</hi> iv. 3, <hi>&amp;c.
This is the Will of God,</hi> or that which he requires from you as
the great evidence of <hi>your Sanctification; That you should ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from Fornication, that every one of you shou'd know how to
possess his vessel,</hi> or body, <hi>in Sanctification and Honour.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the true notion of Holiness, shall be found to consist in
a Discrimination and Separation from the rest of the World
by a nearer relation to God, and a more particular Devotion
to his Worship and Service; it will follow, that Gods
certain Purpose and Design, when he made our Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to oblige us to abstinence from that Vice, was thereby to
declare, that we shou'd Discriminate and Distinguish our
selves from the rest of Mankind throughout all the Earth
by stricter Rules of Chastity, and a more eminent degree of
Purity in all our Conversation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And all Pretensions to the
True, Christian, Evangelical Holiness, are vain and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and trifling in any Man, who lives still in <hi>Fornication.</hi>
That Uncleanness is for the Gentile World, who live in
Darkness, and are given up to the Lusts of their own Hearts.
<hi>But we have not so learned Christ; We are a chosen Generation, a
Royal Priesthood, an Holy Nation, a Peculiar People,</hi> beloved
and favoured,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> and elected of God; <hi>that we should show forth
the Praises of him, who hath call'd us cut of Darkness into his
marvellous Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore no excuse for us to look back upon the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Conversation of former times, and the effects of more
inferior and imperfect Dispensations. For the matter is come
to this last issue, whether <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> into whose Name we
have been baptiz'd, be indeed our Saviour, in whom is all
our hope of Mercy and Everlasting Peace; or whether we


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98885:23"/>
look for Salvation in any other? If not, it concerns us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his Gospel as the rule both of Faith and Manners; to
suffer its Doctrines to determine our Consciences and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and its Precepts and Commands to guide and direct
our Lives. Whatever other Men do, we must <hi>cleanse our
selves from all Impurity both of Flesh and Spirit;</hi> we must <hi>abstain
from fleshly Lusts, and flee Fornication;</hi> or we shall not <hi>inherit
the Kingdom of God.</hi> While any Man continues in this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Practice, he is void of Grace, and of the Holy Spirit of
God, and of that Evangelical <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Holiness without
which no Man shall see the Lord.</hi> I proceed therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>III. <hi>Lastly,</hi> To speak a little of the natural Turpitude of this
Sin, and the mischievous Evils and Consequences that attend
it. And were Men but sincere and impartial in their Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
into Truth, it were easie to shew that this Law of God
in the Institution of Marriage in all the parts of it is founded
on sound and good Principles of Reason.</p>
            <p>Divorce countenances the imperious humours of ill natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Men, and gives encouragement to them to make quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
and dissentions with the first Wife, whenever new Charms
shall inflame them to desire a Second. Polygamy divides that
Love which ought to be entire, and must and will inevitably
be attended with that unequal Partiality towards one, which
will bring the others into contempt and hatred. And the
Jealousie of Rivals upon such occasions, must needs bring Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
and Distractions to a Family.</p>
            <p>But our present business is only with Fornication. And to
shew that all the Laws and Precepts of the Gospel, have
their Foundation in the real difference between good and
evil, and are in themselves Beneficial and Profitable to Men;
let it be consider'd whether the Dignity, and Honour of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, is not concern'd in our abstinence from this
wicked and enormous Vice. Wherein is it that Man excells
Brutes, and becomes in any respect a nobler and better, not


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98885:24"/>
to say, also a Diviner Creature? Is it not in the more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
faculties of the Soul? In an over-ruling Will, and a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious
Understanding; in the power of Thought and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to which all inferior Passions and Affections were at first
created in a due and orderly Subjection. And does not to
this day the true difference of our Natures consist in this;
that Reason is the ruling Principle in us, and Appetite in
them? By which we become capable of better and nobler
Actions; of Communion with God in Heaven, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
more Divine?</p>
            <p>How then shall we vindicate the Dignity of our Diviner
Nature, but by keeping up the Dominion and Superiority of
our Reason over the vile Affections and Inclinations of the
Body? Or in what can we more Dishonour or Debase our
selves, than in subjecting the noble Faculties of the Soul, to
the Tyrannic, Usurped power of our depraved Appetites
and Lusts? And does not every wicked Man in Fornication
and sensual Uncleanness do this? Does Reason prevail? Does
Conscience, or does Lust bear sway in him, who gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
up to the conduct of his loose and sensual Desires? To
follow the impulse of vile Affections, and Inclinations; and
without restraint Debauch and Prostitute himself at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation
of his carnal Appetites? What is this but to Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
his Nature, level himself with Beasts, degenerate into
a Brute that has no Understanding; and reproach both the
Wisdom and Goodness of God who made him of a nobler
shape and frame? So that if Men wou'd think seriously, and
without partiality; it were easie from the Principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Natural Religion, as well as of Reveal'd, to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that this is a shameful and detestable Vice.</p>
            <p>But it will appear yet more odious, if we give our selves
the trouble of but a few short Reflections, on the mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and pernicious Consequences that attend it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First</hi> then consider the unhappy calamitous fate of that
spurious brood that happens to be born by this Vice, Shame,


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98885:24"/>
Infamy, and great Disgrace; tho the least of all these Evils,
are such as the wiser Heathens had very deep and lively Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of. To this purpose <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Treatise of
the Good Education of Children, has these Words.
<hi>That they who desire to have Children well esteemed and of
Good Repute ought by no means to cohabit with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Women that Prostitute themselves.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>For they who
either by Father or Mother are infamously born, will
have that indelible Infamy attend them all their Life
long, and be a ready occasion always at hand to every one
that has a Mind to affront and reproach them.</hi> But indeed this
Evil does not affect only the Character and Credit of the
Children so born: but sometimes it becomes a means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
their Bodies, and shortning their Lives; while they
labour under Calamitous Infirmities, and bring Rottenness,
and Abominable Putrefaction into the World with them.
Nay sometimes the Son of Fornication falls an early Sacrifice
to conceal his Mothers Shame: and as one great Evil too
commonly is followed by another, this enormous Vice often
becomes the Introduction to Unnatural Murder. And he
who begets such an Illegitimate Child, is inevitably injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and unjust to his own Offspring; in that by the Baseness
of his Birth, he is cut off from all Title or Claim to the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of his Father's Fortune and Honour: which by the
Original Laws of God and Nature, the Offspring of Man
shou'd have a Right and Title to.</p>
            <p>And indeed what farther Evidence can we have of the
Hateful and Detestable Apprehensions which all Mankind in
all Ages ever had of this Enormous Practice, than this? That
the Children of Fornication have in all civiliz'd Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
been Neglected and Disregarded; nor allow'd any
Pretence of Title or Claim to the Inheritance of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
These very Laws and Constitutions of almost all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the World, are a most Certain and Irrefragable Proof
that this Vice always was detested and abhorr'd by them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:98885:25"/>
And yet there is a worse, and far greater Calamity that
commonly attends the unhappy Children of such Ungodly
Parents. And that is, that either the want of Natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
or Shame, and a Consciousness of Guilt in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
occasion a certain Neglect and Disregard of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
Virtuous and Religious Education. And every one
that seriously considers the mighty Influence which Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
has to make Men either Good or Bad, must confess that
the Mischief of this Neglect is very deplorable and much to
be lamented. This for ought we know might be one great
End and Purpose of God in the Original Law and Institution
of Marriage. By sanctifying which State, and ordaining
that Union to be inseparable and perpetual, he lays so firm
and Rational a Foundation for each Parents Affection to their
Children, as will always oblige them to be careful and solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
for their good. And that which seems much to favour
this Conjecture, is, That God most certainly did provide,
not only for the Propagation and Increase of Mankind: but
also that it might be in such a manner as might best secure
their being trained up in the Knowlege of him. And as
might most strongly oblige their Parents to instruct them in
that Virtue and Piety, which will at last bring them to the
Eternal Happiness and Glory for which they were Original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
designed.</p>
            <p>And yet however necessary this good Education is in the
Judgment both of God and Man: it is morally impossible
that the Children of Fornication shou'd be Religiously
brought up. Oftentimes either the Poverty, or the Shame
of the Parents, cause them to be exposed in the Streets, and
consequently to be put out by the Parish where they are
found. And in such a Case they are thought to fare well, if
the Nurse to whose Care they are committed, supplies them
with Food and Raiment; but few or none think themselves
concern'd in the Good of the Child's Soul, and to teach it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Principles than its Parents had. Nor is it easie to imagin


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98885:25"/>
that the Parents themselves shou'd do much better in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.
It may be they have not yet repented of their own
Iniquity: and if not, it is hard to believe that they shou'd
have any great Zeal to implant Grace in others, who stiffle
and extinguish it in themselves.</p>
            <p>But suppose they have; how will they set about a Work
that shall bring afresh into their Minds all the Shame, and
Terror, and Confusion that first followed the Commission of
that Sin? The Sense of their own Shame will stop their
Mouths, and the Rebukes of their Consciences Divert their
Purpose, and Prevent their Good Design. So that tho' other
Parents may be careless and negligent in the Instruction and
Tuition of their Children; these lie under almost a Fatal
and Inevitable Necessity of this Neglect. And who knows
what great, what irreparable, and it may be Everlasting
Mischiefs this one Calamitous Misfortune may be the Cause
of? Or how little is it to be wondred at, if such a Shameful
Spurious Brood inherit the Vices of their Parents, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Persons of Reprobate Minds, and given up to Vile Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and abominable Lusts? What is to be expected from
such wicked Practices, but a Propagation of Vice and
Naughtiness, and an horrid Increase in great Iniquities: that
without some extraordinary Operation of Divine Grace and
Mercy brings the whole Generation to Everlasting Misery
and Torments?</p>
            <p>These are Notorious Instances of the lamentable Evils, and
Mischievous Consequences of this Sin. But,</p>
            <p>2. The Mischiefs of it falls oftentimes upon the Offenders
themselves as well as upon their Offspring and Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
And that in the first Place in their Credit and
Character, and Reputation. As to Female Prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
they even by the Heathens themselves have ever
been esteemed the most Infamous and Profligate. And
tho' Men are generally of a less tender Fame and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
yet so inseparable and unalienable is Shame from Sin


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98885:26"/>
and Vice, that neither the Commonness of the Practice, nor
the Authority of great Examples, nor all the Pleas and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies
that are alleged for its Excuse, can give it Credit and
Reputation. And those who are almost ready to be Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
for it, yet in the Commission of it are generally sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
to be conceal'd, and that not only from the Sober and
Pious and Grave; but from others of the same ill Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.
And many of these who have made a shift to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
their Hearts, and sear their Consciences against the
Guilt of it, find it yet very difficult, after all, to harden
their Foreheads too against the Shame and Scandal. And tho'
in a very Wicked and Degenerate Age, yet there is no Man
of what Rank soever, that continues in this Sin and refuses
to be reclaimed; but it will prove a Blemish to him, and a
Scandal to any Dignity, Office, or Character that he bears.
And tho' in Civility and Good Manners he may not discover
this by any outward visible Disrespect: yet he must lose
considerably in the inward Veneration and Esteem of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor does it often fare better with these Sinners in their
Estates; of which besides the Evidence of Reason, we have
the Confirmation of almost every Days Experience. How
often do such Men Ruine and Waste their Substance,
and at last become Poor and Despicably Miserable?
Thus it fared with these Offenders above two thousand
Years ago: Nor has Time or Experience been able to teach
such Men to escape the Mischief, any other way but by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining
from the Sin.</hi> Keep thee from the Evil Woman, from
the Flattery of the Tongue of a strange Woman; Lust not after
her Beauty in thine Heart, Neither let her take thee with her
Eye lids: for by means of a Whorish Woman a Man is brought to
a Piece of Bread, <hi>Prov. vi.</hi> 24. &amp;c. <hi>And</hi> Prov. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10.
Remove thy way far from a strange Woman, and come not nigh
the Door of her House, lest thou give thine Honour unto others,
and thy Years unto the Cruel; Lest Strangers be filled with thy
Wealth, and thy Labour be in the House of a Stranger: and thou


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98885:26"/>
mourn at the last when thy Flesh and thy Body are consumed.
<hi>Agreable to which is that Advice to the Son of</hi> Syrach, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
ix.</hi> 16. Give not thy Soul unto Harlots that thou lose not
thine Inheritance.</p>
            <p>I may very pertinently add here to all the former Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
the Pernicious Effects of this Sin to the Bodies of
those that live in it, who frequently impair their Health, and
wast their Strength, and it may be dye Infamous Martyrs
to their Lusts by the Rottenness of their Bones, and the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous
Infection of a Noisom Scandalous Disease. But I am
unwilling to enlarge upon so Loathsome and Odious a Subject.
And yet methinks 'tis no small Evidence, no trifling Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God's great Displeasure against this Sin: that he has
entail'd a Curse, and a Calamitous Distemper, even to Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenness
and Putrefaction, so peculiarly upon Adultery and
Fornication; that it is not to be brought upon any of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
but one of these Detestable Iniquities must be the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Cause of it.</p>
            <p>But I pass by all these things with transient Reflections;
Not that they are in themselves either small or inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
for an Infamous and a Wicked Posterity, a Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Character, a Beggar'd Fortune, and an Infected Body,
are all of them very great and sore Calamities; But because
there are greater Evils and Consequences more pornicious,
and more justly to be lamented, yet behind. I mean,</p>
            <p>3. Lastly, The Spiritual Mischiefs, and Miserable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
to the Soul, in Grieving the Holy Spirit of God,
and repelling his Divine Grace, which is the true Fountain
of Christian and Spiritual Life in us, and the Blessed Author
of our Sanctification. This is an Evil which a very little
Consideration will convince us is inseparable from this Vice,
and from Adultery; And at the same time more deplorable
than all the Evils that can befal our Credit, Estate, or Life:
because these ill Effects will follow Men thro' the Grave, and
make them Miserable to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:98885:27"/>
For the clearing what I intend on this Head, let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd
that I have already shewn, that our Union with
God and Christ, is by the Mediation of that Holy Spirit,
which Resides and makes its Abode within us. That this
is the Principle of Grace and all manner of Goodness in us;
that to the joint Operation of this Holy Spirit with our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
we owe both our good Affections and Desires, and also
our Strength and Power to do what is Virtuous and Good.
That therefore, according to the Proportion of God's Spirit
in us, and our own Care to Cherish and Improve it, Such
will be the Temper and Disposition of our Souls, and the
Degrees of Goodness and Holiness in us. And that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
upon the Want and Deprivation of this Spiritual
Assistance, we must lose both our Inclinations and our Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of being Religious. We must become subject to our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
Appetites, and Sensual Delights; we are then <hi>Carnal
and sold under Sin,</hi> and led by the Instigation of our Lusts,
which first wound our Consciences, and afterwards destroy
them. We by these Degrees fall under the Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of Sin, and by means of our own vile Affections are
led captive by the Devil at his Will.</p>
            <p>This is what the Gospel in several Places teaches and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to us; and however it may seem Strange and Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the manner of it, to those who have a weak Faith,
and faint Perceptions of things that fall not within the
Ken of their Senses: it is a Divine and Certain Truth, and
visibly apparent in its Effects upon the Tempers and Actions
of Men.</p>
            <p>Let it then but once more be consider'd, that <hi>Fornication
Dishonoureth the Body,</hi> and <hi>Defileth those Holy Temples</hi> which
the Spirit of God has consecrated and set apart for his own
Habitation; That when we by defiling our Bodies Grieve
the Holy Spirit, he will abandon and forsake us; That for
our Resisting, and Abusing the Divine Grace of God it will
be taken from us: Let us but possess our selves with Just No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98885:27"/>
of these mischievous and pernicious Consequences;
and from hence it will be easie to find out what must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
be the Thoughts, and Dispositions, and Inclinations
of such Men towards God and Religion. The Prophet
<hi>Hosea</hi> iv. 11. has plainly taught us what Effects this Sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
will produce. <hi>Whoredom and Wine steal away the Heart,</hi>
and it must needs fare with these Men as it did with the
<hi>Romans</hi> for these Disorders, <hi>viz.</hi> that they must be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 24, 26, 28.</note> and <hi>given up to Vncleanness, and the Lusts of
their own Hearts; to vile Affections, and a reprobate Mind; to
do those things that are not convenient.</hi> These Men must be
entirely under the Conduct of their Corrupt Appetites,
and Carnal Inclinations. They must needs be enslaved
to their Lusts, and hardned in their Sins; and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great difficulty, to be reclaimed, because they have at
present lost not only their Spiritual Strength, but even the
principle of good Affections and Desires.</p>
            <p>Nay, It is morally impossible that these Men should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
themselves within the bounds of any one single Vice;
but Iniquity will encrease, and the Works of the Flesh, and
the Lusts of the Body will cloud their Understandings, byass
their Judgments, infect their Minds, and debauch their
Spirits. So that they can hardly refrain, but that from
the dire Effects of this deadly Sin; they must fall into Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,
Profaneness, Blasphemy, and an Universal Scorn, and
Contempt of God, and Religion.</p>
            <p>This our own Reason from the Doctrines of the Gospel
will teach us to conclude must needs happen; and every
Days Experience will confirm it. Atheism and Profaneness
are grown to a very great height among us, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
not only scandalous but formidable. We
are fallen into such an Age,<note place="margin">Ad haec tempota qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus nec vitia nostia, nec remedia pati possumus, perventum est. Liv.</note> as the Roman
Historian speaks of; in which <hi>our vices are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,
and yet become incurable:</hi> But consider
how long this has been. Since Adultery and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98885:28"/>
have been conniv'd at, and exempted from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Church, and the Punishment of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.
And who are the Men among whom this Tremendous
Mystery of Great Iniquity does chiefly work? It is among
the Sensual and Unclean, that live in Adultery and Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
These are the Men that dispute the Being of a God,
doubt his Providence over the World, and deny the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality
of the Soul. These are they who <hi>trample under
foot the Son of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. x. 29.</note> 
               <hi>and count the Blood of the Covenant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they were sanctified an unholy thing, and do despite to the Spirit
of Grace.</hi> These chiefly are they that disdain the Thoughts of
Divine Revelation, and set up the Profane Oracles of false
delusive Reason against the Infallible and Holy Oracles of
God. These are they that blaspheme the name of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Jesus, and profane the Sacred Scriptures; that speak of
a Saviour with Derision, and of Redemption with Scorn;
that despise Heaven, and harden themselves against the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of Hell. These are they in whom the <hi>God of this
World has blinded their Eyes,</hi> and cast a Vail before their
Understandings, whereby Sacred and Spiritual Things are
become to them imperceptible; <hi>they know them not, neither
indeed can they know them, for they are Spiritually discerned,</hi>
1 Cor. 2. 14. In a word, these are they that being swallow'd
up in the Desires of the Flesh, and Sensual Delights, have Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
all the Gracious Motions of the Spirit, have no Taste,
nor Relish of Divine and Holy Things; have therefore <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the Lord that bought them,</hi> turn'd Apostates from the
Faith; and labour to make the Doctrines of it ridiculous, and
its Promises and Threatnings contemptible.</p>
            <p>Nor is it strange that it should be so. Religion is against
them, and therefore in Policy, and their own Defence, they
must set themselves against Religion. Christianity threatens
<hi>Everlasting Burnings,</hi> and unquenchable Flames, as the future
Recompence of their present for did Pleasures. And they have


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98885:28"/>
no way to harden themselves against these Terrors, and enjoy
tolerable Peace within; but by a <hi>seared Conscience,</hi> and an <hi>evil
Heart of Vnbelief;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. iv. 2.</note> by rejecting the Authority of these Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
by calling these Flames Folly, and the Gospel that
preaches them a Delusion.<note place="margin">Heb. iii. 12.</note> It is now, since they will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd,
become the Interest of such Men, and their only Hope
of Comfort, to perswade themselves that all it says is false.
And tho the Truth of Religion is attested by very rational,
and strong, and serious Arguments; yet when Men have
once resolv'd that they will not <hi>obey</hi> it, it then becomes
their Wisdom too to resolve that they will not <hi>believe</hi> it.
And tho the Infidelity of such Men seems at first Sight much
to be wonder'd at: Yet not at all when we seriously reflect
upon their Actions. The greatest Wonder of all would be,
that Men could live such Lives, and yet believe such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
            <p>While therefore these Vices are tolerated, or conniv'd at,
that repel Grace, destroy the Conscience, and make Men
implacable Enemies to Religion, I doubt it will be in vain
to hope for a sufficient Restraint of Blasphemy, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness,
and wicked Opinions. Censures and Punishments.
may stop Men's Mouths, or make them more secret and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
in their Blasphemy: But the Gospel of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will hardly gain much better Veneration and Esteem in
the Minds of Men; till Adultery, Fornication, and all those
abominable Lusts are restrain'd, that debauch Men's Spirits,
and create this great Aversion, and Abhorence of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>The Flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit, against
the Flesh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal v. 17.</note> 
               <hi>and these are contrary one to another.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is to be feared that those Men who indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the Works of the Flesh, will be always inclin'd,
always endeavouring to ridicule, and to deride the Laws of
God, and the Revelations of his Holy Spirit. Erroneous
Opinions may do a great deal to encourage, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98885:29"/>
and embolden Men in Iniquity; but they have the
first Original and Source from vicious Practices; and are
commonly first Devis'd and Broach'd by wicked Men of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral
Lives to defend their Crimes, and quell and stifle
the sharp Convictions of a guilty Conscience. And these are
the Men to whom they prove extreamly pernicious and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous.
So that the most effectual Prevention and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Blasphemy, and Profanceness is to strike at the
Root of them, and prevent and suppress those Vices that
have occasion'd them.</p>
            <p>Had it been in the Power of strong Arguments, and
sound Reasons, and the Authority of Divine Revelation,
well attested, to do this: Neither the one or the other
could ever have come to that scandalous Height in a Church
and a Nation, where the Gospel has had the best, the most
sound, and judicious Defence of its Principles and Doctrine,
that the Christian World ever saw, since the Primitive Times
of immediate Inspiration. But how little force has the
brightest Object where the Humours of the Eyes are
mudded and clouded; when the Power of Reflection is
lost, and the <hi>Medium</hi> of Perception so obstructed, that it
cannot at all affect the Sense? How little signifie the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Arguments in Spirituals, when the Heart is sensual, and a
Vail cast before the Understanding? When the Mind is
corrupt, the Judgment prejudic'd, and byass'd, and brib'd,
to reject their Force, and oppose the Truth. And this is
the Influence which Adultery, Fornication, and all sensual
Uncleanness naturally have on the Mind.</p>
            <p>These in a word are usually the Consequences that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
this Unchristian Practice; and when both Character
and Fortune, Reputation and Estate, Body and Soul, and
that both of themselves and their Posterity are at stake, is
it not high time to complain? And may we not be allow'd
to expostulate with Men, why they will blind their Eyes,
and stop their Ears, and cherish such gross and palpable


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98885:29"/>
Delusions? A Vice that is a certain Violation of God's Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Institution and Law made at the first Creation of
the World; directly contrary to the repeated Commands
and Precepts of the Gospel; and which besides the other Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
corrupts the Soul, debauches Men's Spirits, destroys
their Consciences, and creates great Enmity and strong A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
to God, and to Religion. What can be sinful? what
can be offensive? or what can be dangerous to Men's Souls
if this be not? But how wretched a thing it is to be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Iniquity, and debauch'd to a deplorable degree of
Inconsideration and Insensibility! Wou'd Men calmly
and cooly reflect; The Shame and Infamy, the Beggary and
Putrefaction, that almost universally attend it, might prove
a sufficient and effectual Restraint. But if Temporal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
are not enough, yet those who have any Esteem
for the Christian Faith and the Doctrines of the Gospel,
are bound in Tenderness and Compassion to their Souls,
to have a care. Man may allege what they please, and
there was never yet any Vice, but the Parties concern'd in
it would plead <hi>Not guilty,</hi> and offer something for its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse.
But there is no withstanding these Reproofs, but by
direct Apostacy from the Faith; nor any way to evade the
Force of these Convictions, but by throwing aside the
whole Authority of Christianity at once.</p>
            <p>There is indeed a Christian Church that wou'd extenuate
the Guilt of this Sin, by the soft Name of <hi>Venial;</hi> and that
I think is the only Plea now left to be made in its Defence.
But alas! what Defence is to be made from the Authority
of a Church so notoriously Corrupt, both in Faith and
Manners; and so far degenerated from the Primitive Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christianity. Especially, what a Plea is this to
those who are not of that Communion? Their Opinions
are as good a Defence for praying to Images, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of Saints. And indeed, instead of countenancing this
Vice, should rather convince us, that according to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98885:30"/>
Blindness, which by the Judgment of God has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to them, Idolatry, and Sensuality must needs go
Hand in Hand, and as inseparable Companions mutually
support and assist each other. <hi>Be not deceiv'd then with vain
Words,</hi> nor imposed on by such Delusions and frivolous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses.
But fear and tremble at the heavy Judgments,
which God has threatned and denounc'd. Abstain from,
and avoid so great, so dangerous a Sin, and so pernicious in
its Consequences, with as earnest Care as you would Death

            <head>AN
APPENDIX
CONCERNING
Concubinage.</head>
            <p>THO the foregoing Discourse does I hope in some
measure prove that Fornication is both a great
and dangerous Sin; yet I have taken notice of
such a Modern Distinction between Whoredom
and Concubinage, as if not rightly understood and cleared,
may be thought to evade the Force of most if not all of my
Arguments. It may not therefore be improper to add some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
by way of Appendix upon that Subject.</p>
            <p>As for Concubinage in a Married State <hi>(i. e.)</hi> when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Man who keeps, or the Woman who is kept as a
Concubine are married, this comes so near the Concubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
of Antient Times, that what has been said already
may be sufficient to the Determination of that Question.
For if according to Christ's Interpretation of the Original
Institution of Marriage, Polygamy be Adultery, such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubinage
must be Adultery also, let the Pretence be what
it will. Nor can the Examples of <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Isaac,</hi> or any
other justify us in such things. For however God was pleased
to Connive at them, this Original Institution is a new reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Gospel, and our strict Observance of it necessary to
Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:98885:31"/>
But there is one Argument I have lately met with, that
indeed did at first surprise me, because it came, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
from a Graduate in Divinity,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jo. Butler.</hi> B. D.</note> and pretended the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of an Apostle, no less than <hi>St. Paul</hi> or <hi>St Barnabas,</hi>
to Vindicate the lawfulness of such a Practise. But a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Reflection serves to discover that a disorderly Man of
any Profession may easily pervert the meaning of Holy
Scripture to excuse or extenuate the Guilt of his own Ill-Manners.
And this I think is his Case. He would excuse
his Adultery under the soft Name of Concubinage, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to prove such Concubinage Innocent from, <hi>Heb.</hi>
xiii. 4. <hi>Marriage is honourable in all, and the Bed undefiled:
but Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge.</hi> From
which words the Argument is formed thus. <hi>The Word</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap> 
               <hi>is a Particle Copulative, and therefore the Words so
joined ought to be of a different and distinct Signification. This
Bed undefiled according to plain Gramatical Construction must be
aptly Significant of some certain Bed distinct from the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
Bed, and that</hi> he says <hi>must be Concubinage; or the Words
must start a Riddle hard to be Vnderstood.</hi> In this is the
force of his Argument if it has any; but indeed it has none.
'Tis mere fallacy and sham. I will not dispute with him
whether the Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> be <hi>Copulative</hi> or <hi>Exegetical.</hi> Let that
pass, The Determination of this Debate does not turn on so
nice a Point. I will suppose then <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
the <hi>Bed</hi> to have distinct Significations. But why must this
needs mean his Concubinage. What will he say if <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the Consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it? What Riddle is started by this Meaning? Or
what Hardship in it to be Understood?</p>
            <p>And this I think is very evidently the <hi>Apostles</hi> Sense;
and this Interpretation agreable to Scripture-Phrase. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> by one even our Father</hi>
Isaac. And that I may not stand alone in this, let Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
be consulted on that Place, and <hi>Grotius</hi> on this of <hi>Heb.</hi>
xiii. 4. who shews what his Opinion was by that notion of
the <hi>Essens,</hi> which he cites as agreable to the <hi>Apostles</hi>
meaning. <hi>They</hi> he says <hi>abstained from Marriage,</hi> attamen
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>yet they neither dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed
Marriage, nor the Procreation of Children.</hi> The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the Text then as I take it is this. <hi>Marriage is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
and the Consummation of it without Vncleanness.</hi> The
rest of all that fulsom Pamphlet may easily be answered
from the foregoing Discourse.</p>
            <p>The next thing therefore to be consider'd is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubinage
of unmarried Persons; that is, when a Man and a
Woman consociate on promise of Fidelity and Constancy to
each other: But do not solemnly Marry according to the
Laws of their Country. In which if it be pleaded that they
fulfil the design of God's Institution, altho they do not
make any solemn Matrimonial Contract as the Laws of the
Land require: I would offer these things to be seriously
consider'd.</p>
            <p>1. Whether in this pretended Fidelity and Constancy to
each other they be truly and conscienciously Sincere. <hi>(i. e.)</hi>
Whether they are so firmly resolved to be thus Constant
as to esteem their Seperation to be a Sin, and all
Consociation with any other to be Adultery. This we
have seen the Original Institution of Marriage most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
requires. And if Men would examine themselves
carefully in this Matter, I doubt it would come close to
all Persons that live in such a Practice. For I doubt, it is a
thirst for Liberty, and an unwillingness to be under so
strict a Confinement and Restraint that is the chief Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to such Practices. For if Men resolve, and think
themselves bound in Conscience to observe such inseperable
Union, and Cohabitation as God's Law requires: What
should hinder them from confirming this Obligation by Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98885:32"/>
Solemnities? If they do not think themselves thus
bound, it is certain they are guilty of Fornication. But</p>
            <p>2. There is a Conscientious Obedience due to all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Constitutions and Laws of the Country where we live.
This is one of the chief Acts of Subjection which we owe to
the Supreme Magistrates and Powers. And as God has
commanded us to be Obedient to them: So to despise their
Good Laws is to Sin against God.</p>
            <p>And this is the more Considerable, because in a great
many Cases the Good or Evil of Humane Actions is to be
determined wholly by Municipal Laws. As for Example;
the Laws of Religion oblige us to be Just to all Men, and
to do no wrong. But the Laws of our Country are in a
great many Cases the only Standard whereby to discover
what is Just and Right; and what is not. So also in the
Case before us. The Design of the Gospel as I take it, is
to condemn all Consociation of Man and Woman as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
but in the State of Marriage. But then it must be
the Laws of our Country that must determine what is
Marriage and what is not. Which consideration will yet
have more Force if we add</p>
            <p>3. That Marriage must suppose a Communion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and Fortunes. For it cannot be that Persons so u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
as to be accounted but <hi>One Flesh,</hi> should have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
Interests, and separate Estates. They are the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Relations to each other which the World affords.
Our Parents from whom we derive our Being, and whose
Flesh and Blood we are, must yet, according to God's
Command, yield to this closer Bond of Unity. Man and
Wife should be united in Heart, and Life, and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
This is agreable to the common Reason of Mankind;
and therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Law declared Marriage to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a <hi>perpetual Consortship of Life,</hi>

always required. And the Communication of their Rights
and Interests is by all Nations esteem'd so Natural and
Necessary that the Wife, whether she brought any Dowry
or no, has a Right to Maintenance out of the Husbands
Estate, tho' there preceded no Deed of Settlement. And
the Husband by Marriage becomes Proprietor of all
that Fortune and Estate that before could properly he
call'd her own. To which end our Liturgy has proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inserted into the Form of Marriage, <hi>with all my world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Goods I thee endow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this reason a Public Solemnizing of Marriage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws of the Land, becomes as Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to make their Cohabitation Lawful and Innocent:
as it is to the Legal Communication of the Interests and
Estates. Whatever is wanting to convey those Rights
and Priviledges which reason tells us Marriage in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Nature of it does and must confer, and which God
himself must therefore be supposed to intend: must needs
hinder such from being Innocent and Agreable to the
Laws of God; and must make that Consortship to have
the Guilt of Fornication. He and she then that are not
Married according to the Laws of the Church and State,
and so as thereby to convey to each other, and to their
Children an undoubted Title to their Estates: are not
Married as the Laws of God require, but undoubtedly live
in Fornication.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, a Man may by Deed of Gift, settle his Estate
on his <hi>Miss,</hi> and her Posterity, if he pleases. And so he
may upon any Body else. But it is still in his own Power


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98885:33"/>
whether he will or no. Or if he does, she is never the less
Infamous or Criminal for that. For we speak now of
such a Communication of Rights as has its Foundation
in the very Nature of Marriage; and as the Laws both of
God and Man have made inseparable from it, and not
left to a Man's Arbitrary Determination; nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can be a true, lawful, innocent Marriage or Consort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
according to God's Original Institution: but what
is so celebrated with Legal Ceremonies, and Solemnities, as
Publicly to declare them to be <hi>One</hi> both in Affection and
Interests, and mutual Partakers of each others Inheritance
and Fortune whether Good or Bad. All other Cohabitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is Sinful, and forbidden.</p>
            <p>4. Lastly, The solemnizing Marriage according to
Custom of our Country is necessary to prevent Infamy,
and remove scandal. By the Laws of Christianity we are
bound to do only such things as are <hi>commendable</hi> and <hi>of
good report;</hi> and to give no offence to the World, or to the
Church of God. And this cannot be in the Consortship
of Man and Woman without the Legal Solemnities of
Marriage. For as to the World things that do not appear are
as though they did not exist. And they that are not
Legally Married, or do not Cohabit publickly as Man and
Wife: are in the Judgment of Mankind as Unmarried.
God 'tis true knows the Hearts, and Consciences of Men;
but he does oblige us not only to do that which is in it self
Good, but to take care that what we do appears to be so,
that our Good Actions may shine to his Honour. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins
not only what is <hi>lawful,</hi> but also what is <hi>Convenient.</hi>
He commands not only what is Innocent, but what is also
commendable in the sight of all Men. And we must care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
avoid not only what is in its nature Evil, but also
what is without Offence or Scandal.</p>
            <p>And this I am perswaded is a Good Reason why Legal
Solemnization, and open Cohabitation should be essentially
necessary to constitute a Marriage in the sense of Gods Law,
as well as of the Laws of Men. For though it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98885:33"/>
that a Faithful, and Perpetual Consociation be the
first Condition in the Essence of Marriage, and that which
is above all things required to make it innocent: Yet, as we
have seen already that is not all. There must be moreover
a communication of Right; And as the Laws of God consult
not only the Natural Morality of our Actions, but also his
Honour in the Reputation of them; and the edification and
Good of our Brethren in avoiding Scandal and Offence: So
much must be necessary in the sense of Gods Law, to a Lawful
Marriage, as may keep it clear of infamy and reproach.
Seeing it was his particular Design in this Institution, to
<hi>sanctify</hi> this estate, and make it <hi>Honourable,</hi> and of <hi>good esteem:</hi>
all such Consortship must needs be Criminal, and Guilty
before him, which by its disagreableness to our common
Reason, and the common Approved Institutions both of
Church and State, becomes both Injurious and Scandalous.
It is therefore necessary, and essential to Marriage, even in
the sense of Gods Law that it should be Solemnly, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
celebrated. Hereby the Ends of it may best be attain'd.
Hereby Man and Wise become most strongly oblig'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
cohabitation; their Rights are best communicated,
and the Honour of that State most eminently consulted.
Hereby alone can it be easily distinguish'd who are Married,
and who live in Fornication.</p>
            <p>If no more were required to make a real Marriage than
the mutual Consent of perpetual Consortship: how shall the
World, and especially how shall the Government be satisfied
who are Married and who are not? How shall the Law
distinguish between those who have so consented, and who
have not? How shall it be known whose Children are Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate,
and whose are not so? Or how shall the greatest
confusion imaginable be prevented in matters of Right or
Wrong? Legitimate Children have a Legal Right to the
inheritance of their Parents: but the illegitimate have none.
And yet how shall this be determin'd: unless Marriage be
publickly and legally Solemniz'd. Again, here would be
the greatest encouragement to Fornication imaginable;


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98885:34"/>
in that Whoredom could not so easily be distinguish'd.
They who had not consented to this inseperable union
would appear in the same Reputation with those that had:
if the Legal Solemnization was once rejected as unnecessary
to Marriage. And can that be free from Sin, and without
God's great displeasure, which is productive of such mighty
mischiefs?</p>
            <p>To prevent all this confusion it has universally prevail'd in
all Nations:<note place="margin">Ignat. ad Polycar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum.</note> that Matrimony should be Publickly own'd.
In the Primitive times of Christianity it was solemniz'd
with the consent of the Bishop. And so agreable is this to
the common sense of Mankind: that the Roman Law says,
<hi>Simulatae Nuptiae non sunt Nuptiae. Counterfeit Marriage is no
Marriage.</hi> By which I understand that which is not cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Solemnly, and Publickly as the Law prescribes.
Those that are thus Legally Married are Man and Wife,
and their Children Legitimate; the rest live in Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and their Children are of base and dishonourable Birth.</p>
            <p>So that the Evils which unavoidably follow the neglect of
Customary Solemnities are a sufficient Argument how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably
necessary they are, in the Judgment of God
as well as of Men. For God must be supposed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
all that as essential to Matrimony, which appears
necessary to make it Honourable, and to prevent such
mighty Mischiefs. And therefore, if Men would but deal
faithfully with their own Consciences; it were easy to
discover, that what is contrary to the Laws of Government;
capable of being abused to very ill purposes; brings on
Man and Woman the imputation of Whoredom; on their
Offspring the disgrace of Bastardy; is a scandal to the Church
of God, and in the sense of the World is esteemed and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Fornication: will undoubtedly have the guilt of such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and can never, upon some Clandestine unknown
reserve, be found Innocent and Safe, and Justifiable at his dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and impartial Tribunal, <hi>Marriage is Honourable and the</hi>
Marriage <hi>Bed undefiled: but Whoremongers and Adulterers God
will Judge.</hi>
