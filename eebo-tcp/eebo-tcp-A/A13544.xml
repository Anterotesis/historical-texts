         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO ALL THAT WISH WELL TO OVR SY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON, HEARTILY AND VN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly: Grace be multiplied and peace in our Lord Iesus Christ.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Rethren, beloued in the Lord: You see by the Title, what you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in the booke following. I hope what it promiseth, shall be indeede performed. I wish it were more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and accurate for your sakes: as it might haue beene, if the graue and diligent Author could himselfe haue set it forth: but blessed be God, that his weightier employments doe not giue him leaue or leasure. I am glad I haue it for you as it is, through my earnest request to him: whose modesty thought it vnworthy the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and my paines in writing it.</p>
            <p>Reasons of this my request and paines, I can giue you many. First, I thinke it necessary, that our God, our gracious and louing God, may haue the praise of all his mercies (and namely that of <hi>this day</hi>) still reserued to himselfe wholly. His workes are glorious, and the benefit of them not confined to a scantling of time. Therefore these
<pb facs="tcp:18772:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Gratulations cannot be lesse seasonable now than they were at the day of Deliuerance. Secondly, this I hoped might be a meanes to restraine our <hi>declining times</hi> from gazing and doting on that pompous Harlot, the Church of Rome. For when our nation shall see, and consider a fresh, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable she hath alwaies beene of blood, and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish blood! I cannot thinke we can be so inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, as to dreame of any toleration, much lesse any sound reconcilement with so implacable an enemie. Thirdly, I thought it not altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible hereby to stop the slanderous mouthes of misse-conceiuing persons, scattered abroade through all the Country, yet pleasing themselues in the common error: who seeing in some good men a difference of iudgement in some small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, presently conclude them enemies of the State, &amp;c. For this I will say of the Author, <hi>(and I say the truth in Christ,</hi>

               <hi>I lie not, my conscience bearing me witnesse in the holy Ghost:)</hi> that hauing beene partaker of his Ministery some hundreds of times, I neuer heard him more earnest, or more faithfull, than in this Argument. And the whole Towne of Reding will testifie with me of his holinesse, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, peaceablenesse, vnweariable painfulnesse, and other graces beseeming his calling: which no ill-willer could euer yet impeach. Fourthly, and lastly, my intent is hereby to stirre vp our drowsie and forgetfull hearts to due thankfulnesse for so great a Deliuerance. And this (me thinks) is more than necessary. For when I behold the generall view of the Land, and the quality of peoples man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb facs="tcp:18772:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the memory of that <hi>wonderfull day</hi> seemes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me quite blotted out: And I know not who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to resemble our selues vnto, than those of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Psalmist speakes, Psalm. 106.11.12.13.14. <hi>The waters couered their enemies: there was not one of them left. Then beleeued they his words: they sang his praise. But they soone forgat his workes: they waited not for his counsell: but lusted exceedingly in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, and tempted God in the Desert.</hi> Doe we not so euen in our Canaan, a Land flowing with milke and hony? What horrible prouocations are there daily and hourely amongst vs, in all places, in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corner? Who can complaine sufficiently of the grieuous temptings and out-brauings of God, which our eyes doe see? Who would iudge by our strange demeanours, that God had euer done any thing for vs, either by sea or land, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst water-workes or fire-workes? Ah sinfull na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, laden with iniquity! Doe we thus requite the Lord for his louing kindnesse? Is this his reward for so great fauours?</p>
            <p>Hearken ye children of Syon, and consider: <hi>Though Israel play the harlot, yet let not Iudah trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse.</hi> Though carnall persons,<note place="margin">

Though others loathe the word, and the meanes of saluation, yet let not Professors loathe them.

them in, who were the instruments of this wicked Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: which is set downe with the accusation in the first words. 1. <hi>Because the Kings commandement was straite,</hi> they were so intent vpon the Kings charge, as (in likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood they forgate their owne safety. 2.

            <p>What shall I speake of the tyranny and cruelty of those Heathen Romane Emperours, within the first 300. yeeres after Christ? of whom not only the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues suffered violent death; but whosoeuer made any profession of their doctrine, were most ignominiously tormented, no respect had of sexe, nor reuerence of age, in so much as the dead bodies of men, and women, and children, old and young together, were cast out and lay naked in the streets like the pauement thereof. And (if we may beleeue history) in the dayes of one of those ten Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors were ten thousand Christians crucified in one mount, crowned with crownes of thornes,<note place="margin">

This very spirit of cruelty is the spirit of Antichrist, which raigneth in Popery at this day; which one religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth and outstrippeth all other religions, in barbarous blood-shead and cruelty (not the Turkish excepted.) Long it were to recite, and incredible to beleeue those horrible slaughters, which might be induced to prooue this part: there is neither writer that can bee so diligent, or writing so exact, as can make a sufficient relation, of the barbarous butcheries made vpon the Saints by these enemies of God and nature. But yet so much as may giue a generall view, and (as it were) a glimmering light, must be set downe for the euincing of this truth, which so glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would auoid.</p>

The <hi>effect,</hi> namely the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the true God by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and all his Nobles. Of all these very briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For the manner: they were cast in bound, and the fire onely loosed their bonds, consumed them, and set their bodies free, yea their garments did not so much as sauour or smell of the fire. Gods children, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Church,<note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7.</note> Neuer were these three more glorious than in the flames.</p>
            <p>We must learne by the Papists <hi>furnace</hi> to take good, as we haue taken no harme:<note place="margin">

               </note> and labour, that our bonds of sinne may be more and more loosed, and our selues walke at more liberty in the wayes of Gods commandements. Thus wise men take more benefit of foes than of friends.</p>
            <p n="2">II. For the meanes of their deliuerance. Some ascribe it to virginity, as <hi>Damascene</hi>; some to fasting, as <hi>Basill:</hi> but the word of God ascribeth it to faith in the Sonne of God; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.34. <hi>By faith they quenched the violence of the fire.</hi> And so in this place: <hi>Nebuchadnezzar saw a fourth like the Sonne of God</hi>; speaking indeede like an Heathen, whose Gods were begotten one of another: not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Sonne of the eternall Father, but an Angell, vers. 18. Yet hence we may note many good things, as</p>
            <p>First, that the Lord Iesus the Sonne of God, and the protection of his people, by whose onely power a true miracle can be wrought, then affords his most gracious
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18772:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
presence, when his members are in extreamest dangers: as the head most bestirres it selfe in the exigence of the least member. He tooke not the quality of fire from this fire, (which did burne wood, and fewell, and the enemies bodies, and the bolts of <hi>Daniels</hi> fellowes:) but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained and repressed it from these subiects. And hence it is, that the Martyrs neuer finde such a chearefull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Gods Spirit with them, as in the midst of flames: whose consolations swallow vp all their feares, and all the horrour of those flames. Of this trueth if our selues had not had experience in their hellish conspiracie, we had not beene here at this time.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let vs ascribe that saluation vnto the Sonne of God, who walked with vs in that <hi>Furnace.</hi> The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked tyrant could espie a fourth like the Sonne of God in the <hi>furnace:</hi> much more let vs, and acknowledge, that it was no fore-sight, wisedome, merit, or humane meanes whereby we were preserued, but onely the Sonne of God, who by themselues reuealed it. And for time to come let vs hide our selues vnder his wing, which if wee doe, fire shall cease to burne, and water to drowne, rather than we shall perish.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as this tyrant by this sight of this Sonne of God in the <hi>furnace</hi> did acknowledge, that hee neither ought to haue commanded such an vniust command, nor his Ministers obayed it; so wee wish the Romish <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And let vs not onely speake of it as a wicked intent, and so force one another to malice them, but driue our selues forward to such du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of faith, loue, obedience, as beseeme those who looke for such saluation.<note place="margin">

their wickednesses, being in ripenesse and perfection: secondly, the greatnesse and heauinesse of their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Leuit. 26.21. <hi>I will punish you seuen times more for your sinnes.</hi> Or <hi>seuerally:</hi> and then this is the sense: If after once or twice their prouoking of me they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, I was readie to returne and giue them pardon: but now the <hi>fourth time</hi> prouoking me, that is, going on in sinne still, and adding obstinacie and impenitencie to their sinne, I will beare them no longer.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I will not turne to it.</hi>] First, I will not turne my selfe any more in my loue, nor by my Spirit, vnto them: I will not offer my selfe in patience to expect them any more. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I will not turne them to my selfe by repentance, but leaue them to themselues, to enioy their sinnes so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and so enormious, till my swift and seuere iudgement ouertake them.</p>
            <p>Note here, that of all iudgements the most seuere is to be left and forsaken of God; when he is so farre prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as he will not returne. This one threat <hi>(I will not turne to it)</hi> is an <hi>epitome</hi> of all miserie.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Now of the equitie. These Idumeans were stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly wicked, and heaped vp sinne vpon sinne. But espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they are here threatned because of their crueltie and fiercenesse against the Church of God, set downe in foure particulars: 1. In respect of the persons: <hi>He pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued his brother. Esau</hi> was the naturall brother to <hi>Iacob,</hi> yea a twinne of the same wombe at the same time; so as the Edomites and Israelites were cousin-germans, of two brethren, <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Iacob:</hi> yet as <hi>Esau</hi> hated his brother extremely, with deadly hatred plotting his death, euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18772:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he got the blessing from him: so was this imbred ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred deriued into his posteritie against the posteritie of <hi>Iacob,</hi> forgetting they were brethren, and of brethren. Therefore it is said, <hi>he cast off all pitie, and put off all huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, naturall affection and all bowels were laid aside:</hi> so is the word, <hi>violating euen the law of nature.</hi>

               </note> 2. In respect of the extent of his wrath: it turned to fiercenesse and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, no sparke of compassion left; called <hi>furie and rage,</hi> Psal. 137.3. while they cried, <hi>Downe with it, downe with it, euen to the ground.</hi> 3. In respect of the effects: which in the text are two: first, sword and slaughter: secondly, spoyle and robberie: They spared neither life, nor goods, but as theeues both slew and rifled them. 4. In respect of the time: His anger was <hi>euermore,</hi> and his wrath <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>; as a cruell beast hauing taken his prey will neuer let it goe: so Edom neuer let Israel goe free, no time wasted his wrath, which continued, perpetuall, and irreconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Obiect. There was often truce and peace betweene them. Answ. No: <hi>in warre he spoyled, in peace he watched him,</hi> saith the text.<note place="margin">

            <p n="3">III. The third generall is the execution of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Therefore I will send a fire</hi>] God will send.

            <p>In all these we haue a liuely pourtrayture of Gods iust iudgement vpon the Romane Edomites, which shall not be lesse certaine than seuere.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>For certainty.</hi>
               </note>The certainty of the destruction of the Kingdome of Antichrist is manifest:</p>
            <p n="1">I. In that the <hi>Lord will doe it:</hi> for <hi>he hath spoken it, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel.</hi> 17.17. The words of God must be fulfilled concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the destruction of Babylon. Now by Babylon in that Chapter and Prophecie, is not to be vnderstood the Babel of Chaldea, neither do the threats befit that Babel, which was fallen and destroyed before: but the mysticall Babel of Rome, which succeedeth and exceedeth that in cruelty. This I will not stand to proue, because we haue it plainely confessed both by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Ribera,</hi> the learnedst of the Romish Church, that Rome present, is mysticall Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel. <hi>Iohn</hi> (saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) euery where in the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps calleth Rome Babylon; because (saith hee) onely Rome in <hi>Iohns</hi> time had the rule ouer the Kings of the earth, and secondly, was the Citie set on seauen hills, which agrees to no other Citie. What therefore I am to speake of Babylon in the Reuelation, I shall aptly and properly speake of Rome, by the learnedst of the Papists owne confession. And the reason, why the Spirit of God by allusion doth call it Babylon,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rome termed Babylon, why?</hi>
               </note> is by way of similitude; Because as that Easterne and Chaldean Babylon did a long time oppresse the Church of the Iewes, so this We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern and Italian Babylon hath kept, vnder most horrible oppression and thraldome the Church of the Christians.</p>
            <p>This Babylon must be so certainely destroyed as if it were done already: <hi>Reuel.</hi> 14.8. <hi>It is fallen, it is fallen,</hi> saith the Angell. True indeede, it is already accomplished in part: it is fallen, 1. In the purity of doctrine, 2. In
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18772:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the estimation which once it had. 3. In authority: but this prophecie notes the certainety of her fall by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ouerthrow. And this Babilon must be certainely destroyed, because God the great Iudge of the world hath passed sentence against her, which only waites the execution; Reuel. 18.20. <hi>Reioyce ye heauens ouer her, for God hath giuen your iudgement on her.</hi> Againe, if any meanes can bring hir destruction, she shall be destroyed: If <hi>death, sorrow, famine or fire</hi> can destroy her, these shall come on one day; and if all these were vnable, the strength of God is able to pull her downe, Reuel. 18.8. <hi>for strong is the Lord, which will condemne her:</hi> Now if God set against a man who can rescue him? Iob. 33.13.14.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The iudgement is certaine, because, as the Lord would not returne to Edom, so neither wil he returne to Romish Edom: for, 1. He is too far prouoked: the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is past and therefore irreuokable. 2. This <hi>leopard,</hi> as shee is called, Reuel. 13.2. <hi>cannot change her spots.</hi> 3. <hi>Edoms teares found no repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> Heb. 12.16.17. no more shall these, nor by any meanes will God call back his anger.</p>
            <p>The seuerity of Gods wrath against the Kingdome of Romish Edom is not vnproportionable to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Syrian Idumea. 1. In the kinde, <hi>a fire</hi>;<note place="margin">2. <hi>For seuerity</hi>

The chiefe sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect is <hi>Teman,</hi> the Metropolis, signifying the vtter ruin of Rome it selfe: 4. It shall reach to the <hi>Palaces of Bozrah,</hi> noting the generality of the iudgement through all the Kingdome of Antichrist.<note place="margin">

            <p>First, the destruction of Rome shall be by terrible fire, euen in the letter it is most likely; though some of great note thinke not so: for, 1.

This is the guise of Antichristian ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Church of God: which while it is not suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, but sometimes too charitable and credulous, they lay their snares where no man can possible suspect. Would any man think the Pope would instigate to kill Christian Princes at the very Masse? yet by the counsell of Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 4. the two Princes of Medices were hurt and slaine euen at Masse; and the lifting vp of the hoast was made a signe of the murder by the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate:<note place="margin">

Would a Prince thinke to be poysoned (of purpose) in receiuing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, by these charitable Catholikes? yet one was by the powder of diamonds tempered with the wine of

Would a Catholique King, most deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Romish religion, and a champion for it, expect to be slaine by Catholiques, and men of peace, before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication? yet this was iust (saith <hi>Reinolds</hi>) and the charitable Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5. said, <hi>A true Fryar had slaine a countefeit Fryar.</hi> Could any man haue expected that suddaine terrible blow, and an vniuersall destruction from vnder the Parliament house, from which the honor, iustice, happinesse, life and soule of our Country (vnder God) hath beene so long maintained and preserued?</p>

               </note> For indeed they are most cruell, both in their <hi>positions,</hi> and in their <hi>dispositions.</hi> Their <hi>positions</hi> are these, and such like: 1. The Oath of Allegiance is against Catholique faith, and the health of soules, saith the Popes Breue. 2. Princes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate by the Pope, may be deposed and killed by their subiects. 3. No faith is to be kept with heretickes: and all are hereticks that are not of their religion.<note place="margin">

            <p>We haue seene the Fowlers, and their nets: now let vs proceede.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The crafty laying of these snares is such, as they haue compassed the bird,<note place="margin">

               </note> and it seems impossible any way to escape. For the danger was, as if the Prophet had said: We were on euery side included in the nets of the <hi>fowlers,</hi> that what way so euer we could turne vs, we were hemd in; the danger met vs on euery hand, and death euery way layd hold vpon vs. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> (Psal. 18.4.5.) confesseth, that <hi>the snares of death compassed him:</hi> hee was euen as a man bound and piniond to execution, so as hee saw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

            <p>The same was our condition in that Gunpowder trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: the enemies made sure of their prey: they saw their expectation euen in their hands: and brought their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked conception to the very birth: the Crowne and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was theirs: they had disposed of the chiefe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the chiefe holds, and reuenue of the Land: onely one <hi>terrible blow</hi> was to be giuen, and the hand of wickednes lifted vp on high, reaching fire to the fewell, which should haue turned three Kingdomes into one Bonfire.</p>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> Why doth the Lord suffer the enemies thus to ensnare his people, that the Case seemes desperate, the deliuerance impossible?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> 1. That wee may see our owne simplicity, who cannot obserue or preuent their snares, the crafty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> wiles of Satan and his instruments against the Church. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. That wee may take notice of Gods patience toward his enemies, suffering them as long as he may, and then his iustice in taking them at the height. 3.

That the greater the dangers be, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Gods goodnes may be the more manifest, and that in most desperate euils we may acknowledge our deliuerance to be miraculous, and so the praise of all may be referred to the Lord,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 9.9.</note> who is <hi>a very present refuge</hi> in the troubles of his Church; as our selues found in this our danger.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the second generall part of the Text, namely the deliuerance of the Church, <hi>Our soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:18772:33"/>Herein consider, 1. the manner, 2. the meanes of the deliuerance.</p>
            <p>The manner, <hi>as a bird escaped out of the net:</hi> The meanes, <hi>the net is broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the manner: 1. Beyond and aboue the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, when all things seemed desperate, when all counsell and meanes failed among men, and no hope was left, euen then came deliuerance. How can a poore bird, wound in the nets of the Fowler, expect but to be taken? And this is matter of more ioy &amp; gladnesse, than if the danger had bin lesse. 2. Beyond and beside the expectation of the <hi>fowlers</hi> themselues, to their greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment &amp; confusion. How will the <hi>fowler</hi> rage and storme, when a silly bird is gotten away out of his net? so doe the enemies of the Church, who haue beene at great cost, and charge, and paines, and beaten all their wits to lay their nets, to be disappointed euen then when they haue their expectation betweene their hands; as the case of these Conspirators was.</p>
            <p>For the meanes: <hi>the net is broken.</hi>] God alone hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in pieces their crafty counsels and deuises: God hath frustrated all their purposes: when they had hemd in the people of God, as a bird in a net, on euery side, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe makes a way out; as when the net is broken asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the bird escapeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctr.</hi> The Lord in his season powerfully deliuers his Church, by breaking the nets of the enemie.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>God still findes a time to rescue his Church from the snares of the wicked.</hi>
               </note> Psal. 33.10. <hi>The Lord breakes the counsell of the Heathen, and brings to nought the deuises of the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. Because GOD is euer present with his Church, in the midst of it, to helpe it at the greatest pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Esa. 8 9.10. <hi>Gather together on heapes, ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces, &amp;c. for God is with vs,</hi> namely as our shield and protection: and, <hi>if God be with vs,</hi>

                  </gap>mies: the King of Israel, euen the Lord is in the midst of thee; thou shalt see no more euill.</hi> The Lord is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where present, but not euery where as in his Church: he is the King, and the shelter of it by a speciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Church is Gods darling and delight: his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is deare vnto him: <hi>he that toucheth them, toucheth the apple of his eye,</hi> Zach. 2.8. In all their troubles he is troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and taketh wrong done to them as done to himselfe: and therefore must needes reuenge vpon the enemies one time or other. See Nahum. 1.2.9. because the Lord is iealous ouer his people, hee reserues wrath for their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: <hi>he shall come vnto them as vnto thornes.</hi> The cause al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is his: they hate the godly for his sake: and therefore he takes their part.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As God is willing to saue his people, so also he is euery way most able. 1. Hee is more watchfull for his Church, than all his enemies can be against it: <hi>Hee that keepeth Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 121.4.</note> 
               <hi>doth neither slumber nor sleepe:</hi> in which he out-matcheth the enemies, who, though they often break their sleepe through greedinesse of the prey, yet sometime they must sleepe. Hee is a more watchfull guard than <hi>Sauls,</hi> when <hi>Dauid</hi> came and tooke away his speare and pot from his head.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.</note> The phrase is taken from watchmen, who stand on walls in time of warre, to fore-see the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of enemies, and giue warning: they may be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, or sleepy, as when the Capitall in Rome had beene taken by the French-men, if the Geese had not beene more waking than the watch-men of the walls. But the Lord is a faithfull and watchfull keeper: let neuer so many watch the mischiefe of the Church, he is sufficient against them all, hath <hi>seauen eyes,</hi> Zach. 4.10. 2. He is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser than all his enemies, and herein ouer-matcheth them, that he knowes all their counsels, they know none of his: which aduantage the King of Israel had of the King of Syria by reason of Gods Prophet.<note place="margin">2. <hi>King</hi> 6.12.</note> Hee knowes their whole plot and proiects, and suffers them to carrie them a

long time, but knowes when to preuent them, and how to dispose them to the good of his Church: for there is neither counsell nor wisedome against the Lord. 3. He is stronger than all the enemies: Ioh. 10.29. <hi>My father is stronger than all:</hi> no one, no nor all together can resist his power. And therefore when great men haue banded and bended all their forces against Christ and his Church, they <hi>imagine but a vaine thing,</hi> Psal. 2.1.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God hath waies enow to deliuer his Church, euen when things seeme very desperate. He hath <hi>seuen pipes</hi> to his <hi>seuen lampes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zach.</hi> 4 2.</note> and these oftentimes laid very secret and out of sight. He can make a way in the sea, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a wall for his people: which cannot be expected by man: yea he can suspend and stay the course of nature; he can suffer his children to be cast into the fire, then qualifie and coole the furnace.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Lord commonly delighteth in such a deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Church,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The righteous shall dip his foot in the blood of his enemies.</hi>
               </note> as is ioyned with the confusion of his enemies: as in the red sea, the same way and waters, which were the preseruation of the one, were the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the other.

            </p>
            <p>And hereby the Lord manifesteth his power and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. 1. That the wicked, while they take craftie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell together, should be pauing a way to their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. <hi>Hee takes the wise in their craftinesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19.</note> that they lay a net in which themselues fall. When they make co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenants with death, and digge to hell to make Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren so sure as none should escape them, then their owne destruction shall be the Churches deliuerance. What a broad net had <hi>Haman</hi> laid for the Iewes? None could be fairer for the game than he that had the Kings edict, ring, postes, and all he desired. But in due season his net tooke himselfe and his familie: his gallowes caught himselfe and his sonnes: in whose destruction God laid the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18772:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his Church at that time. The same in the powder-plot: what deuice was euer fairer, or neerer? or when was there a more vniuersall net laid for Gods Church these thousand yeeres? yet the Lord in the very full season ioyned our deliuerance with their detection and destruction.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.6.</note>2. It is iust with God, that wicked men, while they deuise mischiefe, should onely make rods for their owne backes: though their pretenses be neuer so faire and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. As for example: Dan. 6.7. the Courtiers of <hi>Darius,</hi> (as they can easily lay their plots, to sway Princes to euill counsels) come to the King, whose power they would abuse, and none wish him so well as they, <hi>O King, liue for euer:</hi> none so obseruant of the Kings edicts as they, <hi>All the rulers of the kingdome, officers, gouernours, counsellors and Dukes haue made a decree</hi> concerning the worship of thee O King, that none shall aske any thing for thirtie daies, saue onely of thee. This <hi>Daniel,</hi> one of the children of the captiuitie, regards not thee nor thy decree. They proclaime him seditious, rebellious, and a traitor that hath no respect either of King or law, but despiseth au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and edicts, well and wisely deuised and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished. These are ordinarie nets laid against godly men by vngodly. Then must the law of the Medes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, sealed with the Kings signet, be executed vpon him. He is cast into the denne. They haue him in their net. But they cannot hold him: Nor can he be deliuered but with the destruction of them all by the lions. Here, by plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible speeches what did they but make their owne rods? And so was it in our owne instance, in whom Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice shined most eminently: All the while, they digged a pit for themselues, and fell into the pit they had digged for others: according to that of the Psalmist, <hi>He hath dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a pit, and is fallen into the pit hee hath made: his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe shall returne vpon his head,</hi>

               </note> that for the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his Church hee not onely breakes their nets, but makes them breake their owne nets and neckes: And this is the greater confusion, when the authors of sin are made the authors of their own punishment. For example: Such is their thirst after the ouerthrow of the Church and godly, that they still call in more company, and take in more partners, that if one misse, another may hit, and all may be sure not to faile. But Gods hand now ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruleth the matter, and makes their owne carnall counsell their confusion: that whereas one could keepe counsell, company shall reueale it: As in the many conspirators about the powder-plot, in which one of them furthered the punishment of another, but not the performance.</p>

               </note> that the Church is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible: no net shall long hold it, but it shall breake thorow all nets. It may bee pressed, not oppressed: op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned, not expugned. It is <hi>an heauie stone</hi> to heaue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, Zach. 12.3. For, 1. The enemies cannot worke wisely enough to preuaile, but, as the more the Egyptians oppressed Israel, <hi>the more they incresed</hi>; so is it here. 2. Though the godly be in themselues fewer, weaker,<note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 6.16.</note> 3. The Church stands vpon two sure pillars, like <hi>Boaz</hi> and <hi>Iachin</hi>: first, Gods promise, which is, that the gates of hell shall not preuaile against her. Secondly, her foundation is on a rocke, against which if the floods beate, and the windes blow, it shall surely stand, Matth. 7.25. Why then doe the Pope, and Papists, and that Antichristian league, still trauell with wickednesse, and conceiue mischiefe, to bring foorth a lye? What doe yee imagaine against the Lord? Nahum. 1.9.</p>
            <p>This is a ground of comfort for vs, when wee see ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies leaguing themselues against Gods people, that they make no spare of destroying either by secret meanes, or

This is the way to stay our fathers blow, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine compassion, and cause him to throw his rod into the fire: as the Prophet brings him in relenting for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Hos. 11.8. <hi>How shall I giue thee vp, O Ephraim? how shall I deliuer thee, O Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? Mine heart is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within me: my repentings are rowled together.</hi> For this is the condition, 2. Chron. 7.14. <hi>If my people, among whom my Name is called vpon, doe humble themselues, and pray, and seeke my presence, and turne from their wicked wayes, then will I heare out of heauen, and be mercifull to their sinne, and will heale their land.</hi>

So doth our holy Prophet in this Psalme: he sings out the praise of God to all posterity, for so great a deliuerance in so present a danger. Motiues heereunto: 1.

               <hi>Answ.</hi> By the <hi>Name</hi> of God is meant that by which he reuealeth himselfe to his Church, as a man is knowne by his name. And in this argument the Name of God signifieth the ayd, the power, the strength, and the goodnesse of God: so it is vsed, Psalme. 44.5. <hi>in thy Name wee shall tread downe our enemies,</hi> that is, in thy strength and power. Our helpe consists in that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and strength which the Lord putteth forth for vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who hath made heauen and earth.] Qust.</hi> Why is this added? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. To aduance the Lord in his Attribute of Omnipotency. 2. To strengthen our faith when meanes fayle vs: for this power is not tied to meanes. Therefore these are set the first words of the Creed, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in God the Father Almighty, <hi>maker of heauen and earth.</hi> 3. To shew vs to what end the world, the <hi>heauens and the earth</hi> were made, namely that it might be a Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and glasse of the diuine power and glory of God. 4. To intimate how easie it is for God in most desperate cases to helpe his children: much mor easie than to make <hi>heauen and earth.</hi> 5.

            <p n="1">I. Note hence the nature and worke of faith in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beleeuer: which is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Faith in dangers lifts vp the hearts to Gods promises and Atributes.</hi>
               </note> to eleuate the minde to God in perils and dangers which is the time wherein faith most bestirres it selfe, and to apply Gods promise of ayd, his presence and deliuerance in all our troubles: not only beleeuing his Omnipotency and goodnesse, but that he is so vnto vs and all his chosen. For this is a speech of faith, which looketh beyond all external meanes, and fixeth the eye of the soule only vpon God, in whose hand help is. And farther, the nature of faith is, to search into all the Atributes of God, whereby it may fortifie it selfe and become inexpugnable. It looketh to the <hi>Name</hi> of the Lord.

               <hi>Answ.</hi> No, for God giueth meanes for our good: But 1. No meanes can helpe vs without God, as God can without meanes. 2. Meanes must be vsed, but not trusted in: Psalm. 20.7. <hi>Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will remember the Name of the Lord our God.</hi> Heere he condemnes not the vse of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots and horses, but trust and confidence in them. 3. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer let vs stand in the meanes as our helpers, but in the <hi>Name</hi> of God, who affords both them and successe in them.

to withstand. So was it with the Church at the red sea: so with the three children of God in the fire; what help had they of themselues being bound? So it was in <hi>Hamans</hi> deuice, and so in <hi>Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason.</hi> 1. That the members of the Church may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in acknowledge the sleights of Satan and wicked men, who are mad against soundnesse of grace, and yet most wittie to combine their malice and madnesse against Gods people. 2. To trie them to the vttermost, and proue their soundnesse, in faith and patience. Fire that must trie gold, must be quicke and piercing, and seeme vtterly to burne and consume it. 3. That the Lord may herein haue occasion, both to vphold his chosen in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction with strong inward consolation; and also to put foorth this his omnipotent power in some strong and glorious deliuerance. 4. That his children being driuen out of all other expectations may be vehement in prayer, and fetch helpe from <hi>heauen,</hi> which they want in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. That extremitie of the Israelites at the sea, made <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>crie</hi> vnto the Lord with vehemencie, Exod. 14.15. and when <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> knew not what to doe, his <hi>eyes were to the Lord,</hi> 2.

            <p>Mistake not the estate of the Church,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse.</hi>
               </note> when it seemes to be oppressed, nor yet of the members. God for these ends suffers Satan and his instruments so cunningly to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie their malice and matters, as oftentimes Gods deare children are in the eyes of the world helplesse. But, did Christ cease to be the Sonne of God, because the Iewes said, <hi>Let God helpe him now, if hee will haue him?</hi> or the Saints of olde, who receiued no corporall deliuerance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.43.</note> but a <hi>better resurrection?</hi> or our owne Martyrs, who seemed helplesse in their hands and flames? No,<note place="margin">

            <p n="3">III. Note that the Church and people of God are neuer so helplesse,<note place="margin">

Tim. 4.16. <hi>At my first appearing no man assisted me:</hi> (small helpe indeed:) <hi>Notwithstanding the Lord assisted me, and strengthened me, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason.</hi> 1. This comes to passe by Gods promise of his constant presence with his people, to be with them in <hi>sixe troubles, and in seuen, in fire, and water,</hi> and extremest perils.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Esai.</hi> 43.2.</note> All which promises, although they runne with exception of the crosse, yet are neuer frustrate, but made good one time or other, one way or other. This promise is their safe conduct. And it is equall, seeing they labour in his seruice, and cast themselues vpon his hand. 2. What else is it that keepes the Church as an Arke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the waters from drowning and perishing among so many tyrants, enemies, and persecutors as thick as waues, but this most helpfull hand and power of God the Pilot of it? The Church hath mightie power against it, all the helpe of the wicked, and the gates of hell. But his eye and wing is neerer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> than the hens to preserue her silly chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, Psal. 91.2. 3. As it was with the Son of God our head, so is it with the members, who faithfully follow his steps in patient labouring and enduring. What his estate was, see Ioh. 16.32. <hi>Behold, the houre commeth, and is now already, that yee shall be scattered euery man to his owne house, and shall leaue me alone: but I am not alone, for the Father is with me.</hi> Christ was very helplesse, when his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers fled for feare, and his Disciples durst not tarrie with him, but left him alone: yet then hee had this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and power of his Father: And so haue the godly, both Pastors and people. 4. They can neuer be so help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18772:39"/>
as they shall not be able to crie for helpe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moane their case to God. Neither want they friends to solicite their cause at the highest Court, but haue all the godly, petitioners for them.</p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1</note> when the Saints referre the whole work of their saluation and safetie to the Lord: as Psal. 3.8. <hi>Saluation belongeth vnto the Lord, and thy blessing is vpon thy people.</hi> And when they can commend their whole safetie, for the continuance and preseruation of it, vnto the <hi>Name</hi> of the Lord wherein all helpe lieth.</p>

and expectation, vers. 15.16. And these things are set downe two waies: 1. In Metaphor and similitude. 2. In simple and expresse speech.</p>

               </note> that all their labour is in vaine against the Church, is expressed by a Metaphore frequent in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, taken from the <hi>trauell of a woman.</hi> The minde of a wicked man is compared to a wombe or belly. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is hurtfull and mischieuous thoughts and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises. The cunning contriuing, carrying, and watching of fit opportunities, is the nourishing, perfecting, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to the birth, while they carrie it the iust moneths: in the meane time swelling with their own presumptions, and glorying in the certaine expectation of their concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued hopes. The attempting of their enterprises is the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition and trauell, which costs them no small paine and labour. The birth or fruite is some misshapen monster, some mischieuous impe, some treacherous Massacre, <hi>some inuincible armie</hi> or powder-plot, borne (as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> writes of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6. for the destruction of all Italy, so) for the destruction of all England, Scotland, and Ireland. But this monstrous shape is called <hi>a lye,</hi> because <hi>mentiri is contra mentem ire</hi> (as some allude.) When they looke vpon their owne childe, and see the vgly face and shape of it, in all the deformed members: it is not to their minde, they are ashamed and confounded, and would faine seeke some father abroad, either the Hugonot; in France, or the Puritans in England, but that it is so like the fire as none can mistake the father of such a monster.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The latter,</hi> that all the labour of the wicked is turned quite contrary to their owne expectation, is set downe by another similitude, taken from <hi>Hunters,</hi> who as they lay <hi>snares,</hi> and <hi>ginnes,</hi> and <hi>pitfalls,</hi> to take the sillie creatures; euen so wicked men <hi>digge pits,</hi> and delue deepe, and lay their traines to winde in the godly into the destruction by them prepared: In which sense it is said of <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such are the issues and fruits of cruell and mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous men against the Lord and his people. Psalme 9.15. <hi>The heathen are sunke downe in the pit that they made: in the net that they hid is their owne foot taken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason.</hi> 1 This is so because <hi>God scattereth the deuises of the craftie,</hi> so as they cannot accomplish what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise. Iob 5.12. he will not alwaies let the successe be to their expectation. They consult not with God, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and therefore must not prosper. Come (saith <hi>Pharaoh) let vs worke wisely</hi> to keep vnder the Israelites.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.10.</note> But hee could not worke wisely enough: the more they oppressed, the more the other increased, verse. 12. They might drowne many male children, but themselues must saue Moses the Deliuerer. 2. Gods loue to his Church makes all the counsels of the enemies pernicious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: for hee takes all that is done against the godly, as done against himselfe: <hi>he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye,</hi> Zach. 2.8. God hath vndertaken the care and charge of his people, and will neuer neglect the safety of his charge, nor to releeue his people that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselues to him; but especially when they call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to turne the counsels of wicked Achitophels into folly. All the contempt and cruelty is against God himself: therefore mischiefe against the Church must needs bee like an arrow shot bolt-vpright<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which falles vpon the head of the shooter. 3. The deuise of wicked men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the iust must needs miscary, because they set their plots vpon a slippery foundation, which will bring downe the house vpon their owne heads: namely vpon lies and falsehood. Psal. 62.3.4. How long will ye ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine mischief against a man? ye shall be all slaine, ye shall be as a shaken wall: <hi>their delight is in lies.</hi> And the whole

frame leanes vpon the arme flesh, or the arme of man, which they make their hope, and so lie vnder the curse of them that <hi>make flesh their arme,</hi> Ier. 17.5. and withdraw their hearts from the Lord. Esa. 59.4. <hi>they trust in vanity, conceiue mischief, and bring forth iniquity.</hi> 4. It is most <hi>iust with God to render tribulation to them that trouble</hi> his seruants:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.6.</note> that the most righteous law of <hi>retaliation</hi> might be returned on them.

            <p>This is that iust retaliation which our Sauiour threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, Mat. 7.2. <hi>with</hi> what measure you mete, it shall bee measured to you againe. If the Egyptians make a wicked decree to drowne the Israelitish children, and will needes follow them into the sea to drowne them: it is iust that themselues bee drowned with a memorable destruction. You haue heard how <hi>Daniel</hi> was appointed for the Lions food, but the next day all his accusers and their families were cast in in his stead, and torne in pieces ere they came to ground. You haue heard also how the same <hi>furnace</hi> which was prepared for <hi>Sadrach</hi> and his fellowes, licked vp and burnt (in stead of them) the accusers. Yea the Lord in this iust retaliating of euil men, hath often smitten their owne consciences, and opened their owne mouths, to cleare his righteous iudgement: as we see in <hi>Adoni-bezek,</hi> Iudg. 1.7. seuenty kings vnder my table with their thumbs cut off gathered bread vnder my table; <hi>As I haue done, so hath God rewarded mee.</hi>

               </note> which we shall more clearely see in foure particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Misery: That all their paine and labour is for their owne destruction. Sinne in Hebrew is called <hi>gnamal,</hi> and in Greke <hi>ponerîa</hi>: both which words signifie labour and trauell: to note the great labour, that wicked men take in committing sinne; they are euen <hi>as women in trauell.</hi> Ier. 9.5. <hi>they take great paines to doe wickedly.</hi> Sinne is a <hi>worke of the flesh,</hi> and sinners are workemen, Esa. 59.5. <hi>weauers</hi> and <hi>spinners</hi>: but weaue an ill web, and spin a thred of their owne destruction, euen an halter for their owne heads; as <hi>Haman</hi> was at charges to set vp his own gallows.

            <p n="2">2 Misery: That they liue in perpetuall perill of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. There is not a moment, wherein they can free or secure themselues from the stroke of God: They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say at any time, Now we are in safety: because they are alwaies in armes against God. If they would hide their counsells from him, behold, <hi>he sees in the darkenesse aswell as in the day,</hi> to ouerturne them all, and make <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked counsell worst to the counsellor.</hi>

            <p>This doctrine they would as impudently deny as they doe other. The light makes them ashamed, and so they denie their owne doctrines. They will denie, that the Pope properly pardoneth sinnes, or that they teach it.

            <p>And now, seeing the wicked are fallen into the pit they made, and the powder they laid for vs, hath blowne vp themselues; let vs conclude with the next words of this Psalme, <hi>We will praise the Lord according to his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and sing praise to the name of the Lord most high.</hi> We will set foorth his righteousnesse and faithfulnesse, in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his promises, and in sauing the liues of thousands of his Saints, destinated to death, as <hi>sheepe to the slaughter.</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

How she iudged and ruled in peace, honour, and happinesse fiue and fortie yeeres, to the honour of God and his Gospell, and terror of all enemies: and in the same peace and happinesse exchanged her earthlie with an heauenly and euerlasting crowne of glory.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A great worke of God it was for vs to reioyce in, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> when at her decease the enemies who had long looked for a day, found it the day of their greatest disappoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whilest the Lord, setting himselfe for our good in our gracious King and the fruitfull plants, renewed all our prosperitie, gaue vs a new tenure of the Gospell, and a new hold of our peace and liberties: of whom we may say as was said of <hi>Dauid; He is the light of Israel:</hi> and of <hi>Iosiah; the breath of our nostrils:</hi> who by his power and pen hath shewed himselfe <hi>a Defender of the true Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. To come to the great workes of this day. That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> these Babylonians might keepe their hands in vre, what foule and desperate designes haue they attempted against the life of the Kings Maiestie, our gracious Soueraigne? For while this light of Israel remaineth, impossible they thinke it is for their <hi>kingdome of darknesse</hi> to preuaile.</p>
            <p>Among other deuises, that shame of Popish Religion, that hideous gunpowder-treason, shall neuer be put out from vnder heauen. In which were many great workes of God for vs Englishmen: whether wee consider the greatnesse of the danger, or the greatnesse of the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>First, consider the greatnesse of the plot: the greatest mischiefe that euer was, wanting a fit name to expresse it,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18772:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnlesse you will call it <hi>a Catholike villanie:</hi> a plot of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and vniuersall danger to vs, of greatest triumph to the Aduersarie. Here the head and taile, branch and root, one and other, Prince and people, Nobles and Gentrie, old and young, Papists and Protestants, should haue been destroyed together. For as Duke <hi>Medina</hi> said, his sword knew no difference betweene Catholikes and Heretikes, no more should this hellish or hell-fire, which it was a sparke of.</p>
            <p>Besides the secret carriage and contriuing of it made it most dangerous, more dangerous than the Babylonish captiuitie: for the Babylonians dealt <hi>aperto marte,</hi> there was some hope of safetie either by prayer, or power, or truce, or preparing against them, there a man knew his aduersarie: but here is a crueltie digged out of the depth of darknesse, all of them sworne to secrecie, yea the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a seale of their wickednesse, sworne <hi>brethren in euill,</hi> at league among themselues,<note place="margin">

            <p>Here we might say as <hi>Hanniball</hi> sometime said of two Romane Captaines, one working by power, the other by policie; <hi>Magis se a non pugnante Fabio quàm à pugnante Marcello sibi metuere:</hi> Wee are more afraid of slie and quiet Papists, than of boysterous armed Turkes.</p>

            <p>Wee see our danger, and how great it was.</p>
            <p>Now secondly, let vs see, how the worke of God is as great in our deliuerance, both for the <hi>Matter</hi> and for the <hi>Manner</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For the <hi>Matter</hi>; we were deliuered from great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills, to great good things.</p>
            <p>First, we were deliuered from <hi>a terrible blow:</hi> A dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blow to King, Queene, Prince, Nobles, Iudges, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Counsell, Gentry, Commons, all. A deadly blow to all Lawes and Law makers, to iustice, peace, titles, tenures, records, and the whole Common-wealth. These Babylonians had sacked and spoiled all the Land. A ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible deadly blow to religion, piety, the Gospell, the Word, the Sacraments. These Babylonians would haue rased downe the Temple to the very foundations of it, and carried away all the vessels and rich ornaments of it. <hi>The waies of Sion should haue mourned, because none could come to her solemne feasts.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lament.</hi> 1.4.</note> Lastly a terrible &amp; deadly blow to all Louers and Professors of religion within the whole Land, which (as the traytors) should haue beene drunke with the innocent blood of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
            <p>Secondly, wee were deliuered from <hi>a terrible day, like the day of the Lord which shall burne like an ouen,</hi> Mal. 4.1. A terrible day, wherein the frame of the world should haue seemed dissolued, the sunne should haue beene tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into blood, the earth should haue opened her mouth and swallowed the inhabitants, the aire should haue been darkned through the blacknesse and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that day. A dismall doomesday of England, a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18772:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
day of fire and brimstone had that fifth of Nouember been, if the fire-workes of these fire-brands had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, wee were deliuered from a <hi>terrible tyrannie</hi> and yoke, to which that of Babel was altogether incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable. 1. <hi>Spirituall</hi>: our glory had beene gone, and we might well haue been called <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>habod</hi>: In stead of our Arke wee should haue had the <hi>abomination of desolation</hi> set vp, the horrible idoll of the Masse, ignorance wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped as a god &amp; mother of deuotion; Preaching hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; Preachers martyrd, &amp; al worship in an vnknowne tongue: an ignotant &amp; rascall sort of greasy filthy Priests; &amp; a doctrine,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.7.</note> which is a very <hi>mystery of iniquity.</hi> 2. <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall:</hi> Answerable to their tyrannous doctrine is their tyrannical practise.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eius auaritiae totus non sufficit orbis: Eius lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriae meretrix non sufficit omnis.</hi>
               </note> The whole world satisfieth not their couetousnesse, nor all the harlots in the world their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse. Look where that religion is stable if it haue not swallowed euen the fat of the Land. And what Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man dares meddle with a base hedge-Priest? And for their practise is not behind their positions, and in both, Turkes and Canibals are behind their cruelty. One of themselues writes, <hi>It had bin better the poore Indyes had bin giuen to the diuels in hell, than vnto them:</hi> and themselues professed they would neuer come in heauen, if the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards came there. Well hath his Maiesty obserued, that not the Turks, Tartars, or they of Calicute who worship the diuell, do lay such principles of cruelty in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as Papists doe.</p>
            <p>Wee see the greatnesse of our deliuerance, <hi>priuately:</hi> now see it <hi>positiuely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In one word: The good things wee are restored vnto, are, the fruition of God and his Christ, in his holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, with the Gospell of peace: to the peace of our Countrey, vnder our peaceable Gouernour; new leases of our liberties, lands, callings, liues, and all that heart can desire.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nor</hi> or meanes of our deliuerance was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

wonderfull. 1. It was easily brought about, not by millions of gold and siluer, not by the power or wit of man. 2. It was done mightily, not by the diuell (as <hi>Faux</hi> blasphemously spake) but by the immediate worke of God: though, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> had some glory of the Babylonish deliuerie, so our <hi>Cyrus,</hi> our gracious King had worthily some glorie of his princely care and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in this discouerie. 3. It was done seasonably, in the very due time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all was ready, &amp; the conception was euen in the birth. 4. It was done to their own confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: detected by themselues; their hands that should haue acted it, detected it by writing. Discouered against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: mischiefe returned on the heads that deuised it: they fell into the pit that they digged for others: death intended against their brethren, caught themselues, and that by their owne powder. All this to the vtter confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their Religion, as we haue heard <hi>Winter</hi> himselfe fore-telling.</p>
            <p>Therefore let vs reioyce in this great worke of God, as his ancient people in this place. For why? The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test rage of the enemie is turned to his greatest praise: Psal. 76.10. <hi>Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee:</hi> both in his glorie and his Churches deliuerance. And what is the end of all Gods great deliuerances, but to <hi>praise his name, and glorie in his praise?</hi> Psal. 106.47. Is not ours the benefit? Haue not wicked men seene and felt, that God hauing chosen our land to dwell in, will not eas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y be cast out of his lodging? and will not this coole their blood, and daunt their spirits from the like enterprises for time to come? Doth not this hazard thus happily diuerted make addition to our strength and peace? Oh blessed be God, euen the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, who for his owne sake, by his owne hand, hath heaped vp our happinesse. He that is mightie, hath done <hi>great things</hi> for vs, and holy is his Name. Oh praise we the Lord; for he is good, for his mercie endureth for euer. Holy Father, knit our hearts vnto thee, that wee may feare thy great
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18772:55"/>
and dreadfull Name. Teach vs to be truly and vnfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thankfull to thy holy Maiestie, for this daies mercies, and all heretofore: that so we may receiue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of thy fauours to our euerlasting comfort, and euermore reioyce in thy great saluation. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be God.</p>
