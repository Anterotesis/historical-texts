         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>WHen our dear Lord Jesus Christ, the Blessed Author of the</hi> Christian-Religion, <hi>first sent forth his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, to proclaim the Happy Approach of the Heavenly Kingdom, among several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Things that he gave them in Charge, it pleas'd him to make this One of their Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi> Into whatsoever City or Town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is Worthy; <hi>fore-seeing the ill Use Unworthy Persons would make of that Message, and with what Unweariedness the implacable</hi> Pharisee <hi>and subtil</hi> Scribe <hi>would endeavour to</hi> Pervert the Right Way of the Lord, <hi>and thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the Simple against the Reception of that Excellent Testimony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This being our Case, who above every Tribe of Men are most Maliciously Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, Bitterly Envied, and Furiously Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn'd by many of the</hi> Scribes <hi>and</hi> Pharisees
<pb facs="tcp:105069:3"/>
               <hi>of our Time, for as Impious Wretches as</hi> Those <hi>of that, reputed our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and his Constant Followers, it becometh us in a Condition so desperate, to provide our selves with some Worthy Readers, Men that dare trust their Reason above Reports, and be Impartial in an Age as byass'd as this we live in; whose Determinations shall not wait upon the Sentence of Ignorance nor Interest, but a Sincere and Punctual</hi> Examen <hi>of the Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And since there are None recorded in Sacred Writ, on whom the</hi> Holy Ghost <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd so Honourable a Character, as the</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans <hi>of that Age (for that they both sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched after</hi> Truth <hi>impartially, and when they found it, imbraced it readily) for which they were entituled</hi> Noble) <hi>Therefore it is that to you, the</hi> Progeny <hi>of that Worthy</hi> Stock, <hi>and</hi> Noble Bereans <hi>of our Age,</hi> We, <hi>the so much Calumniated Abettors of the</hi> Cause of Truth, <hi>choose to dedicate this Defence of our</hi> Holy Profession <hi>from the</hi> Injurious Practices <hi>of a fort of Men, who not unlike to the</hi> Jews <hi>of</hi> Thessalonica, <hi>that, Envying the Prosperity of the Gospel among your</hi> Ancestors, <hi>made it their Business to stir up the Multitude against the Zealous</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters

            <p>THe Insatiable <hi>Thirst</hi> of Men after <hi>Religious or Civil Empire,</hi> has filled almost every Age with Contest: <hi>But for Pure Religion scarcely has any one contended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To mention the Disorders within the first Six <note place="marg1">Read <hi>Euseb.</hi> Evag. Socr. Ruffin. Coun. Trent. Simps. Full. Perr. Bak. Dan. Trus. Daval. Clark.

            </p>
            <p>What better has happen'd since, Modern Stories tell us. Certainly the Separation of most <hi>Parties</hi> from former Institutions, however rightly begun, <hi>have basely degenerated into Self-Promotion,</hi> and when there, <hi>to the Exercise of that Power over Consciences,</hi> which, when it was their own Case <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>o suffer from others, <hi>they esteem'd most Cruel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I well know, that there is <hi>something in Man, that prompts to Religion, and such as stands not in the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Men, nor any meer Formality:</hi> But <hi>Man,</hi> that he may not wholy lose the Honour of a share, or be reputed sloathful; with an unwarrantable Activity so adulterates, and by an Intermixture of his own Conceptions with those Divine Dictates, and purer Discoveries, so sophisticates, <hi>that they

last become more his own Workmanship then the Truth's.</hi> And so fond is he of this <hi>Child of his Brain,</hi> that like some ancient <hi>Tyrants,</hi> he will rather cut his way to the Throne by a Violence upon all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, <hi>then not put an Earthly Crown upon its Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that know not the Truth of this, have scarcely look'd back to their <hi>Great-Grand-Father</hi>'s <hi>time.</hi> Two <hi>Centuries</hi> have not past as yet, since<note place="marg1">See <hi>Book of Mar. Luth. contr. Ecc.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Work was now to promote Religion <hi>by Power,</hi> who had so lately overcome <hi>It by Suffering. Leagues, stately Embassyes, great Conventions, raising of Armies, War with one, and Peace with another</hi> took up the Minds of most, how to defend <hi>the Stateliness

            <p>But neither doth our Story end here; for these Men forgetting their <hi>Primitive Tenderness, and that lowly Spirit, which justly charged the</hi> English Clergy <hi>with some Degeneracy, as had that done the</hi> Romish, were quickly Reminded by the timely and honest Zeal of those they call <hi>Independants</hi> and <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:105069:6"/>
who having a clearer Sight of things, as I believe, and more Regard for Reformation, at once charg'd them with neglect, and endeavour'd to push things a <hi>Step further.

               </q> that is, having beheld so many fair Adventures for Reformation (begun certainly from an inward sense of the corrupt, and <hi>Un-Christ-like State of things) to issue in Fulness, Pride, Superstition, and base Coertion upon Conscience,</hi> they should have liv'd in an holy Subjection, and awful Regard to that holy Spirit of Truth, that had given them some farther Illumination, which would have taught the Denial of those Worldly Lusts, that <hi>Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Revenge whetted their desires after,</hi> and have preserved them in the Way of Meekness, Patience, Long-suffering and Holiness, without which none shall ever see God. But alas! as <hi>Reformation</hi> from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Prelacy</hi> was soon over-run by <hi>Party-Asperity,</hi> and <hi>Self-Promotion;</hi> so truly these Men
<pb facs="tcp:105069:7"/>
made as little Conscience to employ the old Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon of <hi>external Force to advance themselves, and depress others,</hi> as had those that went before them.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> who shewed them the Way, as had the <hi>Protestant</hi> him, and the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist</hi> the <hi>Protestant,</hi> being so considerable in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and these Peoples Maxime so narrow (viz.) <hi>Out of a Church, out of the Faith; Not Dipt, not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian'd:</hi> That too great Division might not perish the whole Affair, of continuing the Government in its present Channel of incredible Advantage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, they much against their Will, admitted the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> into a share with them, especially of <hi>Parochial Churches,</hi> as they are called, and did not wholy exclude the more Moderate of them, a part in the Administration of the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>Thus then (though with regret, and no small Jealousie) being tollerably well agreed, like as he that from a poor <hi>Priest</hi> to a <hi>Pope,</hi> was wont to be remembred of his Original, by a Net (because se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Apostles were Fishermen) which he commanded to be brought to his Table, when <hi>Pope,</hi> cried, <hi>Take it away, Take it away, the Fish is caught;</hi> So they having caught the Great <hi>Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Headed Fish of Civil and Ecclesiastical Power,</hi> and upon one <hi>a Crown,</hi> upon the other <hi>a Miter,</hi> Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea-like, <hi>Full, Rich,</hi> and <hi>wanting nothing,</hi> and willing to forget their small Original; their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers House, <hi>those Heavenly Convictions, and their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble frame of Spirit, their early Sense in some good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure had reduct them to;</hi> O!

            <p>Certainly, it was now time, that God should arise, and that his Enemies should be manifest; who, <hi>under the Splendidst Shew of Reformation, that almost any Age for</hi> 1400. <hi>Years could parallel, had Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the Holy Life of Religion, stifling the Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thereof by reform'd Formality, empty Shews, and meer tinckling Cymbals of Sin-pleasing Doctrines:</hi> And their <hi>Primitive Tenderness</hi> being worn off by Time and Preferment, none grew more Superstitious and Persecuting then those who once seem'd most averse from it (I charitably forbear the mention

of particular Persons) In short, <hi>Pride, Self-Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Self-Establishment, in Glory, Wealth, and Worldly Prosperity having undermin'd the Worthy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, that was at first stirring in the Hearts of some of them: Behold a Glorious, but Empty Trunk of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession!</hi> as lofty as the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves, pretending to be Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Heirs of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>yet Servants to Sin;</hi> Christians by Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>but not by Qualification;</hi> saved in Christ, <hi>though lost, through Sin, in Themselves;</hi> pray by the Spirit, <hi>yet their Duties unholy Things.</hi> Behold <hi>Babylon</hi> in one of her best Trims!</p>
            <p>But it was at this time, serious <hi>Reader,</hi> when <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> was so much talk'd of, and so little practis'd, that it pleased the <hi>Eternal Wise God,</hi> who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable in his Goings, to appear, and manifest the Knowledge of Himself, by a Way contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the World (as indeed, <hi>when did he otherwise) shewing himself first to Shepherds, and Men of mean Rank,</hi> whose, <hi>outward Abilities were as incapable to gain Applause from Men, as their Meanness to invite them: Men, Plain and Simple, who desired of long time above Worldly Treasure, they might be acquainted with the true &amp; unchangable Way of God.</hi> All the Religion they were taught of Men, or the strength of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory could collect from Books, joyn'd with their own Simplicity and Zeal, was not able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Enemies of their Souls, for whose Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption God appear'd, and they often groan'd in secret; being truly willing to undergo any cross, that might but help them to this Knowledge, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they had daily thirsted more then for appointed Food.</p>
            <p>Thus, that no Flesh might glory in his Presence,
<pb facs="tcp:105069:8"/>
did the Almighty God, according to his many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promises, break in upon the Spirits of a poor despised People, by his terrible <hi>Power,</hi> which <hi>caused the old Foundations to shake, and begat holy Terror and Dread, because of the Glory of his Majesty, who had reveal'd Himself.</hi> Judgment <hi>overtook for Sin, and</hi> Righteousness <hi>was laid to the Plummet,</hi> and a true <hi>Scale</hi> was erected, <hi>wherein all the Profession in the World was lighter then the Chaff, which is blown away of the Tempest.

               <argument>
                  <p>The Occasion of the Discourse. The Unhandsome Dealing of our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,</hi> with Respect to the Invented Weakness he chargeth upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as the Strength of their Cause.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere is a Book lately come to my Hands, intituled, <hi>A Dialogue between a Christian and a Quaker;</hi> which with several others lately publisht against us, hath given Occasion for this general Undertaking.</p>
               <p>I was very curious to peruse that Discourse, which should make a <hi>Difference</hi> between them, having in my diligent Search after <hi>Religion,</hi> ever desired to understand and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess <hi>That,</hi> which upon true Convictions, I had Reason to believe was the most <hi>Christian:</hi> But as upon Impartial View I found the <hi>Weakness</hi> of that Book more favourable to us, then the Uncharitableness of the Title-Page, <hi>which seem'd to dis interest a</hi> Quaker <hi>in</hi> Christianity; so most unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly I found my <hi>Name,</hi> among others, often us'd, and as often undeservedly abus'd by the <hi>Author.</hi> I was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that any else should answer for my Faults, <hi>if any there
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105069:19"/>
were;</hi> and if <hi>Innocent,</hi> I esteem'd my self both sufficient and oblig'd to my own Relief, which will not be hard to do: and the Reason is, because <hi>so little Reason, and so much Railing,</hi> have been by him imploy'd against me, as if he intended to <hi>scold</hi> rather then <hi>confute me;</hi> and to let the World know, how much better <hi>skill'd He is in Scurrility then Argument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I confess, drew me first into any Willingness of considering his Discourse at large: Not, that the <hi>Truth</hi> was not first in mine Eye; but because I know the Person most concern'd with him, to be both able and resolv'd to reply, I thought my Endeavors (at least for this time) might have been very well excused.</p>
               <p>But so many Out-cries coming upon the Neck of another, if possible, to expel us the World, I found my self press'd in Spirit, to buckle my Mind to this Enterprise, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that my late Concernment with some other <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries</hi> had left the Wearisomness of a Combat upon my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Hopes I had of being spared, by the ingenuous Acknowledgment of our Enemies, from the like Necessity of further Controversie.</p>
               <p>But as it fell out with the People of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> that several very Bad <hi>Tyrants</hi> were succeded by Worse; so truly it hath done with us: The Confutation of one <hi>Adversary,</hi> redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Envy, Prejudice, and almost every evil Quality in the next; as if to be overcome were more intollerable to them, then to find the <hi>TRUTH</hi> by it, would be Acceptable. Oh Lamentable Use that these Men make of our Love and Pains! But we have some Cause to think, that failing of that Reason, which is necessary to prop so infirm a Cause, they would, if possible, supply the Want of it with the LAST WORD, which at <hi>Billings Gate,</hi> I hear, goeth a Great Way to Advantage, and turn the Scale in all Disputes.</p>
               <p>And truly, if the Temper of this Adversary be but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd, <hi>with what Help he himself has given us to do it;</hi> For my part, I should stand amaz'd that any Sober, Civil or <hi>Christian</hi> Man, could refrain passing severe Sentence against him, as one that writeth of Religion, <hi>out of all Sence of either Religion, or good Manners;</hi> and that only took Occasion, thereby to prove eminently to all Impartial Men, <hi>he really has neither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to let that pass, I leave the Book to speak, for or against it self: I shall only premise, that though I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105069:19"/>
have particularly observ'd the Manner of his Dialogue, as an apt Introduction, and that my Discourse has been occasion'd by this and several late Attempts made against the Truth; Yet my Answer, to avoid their Accusation of Personal Heat, is not Immediate, Direct, or Particular to any one. The Matter of our Judgment, both with respect to the <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> (comprehensive of all) I have positively stated, and so <hi>defended by Plain Scripture, Sound Reason,</hi> and <hi>Universal Consent</hi> of former Ages: and what Force any Books, Argument, or Objections (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with me) whether from our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> especially <hi>T. Hick's,</hi> or my own Remembrance, I shall by the way Faithfully, and I hope, Effectually consider: To the end I may avoid the great Vanity, <hi>of Bragging of a Victory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd against a Man of Straw,</hi> and <hi>Enemy of my own making,</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">
                     <hi>As</hi> T. Hicks <hi>hath done.</hi>
                  </note> and that Detestable Sin, and Dis-ingenuous Practice, <hi>of charging those Lyes, and that weakness upon my</hi> Antagonist <hi>he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought, nor could be guilty of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In short, what I have against the Book in general, and for the Truth and My self in particular, I shall in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Places produce; And now descend so to do, with what convenient Brevity I can.</p>
               <p>First then, he has taken a very Unfair Way of Opposing our <hi>Principles</hi> (if we may yet call them ours) since instead of collecting what truly are so, and those most forceable <hi>Arguments</hi> We have been wont to offer in their Defence, out of our own Writings (which in <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> he ought to have done) he presents the World with a <hi>Dialogue</hi> between a <hi>Christian</hi> and a <hi>Quaker,</hi> which we may truly say, <hi>are both of his own making,</hi> at once abusing both himself and that People; <hi>For neither has he truly represented the</hi> Quaker, <hi>nor much more honest is his Character of a Christian:</hi> And whilst he doth most partially render, <hi>his own Opinions to be those of a true Christian, rather then a true Christians to be his,</hi> he brings in the poor despised <hi>Quaker, saying any thing that may be most Ridiculous, Weak and Impertinent to the Matter;</hi> which Way of Confutation is so far from being truly Manly, much less <hi>Christian,</hi> that the Wisest Man may be so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised into the Greatest Fool, and Truth it self seem <hi>van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisht</hi> by the weakest Forces of her Enemies. It was by Wayes not less Injurious, though more Ingenious, that the esteem'd best <hi>Heathen</hi> of his time, was by some of his Emulating Contemporaries brought into utter Disgrace,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105069:20"/>
with that only People, which once most of all deservedly admired him; as they who will take the pains to read the <hi>Comical</hi> Abuses of <hi>Anytus</hi> and <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> upon <hi>Socrates</hi> may easily inform themselves: <hi>Whose Life being Blameless, and Vertue unparallel'd in his Day,</hi> did by his strict Precepts, and Example, so influence the People into a dis-like of those <hi>Comedians, and their loose Adherents,</hi> that till the frothy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Multitude became reviv'd, by their ridiculous Representations of that worthy Man <hi>in a Play,</hi> it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for them to work his Ruin.</p>
               <p>Methinks, this Man's Dialect savours of the same Spirit, though its Grossness tells us, It hath not the same Wit. Let me never have so infirm a Cause to manage, <hi>and grant me but Leave to make my Adversaries Answers,</hi> and I will never fear <hi>the Consequence of such Encounters.</hi> But, who will yield to this, that doth not first resolve to be Overcome? Let <hi>T. Hicks</hi> but permit me that Liberty against his <hi>Water-Baptism</hi> in Defence of Childrens, and I will warrant him a <hi>Rebel</hi> to the <hi>Church of England.</hi> But doth he do as he would be done by? If this be the <hi>Ne plus ultra,</hi> or Upshot of our <hi>Adversaries</hi> Strength, <hi>to feign Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for Us, that he may appear Some Body,</hi> I think, we need say no more, but leave it with every unprejudic'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to guess at the Meaning of such base Designes. Certainly, We have not been <hi>justly</hi> dealt with, nor our Cause weigh'd in the Equal Scale of Righteousness; and indeed, this Imperfection is most of all incident to that Way of Writing.</p>

            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The Gross Lyes <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi> tells in the Name of, or fastens upon the <hi>Quakers.</hi> Such proceeding, full of Envy, Folly, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NExt, he has as well made us to Belye Our selves, and Principles, as to appear Impertinent; a thing so fouly Uncharitable, indeed very wicked, as me-thinks, every Sober and impartial Mind may have just occasion to be scandaliz'd at his whole Enterprise. What! not only make us to answer in his own Language, but Lye
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105069:20"/>
in it, and that against our very <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Consciences</hi> too; This is an Aggravation, at once, of his own Enmity, and the Imbecillity of his Cause.</p>
               <p>For can any believe, that knows us well, that when we are ask'd, as he fictiously doth in his <hi>Dialogue, Do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scriptures to be true sayings of God?</hi> We should answer<note place="marg1">Pag. 66.</note> him thus; <hi>So far as they agree to the Light in me.</hi> For, though it be thus far true, <hi>viz.</hi> that the true Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is the same in kind with that which shined in the Hearts of the Holy Pen-Men, and therefore may rightly be said, to agree both in it self, and in the several Testimonies of Divers Ages; and consequently it may truly be allow'd to judge of what are the sayings of God, from what are those of Wicked Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet has he disingenuously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded those Words by Way of Answer upon us, <hi>which he cannot find so laid down by any of us,</hi> much less all the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, in another place of his abusive Catechism, he thus Queries.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Then may I not conclude, that the Reason why you so free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Pag. 72.</note> 
                  <hi>Rail against, and Reproach your Opposers, is only to Secure your Credit with your own Proselytes?</hi> which he thus makes the <hi>Quaker</hi> to answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I cannot deny, <hi>but that there may be something of that in it.</hi> O Impudent Forgery! Whether this Invention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Man that has the least honest pretence to Christ's Pure Religion, or one who would be thought as Serious as an <hi>Anabaptist-Preacher</hi> ought to be, judge all you that read us? I cannot believe, but <hi>Many who go under that Name, have more Tenderness and Conscience, then to abet this kind of</hi> Proceed <hi>against us.</hi> In short, It was an unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Spirit ask'd the <hi>Question,</hi> and from that <hi>became a Lying one to answer it.</hi> Our Witness is with God, as to our Innocency in this very matter. But he proceeds.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>Will you be so Liberal of your Revilings, whether your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Pag. 73.</note> 
                  <hi>gives occasion or not?</hi> he answers for us.</p>
               <p>A. <hi>It concerns us to render them as Ridiculous as we can, and to make our Friends believe they do nothing but contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again to the same Unrighteous Purpose,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But doth not this signifie a very Dishonest and Malicious Mind in you?</hi> He makes us return.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105069:21"/>A. <hi>We care not what you think, provided our Friends think not so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to conclude his Slanders of this kind, hear him once more.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Doth not</hi> W. P. <hi>in his Book against the Author of the Spirit of the</hi> Quakers <hi>tryed, manifest great Displeasure against the Man for concealing his Name; Suggesting, that if he knew it, then probably they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> have something, to detect him?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I shall omit in this place making mine own Defence; but be pleas'd Curteous Reader, to observe the Man's Answer, which he would have the World to believe was ours.</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Whatsoever thou or others may think of our Writings, we will give it out, that we have both answer'd and consuted our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, and our Friends will believe what we say in this matter, which is enough to us.</hi> O Lyes, Madness, and Folly.</p>
               <p>Certainly Reader, By this time thou canst not but with me believe, I had Reason enough to make this General Exception against the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> as <hi>neither becoming what I am so tender as to think, our bitter Adversary upon more serious Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations might esteem a Right Christian;</hi> nor yet that <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Quaker,</hi> which the more Sober Sort of Men, <hi>carry in their Minds concerning us:</hi> and in the fear of Almighty God, we do appeal to the <hi>Consciences</hi> of all People, that shall ever read us, whether we have been treated by this Man in his <hi>Dialogue</hi> and <hi>Catechism</hi> with that Spirit of Meekness, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Truth, which is, or ought to be the Rule and Guide of Christian-Men in their undertakings, more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in and about the very weighty matters of Religion. Indeed, we need no other <hi>Apology</hi> in this case, then the Folly of his Answers; For all the World will think, we had least need of seeking the Good-Will of our Friends <hi>which we had already,</hi> and rather conclude it our interest, <hi>to care after, and not to slight what others say or believe concerning us.</hi> 'Tis true, I perceive our Adversary is a great Slighter of Conscience, and that Light of Truth which should be the Instructer thereof, and therefore no wonder if we find so little of it in his <hi>Dialogue:</hi> but however, he sets lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by it, preferring his most defective Head-Conceits <hi>before the holy certain DICTATES of the Heavenly Light in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of Men,</hi> as his Unconscionable Dealing with us sufficiently testifies; yet is it our Desire to act suitably to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105069:21"/>
that in our selves, and to seek the Approbation of it alone in others, rather then by a disingenuous way of Writing, <hi>obtrude our own Fictions for Christian-Faith, much less meer Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies and very Lyes, for the only and best Answers of our Adversaries.</hi>

                  <p>That he does not only make us Impertinent, and Lye; But he mannages the Whole prophanely. That he who is an <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> has forgot the Scorn once cast upon his own Perswasion. Men are not to be mockt out of their Religion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt, He has not only made us to say what he pleas'd, Impertinently and untruly, but he has done it, <hi>with a manifest shew of Prophaneness, by a Light, Taunting and Inapplicable Use of those Expressions, which in a way of Seriousness and Simplicity, may have been sometimes uttered by honest and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious People.</hi> Such are these, that he makes us to give, in Answer to his Questions, which we refuse not to render a distinct account of, to any Sober Man at any time, <hi>viz.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>These, <hi>Impartial Reader,</hi> with more of the like tendency, he is pleas'd to set down as our Strongest <hi>Answers</hi> to his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105069:22"/>
                  <hi>Questions,</hi> several of them such, as have receiv'd, and yet may, very Rational and Satisfactory Returns from many of us: However, if any such kind of Answers have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Unseasonable <hi>Queries of Airy and Entrapping Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, neither is it more Ridiculous, then Christ's Immovable Silence to Inquisitive</hi> Herod <hi>was judged of old;</hi> Nor <hi>did</hi> he <hi>Manfully, to assault our Weakest Part, if such he thought it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But least of all is he excusable, that one who is reputed an <hi>Anabaptist;</hi> the <hi>very next in Religion, that seems expos'd to the Scoffs of Libertines,</hi> should take so much pains, not only to render a Sober People Ridiculous (though it will return upon himself) but with the common <hi>Taunts</hi> of <hi>Prophanenists,</hi> to venture to give <hi>their Serious Language in a Jeer:</hi> An Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, that had much better become a <hi>Comedian,</hi> then a <hi>Christian,</hi> and the Entertainment of Loose, then Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Persons. Certainly <hi>Reader,</hi> We must be at a very great Loss for Religion before we could embrace it from such a hand; supposing us to be as meer <hi>Heathens,</hi> as he would have others to think us: For, how can we believe him, to have any Sincerity to God, who so far seems to have forgotten the Reproach, which his own Separation from others hath been attended with, as to make <hi>that of ours, a Subject for his Mockage and Scorn.</hi> Let him call to mind some of the Infamous <hi>Playes</hi> of those <hi>Comical Wits, Sylvester, Shackspeer, Johnson,</hi> &amp;c. with too many of our own dayes, wherein the Preciseness and Singularity of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> and others, are abusively represented, and <hi>expos'd to the Life,</hi> for the Entertainment of Vain, and Irreligious Persons. If this then be a Crime in an unconcern'd Wit, can it be excusable in a <hi>Christian,</hi> for such he would have us think him to be? No certainly; but will be a great Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of his Account in the Day of the Lord, unless it be wip'd out by unfeigned Repentance, as well as that it must needs deter all Persons, that are in earnest about the weighty Life of the true Religion, from countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his ungodly Attempts against us. And me-thinks, it is no small discovery of the exceeding Vanity of his Mind, that instead of putting away Foolish Jesting, he should entertain base Mockage and Derision, and that about <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> it self. What? Is he grown so hardy, that he can handle Holy Things without Fear; and make bold with tender Conscience, so far as to abuse it self? Is Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity become so offensive in a <hi>Quaker,</hi> as an <hi>Anabaptist</hi> must
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105069:22"/>
show his little Wit in Deriding it: But certainly, <hi>Reader,</hi> it can be no small Advantage, that both his Bitterness and Lightness, give us against a Man of his high Pretences to <hi>Religion.</hi> However, <hi>our Conquest here will be our Patience, Innocence, and Truth;</hi> Not that <hi>I</hi> will believe, he thinks <hi>I want Words</hi> (to whom, he more then once makes the having of them Criminal) <hi>and all that read him may see, he hath furnisht me with Matter</hi> GROSS <hi>enough:</hi> But <hi>I</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not to spend my time upon <hi>Invectives,</hi> did I, perhaps I might bestow <hi>a Tragick Comedy upon a Railing</hi> Anabaptist, in return of that Ridiculons <hi>Dialogue,</hi> he disingenuously would fasten on an unconcerned <hi>Quaker:</hi> But my God forbid, that <hi>I</hi> should Sport about Religion; or make so much as any Man's pretended Religious Dissent, a Theam for my Railery or Abuse; for <hi>I</hi> think it an ill way to Laugh men out of their Profession, as well as <hi>I</hi> can never esteem that any sincere one, which men are Jeer'd into: and as Conviction is the most Serious Ground, on which to receive Faith; so, to detract, or deal disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously with any man, may harden, but can never Proselyte; and this is our very Case, with respect to <hi>T.

               <p>Having now rendered with all convenient Brevity my just Exceptions against the manner of the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> and spirit of the Man in general; <hi>I</hi> shall proceed to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer something against the distinct Doctrines of it, in my particular Vindication of the Truth, <hi>viz.

               <argument>
                  <p>That a Right Relish of the Manner of the Dialogue is a sufficient Antidote against the Matter of it. His Questions stated. His Feigned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. A True Answer to the First. What is Salvation. To be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Sin and Wrath; not Wrath without Sin.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHat I have already said, being duly weighed, may be an apt Introduction to what follows; For he that relishes the Unsavouriness and Rancour of His Spirit in the Mannagement of his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Christian-Dialogue, surely can have but little Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to feed upon, <hi>a Dish cook't up with such Poysonous Sauce. Enmity</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> were never Companions; and where there appears so great a share of the one, as hath been truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, we may, I hope, without Offence conclude, there can be but very little, if any, of the other. However, let us see, with Reason and Sobriety, whether the Matter of his Dialogue be more commendable, then the Manner of it, writ with so much Railing and Immoderation. For Reader, this know, I writ not for Conquest, but for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake: and what I can grant, I shall; and what I must oppose, I hope, to do it with Truth and Meekness; being only desirous to approve my self to <hi>God,</hi> who will Reward all men according to their Works; and to that Measure of Divine Light in every Conscience, with which I shall begin, and which, as the Lord God shall ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me, I will endeavour to maintain against the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and Undervaluing Reflections of its Adversaries.</p>
               <p>To overlook then many unnecessary Queries, that are set down, <hi>either to Abuse us, to fill up Corners, or make the Dialogue glide the better,</hi> no wayes true in themselves, and wholly impertinent to the Matter, I receive and prosecute the Main Questions, which he propounds, thus:<note place="marg1">Pag. 2.</note>

In short, We call Salvation, <hi>Christ's making an End of Sin, Destroying the Works of the Divel, Finishing of Transgression, Binding the Strong Man, and Spoyling of his Goods in the Hearts and Consciences of Men and Women; and bringing in his Everlasting Righteousness into the Soul, whereby to Cleanse, Wash, Regenerate, Renew and Refresh the Soul;</hi> in one Scripture-Phrase, <hi>to Save his People from their SINS.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Light Within manifests Sin; yea, all Sin. That Apostacy, or Sin in any, is no Argument against the Light, but rather for it. That the Additional Services of the <hi>Jews</hi> show No Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the Light, but the People, whose Minds were abroad. If Insufficiency against the Light should be admitted of, because of Rebellion and Wickedness in M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>n, the same would be objected against the Scriptures, which overthrows our Adversary's Assertion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Sufficiency.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Light with which <hi>Christ</hi> inlightens all Men, manifests Sin, as these Words import; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that doth Evil hateth the Light, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cometh to the Light, lest his Deeds should be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved: Implying, <hi>That if they would have brought their Deeds to the Light, the Light would have detected them, and tryed them.</hi> To which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> bears express Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians, That whatsoever is Reproveable is made Manifest by the Light;</hi> where the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversality of the Apostle's Assertion shows, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is Reproveable, is, or <hi>can be excluded from the Search or Knowledge of this Light;</hi> which takes in as well Thoughts, as Words and Deeds. So that nothing being Reproveable, which the Light doth not first Manifest: How obvious is it to every Understanding, that if our Adversary believeth all Men to have committed Sin, and so, as that they know it (which is Reproveable) <hi>the Light must needs have been, and be in all Men, in order to such Manifestation and Conviction.</hi> It is as much as if the Apostle had said,<note n="*" place="marg1">That is the Cause.</note> 
                  <hi>Sin is that which Damns all Men; now it could not Damn, if it were not Reproveable;</hi> and it could never be Reproveable, if the Light did not Manifest and Condemn it as such. So that our Adversaries affirming the Light not to be Sufficient to Discern all Sin, is a flat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy,<note place="marg1">Pag. 8, 9.</note> and a down-right giving of the Lye to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle; For says the Apostle, <hi>All things that are Reproveable, are made Manifest by the Light.</hi> But sayes Tho. Hicks, <hi>All things that are Reproveable, are</hi> not <hi>made Manifest by the Light.</hi> Sober Reader, dwell here a while, and after a little paws tell me, <hi>Who deals most Unworthily with the Apostle and the Holy Scriptures of Truth,</hi> T. Hicks <hi>or the</hi> Quakers?</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:105069:25"/>
               <p>Obj. But <hi>T. Hicks</hi> objects, with some others, <hi>If there be that Light in all Men, how comes it, that all Men are not Convicted of their Disobedience and Duty, as the</hi> Heathens <hi>of old, and many</hi> Infidels <hi>at this day? Did the Light in</hi> Saul <hi>reprove him for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Answer,</hi> That this no way impugnes the Light, although it greatly aggravates their Evil that so Rebell'd against it. But that there were <hi>Heathens,</hi> who became a Law unto themselves, through that Light they had, <hi>by which they did the things contained in the Law, and were preferred far before the Circumcision that kept not the Law:</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is very express in that known Passage to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Rom. 2.</note> Nor are other <hi>Histories</hi> silent, but loud in their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of very Divine Attainments, which by <hi>this Light</hi> several Famous <hi>Gentiles</hi> arrived at; and <hi>for their Belief of One Eternal Being, his Communication of Divine Light to Men, and of an Immortality, with their Strickt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity thereto,</hi> are left upon Record. by Credible Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians; and their Praises not a little added to by after Ages, even of those called <hi>Christians</hi> too. Such are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, <hi>Pythagoras, Timeus, Solon, Bias, Chilon, Anaxago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Socrates, Plato, Antisthenes, Xenocrates, Zeno, Antipater, Seneca, Epictetus,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>But what if <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> at any time did Apostatize, and particularly? What if <hi>Saul</hi> persecuted the Church of God, <hi>putting Disobedience for Duty, Murder for Service?</hi> Will it follow, that the Light was Insufficient? By no means; but rather that <hi>Saul</hi> was Rebellious, Stiff-neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Resisting the Holy Ghost; as did his <hi>Fathers,</hi> so did he; and thus much the Words themselves show; for <hi>he kickt against the Pricks.</hi> Then it seems there were Pricks; And where were they, if not in his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? And what were they, <hi>if not the Light of Christ within him, which Manifests Evil, and Reproves the Deeds thereof:</hi> otherwise called that Son of God, that to the <hi>Galatians</hi> he said, <hi>It had pleased God to reveal in him?</hi> though <hi>Paul</hi> knew him not, nor his Voice of a long time; his Eye being darkened, and Ear stopt by the God of this World, who had crept into the Outward Forms of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105069:25"/>
then, as now, and <hi>in that employ'd many Emissaries to decry that Pure, Heavenly and Invisible Life of Truth and Righteousness,</hi> which was then, and is now begotten in the Hearts of many, to the ending of the Idolatries of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and Formality and Outward Services of both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Carnal Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I affirm in the Name of God, and with the Reason of a Man, That it is most preposterously absurd, for any to charge <hi>the Rebellion of Men, to be Insufficiency in the Light:</hi> For if men are Wicked, not because they will not be better; but because they neither see nor know, nor are able to do better; <hi>How Heavy, how Black, and how Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a Charecter</hi> doth the Consequence of these Mens O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion fasten upon the Righteous God of Heaven and Earth; since it supposes him, <hi>Not to have given either In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly or Outwardly unto Men Means sufficient to do that which he requires from them;</hi> and for the not doing of which, <hi>they are to be sentenced to Eternal Misery.</hi> But I confess, How deep soever this may stick with Impartial Spirits, I almost despair of entering our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> whose Souls are pinch'd up within the narrow Compass of a most <hi>Detestable Kind of Predestination,</hi> making the Eternal God, as Partial as themselves, like some Ancients, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not Resemble God, <hi>they would make such Gods as might Resemble them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I say, what else can be the tendency of this kind of Doctrine against the Sufficiency of the <hi>Light Within,</hi> then that the <hi>Gift of God is not Perfect, or able, because Men don't Obey it:</hi> and that the Talent God has given to all, is <hi>therefore Insufficient for the End for which it was given, because Man hides it in a Napkin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Let them tell me, Would it be a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that if the same Corn should be sown in a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and Barren Soile, <hi>that growing in one, and not in the other, the Fault should be in the Seed, and not rather in the Ground?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who knows not, how Tradition and Custom have eaten out much of Conviction, blinded the World, and that it is through Lusts and Pleasures become stupified, as to the Invisible Things of God. Alas! there had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been so much Need of many Exteriour Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Appearances in reference to Religion, so much preferred by the Professors of this Day, had not Mens
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105069:26"/>
Minds been departed from the Inward Light and Life of Righteousness; so that they being abroad, <hi>God was pleased to meet them there with some External Manifestations,</hi> yet so, as to turn them home again to their first Love, <hi>to that Light and Life,</hi> which was given of God, as the Way to Eternal Salvation: Nor could any of those cleanse, as concerning the Conscience; wherefore God still, by his Servants and Prophets, admonished and warned the People of Old, <hi>To Put Away the Evil of their Doings, and to Wash themselves, and to Cleanse themselves; for that all their Exactness in Outward Services, was otherwise but as the Cutting off a Dog's Neck,</hi> a Sacrifice equally pleasing: wherefore the Abrogation of all Outward Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Reducing Man to his first State of Inward Light and Righteousness, is called in <hi>Scripture, The Times of Refreshment, and of the Restitution of all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In short, Though there have been External Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, and Ordinances in the World, by God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; <hi>either to prevent the</hi> Jews <hi>from the Outward splendid Worship of the Idolatrous</hi> Gentiles, <hi>that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Peculiar Soveraignity over them; or to show forth unto them a more Hidden and Invisible Glory;</hi> this remains sure forever, <hi>That Light there was, and that the Ancients saw their Sins by it, and that there could be no Acceptance with God, but as they walk'd up to it, and were taught to put away the Evil of their Doings by it;</hi> suitable to that Notable Passage, <hi>The Path of the Just is a shining Light, that shines clearer and clearer unto the Perfect Day.</hi> What was this <hi>Day,</hi> but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat <hi>Salvation?</hi> Can there be any Imperfection or Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Day? Surely no: What if their Light was not so large? Was it not therefore Saving? Yes surely. But as where much is given, much is required; so where little is given, but little is required. If the Light was not so Gloriously manifested before the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Flesh, <hi>less was then required at that time, then since;</hi> yet it follows not, <hi>that there was Two Lights, or that the Light was not Saving before the Visible Appearance of Christ, to as many as lived in an Holy Conformity to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if it be agreed, that Blindness in Men can be no Argument against the Light of the Sun; <hi>neither is the Light Insufficient, because the People of any Nation remain Blind through their Vain Customs:</hi> Nay, should any such Doctrine be admitted, what would become of our Adversary's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105069:26"/>
                  <hi>That the Light of Scripture is Sufficient of it self to give Men the Knowledge of God?</hi> For if those People, who have the Scriptures, do not so Know, Believe and Obey God, as <hi>T. Hicks</hi> says, they ought to do; will it not follow upon his Principles, that the Defect is not in such, <hi>as if they were Ignorant and Rebellious, but in the Scriptures?</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Consequence will hold as well against the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the Light: If then such wrong the Scriptures, who so dispute, <hi>Let</hi> T.

               <argument>
                  <p>Another Objection against the Lights Sufficiency to manifest what ought to be done, though it were able to discover what should be avoided. It is answerd. The Lights not telling man all it knows, or man may know in time to come, is no Argument to prove it knows not all things. Men know more then they do, let them first Obey what they know, and then what is convenient will be further Reveal'd. It is proved from the Reason of Contraries; because it shows what ought not to be done: From Scripture at large, that it does instruct what to do; And that there is Vertue in it to the Salvation of all that Believe and Obey it. That there is no Essential Difference between the Seed, Light, Word, Spirit, Life, Truth, Power, Unction, Bread, Water, Flesh and Blood; onely so denominated from the various Manifestations, Operations, and Effects of one and the same Divine Principle.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt there is a Second Objection; <hi>That there seems to be a manifest Insufficiency in the</hi> Light: <hi>For, though several things are Revealed by it, yet several necessary matters are not, nor cannot; So that though it should manifest all that is Reproveable, yet cannot it Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all that is Necessary to be either Believed or Done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Answer, this is but a peece of the former Objection already considered; I perceive the Pinch lies here; <hi>that because Men do not Do what they should, or don't Know all that may be Necessary to be known,</hi> therefore the Light is Insufficient.

What must we then conclude, but that the Master may be very capable, <hi>were his Scholar so?</hi> that if the Scholar observe and obey his Master, <hi>he will increase in his Learning,</hi> that the Defect of the Scholar <hi>should not be laid upon his Master;</hi> that to tell or amuse him about things unsuitable to his present Capacity, were the ready Way <hi>to overcharge and wholy Spoile him:</hi> And Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that the <hi>Tutor,</hi> not telling his <hi>Pupil,</hi> all <hi>that is fit to be known, at once, implyes no Defect in, or Ignorance of those things in the Tutor;</hi> which to apply Scripturally, in short thus: <hi>If you do my Will, you shall know</hi> (more) <hi>of my Doctrine; I have</hi>

                  <hi>Individual, in every Age, what</hi> HE <hi>shall ever know it self, or shall be known in future times.</hi> The Light then is not Insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, though it tell not all at one time, which may be a Duty to the End of the World; especially in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Cases, whilst it informs me, or any Man, of Daily Duty. Yea, the <hi>Light</hi> is Sufficient in Point of Discovery, whilst it shews unto any Person something more, then they do, and which they ought to perform. If <hi>T. Hicks</hi> will say, and can prove, <hi>that he is come to the Upshot of the Light's Teachings, that he has Learnt whatever it is possible for the Light of Christ to Teach him,</hi> and yet is able to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that there is some thing further wanting, he will
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105069:27"/>
prove himself not only above Men, but <hi>God</hi> also, who is the <hi>Fountain of all Light; that searcheth the Hearts, and tryeth the Reins of Men by the Inshinings of his manifesting Light,</hi> and which, as obey'd, leads to God, who is the Fulness of all Light and Life: But indeed, this Light is the Savour of Death (<hi>the Wages of Sin</hi>) to all that <hi>Rebel</hi> against it, and the <hi>Savour of Life to those only, who are Obedient to it;</hi> For, Such shall not walk in Darkness, but <hi>have the Light of Life.</hi> But, whilst he pleads against a <hi>Sin-less State,</hi> and shows so Sin-full an One in his <hi>Scribles,</hi> let him cover his Face for Shame, for all his Attempts against the Lights Sufficiency; for in that State he shall never know the Life and Vertue of the Light.</p>
               <p>To conclude, If the <hi>Light</hi> be allowed to Manifest all things that are Reproveable, <hi>then by the just Reason of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, should it be Sufficient to Discover all things that are Approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, with respect to Man's Faith, Salvation and Duty.</hi> If the <hi>Light</hi> tells it is Evil, not to Believe in God, it follows, that to Believe in God, is according to that <hi>Light Within.</hi> And if it Reproves <hi>T.

                  <hi>Word-God,</hi> who is that true Light, as he appears to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover or Illuminate the Heart and Conscience, do real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know and enjoy a new Nature, Spirit and Life; And in that Sense it may be said, <hi>As the Life became the Light, so the Light became the Life again. Who so follows me shall not walk in Darkness, but have the Light of Life.</hi> Not, that there is a Difference, or so much as a Descent in Kind from <hi>Life</hi> to <hi>Light;</hi> only in Operation with respect to Man: For as it is the very Life of the Word, <hi>in the Word,</hi> it is the Light of Men: and so much it is, let them reject the Vertue of it, if they will. But as it is received, and believed in, <hi>It begets Life, Motion, Heat, and every Divine Qualification,</hi> suitable to the State of the <hi>New Birth.</hi> And thus the <hi>Life of the Word,</hi> which is in common the <hi>Light,</hi> becomes the <hi>Life</hi> of every such Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, by communicating to, or ingenerating Life in the Soul; so that no more he lives, but Christ (the <hi>Word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>God,</hi> whom he <hi>hath</hi> now <hi>put on, and</hi> who <hi>is become his very Life, as well as Light</hi>) that dwelleth in him.</p>
               <p>Let not Men then in their Dark Imaginations, with their Rob'd Knowledge from the Letter of the Scriptures themselves, contend against the Sufficiency of what they obey not; neither have seriously tryed the <hi>Power, Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of it, which brings Salvation to as many as are turned to it, and abide in it.</p>
               <p>And indeed, so express are the Scriptures in Defence of the Sufficiency, and Necessity of the Light to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that it seems to have been the great Intendment of our Lord Jesus Christ in delegating his Disciples, to preach his Everlasting Gospel, viz. <hi>That they might open the Eyes of People, and turn them from Darkness to the Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God, that they might receive Remission of Sins, and an Inheritance among them that are Sanctified through Faith, that is in Me;</hi> who, ME: <hi>that am both the Light of the World, and the Power of God unto Salvation.</hi> Now certainly, the Eyes that were then blind, were not the Natural, but Spiritual Eyes of Men (and such must the Darkness and Light be also) blinded by the God of this World, who raigned in the Hearts of the Children of Disobedience: No Wonder then if the Light was not comprehended of the Darkness, and that blind People did not see the Light;<note place="marg1">John 1. 5.</note> but it plainly proves, <hi>That Light there was, though not seen.</hi> Now the Work of the Powerful Ministry of the Apostles
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105069:29"/>
was, <hi>To open the Blind or Dark Eye, which the God of the World had blinded, and then to turn them from that Darkness, to the Light;</hi> the Darkness was within, <hi>so must the Light have been;</hi> since the Illumination was there necessary, <hi>where the Darkness had been predominant;</hi> Consequently, <hi>The Way to be Translated from Satan's Power to God, to have Remission of Sins, and an Inheritance with them that are Sanctified, is, to be turned from the Darkness in the Heart, unto the Marvelous Light (that had long shined uncomprehended)</hi> to wit, <hi>the GOSPEL,</hi> which is called both the <hi>Light and Power of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same Apostle in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> is more express concerning the holy Nature and Efficacy of the<note place="marg1">Rom. 13. 12, 13, 14.</note> Light to Salvation, when he thus exhorts them; <hi>The Night is far spent, the Day is at hand; Let us therefore cast off the Works of Darkness, and put on the Armour of Light: Let us walk honestly as in the Day, not in Rioting and Drunkenness, not in Chambring and Wantonness, not in Strife and Envy; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the Flesh, to fulfill the Lusts thereof.</hi> From whence I shall briefly remark three Things, greatly to our Purpose, and the Truths Defence in this Matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is an absolute Opposition, <hi>betwixt Light and Darkness;</hi> as Darkness can only Vail the Light, from the Understandings of Men; <hi>So Light only can Discover and Dispel that Darkness.</hi> Or thus, <hi>That the Light Manifests and Condemns</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">2 Cor. 6. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>the Works of Darkness; for, what Communion hath Light with Darkness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That in the Light there is <hi>ARMOUR,</hi> which being put on, is able to Conquer the Darkness, and Secure the Soul, from the evil of it; otherwise it would be very strange, that the Apostle should exhort the People to put it on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That putting on the <hi>Armour</hi> of the Light, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Lord Jesus Christ (<hi>the Light of the World</hi>) are Synonimous, or one and the same thing; for it is for one and the same End, as may be observed from the Words, <hi>Let us put on the Armour of Light, and walk Honestly, as in the Day, not in Rioting and Drunkenness, not in Chambring and Wantonness, not in Strife and Envying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the Flesh, to fulfil the Lusts thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope then, Neither will it be disallow'd, that Christ
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105069:29"/>
is that Light, with which Men are Inlightned (but more of that anon) nor is that Light, Men are exhorted to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, <hi>a Naked and Insufficient, but a Searching, Expelling, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and Arming Light,</hi> against Darkness, and all its Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful Works, and consequently SAVING.</p>
               <p>Thus the Beloved Disciple testifies very emphatically, in his first Epistle, where he gives us a Relation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Mission: <hi>This then is the Message which we have</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">1 John 1. 5, 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>heard of him, and declare unto you; That God is Light, and in him is no Darkness at all; if we say, we have Fellowship with him, and walk in Darkness, we Lye, and do not the Truth; But if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have Fellowship one with another, and the Blood of Jesus Christ his Son clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth us from all Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a brief Stating of the whole Great Case of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: (1.) What God is; <hi>Light.</hi> (2.) Who can have no Fellowship with him; <hi>such as walk in Darkness</hi> (that is Sin.) (3.) Who have Fellowship with him; <hi>such as walk in the Light, as he is Light.</hi> (4.) the Reason why, is given; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such as walk in the Light,</hi> are there sure experimentally to feel <hi>the Vertue of Christ's Blood, to cleanse them from all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightcousness;</hi> Where observe, that the Light's leading out of Darkness, that is, <hi>Unrighteousness,</hi> is the same <hi>with the Blood of Jesus Christ cleansing from all Sin; Sin and Darkness, and to be cleansed from the one, and to be translated from the other, is equivalent;</hi> otherwise, a Man might be delivered from Darkness, and walk in the Light, <hi>and not be cleansed from Sin, which is that Darkness; a thing Absurd and Impossible:</hi> In short, they go together.</p>
               <p>By this 'tis evident, that the Light being walkt in, doth directly lead to God, and Fellowship with him, who is the Saving Light and Health of all Nations; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Light leads to Eternal Salvation.</p>
               <p>Many are the Denominations that are given in Scripture to one and the same Being, or Condition; Christ is called, <hi>The Word, the Light, the Saviour, Emanuel, a Rock, a Door, a Vine, a Shepherd, &amp;c.</hi> A State of Sin is sometimes called, <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Death, Disobedience, Barrenness, Rebellion, Stiff-necked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Eating of Sowr Grapes;</hi> And Wicked Men, <hi>Bryars, Thorns, Thistles, Tares, Dead Trees, Wolves, Goats, &amp;c.</hi> On the contrary, a State of Conversion, is sometimes expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, by such words, as, <hi>Purged, Refined, Washed, Cleansed,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105069:30"/>
Sanctified, Justified, Led by the Spirit, Baptized by one Spirit into one Body, Regenerated, Redeemed, Saved, Bought with a Price, &amp;c.</hi> And Persons so qualified, <hi>The Children of God, Children of Light, Heirs of Glory, Lambs, Sheep, Wheat;</hi> And that by which they become or continue thus, <hi>Light, Spirit, Fire, Sword, Hammer, Power, Grace, Seed, Truth, Way, Life, Blood, Water, Bread, Word, Unction,</hi> that leadeth into all Truth; All which respectively, is but one and the same in Nature: That is, <hi>Sin or a Sinful State is so variously denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the divers Operations and Discoveries of the Nature of it in Wicked Men.</hi> The like may be said of the several Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in Good and Holy Men, and so of that one Divine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>which so qualifies and preserves them;</hi> For as the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Saints felt the Operation of the One Holy Principle, so they denominated it: to men in Darkness, <hi>they call'd it Light;</hi> to such as believed and obeyed, <hi>It became a Leader;</hi> and those who witnessed their Sins conquer'd, their Lusts cut down, their Hearts broken, and their Souls Washed, Redeemed and daily Nourished, they called that <hi>Divine Principle, a Sword, Fire, Hammer, Water, Flesh, Blood, and Bread, and Seed of Life.</hi> In short, The same Heavenly <hi>Principle</hi> became <hi>Light, Wisdom, Power, Counsel, Redemption, Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Salvation</hi> unto those who believed in it: So that the Variety of Expressions in the Scriptures, must not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for so many distinct things in kind, no; nor sometimes in Operation. And indeed, notwithstanding that Light, <hi>T. Hicks</hi> would have lodg'd in the bare Scriptures, exclusive of the Spirit, all the Men of the World met together, would be confounded, <hi>to give a true Account of the Matter therein contained, if they were not Living Experimental Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi> For as he is not an Evidence sufficient in Laws Humane, that was not an Eye or Ear Witness; neither are they E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences for God and Christ, <hi>who are not Eye and Ear Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the</hi> Light, Spirit, Grace <hi>and</hi> Word of God <hi>in the Heart.</hi> And I boldly affirm, the Scriptures speak no more for such, as are not <hi>Inheritors</hi> of that Blessed Condition, they declare of in some Measure or other, <hi>then any Deed of Gift would do for a Person no wayes Nam'd or Interested therein.</hi> It is time then for <hi>T.

               <p>To which I shall give my Answer, both from Scripture, History and Reason.</p>
               <p n="1">The first Scripture I shall quote, is in the first of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis; So God created Man in his own Image, in the Image of God</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Gen. 1. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>created he him.</hi> From whence I draw this Argument, That if Man was made in God's Image, then because, <hi>God is Light,</hi> Adam <hi>must necessarily have had of the Divine Light in him, and have been the Image of that Light, so long as he walkt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in It:</hi> Since no man walks in the Light, but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Child of Light. And as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it, of such as were converted to that Light they had once erred from; <hi>Ye were Darkness, but now are ye Light in the Lord;</hi> That is, Through Obedience to the Light of the Lord. For any man then to say, <hi>Adam</hi> had not Light, were to suppose his Innocent State to be that of Darkness, and instead of, and being God's Image, who is, and ever was, and alwayes will be <hi>Light,</hi> he would have been wholy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of him, in whose Image he is said to have been created.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This <hi>Moses</hi> directed the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> to, when he in God's stead, recommended and earnestly pressed the keeping of the <hi>Commandment,</hi> and <hi>Word in the Heart;</hi> as we read in <hi>Deuteronomy. For this Commandment which I Command</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Deut. 30. 11. 12, 13, 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>thee this day, is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off: It is not in Heaven, that thou shouldst say, Who shall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it and do it? Neither is It beyond the Sea, that thou shouldst say, Who shall go over the Sea for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105069:31"/>
us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it and do it? But the Word is very nigh unto thee, in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart, that thou mayst do it. See, I have set before thee this day, Life and Good, and Death and Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence I cannot but observe these Three Things,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the <hi>Commandment,</hi> and the <hi>Word, are so called by way of Excellency and Preheminence, to all written Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Words.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That this <hi>Commandment</hi> or <hi>Word</hi> is <hi>Nigh, even in the Heart of Man it self:</hi> none need plead Distance or Ignorance.</item>
                  <item>3. That the Setting <hi>Life and Good, Death and Evil</hi> was and could only be in the <hi>Light</hi> within, <hi>since without the Light, how could they have Seen it Set before them:</hi> And that it was in their Hearts, the Lord so set those States before them, the Verse immediately follows that wherein the Word is by <hi>Moses</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentatively prov'd, as well as affirm'd to be in the Heart of Man. Now I hope, it shall not be injuriously done of me; and I know who will bear me out, if I say, This <hi>Commandment</hi> is that which <hi>David</hi> spoke of, when he said, <hi>The Commandment of the Lord is pure Inlightning the Eyes;</hi> and this Holy <hi>Word,</hi> the same with that <hi>Word,</hi> which he said, was a Lamp unto his Feet, and a Light unto his Path, and not an other <hi>Word,</hi> then what <hi>Paul</hi> call'd the Word of Faith, which he preach't, by which the Just live; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently a Saving <hi>Commandment, Word or Light</hi> it was, and is to such as Believe and Obey it.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="3">III. The next Scripture I will urge shall be this: <hi>For thou</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">2 Sam. 22. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>art my Lamp O Lord, for the Lord will Lighten my Darkness.</hi> Now if <hi>God</hi> was the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Lamp</hi> of that Day, to such as regarded the <hi>Light,</hi> cerainly then they had a <hi>Light and such an one as was Saving too;</hi> unless we should Blasphemously Deny, <hi>God to be either a Light, or a Saving One,</hi> who is most certainly both.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Wicked Men were not without Light to Condemn them, as Good Men ever had Light to Preserve them: <hi>They are of those that Rebel against the Light, they know not the</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Job 24. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Wayes thereof, nor abide in the Paths thereof,</hi> said <hi>Job.</hi> In which Passage it is very obvious, <hi>that Wicked Men have Light,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it would have been utterly Impossible for them, <hi>to have Rebell'd against it;</hi> Nay, <hi>against</hi> THE LIGHT, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, <hi>that it is the same Light in Nature, with that, which

                  <note place="marg1">Job 25. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>of his Army, and UPON WHOM DOTH NOT HIS LIGHT ARISE?</hi> Certainly, this Universality strongly pleads on the behalf of our Belief of the Light; And if our <hi>Adversary</hi> would but venture to let it come close to his Conscience, I cannot be so Uncharitable as to think he should not make some Acknowledgment to its Universality, antecedent to the Coming of Christ. I omit to say much of its Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness at that time (though one would think that <hi>Light</hi> alwayes gives to Discern a Good Way from a Bad one) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it to another place: Only I shall observe, how that <hi>Job</hi> expresly tells us, and that when he was in his deep Troubles of Spirit: <hi>O that I were as in Months past, in the</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Job 29. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Dayes when God preserved me, when his Candle shined upon my Head, and when by his Light I walked through Darkness;</hi> where it is most apparent, that <hi>Job attributes his Salvation from the Darkness</hi> (which stands both for <hi>Sin and Affliction) unto the Light, wherewith God had Inlightned him.</hi> And certainly, It had been utterly Impossible for those weighty things, that are deliver'd in that Book of <hi>Job,</hi> as well from others, as from <hi>Job,</hi> to have been known, had not they been Inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and received very great Discoveries from that Light and Candle of the Lord in their Hearts; For in all the whole Book I find not one Verse expresly cited out of any other Writings, but what purely proceeded from Immediate Impulse, and Inspiration of the Almighty, which sayes the same Book, gives Men Understanding.</p>
               <p n="5">V. To this Doctrine <hi>David</hi> was no Stranger, who so very often commemorates the Light, and the Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of it; some few places I shall mention of those many that I might offer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord is my Light and my Salvation, whom shall I fear? the</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Psal. 27. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord is the Strength of my Life, of whom shall I be afraid?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This weighty Passage of the <hi>Prophet</hi> is a lively Testimony to the True <hi>Light,</hi> wherein <hi>David</hi> confessed what <hi>John</hi> call'd his Evangelical Message, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>God</hi> is Light. Next, that not only God is <hi>Light,</hi> but which doubtless was most of all to his Comfort, HIS LIGHT; <hi>The Lord is</hi> MY <hi>Light, and</hi> MY <hi>Salvation:</hi> As much as if he had said, Because the Lord is become my Light, I have known him to be my Salvation, or him by whom my Salvation hath
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105069:32"/>
been wrought. In short thus, <hi>That God is My Salvation, as he is My Light; or, as I have Obey'd the Lord My Light, I have witnessed Salvation.</hi> O! that such Professors of Religion, in whom there is any Moderation, would but be pleas'd to weigh, <hi>What was</hi> David'<hi>s Light; What his Salvation;</hi> and <hi>Who must needs have been his Rule</hi> at that time of the World, of which he further speaks:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God is the Lord, who hath shewed us Light. Thy Word is a Lamp</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Psal. 118. 27 119. 105, 102.</note> 
                  <hi>unto my Feet, and a Light unto my Pathes. I have not departed from thy Judgments, for thou hast taught me.</hi> This made him far Wiser then his Teachers in the hidden Life and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of things, whereby <hi>David</hi> had long seen beyond all Types and Shaddows of the good Things to come, to the very Substance it self, from whence came his excellent Prophecies: agreeing with that passage, <hi>The Path of the</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Prov. 4. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Just is as the shining Light, that shines more and more unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Day, said the wise Man.</hi> This strongly implies, that <hi>David,</hi> and not he alone, but the Just of all Ages, were attended with the Discoveries and Leadings of a Divine Light; which as obey'd, did <hi>make Just,</hi> and alwayes lead in the Way of Salvation: <hi>unless the Just Way was not the Saving Way;</hi> and if it was, certainly it is still: for it is the <hi>Lord himself,</hi> whom in <hi>Samuel's</hi> History, he is recorded also to have called a <hi>Lamp,</hi> as he here doth the <hi>Word,</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> said, <hi>was nigh in the Heart,</hi> that Men should obey it and do it. <hi>This was the Word of Reconciliation in every Generation, whose Holy Water washed their Consciences from Sin, who heard, andobey'd it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, that this <hi>Light</hi> was not confin'd to <hi>David,</hi> or such Good Men, take these two Passages.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105069:33"/>
is expresly confirmed in that notable passage of the Prophet, <hi>For Lo! He that treadeth the Mountains, and cleareth the Wind,</hi>

                  <hi>whither shall I flee from thy Presence?</hi> which plainly shows to us, that the Spirit of the Lord, and his Presence was every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>and that as Light, discovering Darkness with respect to Mankind:</hi> For the Question was not, whether God by his Spirit was not every-where, for that our Adversaries grant, <hi>or he could not be God?</hi> But whether it was possible for <hi>David</hi> to withdraw himself into any place, <hi>where his Mind could not be sensible of the Eternal Spirit and Immediate Presence of God</hi> (who is Light it self) <hi>either as a Reprover, Exhorter, or Informer;</hi> as the foregoing Words intimate? <hi>O Lord thou hast searched me, and known me,</hi> — <hi>Thou understandest my</hi>

                  <hi>Thoughts afar off</hi> — <hi>Thou art acquainted with all my Wayes.</hi> Which however God might know them, it stands firm, <hi>that</hi> David <hi>could never have known God so as to see and behold them, but from that Light and Spirit of which he sayes in the</hi> 7th vers. <hi>following</hi> (which I have already cited) <hi>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?</hi> In short, it must needs be evident, to all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd Readers, <hi>that</hi> David <hi>had this Light within, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God present with him,</hi> as a <hi>Reprover, Informer, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,</hi> since it was impossible for him to be any-where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.

               <p>I might here to sub-joyn the Account we have of the great Illumination of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> clear Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the same, which they could never have done, with that Seriousness and Conviction, but from some glimps of the same Divine Light; but that I

shall pass over with several Passages of other of the lesser <hi>Prophets;</hi> and conclude this Scripture Proof of the Gift of the Light and Spirit, antecedent to Christ's coming in the Flesh; and from <hi>Stephen's</hi> Testimony, <hi>Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, as saith the Prophet: Heaven is my Throne, and Earth is my Footstool, what House will</hi>

have said in reference to a</hi> Saving Light <hi>or</hi> Spirit, <hi>universally bestow'd upon the</hi> Jews, <hi>THAT WERE A DISTINCT PEOPLE from the rest of the World, under very many peculiar Rights; yet cannot we think it good Arguing, to infer the Gifts of God's</hi> Light <hi>and</hi> Spirit <hi>to the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>that make far the greatest part thereof; from these Scriptures, that only seem to prove it the Priviledg of the</hi> Jews.</p>
               <p>To which I Answer, That I conceive I have urg'd those Scriptures already, that afford a plain Conviction, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement of the Truth of that general Inference; but because I am desirous from my very Soul, in perfect Love to theirs, that shall read this Discourse, of removing what Objection I am able to fore-see it may meet with, after it shall have past my hand, I will endeavour to make appear, first from SCRIPTURE, and next from the Best Account we have of the DOCTRINES and LIVES of HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THENS, and lastly from REASON; <hi>That God's Love in the Illumination of his Spirit or Gift of a Measure of his Divine and Saving Light was Universal;</hi> or <hi>that Mankind was</hi> (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently is) <hi>antecedently to Christ's Coming in the Flesh, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with such a Measure of Light, as was Saving in it self: And to all such, as received the Light, and obeyed it, in the Love of it.</hi> In order to this, I shall briefly insist on a few Scriptures, some of which have been already quoted, though not so directly to this Matter.</p>

               <p n="4">IV. Thus much these two <hi>Notable Parables</hi> teach us of the <hi>Sower,</hi> and the <hi>Lord that gave his Servants Talents.</hi> They who believe Scripture, must acknowledge them to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent God's Dealings with Mankind, in reference to <hi>Gift, Duty</hi> and <hi>Reward.</hi> Observe the first Parable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The same Day went</hi> Jesus <hi>out of the House, and sate by the Sea</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Mat. 13. 1, <hi>to</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>side; And great Multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a Ship, and sate, and the whole Multitude stood on the Shore. And he spoke many things unto them in Parables, saying, Behold,</hi> A SOWER WENT FORTH TO SOW, <hi>and when he sowed,</hi> some Seeds fell by the Way side, <hi>and the Fowls came, and devour'd them up;</hi> Some fell upon Stony places, where they had not much Earth, <hi>and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no Deepness on Earth, and when the Sun was up, they were scorched, and because they had not Root, they wither'd away; and</hi> some fell among Thorns, <hi>and the Thorns sprung up and choack'd them; But</hi> other fell in Good Ground, and <hi>brought forth Fruit;</hi> some <hi>an Hundred-fold,</hi> some <hi>Sixty-fold,</hi> some <hi>Thirty-fold.</hi> Who has Ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
               <p>It is granted by all that I know of, that the <hi>Seeds-Man</hi> is <hi>God;</hi> the Scripture saith, the <hi>Seed</hi> is the <hi>Word of the Kingdom,</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Vers. 19.</note> which must needs be the Spiritual Word nigh in the Heart, suitable to the Heavenly Kingdom Christ said, was within, other-wise call'd <hi>Light,</hi> that is said <hi>to be sown for the Righteous;</hi> or the <hi>Grace, that appeares unto all-Men, and brings Salvation to them that are taught by it:</hi> And lastly, common Sense tells us, <hi>that the several Grounds comprehend Mankind;</hi> for they must either include the <hi>Bad</hi> with the <hi>Good,</hi> or the <hi>Good only</hi> must be benefited: But the very Scripture expresly distinguisheth betwixt the Good and Bad Ground, <hi>yet affirms the one to have been sown with the Seed as well as the other;</hi> Therefore <hi>Gods Gift is Universal,</hi> however Men by Wicked Works may have render'd their Hearts <hi>Stony, Thorny,</hi> or otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and uncapable of bringing forth Fruit.</p>
               <p>The other Parable is also very weighty, and much to our purpose: <hi>For the Kingdom of Heaven is as a Man travelling</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105069:37"/>
Two, and to another One,</hi> to every Man according to his several ability, <hi>and straight-way took his Journey. Then he that had received Five Talents, went and traded with the same,</hi> and made them other Five Talents; <hi>and likewise he, that had received Two,</hi> he also gained other Two; <hi>But he that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived One,</hi> went and digged in the Earth, and hid his Lord's Money. <hi>After a long time, the Lord of those Servants cometh and Reckoneth with them:</hi> And so <hi>he that had received</hi> Five Talents <hi>came and brought other Five Talents,</hi> saying, <hi>Lord, Thou deliveredst unto me Five Talents, Behold, I have gained besides them Five Talents more. His Lord said unto him;</hi> Well done thou Good and Faithful Servant, thou hast been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over a few things, I will make thee Ruler over many things, Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord. <hi>He also that received</hi> Two Talents, <hi>came and</hi> said, <hi>Lord, Thou deliveredst unto me Two Talents, Behold, I have gain'd Two other Talents besides them, His Lord said unto him;</hi> Well done Good and Faithful Servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee Ruler over many things, Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord. <hi>Then he which had received</hi> One Talent, <hi>came and</hi> said, <hi>Lord, I knew thee,</hi> that thou art an hard Man, Reaping where thou hast not sown, and Gathering where thou hast not strawed; <hi>and I was afraid, and went and hid thy Talent in the Earth: Lo, there thou hast that which is thine. His Lord answer'd, and said unto him,</hi> Thou Wicked and Slothful Servant, thou knewest that I Reap where I sowed not, and Gather where I have not strawed, Thou oughtest therefore to have put my Money to the <hi>Exchangers,</hi> and then at my Coming I should have received mine Own with Usury: <hi>Take therefore the Talent from him, and give it unto him which has Ten Talents; For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have Abundance, but from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he hath:</hi> And cast ye the Unprofitable Servant into utter Darkness, <hi>there shall be Weeping, and Gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of Teeth, when the Son of Man shall come in his Glory, and all the Holy Angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the Throne of his Glory, and before Him shall be gather'd all Nations, and He shall separate them one from another, as a Shepherd divideth his</hi> Sheep from the Goats, <hi>and He shall set the</hi> Sheep on his Right Hand, <hi>but the</hi> Goats on the Left.</p>
               <p>Serious <hi>Reader,</hi> I have the rather repeated the Scripture at large, because of that great Strength it carries, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, to the Conviction, at least Confusion of that Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105069:38"/>
Spirit, which confines the infinite Goodness of God, and renders him, whilst he is an Universal Creator, <hi>but a particular Benefactor, shutting up his Gifts within the straight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of a FEW;</hi> representing him thereby, as partial, <hi>as some Parents, who they know not for what, beside their own unequal Wills, do frequently bestow their Favour (indeed the whole of their Affection) upon an Elected Dareling, to the manifest, though cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Neglect of the rest.</hi> But to speak the Truth of the matter, the Over-fondness some bear to their own Opinions, joyn'd with the Envy raised towards those who conform not to them, <hi>has so emptied them of all natural Affection, that looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in that condition they dare to think him as unnatural as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi> For my part, I have not a great while believ'd, but that it rather rise from an Unwillingness in some, that Dissenters from them should be saved (thereby endeavouring a Compliance upon Necessity) <hi>then that God had not been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious unto all his Creatures.</hi> For who sees not, who can or will see, that <hi>God is this Soveraign Lord, that he made Mankind to be his Servants, that these Three are representative of the whole, and to the End they might not be Unprofitable Ones, that he gave them Talents to improve against his Return,</hi> that is, <hi>against the Day of Recompence; for which they are accountable, that who improve their Talents may be rewarded, and they who make no improvement of their Talents, may be punisht with Eternal Separation from the Presence of God, and all his Holy Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will conclude with these Five Observations:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That God</hi> (though it be his Soveraign Prerogative, <hi>what he will give) has given a Talent out of his Celestial Treasury unto every Man and Woman.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That this <hi>Talent is in it self Sufficient;</hi> but as the best <hi>Corn, so this Talent, put up into a Napkin, must needs be Unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable;</hi> yet, that the Fault is in the Party Neglecting or Hiding of it, not in it self.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>That those who improve not their Talent, are most apt to charge God with Reaping where he Sows not,</hi> as do those Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors we have to do with; <hi>who make God to require an Account of all,</hi> and yet deny, in order to rendring up this Account with Joy, <hi>that he has given all a Talent Sufficient thereunto.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. That the <hi>Eternal Estate of Men and Women, as Sheep and Goats, purely depends upon their Improving, or not Improving of that Heavenly Talent wherewith God has indu'd them.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Lastly, Neither is there any <hi>Shelter</hi> for these <hi>Parsimonious Men,</hi> or their <hi>Hide-bound Faith,</hi> under the Inequality of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105069:39"/>
Number of the Talents; for it is not, how many Talents are given, <hi>but what Improvement is made of what is given:</hi> Wherefore greater is his Reward, <hi>who makes one Talent Three,</hi> then his who of Ten, <hi>advances but to Fifteen;</hi> since the one makes but Half, whilst the other makes Treble Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. <hi>Blessed therefore are you all, and will you assuredly be in the Day of the Lord's Recompence, who disregarding the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, Pleasures, Cares and Fleshly Religions of the World, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently mind your own Talent, and are in the Pure Wisdom and Holy Counsel of the Lord, making your daily Improvement of the same, laying up Treasure in the High and Heavenly Place, that is Durable and Everlasting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. This reasonable Truth is yet further manifest, from the weighty Words of our Lord Jesus Christ; <hi>For every one that</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">John 3. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>doth Evil hateth the Light, neither comes to the Light, lest his Deeds should be reproved:</hi> To which I would add that of the Apostle, <hi>Whatsoever is reproved is made manifest by the Light.</hi> Certainly<note place="marg1">Ephes. 5. 13.</note> then, unless Men will be so Unjust to God, as to think (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture and Reason) <hi>He should let Millions of Men, and Scores of Generations live in Sin, without a Light to shew it them, or a Law to limit them;</hi> it must be yielded, <hi>that they had Light and Law in their Hearts and Consciences,</hi> by which they were Convicted of Sin; and such, as obey'd it, led to work Righteousness, <hi>since their Refusing to bring their Deeds to the Light, was not an Act of Ignorance, but Design; because they knew their Deeds would be Condemn'd, and they for them;</hi> which loudly asserts, <hi>that they both had a Light, and knew they had it,</hi> though they Rebell'd against it. And if I should grant, that whatever was reproveable, was not made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest unto them; <hi>yet this will no wayes hinder the Capacity of the Light to do it.</hi> 'Tis evident, <hi>That some things which the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles <hi>did, were reprov'd, therefore they had the Light:</hi> And if they had it not in all the Extent of its Revelation, the Light was no more to be blamed, then that Guide, whose Passengers therefore could not arrive at their Journey's End, <hi>because they never would begin, at least proceed.</hi> Had the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> been Faithful to what they had of God in themselves, <hi>and not been blinded by the Vain Idolatries and Superstitious Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of their Fathers, they had more fully known and learn'd the Mind and Will of their Creator;</hi> which some of those <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> notwithstanding did, as will yet further appear.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:105069:40"/>VI. Thus the <hi>Apostle Paul</hi> teaches us to believe, in that remarkable Passage of his in the first Chapter to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: For I am not Asham'd of the Gospel of Christ: For it is</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Rom. 1. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>the, Power of God unto Salvation, to every one that believeth, to the</hi> Jew <hi>first, and also to the</hi> Greek. <hi>For therein is the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God reveal'd from Heaven against all Ungodliness and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness of Men, who hold the Truth in Unrighteousness.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath shewed it unto them. <hi>For the Invisible Things of Him from the Creation of the World are clearly seen, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by the Things that are made, even his Eternal Power and God-head, so that they are without Excuse; because that when they knew God,</hi> they Glorified him not as God, <hi>neither were Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but became Vain in their Imaginations, and their Foolish Hearts were Darken'd. And even as</hi> they did not like to Retain God in their Knowledge, <hi>God gave them over to a Reprobate Mind, to do those things which are not Convenient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Notable Lines of that Great Apostle, give an apparent Overthrow to all Objections against, <hi>either the Universality or Sufficiency of the Light within;</hi> which will be further manifest, if the Reader be but pleas'd to observe these few Particulars. (1.) That in the Gospel of Christ <hi>is the Righteousness of God revealed, and that from Faith to Faith.</hi> (2.) That <hi>this Faith the Just have ever lived by,</hi> for he quotes a Time past, <hi>as it is written,</hi> which Writing was about 700. Years before he wrot that Epistle. (3.) That <hi>many had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from the Righteousness of God,</hi> to wit, the Gentiles, <hi>into Ungodliness,</hi> against which the Wrath of God was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Heaven. (4.) <hi>That they however, once knew the Truth.</hi> (5.) <hi>That they came to the Knowledge of this Truth from the Manifestation of God</hi> (who is Light) <hi>within; since what might be known of God was manifested in them, because God had shewed it unto them.</hi> (6.) That the Cause of their after Darkness, <hi>was their Rebelling against that Manifestation or Light, not Glorifying the God that shewed it to them, when they both saw it, and knew him so to do.</hi> Consequently, that God had given them Light Sufficient, <hi>both to know and obey him.</hi> And since <hi>they liked not to retain God in their Knowledge,</hi> the Deficiency was theirs, <hi>and not the Light's.</hi> (7.) If therefore their foolish Hearts were darkned, that is, by Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it follows, <hi>that therefore that Darkness came by Sin into their Hearts,</hi> they <hi>had Light in their Hearts, or a Light
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105069:40"/>
within.</hi> 8) Lastly, If the Wrath was therefore revealed, <hi>because the hold the Truth in Unrighteousness,</hi> and when they knew God by that Manifestation of Light within, <hi>they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified him not as God, but became vain in their Imaginations, and their foolish Hearts darkned;</hi> Then certainly, had they kept to that Principle, call'd the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God within,</hi> and preserv'd their <hi>Faith in God,</hi> as he had reveal'd himself to them; <hi>So glorifying him as God,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting to retain him in their knowledge;</hi> Not Wrath, <hi>but Mercy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Upon which I query, whether this amounts not to as much as what the Scriptures teach, and these here inserted tell you; <hi>That the Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of Wisdom, and to depart from Iniquity a Good Understanding?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But further, to the same Purpose; <q>A Wise Man<note place="marg1">Id.</note> is <hi>Innocent.</hi> — A Wise Man is <hi>Free;</hi> Wicked<note place="marg2">Psal. 111. 9, 10.</note> Men are <hi>Slaves.</hi> — Again, A Wise Man is<note place="marg1">Cic. Parad.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Whereby it is evident, <hi>that the Wisdom they meant was Vertue, in Opposition to Vice,</hi> which they esteemed <hi>Folly,</hi> as doth the Scripture frequently; as much as to say, those who are thus Good, <hi>are only Wise.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>

by a Life excelling theirs in Vertue and Self-Denyal.

               <p>For this let all know, that far greater were the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> were blessed with, then those of the Ancient <hi>Gentiles.</hi> God gave the <hi>Jews</hi> what the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had, but he was not pleas'd to endow the <hi>Gentiles, with all that he freely bestowed upon the</hi> Jews: Yet that he gave them what was sufficient to Godliness is altogether as certain; For the Difference lay not in the Root of the Matter, but only in some Extraordinary Helps, and several visible Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, Figurative of a further Glory.</p>
               <p>The Word nigh in the Heart (of which <hi>Moses</hi> testified) was not the only Priviledge of the <hi>Jew,</hi> but of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> also.

there might be some <hi>Self-Mixtures</hi> from Temper, Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or otherwise; yet I will also boldly affirm, that as the Light they had was sufficient in it self to their Salvation (of which their Life and Doctrine are a notable Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration) so they had some of them a glimmering Prospect and bold Belief of as high a State of Purity, Glory and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, as Man's Nature is well capable of attaining to.

                  <p>A great Objection stated; Answered. The Light both Law and Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, not in the same Discovery; but in it self. A Way to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the seeming Difference about it. The Light still defended.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt because I am yet to expect Doubters about the <hi>Light,</hi> who rather strive how to oppose it by their Notions, then believe and obey it.

                  <note place="marg1">Objection.</note> 
                  <hi>Law in the Conscience, answering to the First Covenant; For here is scarce any mention made of Christ in this long Discourse; and if this Light were Christ, as is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by you</hi> Quakers, <hi>then how comes it, that he was not so called of Old by the</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Greeks? <hi>and why typified out to come, when he was come before, and whilst typified? And further, In what Sense can he be understood to bear our Iniquities, and Men and Women to be saved by his Blood, if this</hi> Light <hi>be the</hi> Saviour, Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah, Christ, &amp;c. <hi>as you believe, and endeavour to maintain now in the World?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:105069:66"/>This <hi>Objection,</hi> I suppose, the <hi>Reader</hi> will allow to be the most weighty made against our Principle, and that I have dealt more fairly by our <hi>Adversaries</hi> (especially by that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just and Malicious Man <hi>T.

To all which I thus answer, in the Fear of God &amp; Spirit of Moderation. The Objection consists mainly of these Four Parts; The First, relating to the <hi>Light's being but the Law, not the Gospel.</hi> The Second, to the <hi>Light's never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called Christ by</hi> Jews <hi>or</hi> Greeks. The Third, to <hi>Christ's being typified, and yet in Being at the same time.</hi> The Fourth, to <hi>Christ's Blood, the Bearing our Sins, and which way this could be appropriated to the Light, and not do Injury to the Holy Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First then, I shall answer to that Part of the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which concerns the <hi>Light's being but, or no more then the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do thus far agree, That the Light is the Law; but that it is not therefore in any sense the Gospel, I also deny, yet not in that Capacity wherein it is the Law; for as in that state it cannot justifie, so it would be to say, <hi>it is the Law, and it is not the Law.</hi> I say then, that the Light may be both, in reference to a two-fold Manifestation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where there is no Law there is no Transgression.</hi> It might as well have been said (since they themselves confess it to be the Law) <hi>That where there is no Light, there is no Transgression;</hi> and the rather, because whatever is reproved, or Sinful, <hi>is made manifest by the Light;</hi> therefore, since all have transgrest, all have Light, and ever had: In this State then it is a Law, which justifies none; for whoever is in that which is reproveable, is under Condemnation from the Law, or the Reproving Act of the Light. But again, Such as by unfeigned Repentance come to turn unto the Light, they are herein justified in a two-fold Sense (and I so speak for the sake of the Simple, beguiled by a wrong Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Word) First, In that God acquits for his Name's sake, <hi>who is Merciful, Pardoning Iniquity, Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression and Sin, all that Repent with Unfeigned Repentance.</hi> Secondly, In that he accepts upon the Renewal and Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The outward Sun is the Cause of the early Dawnings, and is at that very time in it self the same Glorious Body of Light, as when in the <hi>Meridian;</hi> but if Men either through Natural Weakness, or the many Fogs and Mists of <hi>Tradition, Education, Ignorance or Prejudice suffer an Eclipse,</hi> they must not blame the Light, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. He that follows the Light, <hi>which was ever the Just Man's Path,</hi> shall meet with Blessedness at the End of his Travels; But such as let the World of Wickedness get between, are over-taken with Night. <hi>Abraham</hi> saw Christ's Day; What Day? The Dispensation of Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as Heir of all things, the Day of perfect Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which he could never have done, had he not had Light, by which to have seen it. So several of those Holy <hi>Ancients</hi> obtain'd a Degree above many, and arriv'd at a Growth, yea, the Benefit and Enjoyment of a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, that was not general, through the Weakness of the Age: Such really saw beyond the <hi>Offerings, Types, Figures</hi> and <hi>Shaddows,</hi> to a State more <hi>Inward, Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Substantial,</hi> by taking good heed to the Heavenly Light. And this was the End of all External Administrations, to drive the Creature in, &amp; point out unto it some more hidden Mystery that Man's Wandering from God had caus'd him to neglect; yet still was Christ, the Word. God, a saving Light in that State. And the Light of the Law was as a <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Master,</hi> that led such as diligently obeyed it, to that more excellent Discovery of the same Light, which is now called the Gospel, or Glad-tidings, as certainly it was and is, after so Black and Cold a Season, as hath tediously over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105069:67"/>
the Heavens, to have that Sun of Righteousness ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in that Body, prepared and anointed for that Purpose, in a transcendent Manner to all former Manifestations of Himself. Thus it was that such as had liv'd up most faithfully to the Law of God, or Light of that Dispensation, gladly received Christ, believed in him, became his Followers, and the Companions of his Sufferings; so that he, who was the Light of the Law, is also the Light of the Gospel, though not in one and the same Degree of Discovery, as the Light is not one in Condemning and Justifying, though it be one in it self; nor in the Degree and Growth of little Children, young Men and Fathers, yet one Pure, Eternal, Unalterable Light of Life and Righteousness in it self. If therefore it doth the Office of the Law in any, to be sure such one is yet under a State of Condemnation for Evil, and he is not yet come to know the fulfilling of the Law, as becometh every Follower of Christ, yea, every one that would come to Christ. Christ indeed fulfils the Law for us; but how? The Light in us, as we are subject to it, and led by it, administers an Holy Power, by which we are enabled to do that which is Good and Acceptable in the Sight of the Lord; and so obeying the Light, we fulfil the Law: Thus he works his Works in us and for us. And so far was Christ from Dis-ingaging his Followers from an indispensible Necessity of keeping the Law, as outwardly ingraven on Stones, that he set them a far harder Task, by how much it is more easie to restrain from Acting then Thinking. <hi>Thou shalt not Commit Adultery, saith that Dispensation of</hi> Moses; Whosoever looks on a Woman, to lust after her, hath committed Adultery al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready with her in his Heart, <hi>saith that more Excellent Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Mat. 5. 27. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>of Christ.</hi> Certainly then those Men, who fancy themselves upon the easie Terms of being excluded the Fulfilling of the Law, or Performing good Works, as a Condition to Justification, must basely abuse themselves, and dangerously adventure the Well-being of their own Souls. In short, He was the <hi>True Light,</hi> who said, <hi>He that looks upon a Woman to lust after her, has committed Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with her already in his Heart:</hi> But so was he also that said of old by <hi>Moses, Thou shalt not commit Adultery; Therefore should we conclude two Lights, and not rather two several Manifestations, or gradual Discoveries of the self-same Eternal Light?</hi>

                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:105069:68"/>To conclude, The <hi>Law</hi> (as I may say) <hi>is the Gospel begun, and the Gospel is the Law finished; He that would be justified must first be condemned, and who would be healed, must first be wounded: The Law is as the Sword, the Gospel as Balm; The one Duty, the other Love.</hi> And that which alone is needful to attain unto the highest Discovery, is, to be humbly subject, and constantly obedient to the lowest Appearance of it: <hi>The faithful Servant becomes a Son by Adoption.</hi> Wouldst thou know the <hi>Word a Reconciler,</hi> thou must first witness it an <hi>Hammer, Sword, Fire, &amp;c.</hi> The Way to arrive at <hi>Evangelical Righteousness,</hi> is first to perform <hi>the Righteousness of the Law:</hi> By Law, I mean not that <hi>of Ceremonies, or the External Order of the Jews; but</hi> that <hi>Moral &amp; Eternal Law,</hi> which is said to have come by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and is accomplisht by Christ. And there is great Hopes, that who Conscientiously keeps the Beginning, will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass the End. <hi>Such as have Conquer'd bad Doing, if they be faithful in what they have received of God's Light and Spirit it will inable them against bad Saying, till at last they overcome evil Thinking too;</hi> and witness that Scripture fulfilled; Judgment (the Law) <hi>is brought forth into Victory</hi> (the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel) <hi>He that follows me</hi> (the Light of the World that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens all Men coming into the World) <hi>shall not abide in Darkness, but shall have the Light of Life.</hi> I make not this Distinction of Law and Gospel to distinguish in Kind, but Degree, and for the sake of the Weak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to it. And if the Son make you free, then are you free indeed: For as it is a Condemner it may be called the Light that brings Death, in that it slays by the Brightness of it's coming into the Conscience, the transgressing Nature; like unto that Expression the Day of the Lord is a Day of Darkness, because of the Judgments and Terrors of the Lord for Sin; But to the Obedient it is the Light of Life.</p>
               <p>Thus is Christ as the Word-God, and Light of the World through every Dispensation, <hi>ONE in himself,</hi> though to Mankind he has variously appeared, <hi>not by Differing Lights,</hi> but Manifestations only, <hi>of one and the same Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Light of Life and Righteousness.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Second Part of the Objection, that Christ was not anciently called the Light; Answered. And the Contrary proved from Scripture and Reason.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO the Second Part of the Objection, <hi>If the Light in every Man were Christ, how comes it that the</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Greeks <hi>never called it so?</hi> I answer, We do not say, that the <hi>Light</hi> in every Man is <hi>Christ,</hi> but <hi>of Christ;</hi> He is that Fulness from whence all receive a Measure of Divine Light and Knowledge; but not that every Individual has the whole or compleat Christ in him; such an Absurdity never fell from us, nor our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, though the Malice of our <hi>Adversaries</hi> hath char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it upon both. But as the External Sun darts its Light upon the Organ of the Eye of the Body, by which it conveyes true Discerning to act, how, in and about Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibles; so doth the Internal Sun of Righteousness shine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Eye of the Soul, giving it the Knowledge of those invisible Things, which properly relate to the Nature of the Soul; So that we are the less oblieged to give a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why others called not the Light in Man, <hi>Christ, since we renounce all Share in such Belief our selves:</hi> Which is Answer enough to <hi>T. H</hi>'s dis-ingenuous Inference, that because <hi>G. W.</hi> affirmed, the Light, with which Mankind was inlightned, was God, therefore sayes <hi>T. H. Every Man his whole God in him,</hi> or to that Purpose, p. 5, 6. Yet thus far I will tell those Men, that <hi>Christ</hi> was called <hi>Light,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever he was in the World, though not before he was Christ. <hi>I will give him for a Light to lighten the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if any will say, that this Light was not Christ, let them tell us so in plain words: But if it will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, then <hi>T. Hicks</hi> had best ask, why the Prophet by the Holy Ghost should call <hi>Christ, Light,</hi> even as soon, if not before he was called <hi>Christ;</hi> and why in <hi>that very State, in which he was called Christ, he should be called Light.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is then, that by <hi>Him, the Light,</hi> we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>Christ,</hi> which is one and the same thing, as if he had said, I will give Christ for a Light to enlighten the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:105069:69"/>
or, <hi>who is the Christ, is the Light;</hi> or, <hi>the Light is Christ:</hi> So that it will follow, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by Christ, which is the Whole of what we understand by our Assertion, as to the Light in Man.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>John</hi> expresly calls that Light with which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man is inlightned, the Word; and the Word is said to have taken Flesh: If then he that took Flesh <hi>was Christ,</hi> and consequently that Body, <hi>Christ's Body only,</hi> as none, I think, will dare deny, but <hi>Muggleton,</hi> and his Credulous Followers, it will follow, <hi>That Christ, who took, or appeared in that prepared Body, is the Light, with which every Man is inlightned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, Christ himself sayes, I am the Light of the World; which is as much as if he had said, <hi>I have inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the World:</hi> therefore the <hi>Light,</hi> which shines in the Hearts of Mankind <hi>is Christ,</hi> though, <hi>not every particular Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination</hi> the entire Christ; for so there would be as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Christs, which were Absurd and Blasphemous.</p>
               <p>But Lastly the Apostle himself calls him Christ before his Coming in the Flesh; or that Christ was Christ before his Appearance in that Body at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which clears that Point in Controversie: for the Stress of <hi>T. Hicks</hi>'s Objection, as to this Particular, lies here, <hi>Christ, as Christ, was not before he took Flesh;</hi> therefore though I should grant (might he say, and he doth say as much) <hi>that as the Word-God all are inlightened by him,</hi> yet, sayes he, <hi>not as he is Christ before that visible Appearance:</hi> One would think he were a very <hi>Socinian</hi> by his Arguing; not that I write so in Slight, Abuse or Reflection; but if Christ was not before, then the Manhood, that was taken in time, must be the Christ; and what should materially hinder their Conjunction I know not? But I would fain know his Reason for it, if it be Lawful to expect what I fear he has not to give; however, if he darest, he would give you his Interest in lieu of a Reason for his so holding, but that I shall do for him, and with Impartial Minds it will be a Reason against him. The <hi>Dilemma</hi> in short is this, If he denies Christ to have been <hi>Christ</hi> before that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, he <hi>thwarts as plain a Text as the Scriptures have;</hi> and if he should allow of it, <hi>his whole Fabrick</hi> (now a Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, he thinks) <hi>would fall like a rotten House about his Ears.</hi> Well, but I will tell him, and all concern'd, for his base Opposition, That since Christ, as the Word-God,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105069:69"/>
hath illuminated all Men antecedent to his Coming in the Flesh, as confesses <hi>T.H. J.G. J.F.</hi> and many more of them, &amp; that the Apostle says, that the Word was Christ, or Christ was before he came in the Flesh; for Christ was in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness a Rock to <hi>Israel,</hi> unless Christ and the Word are two distinct Beings, or that there be two distinct Christs: Christ was that Light, with which Mankind was illuminated, or that Light, Mankind was inlightned with, was the very Christ, and consequently, <hi>the Light has been called both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly and implicitly Christ before that visible Appearance at</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem. Nor is the Allegation of that Scripture perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the Matter in hand (viz.) <hi>Which none of the Princes of this World knew, &amp;c.</hi> brought by <hi>T. H.</hi> for that was spoken in reference to the Wisdom which had been hid, and not the meer Manhood of Christ; But suppose it had deeply concern'd it, we have this to say, that such as rejected, much more those that crucified him in his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearance, had first despised and slain him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>They were of those who Rebel against the Light, and Love not the Wayes thereof.</hi> And I affirm against all Opposers, that it was by that Sight the Light within gave to <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Peter, Nathanael,</hi> and all others, who believed in him, that they Confessed him, and Suffered for him; such as had not so Out-sinned their Day, Defiled their Conscience, Clouded their Understandings, and Hardned their Hearts, as others by Wicked Works had done; but through the Light of the Lord, had in good measure kept their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences void of Offence, they received and imbraced him. The Light knew its own; The Lesser led to the Greater, and the Greater Light as naturally attracted the Lesser, as we may see Fire do every day. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Particular, let me add, that they were not the Princes of this World that put him outwardly to Death; for it came by the Envious Accusations and most Invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Suggestions of the <hi>Jews</hi> (a Broken Conquered People) to <hi>Pilate,</hi> but Governour of a Province; therefore, since I believe what the Apostle saith to be true, I have rather Reason to infer, that it was meant of Christ Mystically, then of that Visible Body. However it be, that part of our <hi>Adversaries</hi> Objection about the <hi>Light's not being call'd Christ, antecedent to his Coming in the Flesh,</hi> can be of no Weight to the Matter under Debate, since we have so evidently made the Contrary appear.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Third Part of the Objection; If <hi>Christ</hi> was enjoyed under the <hi>Law,</hi> as he was, if the <hi>Light</hi> be <hi>Christ;</hi> why was he Typified? Is proved of no Force. The <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Anti-type</hi> in some Respects may be at one and the same time; this is proved by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Our <hi>Adversaries</hi> Oppostion and Cavil Weak and Insuccessful.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Third Part of the Objection, and what seems at first sight to carry something of moment against us, is this; <hi>If the Light Within be Christ, and the</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles <hi>had it from the beginning of the World, how can Christ be said to be typified out, as not come, and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied of to come, when by your own Principle he has been alwayes come?</hi> I answer, This part of the Objection is in some respect built upon the same Mistake as was the second, namely, that the Light within is intirely Christ; concerning which I have plainly and truly exprest my self before; I will therefore faithfully state the Question for them thus: <hi>Well, but still you say, Christ inlightned</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that visible Coming; if so, then was he come by your own Principle, whilst his very Coming was typified out, and Prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of: Doth not this seem a Contradiction?</hi> But to this I say, that the supposed Contradiction ariseth from the Mistake of the Dispensations; for it takes for granted, that there was no Difference in the Degree of Illumination before, and at the Coming of Christ after that visible Manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, which all must needs confess: For as I would be understood, when I call the Light before, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ's Coming in the Flesh, <hi>Light,</hi> to mean but one and the self-same Light in Nature; <hi>So let none apprehend, that we make not a Difference by the Acknowledgment of a more eminent Manifestation of the same Light.</hi> What follows then? Why thus much most clearly, <hi>That under the Enjoyment of the Lesser Manifestation of Light, suited to the then Childish State of the</hi> Jews, <hi>God was pleased to allure them after an Expectation of, at least a Belief in higher things, by Types and Prophecyes of that far more Excellent and Exceeding Glorious Dispensation of the Light and Love of God in after Ages.</hi> The End of God's gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Israelites</hi> that outward Prophet and Leader <hi>Moses</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:105069:70"/>
was, to bring to the Inward, which though they through Carnality and Weakness were not then sensible of him, so as to stay their Minds upon him, yet <hi>Moses</hi> prophesied of him; and all the External Dealings have been with respect to bring to the Seed within, which is able to bruise the Serpent's Head, and did so in some measure through all Ages. So that in good Reason and Truth may we assert, <hi>Christ</hi> the Light, <hi>was the Rock that follow'd</hi> Israel <hi>in the Wilderness</hi> (who is the Rock of Ages, and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Generations, who ever enlightned all Mankind, the same yesterday, to day, and forever) <hi>yet a greater Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of that Divine Light might be typically preacht forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Enjoyment of the Lesser:</hi> And that we herein are not without the Suffrage of the Scriptures to our Defence, I would fain know of <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> or who else that is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against us, If notwithstanding all those outward Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of those Times, God did not frequently press the very Substance it self, namely, a Clean Heart and a New Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; accounting all short thereof but as the Cutting off a Dog's Neck? And whether Christ himself did not with his own Hands <hi>give the Bread and the Wine to his Disciples, and yet bid them do it till he came?</hi> Whence it is easie to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that unless <hi>Tho. Hicks,</hi> and the rest of those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, say with the <hi>Papists,</hi> The Bread and Wine are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Christ (and so make Christ giving Christ, thereby destroying the Nature of a Sacrament; and instead of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it till he come, that he should come when-ever they do receive it (which Ignorance I will not suppose him or them guilty of) I say, unless then that they were of one Mind with the <hi>Romanists</hi> in the Matter of the Supper, it must be granted to us, that <hi>Christ present gave them a Figure of Christ to come;</hi> therefore to figure out Christ to come, destroyes not Christ's being come; especially with our most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Distinction of the lesser Manifestation from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which nevertheless divides not the Light, but that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in it self one Pure, Eternal Being of Light, and Sun of Righteousness through every Dispensation.</p>
               <p>This, that Passage I have already observed from the <hi>Apostle Paul,</hi> in Answer to the second part of the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on plainly clears to us; For if Christ typified out was their Rock, or the Rock of that Age, even when the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> the <hi>Type</hi> was in being, I cannot see, but the Type and the Thing typified might be at one and the same time;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105069:71"/>
not as to <hi>Degree,</hi> but <hi>Nature;</hi> for so I would be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude take this notable Saying of Christ to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and what may be collected from it to our Purpose; BEFORE <hi>ABRAHAM</hi> WAS I AM — <hi>ABRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Joh. 8. 56, 57, 58.</note> SAW MY DAY, AND REJOY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CED — which affords us briefly thus much: That though he was not so visibly come, yet it was the very same HE that came about One Thousand Six Hundred Years ago, who was with the Fathers of Old; and that <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Helv. Chron.</note> who lived One Thousand Nine Hundred Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that outward Appearance, saw him, and his Day. If this be not the Import of the Place, I know none; For the <hi>Jews</hi> not believing him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> thought it high Presumption sor him to compare with <hi>Abraham;</hi> Art thou Greater then our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is dead, and the Prophets are dead? Whom makest thou thy self? said that Unbelieving People; Unto which he answered (that he might prove himself to be the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Christ of God) <hi>ABRAHAM</hi> SAW MY DAY, and rejoyced: They still harping upon that <hi>Visible Body,</hi> not Thirty Three Years old, replyed, Thou art not yet Fifty, and hast thou seen <hi>Abraham?</hi> Taking that to be the Messiah, the <hi>Christ of God,</hi> and Saviour of the World he meant, which they saw with their Carnal Eyes. To which he rejoyn'd with a <hi>Verily, verily I say unto you, before</hi> Abraham <hi>was I am;</hi> then took they up Stones to cast at him, &amp;c. By all which it is most clear, that unless our <hi>Adversaries</hi> will deny him that so spoak (which yet <hi>T. Hicks's</hi> Anti-scriptural Opinion doth imply) to be Christ, who singled and distinguisht himself, as the <hi>Messiah, the Christ of God, and Saviour of the World from that Visible Body, not Fifty Years old indeed;</hi> both Christ that then spoak must needs have been long before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Time; and that such Holy Ancients were not without a Sight and Prospect of him, and the Day of his Glorious Appearance, or that most Signal Manifestation of himself in that Body prepared for that Great and Holy Purpose; witness the exceeding Clear and Heavenly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyes, that were as so many Fore-runners, or Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Evangelical State.</p>
               <p>And this is unquestionably confirm'd unto us by that known and very weighty Expression of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans: Whose are the Fathers, and of whom as concerning</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Rom. 5. 9.</note>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:105069:72"/>
                  <hi>the Flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever,</hi> Amen. Since here both Christ is distinguisht from the Body he took and made one with that God, who is over all, blessed for ever, <hi>Amen;</hi> As much as to say, of whose Flesh Christ took, <hi>therefore Christ was before he took it;</hi> or his taking it did not constitute him Christ, <hi>which Christ is God;</hi> And if God (<hi>which cannot be said of meer Flesh or any Corporal Lineage</hi>) then must he have been from all Everlasting.</p>
               <p>To conclude, As <hi>Abraham</hi> Outward and Natural was the great Father of the <hi>Jews</hi> Outward and Natural, whose Seed God promis'd to bless with Earthly Blessings as <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp;c. &amp; that they were figurative of the one Seed Christ, and such as he should beget unto a lively Hope through the Power of his Spiritual Resurrection, it will consequently follow, that this Seed must be Inward and Spiritual; since one outward thing cannot be the proper Figure or Representation of an other: Nor is it the Way of holy Scripture so to teach us; <hi>The Outward Lamb shows forth the Inward Lamb; The</hi> Jew <hi>Outward, the</hi> Jew <hi>Inward.</hi> As God attended the one with many singular outward Mercies (to say no more) above other Nations; So the <hi>Jew</hi> in Spirit doth he benefit above all other People</p>
               <p>I have these two short Arguments to prove, what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and assert as to the Spirituallity of the True Seed; and a clearer Overthrow it is to the Opinion of our <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries</hi> to the True Christ. <hi>First,</hi> Every thing begets its like; What is simply Natural produces not a Spiritual Being; Material Things bring not forth Things that are Immaterial. Now because the Nature, or Image, begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Hearts of True Believers, is Spiritual, it will follow, that the Seed which so begets, and brings forth that Birth, must be the same in Nature with that which is begotten, therefore Spiritual; then Christ's Body, or, what he had from the Virgin, strictly considered as such, was not the Seed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is clear from hence; The Serpent is a Spirit: Now nothing can bruise the Head of the Serpent, but something that is also Internal and Spiritual, as the Serpent is; But if that Body of Christ were the Seed, then could he not bruise the Serpent's Head in all, because the Body of Christ is not so much as in any one, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Seed of the Promise is an Holy and Spiritual Principle of <hi>Light, Life,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> that being receiv'd
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105069:73"/>
into the Heart <hi>bruiseth the Serpents Head:</hi> And because the Seed, which cannot be that Body, is Christ, as testify the Scriptures, the Seed is one, and that Seed Christ, and Christ God over all, blessed forever, we do conclude, and<note place="marg1">Gal. 3. 16.</note> that most truly, that Christ was, and is the <hi>Divine Word of Light and Life, that was in the beginning with God, and was, and is God over all, blessed for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this may yet more evidently appear, let it but be seriously weigh'd, that before ever that visible Appearance, <hi>the Seed bruised in good measure the Serpent's Head in the Holy Men and Women of all Generations,</hi> otherwise they had not been Holy, but <hi>Serpentine and Wicked;</hi> And if the Seed, was before, and that Seed be Christ; because there is but One Christ, as well as but One only Seed, it doth clearly follow, <hi>that Christ was Christ before that Outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance;</hi> and consequently, it could but be a more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and free Manifestation of his Truth, Righteousness, Salvation, Wisdom, Power, Glory and Dominion, as indeed it was.</p>
               <p>For notwithstanding that this Heavenly Seed was in some measure known, and what was wrought of Inward Deliverance in that Day, was by and through the Power and Vertue of it, as the Minds of People were retired to that Word of God nigh in the Heart to cleanse and redeem; And though particular Persons might arrive at great Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, even to a Beholding the Day of the Seeds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Redemption, and Conquest over all it's Oppressors (when what was but in the Condition of a Seed, or New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Child, should become the only Son, the Wonderfull Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father and Prince of Peace, of the Increase of whose Government there should be no End, as speaks the Prophet) Yet it is granted, through that good Understanding the Lord has given us in these weighty Things, that the Generallity were but Weak, Dark and Imbondaged, as saith the Apostle, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Carnal and Beggarly Elements, not clearly seeing through those outward Services, which, if I may so speak, God held them in hand with, condescending to their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that he might both keep them from gadding after the Pompous Invention, and Idolatrous Worship of other Nations, and point out unto them under their great Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality that more Hidden Glory and Spiritual Dispensation, which should-afterwards be revealed, to wit, <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105069:73"/>
Redemption of the Soul, and Raign of the Holy Seed,</hi> from the Child born, and the Son given, <hi>to the Wonderful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace, of the Increase of whose Government there shall be no End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that then we ought, and we do by absolute Force of Truth conclude (1.) That the <hi>Seed,</hi> which Seed is Christ, <hi>was in all Ages with</hi> Abraham, <hi>with the</hi> Israelites, <hi>with the Prophets, Therefore he was as well before he came in that prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Body, as then and since.</hi> (2.) Yet it is confest, <hi>That He was not so clearly revealed, perfectly brought forth, and generally known before his so Coming as then and since, but more darkly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured out by Types and Shaddowy Services; which though they Cleans'd not, Sav'd not, Redeem'd not, yet did show forth a more Hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and Spiritual Substance, that was able to Cleanse, Save and Redeem, and did all that received it, and were truly subject to it.</hi> (3.) That it therefore is not at all Absurd, <hi>that the more Excellent Manifestation of Truth should he Typified and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied of, under the Enjoyment of the Lesser, since the Reason of the Thing, and the Testimonies of the Scripture are so express for it,</hi> which ends our Answer to this Particular.</p>

               <p>HAving thus considered the Third Part of this great Objection, I am now come to what chiefly stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles People, with respect to the Light within, at least, as I apprehend; and that is this Fourth and Last Particular, viz. <hi>But if the Light in every Man be Christ, how doth it bear our Sins, and are our Iniquities laid upon it? and how can we be said to be Justified, Redeemed or Saved by its Blood, since all these things are spoken by the Holy Pen-men of the Man</hi> Christ, <hi>or</hi> Jesus <hi>born at</hi> Nazareth? <hi>Surely you wholy invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date his Life, Death, Resurrection, Ascension and Mediation by this Belief in the Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I take to be the very Stress of the Matter, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of the most Forceable Writings of our <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries;</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:105069:74"/>
To which I Answer, and let him that reads under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
               <p>It must be considered in this Last Part of the Objection, how those Questions can be applicable to the Light, and yet be reconciliable with those Scriptures that seem to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all to his Bodily Sufferings. I hope to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that as we exalt the First, so we dare not by any means to slight the Last.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Light,</hi> or rather He that is Light in Man (for I have alwayes desired so to be understood: <hi>Light</hi> being a <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor</hi> or word taken from the outward Day, and chiefly so term'd, because of Man's Darkness, which is thereby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered) hath been as a Lamb slain since the Foundation of the World; that is, the World had not been long created, before the good Order of it, and every thing therein, being envied by the Fallen Angels, that Spirit of Iniquity betrayed Man of his Innocency; and Sin by Disobedience prevailing, the Light or Principle of Life, under whose Holy Leadings Man was placed, became <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted, Grieved,</hi> and as it were <hi>Slain</hi> (which word <hi>Slain</hi> is also Metaphorical) that is to say, the Innocent Pure Life was as Wounded unto Death through Man's Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Lamb-like Image, in which <hi>Adam</hi> was created, by him through Rebellion lost: Thus that Holy Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which God placed in the Heart of <hi>Adam,</hi> in which was true Light, Life and Power, bore the Sin, was prest under it, as a Cart under Sheaves, grieved exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and as it were quencht with Iniquity. This hath been the Condition of that Precious and <hi>Elect Seed, Spirit, Light, Life, Truth</hi> (or whatever Name equivalent any may please to give it) ever since that first Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to this very Day: And as in Wicked Men God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Light and Spirit, or that Principle which is so called, hath been deeply <hi>Wounded,</hi> yea, as one <hi>Slain;</hi> so in Good Men, that have had a Sence of the World's Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath it also born many Burdens and Weights; for the Light and Life is <hi>One</hi> in All. And those who have been reformed by it, and joyned to it, have been as One Spirit, and have not been without their Share of their Lord's heavy Sufferings, from the Ungodly World, which was as well a filling up of Christ's Sufferings that were before his Outward Coming, as what to this Generation are behind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:105069:74"/>And as at any time Disobedient Men have harkened to the still Voice of the WORD (that Messenger of God) <hi>in their Hearts,</hi> to be affected and convinced by it, as it brings Reproof for Sin, which is but a <hi>Fatherly Chastize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>

               <p>But notwithstanding the same Light and Life, with that which afterwards clothed it it self with that outward Body, did in measure inwardly appear for the Salvation of the Souls of Men; yet, as have often said, never did that Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For doubtless that very Light, Life and Power, which dwelt in that Flesh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>y Tabernacle, eminently was the Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, Condemner, Saviour and Redeemer; yet not only as confined to that Body, but as revealed in the Hearts of Men, as he was in <hi>Paul,</hi> who not consulting with Flesh and Blood against the Lord of Glory willingly receive him in, to bind the strong Man, spoil his Goods, and cast him out, that He might Reign. And that the Divine Life, Light, Spirit, Nature of Principle, which resided in that Body was the efficient Cause of Salvation, observe the Title that is given from the great Work he was to do, namely, <hi>To save his People from their Sins;</hi> there is not one Word of Wrath, but consequentially: Therefore, since that Sin is in the Heart and Conscience of Mankind, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105069:75"/>
but a Divine Light, Spirit or Power can reach <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculation</hi> into those inward Parts; and consequently that must be the Redeemer and Saviour. But indeed, those who have a Mind <hi>to Naturalize that strange Figure into the Language of the Holy Truth;</hi> I mean, to understand that to be saved, <hi>is to be saved from Wrath,</hi> and not from Sin (whose assured Wages is Wrath) may have <hi>some Interest,</hi> though <hi>no Reason</hi> for their implacable Enmity against an <hi>Inherent Holiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I farther confess, that his Righteous Life, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to its Appearance in that Body, was grieved by Sin, &amp; that the Weight of the Iniquity of the whole World, with the Concernment of its Eternal Well-being, lay hard upon him, nor was his <hi>Manhood Insensible of it:</hi> Under the Load of this did He travel, he alone trode the Wine-Press; that is, All others were then Insensible of that Eternal Wrath, which would be the Portion of Impenitent Persons, as well as that it was his great Care, and deep Travel, that the Holy, yet Oppressed Seed might arise over the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Iniquity in the Hearts of Men, to bruise the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's Head in all; And as outwardly he gave his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Life for the World, so he might inwardly shed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in their Souls the Blood of God, that is, <hi>The Holy Purifying Life and Virtue, which is in him as the Word-God,</hi> and as which, he is the Life of the World.</p>
               <p>This was it which gave that visible Part the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it had, which fitted it for so great an Embassy, by whose Power alone it <hi>Fasted, Prayed, Preacht, Cast-out</hi> Devils, <hi>Wrought Miracles, Lived that most Unblemisht Life, Patiently Suffered Death, was Raised for an Holy Confirmation,</hi> maugre all the Military Opposition of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and this it was which accompanied the Ministry of his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, rendring it Efficacious to Conviction and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: So that the Invisible, Spiritual and Divine Life, Principle or Nature, was the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Fountain</hi> of all which is sometimes asscribed in Scripture to the Body, by that Common Figure, or Way of Speaking amongst Men, <hi>the Thing containing,</hi> which was the <hi>Body for the Thing contained,</hi> which was the <hi>Eternal Power, Wisdom, Life, &amp;c.</hi> Not that we would irreverently rob the Holy Body of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Acknowledgement is justly due, nor yet separate that God joyned; though I confess with holy Fear, I dare not attribute to an External prepared Being, which is the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105069:75"/>
Natural, Proper and Only Work of the Divine Light and Life to operate and effect: But certainly, if some Men in Scripture are intituled <hi>Saviours</hi> because of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of their Tryals, Travels and Labours towards the Salvation of Man-kind, of much more Right is that Honour ascribable to him who had the Spirit without Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; For I do freely acknowledge it to have been in some sense a <hi>Co-worker</hi> and <hi>Partner with the Divine Life in many of its Tryals, Weights, Sufferings and Travels for Man-kind:</hi> Yet as it was the Divine Power in them that made them serviceable in that great Work, so was it the Divine Power in him which made that what it was, and therefore ought we <hi>chiefly</hi> to appropriate the Salvation to <hi>Christ,</hi> as the <hi>Word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>God,</hi> and to the <hi>Holy Manhood</hi> not any otherwise then <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentally,</hi> or by the same Divine Power in and through it; I mean, as it was a Chosen <hi>Instrument or Vessel, in and by which God declared the Blessed Glad-Tidings of Love, and his Message of Reconciliation to the World,</hi> in which he gave the most Heavenly Example of Purity, and <hi>through whose</hi> whole <hi>Life, Doctrine and Death did shine forth the clearest Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> of Truth, Goodness, Mercy, Patience, deep Travel for the World, Self-Denyal, Holiness and Triumphant Matyrdom. No Wonder then, if he be called a <hi>Saviour,</hi> who not only came on an Embassy of Salvation, and when come, did draw many after him, who were struck with the Authority of his Sayings, <hi>when he allow'd for a time to have their Eyes and Hearts upon him, as in that State present with them;</hi> But afterwards, he let his Disciples know, of how much Benefit it would be to them, that he should leave them; How? Forever: In all Capacities? No; but as with respect to his outward Appearance, that being <hi>scattered in that Day to their own Measure of Light, Pon er and Life, they might know him</hi> NO MORE AFTER THE FLESH, but witness him <hi>come into their Hearts a Comforter,</hi> who could not leave his true-hearted Disciples comfortless. <hi>He that is with you shall be in you.</hi>

               <p n="4">IV. It plainly preaches thus much to us, That as Him, whose Body the <hi>Jews</hi> outwardly slew, <hi>we by Wicked Works have crucified in the Streets of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Egypt, <hi>spiritually so called, our polluted Hearts and Consciences.</hi> So, unless we come to know the <hi>Benefit of the Inward Life,</hi> answering to, and expressed by <hi>that Outward Life he gave for the World,</hi> it will avail little; For so it is, and very Marvelous in our Eyes, that the Life of the Crucified can only save those who may well be reputed the Crucifiers. O Mystery! And because those that did not actually slay him <hi>Outwardly,</hi> have slain him <hi>Inwardly,</hi> therefore must every such one really know that Life Inwardly raised &amp; shed abroad for Sanctification and Redemption. O how great was his Love! Truly larger then Man's Cruelty; who whilst he dyed by Wicked Men, <hi>he would Dye for them;</hi> and when dead, <hi>they could not hinder him from Rising to do them good,</hi> who had done their worst for his Destruction, thereby shewing Mercy to those, <hi>who shewed they had no Mercy for themselves. O</hi> Jerusalem, Jerusalem! <hi>how often would I have gathered thee, and thou wouldest not, &amp;c?</hi>

               <p n="5">V. That Expression of his is greatly worth our Notice, <hi>I lay down my Life for the World.</hi> All he did was for the Good of the World, and particularly the Laying down of his Life, that he might both express his Love and our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Had he not desired Man's Salvation, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose prepared a Body, in which to visit him, and by his dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Labours among Men to further their Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the <hi>Jew</hi> had never been able to put him to Death: But being come, and when come, so hardly used, herein did he recommend his great Love to us, that besides the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Weights of Sin he bore with his deep Concernment for Man's Eternal Well-being, <hi>he chearfully offered up his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Life,</hi> to recommend and ratifie his Love for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sin, and give us an Holy Example to follow his Steps. But these Words will bear another Sease too, as<note place="marg1">John 6. 51, 52. 53, 54, 62, 63.</note> do those he spoak to the <hi>Jews, Unless ye eat my Flesh, and drink my Blood, you have no Life in you:</hi> Where we may

plainly see, that as the <hi>Jews</hi> vainly and carnally fancyed, he meant his <hi>Outward Body</hi> only, to which they opposed the <hi>Impossibility</hi> of the thing; so Christ declares their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake of his Meaning to his Disciples, in these few, but deep Words, <hi>The Flesh profiteth nothing: it is the Spirit that quickeneth.</hi> So that the Words are true, and weighty in both Senses.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. And we further acknowledge, that in that Holy Body the Divine Principle of Light and Life did discover the Depth of <hi>Satan</hi>'s Darkness, encounter Hell, Death and the Grave, every Temptation it was possible for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, with all his Power, and Subtilty to beset him with (in which Sense he was made like unto us in all things, Sin excepted, that he might be sensible of our Infirmities) the Divine Life travelled and supported under all, administring Strength to the outward Man, that it might answer the End of its Appointment, &amp; in the End utterly defeated, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever overcame the Power of the Tempter, <hi>bruising the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents Head in general, as Prince of Darkness, and God of the World,</hi> and in a plain Combat giving him that Foyl, which in good measure shook his Foundation, divided his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, chased away his <hi>Lying Oracles,</hi> and proved a very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Blow to his whole Empire: Which holy Conquest obtained by Sweat of Blood, and deep'st Agonies with Holy Patience, may not unfitly be compared to that of some Worldly <hi>Prince</hi> maintaining a Righteous Cause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an <hi>Usurper</hi> of his Territories, whom he puts to rout in open Fields; by which I understand the <hi>General Conquest;</hi> yet many <hi>Towns, and Cities and Cittadels remaining strongly guarnison'd</hi> (by which I understand, particular Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men enslaved by Sin) they are not thereby overcome, though the Approach be easier to them, and they be truly more endanger'd then before.</p>
               <p>The <hi>One Seed, who is Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever,</hi> having given that Proof of his Everlasting Arm, that it has brought a general Salvation by a plain Overthrow of the God of this World, the Enemy of his Glory, and thereby weakened his Power in himself (which is the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Battel fought in Garments rould in Blood, between the <hi>two Seeds, Spirits, Natures and Powers; God</hi> and <hi>Mammon; Christ</hi> and <hi>Belial</hi>) had many <hi>Towns, Cities</hi> and <hi>Cittadels</hi> to vanquish, who lay strongly guarnison'd by this God of the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105069:78"/>
World; which Places, as I said, represent the Souls of particular Men and Women inbondaged by him. So that though their Hearts were, or are more accessible by that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Victory over the very Spirit of Darkness it self, and Light may be more clear d and broken up; yet unless those particular <hi>Places or Persons are besieged and taken, their Goods spoiled, and Houses sackt of all the strange Gods, &amp; so redeemed from under the Yoak of that</hi> Pharaonian <hi>Task-Master, reclaimed, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, sanctified &amp; naturalized by way of an Holy Subjection to him, who is Lord from Heaven, the Right Heir of all things, to receive his Mark, and bear his Image;</hi> Those Places or Persons must needs have yet been, and be Subjects of the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the God of this World, who reigns and rules in the Hearts of the Children of Disobedience.</p>
               <p>To conclude; We, though this General Victory was obtained, and holy Priviledges therewith, and that the Holy Body was not Instrumentally without a Share thereof; yet that both the efficient or chiefest Cause was the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> that so clearly discriminated and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded this Mystery of Iniquity, and that none can be thereby benefited, but as they come to experience that <hi>Holy Seed of Life,</hi> and Mighty Arm of Power revealed to effect the same Salvation in each Particular Conscience, which none can fail of, who receive it first as a <hi>Light, that manifesteth and reproveth every Evil Way,</hi> and continues to walk up to all its holy Leadings.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. But there is yet a further Benefit that accrueth by the Blood of Christ, viz. <hi>That Christ is a Propitiation and Redemption to such as have Faith in it;</hi> For though I still place the Stres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of what he had obscurely and in Parables said to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he meant not something more hidden and Divine then what they and the <hi>Jews</hi> saw; Yet that which hindred those <hi>Jews</hi> from the Knowledge or Benefit thereof, was their Stumbling at him without a Confession, unto whom they co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>To conclude, That Body was the Divine Lifes, <hi>a Body hast thou prepared me;</hi> therefore all that was done by that Body towards the <hi>Redemption of Man-kind, was eminently the Divine Lifes;</hi> yet because many times Actions are denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from, or appropriated to the Instrument as the next Cause, though not the Efficient, or most Eminent Cause; therefore the Scripture speaks forth (as indeed is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of both the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues (<hi>Parabol cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Hyberbolically, Metaphorically</hi>) the inward Substance and hidden Life of things, by things more Exteriour and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the Sense, to the End that such Mysteries might be the better accommodated to Vulgar Capacities. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what I say with this Qualification, that ultimately and chiefly, not wholy and exclusively the Divine Life in that Body was the Redeemer: For the Sufferings of that Holy Body of Jesus had an engaging and procuring Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And as the Life decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and preached forth it self through that Holy Body; so who did then come to the Benefit procured by the Divine Life, could only do it through an Hearty Confession to it, as appearing in that Body; and that from a Sence first begotten by a Measure of the same in themselves.</p>
               <p>This is the main Import of those Places: <hi>Whom God</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Rom. 3, 25.</note> 
                  <hi>hath set forth to be a Propitiation, and in whom we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption through Faith in his Blood.</hi> For who is this H E, whom God hath set forth, and in whom is Redemption? Certainly the same H E, that was before <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Rock of the Fathers, that cryed, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy Will (O God) a Body hast thou prepared me:</hi> which was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="marg1">Hebr. 10. 5, 7.</note> the Body was conceived and born. But may some say, How is it then his Blood? Why, just as the Body is his Body.</p>
               <p>Those who had Faith in that Blood believed his Visible Appearance, inasmuch as they acknowledged that great Seal and Ratification of it, to wit, the Shedding of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105069:81"/>
Blood of <hi>His</hi> Body, who came to save the World, and who alone is the Propitiation, Redemption and Salvation of all who had right Faith in that Appearance and Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage so confirmed, and therefore so often exprest by it, as inclusive of all his whole Life and Sufferings beside. And this is my Reason for it, <hi>that it was impossible for any Man in that Day to confess to, and believe in that Divine Light and Life, which appeared in that prepared Body, but from the Inward Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries and Operations of that Light, with which Christ the Word-God who took Flesh, had enlightened him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, though the Apostles might then so express themselves, thereby to assert and recommend unto the Faith of all that most Heavenly Manifestation, and the great <hi>Love</hi> of Christ therein, as the Visitation of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life through that prepared Body, and the deep Sufferings of both for the World, being True and Spiritual Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses thereof; yet it was never intended, that any should barely rest in that, but press after the Knowledge of Christ by Faith in something farther, and beyond that Body, in which he appeared, not excluding our Belief in that too: They who knew Christ after the Flesh, were to press af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some more Spiritual Discovery of Him; and who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most doted on his outward Manifestation, it was expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that they should be weaned from it, to the End his more interiour, and indeed beneficial Revelation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felf might be witnessed.</p>
               <p>Faith in his Blood was requisite, that they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess him, whose Body and Blood it was to be Christ, who is God over all, blessed for ever; The great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion with the <hi>Jews, Whether God was truly manifested in that Body of Flesh which they saw?</hi> So that the Stress lyes in Confessing to the Divinity come in the Flesh; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they would have rejected not only the most signal Suffering of the whole Manifestation; but consequently that It self. To conclude, we confess, HE who then appeared, was and is the Propitiation, &amp;c. and <hi>in Him</hi> was Redemption obtained by all those, who had such true Faith in his Blood: But still it is to be understood, that there must be a Witnessing of a measure of the same <hi>Light, Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to appear for Redemption in each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. That <hi>Justification came by Faith in his Blood,</hi> is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105069:81"/>
clear in a Sense; for by the Law could no Flesh be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: That is, the Law being added because of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, certainly the Transgressor could not be justified, whilst such, <hi>by that Law which condemned him for being such.</hi> Which puts me upon Distinguishing betwixt <hi>Justification,</hi> as it is sometimes taken, <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>Remission, Pardon or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of Sin past upon Repentance;</hi> and that Justification, which implies <hi>an Acceptance with, and an Access to God, as a Keeper of the Law of the Spirit of Life, which is to be made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently Just.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the first Sense, Since all have sinned, no Man can be justified by the Law he has transgress'd: Therefore that great Favour and Mercy of Remission, Pardon and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness was only then generally preacht in the Name of Jesus, that such as believed in his Message should obtain. Thus by the Works of the Law shall no Flesh be justified; because, all the Righteousness Man is capable of, ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ot make Satisfaction for any Unrighteousness he has commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; since what he daily doth is but what he daily ows. But still such as keep the Law, are justified: for that a Man should be condemned both for Transgressing &amp; Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law too, would be very hard. What shall we say then, but that Justification in the first Sense, since <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Day</hi> to this, <hi>hath been God's Free Love upon Repentance;</hi> and above all, that by Christ's visible Appearance, and in his Name was Remission, Pardon, or Forgiveness preacht or held forth to the whole World, upon their believing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, more eminently, then ever,</p>
               <p>But in the last Sense, No Man can be justified, <hi>but as he is made Just, and is found actually Doing of the Will of God;</hi> That justifies, that is it gives Acceptance with, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to God: In this Sense it was, that the Apostle said, <hi>Such as are the</hi> DOERS <hi>of the Law shall be justified;</hi> and not from the Guilt of what they formerly did against it, by then keeping it; for that is the free Love of God alone, upon the Repentance of the Creature, (which hath been in all former Ages, but never so eminently held forth to the World, as by the Coming of Jesus Christ in the Flesh.)</p>
               <p>So that thus far we can approach the Honester Sort of Professors of Religion, or rather, we never were at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from them, <hi>viz.</hi> That Men may be reconciled, and in a Sense justified, while Sin may not be totally destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105069:83"/>
of the first Nine Verses of <hi>John,</hi> as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the Light.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some say, that the Light here spoken of, <hi>is not a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per natural, and consequently no Saving Light, but the Light of common Reason; Others call it of Nature, decay'd by the Fall, and what Conviction ariseth thence is only the Imperfect Remains of that Natural Light,</hi> which these Men, who thus speak, grant all to have, as well before as after Christ's coming in the Flesh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others say, <hi>that this is indeed an Universal and Saving Light, but they restrain it to that Visible Appearance, and make the</hi> ALL <hi>to be, all those that will believe; and the World to be that New Spiritual World Christ came to create by Saving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which Believers come into.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will briefly answer both, and therein as well all the pretended <hi>Anti-Socinians</hi> (viz) <hi>J. Owen, R. Baxter, T. Danson, J. Clapham, J. Bunnion, S. Eaton, J. Grig, T. Imner. T. Hicks,</hi> and abundance more who hold the former; as those who are reputed <hi>Socinians,</hi> who hold the latter.</p>
               <p>It is agreed <hi>by the First,</hi> in the beginning of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that Christ's Eternal Divinity is declared by the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist,</hi> since some of them, and particularly <hi>J. Owen</hi> tells us out of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> that it was written on that very Occasion; one <hi>Cerinthus</hi> then denying any such thing.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Word</hi> which was with God, and <hi>was and is God:</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">Joh. 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 9.</note> This <hi>God,</hi> the same Person tells us in his first Epistle, <hi>is Light;</hi> By Him all things were made, among the rest Mankind. He then tells us that <hi>This Word had Life,</hi> and from thence descends to inform us, what the <hi>Word</hi> was with respect to Man; <hi>In Him, the Word was Life, and the Life the Light of Men;</hi> as such, He was <hi>that True Light,</hi> and not <hi>John,</hi> who only came to bear Witness of <hi>that True Light, which inlightens all Mankind coming into the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this <hi>Light is Divine,</hi> and no otherwise <hi>Natural,</hi> then as it is <hi>Christ's Nature, or Natural to the Word,</hi> I shall thus prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Man</hi> is here supposed to be before he was inlightened, therefore what ever was proper, and connatural to Man, <hi>as Man,</hi> he had before he was inlightened, that is, <hi>he had a reasonable Soul, indued with intelligent Faculties, and that clothed with a Body, fitted with sensible Organs;</hi> The Latter dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd him from <hi>Inanimate,</hi> the Former from <hi>Irrational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:105069:84"/>
But still the <hi>Light,</hi> with which this Soul is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, in reference to God, and things appertaining to its Eternal Well being, <hi>belongs not to Man, as Man:</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then, <hi>this Light must be superadded,</hi> that is, over and above Man's Composition, as a meer Understanding Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and consequently, it must descend from above, and in this Sense be <hi>Supernatural.</hi> Thus the <hi>Word</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things, and among them made Man, <hi>enlightened Man with a Supernatural Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this <hi>Light</hi> was not only over and above Man's Nature, but is also of a <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Saving,</hi> One in it self, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> prove from its being <hi>the Life of the Word;</hi> for if the <hi>Life</hi> of the Word <hi>be the Light of Men, here is no such thing as descending to an Effect, to prove the Light Divine,</hi> a that the <hi>Life</hi> should bring forth a <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>therefore this Light is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, because the Life of the Word that Product it is so:</hi> I say, without going to an <hi>Effect for a Proof of the Light's Divinity,</hi> I thus Undeniably prove it from the <hi>Life it self.</hi> for that very Divine LIFE is the LIGHT, <hi>not that it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth or brings forth a Light,</hi> as a <hi>Cause</hi> doth an <hi>Effect, but is that very Light it self;</hi> so that unless they will make that Life <hi>Natural</hi> (I mean as they do) <hi>Created</hi> (though very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly; <hi>for a Divine Life is Natural to Christ</hi>) they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conclude the <hi>Light</hi> which is not the Product, <hi>but that very same Life it felf,</hi> to be a meer <hi>Natural Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then the very LIFE of the <hi>Word,</hi> be the LIGHT of <hi>Men,</hi> unless the LIFE of the <hi>Word</hi> be NATU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAL, the LIGHT of <hi>Men</hi> must be SUPERNA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURAL, DIVINE and INFINITE, as it becomes the LIFE of the WORD (which is GOD) to be.</p>
               <p>And this roundly checks the dull <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or base <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105069:86"/>
be allowed then to blame the Light as Impotent, when he can live Uncondemned of it, or <hi>Experience can tell us its Insufficiency to Well-Living:</hi> Tis vain to undervalue <hi>That</hi> which chargeth both with <hi>Duty omitted, and Sin committed.</hi> Happy Man were he, if leaving <hi>Prejudice,</hi> he obeyed the <hi>Light within,</hi> it would not teach him to write <hi>Lyes, Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Forgeries,</hi> nor to call Men <hi>Knave,</hi> much less to threaten them with <hi>Blows</hi> whom he scurrilously named so. But <hi>Our Religion is to Bear and His to Abuse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, this stands sure, that <hi>the Life of the Word is the Light of Men, and consequently Divine;</hi> and (to say nothing of the Absurdity of their Phraises) there I will leave this <hi>first Sort</hi> of Men, and their fruitless Opposition.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Second Interpretation</hi> given, destructive of that <hi>Scope</hi> we testifie the <hi>Light</hi> to have, I return thus much.</p>
               <p>That because <hi>the Light of Men was the Life of the Word,</hi> which <hi>Word</hi> was <hi>God,</hi> by whom all things were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that <hi>all Men</hi> are mentioned in that place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, which presupposeth no further Qualification in order to have this Light, <hi>then being born one of that</hi> all Men <hi>into this World;</hi> I conclude, that it is not only a most False, but Injurious Notion, to assert the Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or being o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> that Light, to be from the Coming of Christ in the Flesh.</p>
               <p>Besides, since this relates to the <hi>whole Man,</hi> which Word begins with <hi>Adam,</hi> and ends with the last of Man's Race, I cannot conceive how that Exposition can be valid; for then <hi>John</hi> would have been before <hi>Christ,</hi> instead of<note place="marg1">See <hi>Origen, Chrysostom, Greg Erasm Drus.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Christ's being before Abraham;</hi> whereas, therefore is <hi>John de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to be that Light, because that true Light by Way of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency was the Enlightener of all Men,</hi> yea, <hi>of John himself,</hi> and therefore call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

is this but to say, God expects Homage from Men as their Soveraign Lord, and that they live uprightly in the World, <hi>yet he has given them no Ability, in order to do it?</hi> He pronounces such Miserable who conform themselves not to an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life, <hi>but gives no Power to avoid the Curse?</hi> In short, though Reason tell us, he made none purposely to Destroy them, but rather that he might be glorified in their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which he is also said to invite Men to; <hi>yet that he designs nothing less, by leaving any, or all Mankind under the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>I Will sum up the whole of this Discourse into these few Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That <hi>Salvation</hi> is to be saved from <hi>Sin</hi> first, and <hi>Wrath</hi> consequentially; <hi>He shall save them from their Sins.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. That nevertheless not to the <hi>Body,</hi> but holy <hi>Light of Life</hi> therein, is <hi>chiefly to be asscribed the Salvation;</hi> and to the <hi>Body</hi> however excellent, but <hi>Instrumentally:</hi> for that it was the Eternal Light and Life, which gave the Weight to all the Actions and Sufferings of the Body.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. That the <hi>Benefit</hi> then procured is not witnessed by any, <hi>but as they come to believe in Christ the</hi> Light, <hi>as he doth appear in the Heart and Conscience, to save from Sin, destroy the Works of the</hi> Devil, <hi>finish Transgression, and bring in of his Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Righteousness:</hi> Wherefore to fancy one's self intituled to a State of Salvation, whilst in Rebellion against the Light within (<hi>which is Christ's inward Knocking and Appearance</hi>) must needs be a Delusion most pernicious, and destructive to the Souls of men.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. That upon the whole it is determin'd and concluded, that <hi>Christ is that Light which shineth in the Conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">X. That the <hi>Light</hi> is prov'd by Reason both <hi>Universal</hi> and <hi>Sufficient;</hi> The <hi>first</hi> from the Consent of Mankind, the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Rectitude of God; the <hi>second</hi> from both <hi>Experience,</hi> and that it were inconsistent with God, to give a <hi>Light</hi> to his Creature <hi>insufficient for the Work for which he gave it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus in short have I given the <hi>Heads</hi> and Results of most of the Matter contained in the whole Discourse upon the <hi>Light;</hi> and I intreat our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> they would seriously

weigh the Whole, before they either reject it, or endeavour to reply to it: But let them be advised to try the <hi>Virtue of the Light,</hi> before they sentence it to have none; And in the Love of God be once prevail'd upon to consider, if something in them doth not really <hi>Condemn</hi> them, amongst other things <hi>for these brisk Attempts against it.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And whatever any may think of us, we both believe, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, and will maintain against Men and Divels, that <hi>God is LIGHT; and that out of the Light, or void of his Divine Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, no man can</hi> Know <hi>him, and consequently not</hi> Worship <hi>him, unless they should worship an</hi> Unknown God: <hi>That such as receive this Illumination, and rebel not against it; but improve this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Talent, they have Fellowship with the Pure Eternal God, and experience the Blood of Jesus Christ to cleanse the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> from all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any think to arrive at Glory another Way, and will not be admonisht, let them proceed; we speak what we know, and can but declare what we have felt of the Work of God in our Hearts. The <hi>Scriptures</hi> we highly value: But we believe not the things we often quote thence, to be true, <hi>Only because there, but for that we are Witnesses of the same Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and bring in our experimental Testimonies to confirm the Truth of theirs:</hi> and such truly honour the Scriptures; all others are at best but <hi>empty Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Pharisaical Babblers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So with God I leave my Labour in this Particular, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that his Heavenly <hi>Light</hi> may yet more abundantly arise

               <head>OF THE GENERAL RULE OF Faith and Life.</head>
               <p>SInce there be so many <hi>Faiths</hi> in the World, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext Controversies about them; and that it great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behoveth every man (if to <hi>Contend</hi> for, then first) <hi>to Know the True Faith that overcometh the World,</hi> It may not be unnecessary to say something of <hi>the General Rule of Faith and Life, and Judge of Controversie,</hi> at this time. And indeed I am prest to it from this weighty Consideration, that Men perish for Want of it, and can no more arrive at Truth without it, then the distressed Mariner can gain his Port who sailes without either Star or Compass.</p>
               <p>I shall begin with an Explanation of the Terms, <hi>Rule,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> of which we shall first treat, that we may as well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press what we intend by the one, as what we mean by the other, which will be a proper Introduction to the whole Discourse.</p>
               <p>By <hi>General Rule,</hi> &amp;c. we understand, <hi>that Constant Measure or Standard by which Men have been in all Ages enabled to Judge of the Truth or Error of Doctrines, and the Good or Evil of Thoughts, Words and Actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>Faith</hi> we understand <hi>an Assent of the Mind in such manner to the Discoveries made of God thereto, as to resign up to God, and have Dependence upon him, as the Great Creator and Saviour of his People,</hi> which is inseparable from good Works.</p>
               <p>That Men in all Ages have had a Belief of God, and some Knowledge of him (though not upon equal Discovery) must be granted from that account that all <hi>Story</hi> gives us of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in matters of Religion; several have fully performed this: Ofold, <hi>Justin Martyr, Clemens Alexandrinus, Augustine,</hi> and others; of later times, <hi>Du Plessy, Grotius, Amiraldus, L. Herbert,</hi> with many more: And indeed the reliques we have of the most ancient <hi>Historians</hi> and Authors, are a Demonstration in the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:105069:95"/>
Point. Now the Scripture tells us, <hi>that no Man knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him:</hi> And<note place="marg1">Mat. 11. 27.</note> as <hi>none knows the things of Man, save the Spirit of Man; so the</hi>
                  <note place="marg1">1 Cor. 2. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>things of God knows no Man, but the Spirit of God.</hi> Hence we may safely conclude, that the <hi>Creating Word that was with God, and was God, in whom was Life, and that Life the Light of Men; who is the Quickning Spirit,</hi> was <hi>He,</hi> by whom God in all Ages must have been revealed; consequently, that <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> hath been the <hi>General Rule of mens Knowledge, Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with respect to God.</hi> And thus much <hi>Pythagoras</hi> (that liv'd about Six Hundred Years before those Words were spoak or writ) laid down for a <hi>Maxim,</hi> viz. <hi>That no man can know what is agreeable to God, except a man hear God himself,</hi> that is, <hi>within;</hi> for that was his Doctrine: To which the <hi>Apostle</hi> and <hi>Prophet</hi> thus agree; 1. In that <hi>whatever makes manifest is Light.</hi> 2. <hi>That</hi>

               <p>Thus is it evident that the <hi>Scripture</hi> was <hi>not</hi> the general Rule, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There hath been since, and is now the same Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment; for before Christ's coming in the Flesh, and since, where the <hi>Scriptures</hi> never reach d, there hath been the same <hi>Light:</hi> And though Nations (<hi>through not glorifying God as God, when they have known him</hi>) have bin so given up to all manner of Impieties, as that their Understandings have been greatly vail'd; yet did not the <hi>Light within</hi> so wholely loose its Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Exercise among them, as that they lived without any Sence of such thing; Therefore still the <hi>Scriptures</hi> have not been, neither are the General Rule, no not so much as of any Age; since in no Age can it be prov'd, that the whole World was furnished with them: But had they been so for some one or two Ages, as they never were; yet the granting it will not reach our Question, where the Word <hi>General,</hi> implieth the Nature of the Thing it self, respecting Mankind from the Beginning to this Day, and so to the End.</p>

If the <hi>Faith</hi> of God's People in all Ages be of one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then the <hi>Rule</hi> but of one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But clear it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. The <hi>Faith</hi> has been but of one Nature; Consequently, the <hi>Rule</hi> but of one Nature. In short, If the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients had <hi>Faith</hi> before they had and wrote Scr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>pture, they had a <hi>Rule</hi> before they had or wrote Scripture; for where <hi>Faith</hi> is, there is a <hi>Rule</hi> for that Faith; And if the <hi>Faith</hi> be of one Nature, the <hi>Rule</hi> is of one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And since the <hi>Faith</hi> is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Spiritual, begotten of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Word, in which is Life, and that the Light of men; and that this Word, Life and Light was the <hi>Rule,</hi> then no more Book, Writing or ingraving on visible and perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Matter can be the <hi>Rule</hi> now.</p>
               <p>Again; Such as the <hi>Faith</hi> is, such must the <hi>Rule</hi> be: But the <hi>Faith</hi> is as before, Inward and Spirual; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Rule</hi> must be Inward and spiritual, which no meer Book can be.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:105069:97"/>2. If the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were the Rule, they must have always been a perfect Rule, ever since they were a Rule: But this is impossible, since they were many hundred years in writing and are now imperfect also, as to Number; <hi>How then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they were not the <hi>Perfect</hi> Rule before they were written must be granted; and that they were many hundred Years awriting, must also be allowed; and that they are imperfect now, as to Number, I prove.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Enoch's</hi> Prophecy is mentioned by <hi>Jude,</hi> but not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the Bible; <hi>the Books of the Wars of the Lord,</hi> Numb. 21. 14. The <hi>Book of Jasher,</hi> Josh. 10. 13. 2 Sam. 1. 18. The <hi>Book of Nathan,</hi> 2 Chron. 9. 29. <hi>The Book of Shemaiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 12. 15. <hi>The Book of Jehu; The Epistle of Paul to the Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans,</hi> Collos. 4. 16. and several others, mentioned in the Scriptures, not now extant: And lastly <hi>Luke</hi> sayes, <hi>That many took in hand to relate from Eye-Witnesses the things most surely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now 'tis taken for granted that <hi>John</hi> wrote many Years after <hi>Luke;</hi> Some think <hi>Luke</hi> wrote before <hi>Mark:</hi> However, <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> were not many; and to this day we see no more then those four in our Bibles, and therefore many such Writings lost; and if lost, then the Scriptures not perfect; and if imperfect, how can they be the Rule of Faith, since the Rule of Faith must be perfect?</p>
               <p n="3">3. My third Reason is this; The Scriptures, however use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Edification and Comfort, seem not in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Frame to have been compil'd and delivered, as the Rule and intire Body of Faith; but rather upon particular Occasions and Emergencies. The Doctrines are scattered throughout the Scriptures, insomuch that those Societies who have given forth verbal Confessions of their Faith, have been necessitated to toss them to and fro, search here and search there, to lay down this or the other Principle; and then as like the original Text as their Apprehensions are; whereas, were it as plain and distinct as the Nature of a Rule requires, they needed only to have given their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription for a Confession. Besides, here they are <hi>Proper,</hi> there <hi>Metaphorical;</hi> in one place <hi>Literally,</hi> in another <hi>Mystically</hi> to be accepted: Most times Points are to be prov'd by comparing and weighing Places coherent; here to allude aptly and not wrong the Sense is difficult, and requires infallible Discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, notwithstanding the Brawlers of our times against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility:

If the Scriptures are the Rule, they are so either in their <hi>Original</hi> or <hi>Copies:</hi> If in their <hi>Original,</hi> that is not extant, then no <hi>Rule</hi> in being; for the last of it that was extant, was <hi>John's History</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> not seen these thousand Years: If the <hi>Copies</hi> must be the <hi>Rule,</hi> it were to be wished, we knew which were the nighest to the Original, there being above thirty in Number: This is undetermined and for ought we see indeterminable.

               <p>Now, certain it is that some of the Scriptures taken in by one Council for <hi>Canonical,</hi> were rejected by another as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphal;</hi> and that which was left out by the former for <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> was taken in by the latter for <hi>Canonical.</hi> Now vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible it is that they contradicted each other, and as true that they both erred, respecting the present Belief; for your <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Catalogue</hi> varies from theirs, and, let me say with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Offence, from any <hi>Catalogue</hi> you can produce.

               <p>As it is great Vanity and Weakness to infer Insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to the Light from the Imbecillity and Darkness that are in Men (occasion'd through their Rebellion to the Law and Light within) so from God's superadding Scripture, and other external Assistances to Men in that State: What

Does the Declaration jarr or make weak that from whence it came? Or because of God s (ondescension for a time to Externals, shall they turn the Light and Spirit out of the Office of <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> by being perpetuated the <hi>Rule</hi> and Judge?

               <p>The Scriptures are uncertain upon your Foundation, but not upon ours. Doth our mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

By no means; but we would have you come to receive them upon the Spirit's Testimony and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that gave them forth: And though we cannot allow them to be <hi>the Rule of Faith and Life</hi> under the Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospel, which is Power and Life it self; yet are they to be <hi>read, believed and fulfilled</hi> under the Gospel. For notwithstanding the Law written upon Stone, was not <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule, after the Son of God was revealed in him; yet the Son of God taught <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>fulfil</hi> the Righteousness de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by that Law: If it were to deny and reject (as some Persons enviously say of us) yea, to vilifie the Scripture, because we cannot allow it to be the Rule, &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> must be said to deny, reject and vilifie the Law written, at what time
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105069:101"/>
                  <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus became his Rule.</hi> There is a great Difference in asserting, that the Spirit is the Rule, and casting away &amp; vilifying of Scripture: And indeed it is but an old Fetch of the <hi>Devil's,</hi> to pretend Honour to the Letter, that he might the more unsuspectedly oppose the bringing in of the Dispensation of the Spirit; which the Letter it self testifies to. They that come to be led of the Spirit, arrive at the End for which Scripture was given forth; the Apostle <hi>John</hi> did as good as say the same thing, when he told them to whom he wrote, <hi>That the Anointing which they had received and abode in them, would lead them i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>to all Truth; and that they needed not that any man should teach them:</hi> To deny this to have been the Saints <hi>Teacher,</hi> is to deny as plain a Proposition as is in the whole Scripture; and that one Age of <hi>Christianity</hi> should have one <hi>Rule,</hi> and another Age <hi>another Rule;</hi> that, the Spirit; we, but the Letter; is more then any Man can prove: yet did <hi>John's</hi> so writing invalid the Scripture, or vilifie his own Epistle? Certainly, none will talk so idly. How then doth our lifting up the Light and Spirit of Christ, which fulfils the Scriptures (by bringing such as are led thereby to enjoy the good things therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) reject and vilifie the Scriptures? Does our living up to them by an <hi>higher Rule</hi> make us to <hi>deny and reprobate them? Erasmus</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> think them, then most to be valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when men are <hi>Witnesses</hi> of them: see on 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19, 20. I do acknowledge they contain an Account of several heavenly <hi>Prophecies, godly Reproofs and Instructions that ought to be obeyed.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ. A</hi> Rule and <hi>the</hi> Rule, are not one and the same thing. By <hi>the</hi> Rule of Faith and Life, I understand, <hi>the living, spiritual, immediate, omnipresent, discovering, ordering Spirit of God:</hi> And by <hi>a Rule,</hi> some Instrument, by and through which this great Rule may convey its Direction: Such a <hi>subordinate, secondary</hi> and <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If then it was <hi>this Light of the Eternal Word,</hi> that delivered these past things to <hi>Moses,</hi> and gave that Prospect of future things to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as no doubt it was (if Scripture be indubitable) then to say, the Light or Spirit could not do it, is <hi>Blasphemous.</hi> Again, To argue, because the Light does not reveal every Circumstance of History to each Individual that hath already an Account, that therefore it could not, is <hi>ridiculous:</hi> Were the History of the Transactions of Christ

and his Followers wanting, as before <hi>Moses,</hi> was that of <hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity; and that the Lord saw it needful to acquaint Mankind therewith, no doubt but the Light and Spirit, which revealed the Account of the Creation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Two Thousand Years after to <hi>Moses,</hi> and fore-told se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hundred Years many of those Transactions of Christ, by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> would also have supplyed that Want: But inasmuch as an Account is extant, and therefore not needed, 'tis vain to make that Objection.</p>
               <p>Again, It does not follow, because every man has a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Light to inform and rule him, that therefore he must needs know all which that Light knows, or is able to reveal to him: I return that Argument thus upon our Adversaries. They say, they have the Spirit of God; <hi>Then they know all that the Spirit of God knows, or can reveal to them:</hi> If the latter be absurd; then the former. Again, say they, <hi>The Light within did not reveal Christ to the</hi> Gentiles; <hi>that Christ should be born of a Virgin, &amp;c. therefore insufficient:</hi> I return upon them thus; <hi>The Spirit of God, given to the Children of</hi> Israel, Neh. 9. 20. <hi>did not acquaint them that Christ should be born of a Virgin, nor much more of his Life and Bodily Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; therefore the Spirit of God was insufficient.</hi> The like may be concluded against the Spirit in the Prophets: For 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11. that the Spirit had not reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all the Prophets the <hi>Time</hi> of Christ's Appearance and Sufferings; was the Spirit therefore an insufficient Rule to them? But that which falls heaviest upon our Adversaries is this, That the Scriptures, by their own Argument, are a most imperfect Account themselves of what was done, not relating the hundredth part of things; therefore as insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in not relating what is behind, as they would weakly render the Light or Spirit in not revealing to every Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual those things already related: Nay, they may as well infer Insufficiency to the Spirit, or the Light within, <hi>in that it does not now shew all that shall be to the End of the World,</hi> which in their proper Seasons there will be a Necessity to know, as to reflect insufficiency upon it, &amp;c. because it did not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel things now past, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And surther, to prove that the Light and Spirit within the <hi>Heathens</hi> was sufficient to discover these things: 'Tis granted on all hands, that the <hi>Sibylls</hi> had divine Sights; I mean not those made in their Name by some Professors of <hi>Christianity,</hi> as is charged on them, to gain Authority upon the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> against which <hi>Blundel</hi> writes; But those ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, Who prophesied <hi>of a Virgin's bringing forth a Son; and that he should destroy the Serpent, and replenish the Earth with Righteousness,</hi> as is before cited out of <hi>Virgil,</hi> who took it out of the Remains of <hi>Cumaa</hi>'s Verses, then among the <hi>Romans.</hi>

               <head>OF THE Judge of Controversie.</head>
               <p>I Shall explain what I mean by the Termes:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Judge, <hi>is one that has not only Power to determine, but Discerning to do it rightly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Controversie, <hi>is a Debate between two Parties about the Truth or Falshood of any Proposition to be determined by that Judge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence I am led to assert, that <hi>The Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie must be Infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though this may seem strange to some, 'tis neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less true in it self: For if the Judge be fallible, however he by his Authority may determine the Persons controverting into Silence; yet it does not follow, that he has given true Judgment, since he may as wel, nay, rather, determine falsly, then truly: so that Controversie can never be rightly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by a fallible Judge, therefore no true Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie. Indeed it is absurd, and a Contradiction in it self to think otherwise; since he that is uncertain can never give a certain Decision; and if not a certain one, then none to the Purpose. Nor ought any Person, no otherwise

               <p>Since then the Judge must be infallible, it will be worth our while to consider, where 'this insallible Judge is to be found. <hi>There is none Good but God,</hi> said God himself, when manifested in the Flesh, that is, <hi>originally,</hi> or as of himself; so truly there is none <hi>infaltible</hi> but God, as of himself, yet as the supream Good, is communicated unto man according to measure; so (well sayes Bp. <hi>Lati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Immanuel, <hi>God with men,</hi> as he is their <hi>Rule,</hi> so their <hi>Judge;</hi> he is the <hi>Law-giver,</hi> and therefore the best <hi>Irterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of any Point that may concern his own Law: and men are so far infallible as they are subject to his Voice, Light or Spirit in them, and no farther; for, <hi>humanum est errare,</hi> Man is Errable.

               <p>Obj. <hi>But how will this determin the Controversie, and allay the Fury of Debates on foot?</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Nothing like it, if man adhere to it; and if he does not, there is no way left, but the Wrath that is to be reveal'd: But most Perswasions are agreed about the absolute Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries in Religion, from that Witness God has placed in man's Conscience, viz. <hi>That God is; That he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him; That the Way of God is a Way of Purity, Patience, Meekne ss, &amp;c. without which no man can see the Lord:</hi> Nay, they accord in some considerable Matters <hi>superadded,</hi> as some of them speak, to wit, <hi>That God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested himself extraordinarily in the Flesh; that he gave his Life for the World, that such as believe and obey his Grace, receive Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sins and Life Everlasting.</hi> Now, I say, since these things men generally submit to, let them live up hereunto; and forbear wanton Scrutinies after Things or Notions that gender to Strife and Contention, and leave not Mankind better, but rather worse then they found them; and the World would be soon rid of Controversie: Holy Living, and not Disputing, would be the Business of Mankind. What more excellent Judgment can be given, then that men quit their Contentions about Notions and Opinions, and betake themselves to the Practice of that which God hath already shewn unto them; as spake both the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 8. and the Apostle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 1. 19. And if any

               <p>And this I (with my Brethren) must give Testimony of, that as God hath in these last Dayes been pleased to visit us by his Eternal Power, and in his Love and Kindness to open the Eyes of our Understanding, to see his Goodness both to our own particulars, and to Man-kind in General, in extending Saving Grace or Light to all.</p>
               <p>So it is by his Power that he hath raised up, and set forth Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of the same; the Sence we have of the Love of God, and his Glorious Light revealed, induceth and moveth us, even in the Spirit of the Gospel, to call others out of Darkness, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their Minds to the Appearance of the true Light in their Hearts and Consciences (in what degree soever it sheweth it self) which God in his Goodness hath universally afforded for Good to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that they might both know him, and their Duty to him: God did stretch forth his Hand, and reach unto us by his Power, for this very end, to gather us unto his divine Light or Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in our Hearts, that thereby we might receive the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Glory in the Face of Christ Jesus, as his former Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses did.</p>

               <p>Moreover, This we assert, that God that made Man for his own Glory (whose Mcrcies are over all his Works, and who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not the Death of Sinners, but rather that they should return and live) He hath not only throughout all Ages universally affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an Unchangeable Principle of Divine Light, which he hath placed in man, to direct him his Way out of Darkness and Sin; but also he signally visits him at times with Living Appearances, Motions and Opperations of his Light and Spirit, to his Reproof and Conviction, thereby often warning and calling Man out of Iniquity; as the Spirit of God did strive with the old World that had corrupted us Way before him, and was destroyed by the Flood, for its Flood of Iniquity; and he gave his good Spirit unto the Rebellious <hi>Jews,</hi> which they grieved and vexed, until he became their Enemy, and fought against them: He by his Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings enlightened the World, and the Earth trembled and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

as his Inward Light opens Man's Understanding and the Eyes thereof.</p>
               <p>Howbeit Man having transgressed this Divine Principle, and his Mind being alienated from it, and blinded by the God of this World: God having Bowels of Pitty still remaining, he hath been pleased so far to commiserate poor lost Man, as to afford and extend those pretious Promises, as the more eminently to declare, shew forth and renew his Love Light and Power, for man's Recovery out of his Lost and Dark Estate: As that the Seed of the Woman should bruise the Serpents Head; and this did Christ in general (and doth in particular) by the Power of the Father, which can no wayes lessen nor detract from his Light within, nor be any Inconsistency with its directing Men to the same Power of God, for the subduing and bruising Satan under their Feet, which in their own particulars they must experience, whoever attain to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance or Salvation from the Power of Sin and Satan.</p>
               <p>As also God hath promised to make a New-Covenant with his People; Its new, not as opposed to the Light within, as implying its waxing old (but new) as that the old Covenant without, (which the <hi>Jews</hi> broke) was to decay and vanish, this New-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant being a Covenant of Light, Life and Peace, a Covenant whereby he takes away and forgives Sin; This they only have a Part in, who obey the Universal Light of the Son of God within, which no Way differs in Nature from the Covenant it self, nor can it oppose the Ends of it; but is a Light of the same Life and Fulness that is enjoyed in the Covenant or Agreement with God, moving and conducing to the very same End and Agreement as ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And this New-Covenant is the last Dispensation of God in Christ to Man, wherein his Highest, Spiritual and Saving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is to be received, by all that truely obey his Light; and though this be new as to his renewed glorious Discovery herein; yet he who is the Life of this Covenant, and given for a Covenant and Salvation, is the first and the last, the Rock of Ages, whom God hath decreed to anoint or set up upon the Hill of his Holiness, even the Holy Hill of Sion, that he may subdue and rule the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and be the Salvation of God to the Ends of the Earth, more abundantly to be manifest in these last Ages, wherein his Church cometh out of the Wilderness, and the Holy City New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is discovered from Heaven as a Bride prepared for the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105069:113"/>
and the Lord God and the Lamb (as promised) is the Light thereof, and the Nations of them that are saved shall walk in the Light of this City, and for this End is the Gospel made known and preached again, after a long Night and Reign of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Christ, Beast, false Prophet, Dragon</hi> and <hi>Whore,</hi> whose Judgment is revealed, even against all the dark Whorish Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Hypocritical Envieus Agents of <hi>Anti-Christ</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> who do not only envy, oppose and gain-say the Truth, and undervalue the True Light, as its an Universal Principle in man, but also resist and strive against the Glorious Breaking forth and Discovery thereof in our Dayes; for which the Lord will rebuke them, and he that sits in Heaven hath them in Derision.</p>
               <p>And all such <hi>Babylonish Builders,</hi> and <hi>Envious Agents;</hi> as divers of these Men, called <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> or <hi>Dippers,</hi> now shew themselves to be, whose Malice, Madness and Folly shall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to all Men; why do they rage, and fret, and revile, but because the Light is sprung up, and the Over-spreading Day of God is broken forth, who hath said, <hi>as truely as I live, all the Earth shall be filled with the Glory of the Lord, Num. 14. 21.

               <p>At this Satan is offended, and his Agents are angry; These our present Opposers vent forth their Confusion, Envy and Strife, though it be against the Stream; they are wearying themselves for very Vanity; the Fire (which they have kindled in their Envy against the Lord's Heritage, wherein they are labouring) shall devour them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. These <hi>Anabaptists Babylonish</hi> Confusion greatly appears about the Light, which is in every Man, as Men whom Enmity hath blinded, and whose Minds are alienated from it into gross

Darkness; Though the Controversie between us is not upon the Question, <hi>Whether there be a Light, or any Light in every man</hi> (for thus far we both agree in the Affirmative) but <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God hath given a Divine or Sufficient Light to every Man, to shew and direct him out of Sin and Evil, to God who is Light, and the Giver of Light for Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> which we affirm, but these <hi>Dippers</hi> deny, especially such of them who are <hi>particular Electioners or Predestinarians,</hi> whose partial Doctrine doth not really place the Cause of Men's Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon their Neglect (or Disobedience) of the Light given them; but originally upon God's secret Decree against them, and his with-holding saving Light or Grace from them (as they both falsly and partially imagine) however its confest to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to all, in preaching the Gospel without Exception or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Persons.</p>
               <p>But under what Terms or Names do these our Opposers repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this Light, which they confess is in every Man to prove it Insufficient, either for a Rule or Guide to Salvation. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they call it <hi>a Creature,</hi> sometime <hi>a Natural Light,</hi> sometime <hi>the Substance of the Law, or first Covenant,</hi> which they grant ought to be improved. Sometimes, after a more gross manner, they blasphemously represent it as a <hi>Mis-guiding Light, directly opposing the Covenant of Grace, and to be rejected;</hi> but how well this agrees with its being a Light given of God to be improved (surely sor a good End) I leave to the Serious Impartial Reader to judge, of which he may see further about in the following Answer to <hi>Thomas Hicks.</hi>

               <p>To his four first Assertions, I query, Is that Life which is the Light of Men, <hi>John</hi> 1. 4. divine in it self? the Light of Jesus Christ as the Eternal Word? able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and bring Man clearly to see the Invisible things of God, even his Eternal Power and Godhead? (as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed from <hi>Rom,</hi> 1. 19, 20.) And yet is this Light neither able to understand the Worship that's due to him, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ Jesus concerning his coming to save Sinners, how Sin came into the World, nor yet to acquaint Man with the Knowledge of the Resurrection? can the Light apprehend or bring men to see God's Eternal Power, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105069:117"/>
yet neither bring them to understand the Cause of Man's Separation and Death from God, nor his Duty or Restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God again? How manifestly in consistent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory are these? and how plainly doth he charge men's Ignorance (and Defects for want of Obedience) upon the Light within? And then, what is it given for, and what can it do? But these Assertions are grounded upon his taking it for granted, that <hi>it is not a Light of Grace, but of Nature,</hi> when that Life which is the Light of Men is granted to be divine in its own being, able to discover the Eternal Power and Godhead, then which there is not a higher Power; but how this divine Light should become Natural as a Creature, we are still to enquire, as that which neither <hi>T.

                  <hi>must be a Light of Nature or of Grace; This Light cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the Light of Grace, because the Scripture doth suppose a time when Men are without it: It is said, after those Dayes I will put my Laws in their Hearts, and they shall know me; that must be the Light of Grace.</hi>

And because the State and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it is both the having God's Laws written in his People's Hearts and Minds, their knowing him to be their God, and they to be his People; and its a Covenant of Mercy and Forgiveness of Sins past; It doth not therefore follow, that none of his Law is in them before they come to this Holy Attainment and Blessed Agreement; though his Laws are not so universally written or deeply engraven in their Hearts before, for its now granted by divers of our Opposers, who are of the more moderate.</p>

                  <p>FIrst, That there is a divine Light in every man, which is of a saving Property in its self; and therefore suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to guide and direct man to God, and so to Salvation. And for its being a divine Light, I have urged <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 4. In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Light is the certain Guide and Rule to true Believers in matters of Faith, Spiritual Worship and Obedience to God [and therefore that which can give a right Understanding of the Holy Scriptures.]</p>
                  <p>These our Assertions are chiefly quarelled at by <hi>T.H.</hi> and some of his Brethren, though he very smoothly pretends, <hi>not to cavil,</hi> but that he may <hi>understand</hi> the Truth, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to know.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>To which I answer, It both hath appeared, and will appear against thee <hi>T. H.</hi> that thy Envy and Cavilling hath kept thee from the right Understanding and Knowledge of the Light and Salvation, that thou art now to seek at this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105069:122"/>
time of Day: And yet sayest, that all thou intendest is my <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Recovery,</hi> as in thy <hi>10th p.</hi> when as yet the Darkness covers thee, and keeps thee from the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Truth. But if thou hadst obeyed the Light of Christ within thee, thou wouldst have known both its Power and Sufficiency unto Salvation, and that this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which it leads to is Christ, who is both Redemption and Salvation to them who follow him in his Light, from Darkness, Sin and Defilement of Conscience (and so consequently from Wrath) which thou art yet highly guilty of, and from which thy <hi>Water-Baptism</hi> has not washt thee.</p>
                  <p>T. H. <hi>You express your selves with great Varity; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you say 'tis Christ,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou shewest thy self a dull cavilling <hi>Baptist;</hi> must we be tied up to one Word to express a Principle by, when the Scriptures allow of Varieties for Demonstration to divers Capacities, which doth not alter the Matter? This divine Light in man is exprest in the Scripture with as much Variety of Words as we do.</p>
                  <p>As its called the Life, the Light, a Gift, Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Seed, Kingdom of Heaven within, a measure of the Gift of Christ, the Grace of God, &amp;c. yet one and the same spiritual and divine Life or Light.</p>
                  <p>T. H. <hi>Notwithstanding thy most diligent Attendance to the Light in thee, that which thou callst the Light in thee hath in many things mis-guided thee, p. 3.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Now thou beginnest to be mad again the Light within; that which I call the Light within, is the very same that Christ and his Witnesses did witness to (to wit) In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men; therefore thou hast blasphemously accounted this a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiding Light.</p>
                  <p>And in thy <hi>7th. pag.</hi> hast plainly contradicted thy self herein, where thou <hi>appealest to the Light in me,</hi> and grantest <hi>it ought to be obeyed:</hi> See how thou hast broke the neck of thy corrupt cause; if it were a mis-guiding Light, how
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105069:123"/>
dost thou for Proof appeal to it (as Rule) and grantest it ought to be obeyed? ought that which is mis-guiding to be obeyed? But the Light within ought, therefore it will not mis-guide.</p>
                  <p>T. H. saith, G. W. <hi>in his Discourse upon it urged that text</hi> Joh. 1. 4. <hi>In him was Life and the Life was the Light of men. If the Life</hi> (said he) <hi>be the divine Essence</hi> (my Words were, If that Life be of the divine Being) <hi>the Light must be so also.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This Argument thou didst never answer to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose yet, but cavillest, and draws what Absurdities thou pleasest upon thy own Forgeries, as will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, only sillily thou argued against it thus, viz.</p>
                  <p>T. H. <hi>That the Life or Light spoken of,</hi> Joh. 1. 4, 9. <hi>is not supernatural, because it is the Light of the Word, as a Creator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> To which was answered, that its false and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent Doctrine; For the Light of the Eternal Word is supernatural, because the Light of the Eternal Word the Creator. See here the Reason thou rendrest for its not being supernatural, proves it super-natural; for because its of this divine Relation it must be divine. And thou shifts but very sorrily to come off here, when thou tellest me, that <hi>the Life and Light commnuicated to every man from that Eternal Word, is not supernatural, Eternal and Divine.</hi> But for this, we have only thy Say-so, contrary to what thou hast granted before, to wit, <hi>as being the Light of the Eternal Word.</hi> Neither could thy other Shift serve thy turn, viz.</p>
                  <p>T. H. <hi>That the Life which is in God, which is the Light of Men,</hi> Joh. 1. 4. <hi>is divine as it is in God, but natural as it is in man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Conclusion of this is Blasphemy; for that divine Life is Immutable because divine, it did not loose his Divinity by being given to man; for being divine, 'tis no more subject to mutation than God is. Remember here, how thou wast nonplust, and how thou art in a Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth; and of this thou dost not clear thy self in all thy perverse cavilling against us.</p>

But instead of taking notice of the Words, <hi>his Immediate Illumination or Shining,</hi> thou art pleased to quarrel upon the Words, <hi>such as is the Cause, such the Effect must be;</hi> and thus thou proceedest upon it, viz.</p>
                  <p>T. H. <hi>From this kind of Reasoning we may conclude not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Light within, but every Creature both Beasts and Trees are God, these being the Effects of Infinite Wisdom; dost thou not tremble at this Consequence,</hi> p. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> How causlesly dost thou quarrel? Are both Beasts and Trees Immediate Effects of God's Power? Did he not cause both Plants and Trees to grow out of the Earth? <hi>2ly.</hi> Were these Immediate? To be sure I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver affirmed so many Gods as there are Effects of Infinite Wisdom.</p>
                  <p>But be it remembred, that I never called the divine Life, which is the Light of men, a <hi>meer Effect,</hi> but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of the Word Effect with reference to the Immediate Illumination or Shining of God in the Heart, as being of a divine Nature, because God is the Enlightener and Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: And thou denying the Light to be of the divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, because communicated, I urged this Argument; That if the Life be divine, or of the divine Being, then the Light in man must be divine, because the Life that was in God was that Light; and such as is the Cause, such is the Effect, in some sence holds true, in all the Effects of Infinite Wisdom, true in all Creatures as they were made <hi>good;</hi> God, the Cause being the chiefest Good, who beheld all that he had made, that it was <hi>very good,</hi> And God who is Light is the Fountain of Life and Light,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105069:124"/>
whose divine Life or Light it self (which is the Light of men) I never intended to be a meer Effect, strictly taken as an Act of Power or thing made or created; but as the Illumination or Immediate Shining in man, immediately and naturally flowing from God the Fountain of Light, (its Envy makes thee carp and cavil) and was not the Effect of the Law written in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Hearts, of the Nature of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Canst think thou art Ingenuous? Dost think that I do not own Varieties of Effects from the Infinite Wisdom and Power of God, as not only supernatural but natural, both mediate, providential and immediate Effects, as well as Increated, Immediate Products of Life, Light and Vertue, flowing naturally from him? Yet though divine Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as manifested in man, be an Immediate Act or Effect; the Light or Life which doth illuminate is greater; for it is the Cause which is more then the Effect, though this Illumination hath a Living Vertue and Resemblance of the Cause in it, and they are inseparable: So that the Life which is the Light of Men, <hi>Joh.</hi>

                  <p>Again thou leavest out part of the Controversy between us, whichw as thus. viz.</p>
                  <p>T. H. <hi>The Light in every Man cannot be the divine Essence in God; for God is in Heaven, and his Divine Essence is not communicable, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>This Question in the Narrative <hi>T. H.</hi> is willing to wave, as that which pinches him, and thus does he reply to the Words before, viz.</p>
                  <p>T. H. <hi>Then it seems that the Lightwithin and the Omni pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God is one and the same thing. Is this your Champion.</hi> a. 4.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou scoffs, but durst not answer.

                  <p>T. H. <hi>THough it be granted, that God is an Infinite, Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and Perfect being; will it therefore follow, that every thing he created and communicated is his own being? What man but a</hi> Quaker <hi>would dare affirm this?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou wrongst the <hi>Quakers</hi> (as thou callst them) its none of their Argument, that because God is Infinite, therefore every thing that he creates is so: But because of his Infiniteness and Omni-presence he is near unto all men, even shining in their Hearts.</p>
                  <p>But it is thy gross Error to take for granted, that his Light in every man is <hi>Created;</hi> See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. God hath shined in our Hearts, and that Christ that enlightens every man that cometh into the World is God, in worshipping of whom we do not worship a Creature, as thou falsly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates against us, p. 6.</p>
                  <p>But thou shewest thy self against the Light, as an Agent of the Son of Perdition, who exalts himself above <hi>all</hi> that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God, 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
                  <p>Is not man this Temple of God by right? And hath not this Son of Perdition or Mystery of Iniquity been exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105069:125"/>
in Apostates above all that's called God? And what was that that was called God and that was worshipped, above which this Son of Perdition exalted himself? Was it not a Manifestation of the divine Life and Light? And what was the Apostles Rule to try and reveal this Son of Perdition by, when he wrought in a Mystery, and as God did sit in the Temple of God, shewing himself to be God? Is it not the Day of Christ that reveals, and so God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that makes manifest this man of Sin? And is not God then the Saints Rule to discover this Mystery?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou hast wronged my Light; sor God is my Light and my Salvation; and Christ is my Life and Light who is perfect; and this Christ we preach, as the Light of the World, that enlightens every man that comes into the World; though we do not say that he is revealedly or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly the Light in every man, or by Way of Union, nor yet that Christ (considered as thou describes him, p. 11.) as to his outward Birth and Person is in any, much less in every man; Yet this hinders not, but that as God, or as with Relation to his divine Life and Light, he is Infinite over all, and through all, and in all; yet to those only revealed and united, who truely obey and follow him in the Measure of his Light which is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally given unto Man-kind.</p>
                  <p>T. H. <hi>The Apostle did needlesly exhort the</hi> Corinthians <hi>to examine themselves, whether Christ were in them or no</hi> (viz. If he were in every man) p. 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Nay, he bad them examine themselves whether they were in the Faith; for saith he, know you not your own selves that Jesus Christ is in you except you be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.</p>
                  <p>And if thy Mind were not reprobated and estranged from his Light in thee, thou mightst know him revealed in thee. But as Christ the annointed is a Mystery, he is hid from thee and many more, though his Light be in thee and others that is sufficient to reveal Christ, and leave you without Excuse, and to condemn you for Iniquity.</p>

                     <hi>4thly,</hi> Thy denying the Light in every man to be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to guide to Salvation, is plainly enough contradicted by thee, in thy confessing Christ to be the Life and Light of men, p. 22. whose Life and Light is sufficient. And for what end is his Light in every man given, if not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect unto Salvation? Thou art not so ingenuous as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, though thou both appealst to it, and grantst it ought to be obeyed; this will stand in Judgment against thee, for thy false Judgment given against it in other Places, as also what thou further acknowledgest, viz.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> If thou didst obey this something, or Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (thus acknowledged by thee) in shunning those many Evils thou art checkt for, and performing the good to

which it excites thee, thou wouldst both know and speak better of it then thou dost, as that which both moves and leads in the Way to Salvation, which is from Sin here, and from Wrath hereafter, and so unto Christ, who is the Giver of it.</p>
                  <p>But it is probable thou thinkst thou art an elect Person, and so in thy Presumption slites the Light within, as not only Insufficient of it self to guide unto Salvation, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so as a mis-guiding Light: And this Doctrine herein op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth thy Maker, and his Universal good to Man-kind; How then thinkest thou, that the Rebellious can be left without Excuse, or God be known to be clear, when he judges?</p>

                  <p>If all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the Light, how dost thou exclude those gross Sins of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution and Murder from being reproved by the Light?

of the true God, was therefore able to direct them into the right Way of worshipping him.</p>

                  <p>And that thousands of Man-kind are reproved for not believing in the Son of God, is evident by the Spirit of Truth, reproving the World of Sin, because they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not in the Son of God, in that they do not believe in his Life or Light within, they do not believe in him, who is the Giver of it, and therefore reproved by the Spirit; and surely many Thousands are comprehended in this World of Unbelievers.</p>

                  <p>But here thou art very dark; for though Christ's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation did differ both in degree and manner of Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and though, when in the Fulness of time he came to fulfil the Prophesies and Types of him; the Power and Glory of the Father was more fully and eminently and signally manifest in him, then in any before; and the Light more shone forth exemplarily in him; yet it follows not, that the true Christ was not in being in <hi>Moses</hi> and in the Prophets time; or that his Light was not in some Degree manifested, both before, under, and since the Law.</p>
                  <p>If the true Christ was in being, and in any degree ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, his Light needs must; but the true Christ was in being from Everlasting, and in time universally shining and manifest in some degree throughout all the Generations of the Righteous, since the World began, being the Rock of Ages, that spiritual Rock whereof all <hi>Israel</hi> drank, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. who said, before <hi>Abraham</hi> was I am; this great and most eminent Prophet God promised to raise up unto <hi>Israel</hi> of their Brethren, which was in a more familiar Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, even in the Flesh, though his spiritual Out-goings were before from of old, and he was called the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the Creation of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 14. who faith, behold I stand at the door and knock, if any man hear my Voice and open the Door, I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me, <hi>ver.</hi> 20.

                  <p>Now though the pure Light and Glory of the Father was more fully, eminently and signally then ever before manifest, and shining forth in him, as coming in the fulness of time to consummate and end the Types and Shadows of the first Covenant; whereby he gave a more eminent and

The Scriptures testifie against all Sin, but do not shew unto men their particular Sins; many read the Scriptures, who over-look the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of their own Hearts; but if they Eye this Light of the Son of God within, it will manifest unto them their particular Evils, and shew them their Thoughts, Motions and Actions, and the Tendance of each; so do not the Scriptures, they cannot of themselves convince any, as the divine Light can. And this divine Light within disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers all the Temptations, and mysterious Workings, and Depths of <hi>Satan</hi> to that Soul that waits in it, as they are met withall, and as <hi>Satan</hi> attempts to insnare, that the Soul may shun his Snares and Wiles upon all Occasions and in all Tryals; and this does not the Letter without.</p>
                  <p>This Light within also, as a perfect and immediate Rule of Faith, directs the Soul in all the Operations of Faith, against all the Innumerable Temptations, and Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and Besetments of the Enemy, and it opens an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Eye of Faith, and is the Immediate Guide to see him who is Invisible through all, but so is not the Scripture: All which being seriously considered, the Light within is the Rule of Faith, and not the Scripture.</p>

                  <p>That G. F. mentions in his great Mystery, &amp;c. p. 68. and 100. <hi>That the Soul is part of God and of his being, and that it is without beginning,</hi> p. 91. and also infinite. <hi>p.</hi> 29. Whence thy Inference is, viz.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> We cannot expect any impartial or fair Dealing from thee, while Prejudice and Envy do possess thee, who hast both falsly and ignorantly represented <hi>G.

And all these things mentioned by thee, he does not speak of the Soul or Spirit of man, as made or formed in him, though composed of Spiritual Parts, nor use these Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the Soul or Spirit of the Creature Man, is a part of God without beginning; neither was the Phrase (part of God) originally <hi>G. F</hi>'s but his Opposers, only admitted of by him by Way of Question, as plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, p. 100. with Relation to that which came out from God, that immediate Spirit of Life, which gives Being Life and Subsistance to the Soul, and he doth distinguish between the Soul and Christ the Bishop of it, between the Soul and the Saviour of it, as plainly appears in many places of the said Book, and the Soul could no otherwise
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105069:132"/>
be deemed infinite, then as Man is said to be the Image and Glory of God, namely by a Participation thereof; so he speaks of the Soul in a two-fold Sense; as,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>First,</hi> With reference to that which came out from God (which is the Original Life or Soul of every Man's Soul)</item>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> With Respect to man, as being made a living Soul by Vertue of the Spirit of Life proceeding from God.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And so with Relation to the first, he questions; Is not that of God, which comes out from God? <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 68. But with Relation to the latter, viz. Man, he speaks distinctly of the Soul, as neither God nor Christ; neither doth he confound the Being of man with the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Being of his Creator, as is implyed in our Opposers angry Charge; for as every Spiritual Being or Existence is not divine; so the Spirit or Spiritual Parts of Man are not God, though a divine Light and Capacity is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in them.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>G. F.</hi> doth not only speak of the Soul in a two-fold Sense, viz. with Relation to its original Life, and with Relation to man in his Spirituality, but of the Soul of man as in several States; as,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Of the Souls being in Death in Transgression, man's Spirit unsanctified; the Soul being come into Death, transgressing the Law, &amp;c. <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 91.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therein he cannot intend the infinite Essence, Being or Life of God or Christ, which is immutable, and unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geably pure and holy, though thereby the Soul is upheld in its Being and Immortality, whether in Comfort or Misery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of the Soul and Spirit of Man as sanctified, living to God in his Life, through a diligent hearkening to the Counsel and Voice of God, and feeling of his Hand, which brings up out of Death, and restores the Soul, that it may live in Christ the Preserver and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer of it, to praise God the Saviour, being one Soul (in that State) as they that are joyned to the Lord are one Spirit.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As also <hi>G. F.</hi> adds, viz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Every Man that cometh into the World having a Light from Christ Jesus, the Way out of the Fall, the second <hi>Adam;</hi> receiving the Light, they receive Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105069:132"/>
and Sanctification, whereby their Spirits, Bodies and Souls are sanctified, <hi>Great Mystery, p.</hi> 91.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note here still, that he plainly distinguisheth between the Soul and him that redeems and sanctifies it; so that the Soul or Spirit of Man, is neither God nor Christ; but as much inferior in Subordination to God and Christ, as the Creature Man is to the Creator, or that which is saved and redeemed to him that saveth and redeemeth.</p>
                  <p>The sum of what's said amounts to this candid Account about the Soul, viz.</p>
                  <p>That the Soul and Spirit of Man is not the very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, nor a part of God, though the original Life of the Soul which came out from God is immutable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; there is a divine and infinite Life in the Soul of Man (which we would have you be sensible of.)</p>
                  <p>This is the Life of Lives, the Soul of Souls, the Being of Beings; by which the Soul of man is made to subsist in its Being and Immortality, whether in the Kingdom of Glory or Pit of Darkness; although this original or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life in the Soul stands clear and free from both the Guilt, Torment and Anguish, that comes upon every Soul of Man that does Evil.</p>
                  <p>Every Soul must appear before the Lord in its own proper Image and Nature, which it hath born, been under, and received while in the Body (having been subject either to the Spirit and Power of God, or to the Spirit and Power of the wicked one) wherein its capable of either being a Vessel of Mercy and Love, or a Vessel to hold Wrath and Anguish, according to what it doth here love and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and contract to it self whether Good or Evil.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as its commanded, Take heed to thy self and keep thy Soul diligently, &amp;c. love the Lord thy God with all thy Soul, &amp;c. and then thou wilt know Christ to be the Salvation of it.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture speaks variously of the Soul, and as in divers States and Conditions, viz. 1. Of the Soul of God which is Immutable. 2. Of the Soul of Man, and that, 1. Of the Righteous, which really pertake of the divine Nature. 2. Of the Wicked, which pertake of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Enmity: And these differ in their Affections, the one being to Good, and the other to Evil.</p>
                  <p>Mention is made of the Soul, as under the Power of Sin, Death and the Grave by man's Disobedience and Fall, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105069:133"/>
of the Soul as quickned, raised up, and delivered or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Power of Christ, the living ingrafted Word.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the Soul is mentioned, as including the whole man; sometimes, as distinguished from the Body; sometimes its esteemed as the Life, and sometimes the Spirit or Breath of Life, and an active Soul inspired, and there is a State wherein the Word of the Lord is said to divide asunder betwixt the Soul and Spirit.</p>

Knowledge of him as our Life and Light; we must needs reverently own and make use of those Testimonies in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which concur with our Knowledge of him, and that to evince the Truth concerning his Light to them that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a Belief of the Scriptures, while yet they are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his Light testified of therein.</p>

                  <p>But suppose many of these Stories were true against pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Persons: Hast thou herein dealt ingenuously, thus no inveigh against Principles, from personal Failings of such as profest them; Is there no such thing as divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the Guidance of an Infallible Spirit to be known, because some do err or are mistaken that profess them? Or no such thing as an infallible Light, because some have differed in some particular Cases that have profest it? Wouldst thou thus be dealt by concerning thy <hi>Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> or pretended Gospel-Institutions?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:105069:136"/>If it should be argued, that because the Dippers are greatly divided among themselves, and that about Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Doctrines; and some of them have been grosly corrupt and debaucht in their Lives, therefore their dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or Water-Baptism is no Institution of Christ: wouldst thou look upon this as a good Argument?</p>
                  <p>Nay further, Do you not much differ among your selves in several principal matters? As about personal Election and general Redemption, and so about the Death of Christ, whether for all or some, and about Free-Will, the seventh Day Sabbath, and laying on of Hands, and about the manner of administring your pretended Lord's Supper, and about the Immortality of the Soul; as also some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming <hi>Water-Baptism</hi> to be of Necessity to Salvation, others not, with several other things; and yet most of you that thus differ, profess the Scriptures to be your Rule.</p>
                  <p>If then I should from hence argue, that therefore the Scriptures are not the Rule, because you that profess them to be so are so repugnant one unto another, thou wouldst readily reflect Absurdity upon me, though to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of thy own Cause. Why dost thou so much slite the Light within, and insinuate against Revelation, or Perfection from personal mistakes, Weaknesses or Failings of some particulars, supposed.</p>
                  <p>Nay, I may further except against thy Impertinency here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, who durst not produce one Argument against the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon this Occasion when thou wast desired; for that an occasional Mistake, Slip, or circumstantial Difference is no general Argument to prove a man a false Prophet or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster never called of God; seeing that,</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Eli</hi> and a <hi>Samuel</hi> might be mistaken, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13, 14. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 16. <hi>Verse</hi> 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>A young Prophet seduced by an old, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Paul</hi> revoking his Reflection, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 5.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Paul</hi> and a <hi>Banabas</hi> in a Contest, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 39.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Peter</hi> withstood by <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>Yet these are no Arguments, that therefore these men were never called of God, nor had divine Revelation to prophesie or preach.</p>
                  <p>Neither on the other Hand does it argue that they fell short of Perfection or Infallibility, when they came to see into the Depths of Satan, and how any of them have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105069:137"/>
been overtaken; for through that which is perfect they out-grew Imperfections and Weaknesses.</p>
                  <p>I must yet take notice of what thou speaks <hi>of a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that came from</hi> Paul Hobson, <hi>who on Purpose to try them spake through a Trunk, yet could they not distinguish his Voice from the Immediate Voice of God, p.</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> Thou hast herein grosly belyed the <hi>Quakers,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they either thus tryed or cheated; howbeit dost thou think that this adds to the Credit of thy Cause? Was not <hi>Paul Hobson</hi> an eminent Dipper, or Brother <hi>Baptist</hi> of yours, who (when he grew weary of a poor shattered whimsical man in his House, who was no <hi>Quaker</hi>) your Brother <hi>Paul</hi> did feign a Call as from God through a hollow Trunk to the poor man to get rid of him; as I have also heard the Story credibly related in the County of <hi>Durham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now was not this a horrible Deceit and Cheat of your Brother <hi>Paul</hi> to presume such an Invention, as in the Name of God; whether was he the Deceiver or the poor man deceived most to be blamed? Let the ingenuous Reader and thy own Conscience judge.</p>
                  <p>And so how dully and sorrily thou hast come off, to bring this as an Instance either against the <hi>Quakers</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation? How hast thou manifested thy Folly herein? And wouldst thou and thy Brethren be thus dealt by, to be all reflected upon, or disparaged by the Miscarriage of any particular Persons supposed among you, thou wouldst be ill pleased if I should speak in earnest; behold what Deceivers the <hi>Baptist</hi> Preachers are, seeing <hi>Paul Hobson</hi> their Brother did so impiously deceive and cheat the poor shattered man. And so what Advantage hath thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Reflection upon us, been to thee or thy Cause.</p>
                  <p>Again thou bring'st an Instance against the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, thus,</p>
                  <p>T. H. <hi>Above all, that eminent Difference may not be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between</hi> J. N. <hi>and</hi> G. F. <hi>at or after</hi> J. N's <hi>publick Entrance into</hi> Bristol, <hi>when they called each other the Children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and departed from the Light; A great Party adhered to both in this Opposition of their Lights and Revelations, p.</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ. First,</hi> This is a false Relation, the Words were
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105069:138"/>
not so between them, nor was the Opposition at <hi>Bristol.</hi> 2. Nor was the Opposition from the Light in both. 3. Its true, that <hi>J. N.</hi> was witnessed against by several for turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aside from the Light at that time; and therefore it is most unjust in thee to cast his Failings upon the Light, or instance it as an Argument against us. 4. <hi>J. N.</hi> came by the Light to a Sence of his Loss and repented of it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unjustly imputed either to the Light, to <hi>G. F.</hi> or us. 5. Seeing there was Opposition between them, it is a most malitious Conclusion of thine, from hence to call us <hi>Cheats and Impostors,</hi> p. 28. as also in thy 17. pag. thou calls our first fundamental Principle <hi>a meer Cheat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus thy wicked Design is not only against the Persons, but against the Principles; whereas our first fundamental Principle is the true Light, against which thou hast thus blasphemed; for which God will rebuke thee, not only as an impertinent but a most malitious Opposer.</p>
                  <p>And to prove thy Lye, <hi>that we endeavour to beget in the minds of men an ill Opinion of the Scriptures,</hi> thou dost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance my Saying, <hi>that which is spoken from the Spirit of Truth in any, is of as great Authority as the Scriptures and greater. p.</hi> 28. But leavest out my Explication, viz. <hi>as received, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately proceeding from the Spirit and spoken in the Sence thereof;</hi> that is, in the living Demonstration of the Spirit to the Conscience.</p>
                  <p>This I still testifie is of greater Authority then the meer Letter or Writing, though containing the same Words so spoken as I did then instance and explain thus, viz. <hi>As Christ's Words were of greater Authority when he spake, then the</hi> Pharisees <hi>reading the Letter, &amp;c.</hi> But do not you <hi>Baptists</hi> deem your Preaching of equal Authority with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when you say, what you preach is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> (however intermixt with your own uncertain Meanings.)</p>
                  <p>In thy 35. pag. to prove thy calling me <hi>a Knave, a false and deceitful Man;</hi> thou sayst, <hi>I give not the least hint of thy Explications of thy Positions;</hi> whereas I writ thy Doctrines for thee to give thy own Explications, least thou shouldst say I wronged thee; yet to this Day I must confess, that some of thy Positions were so absurd and incongruous that I could not hear thee give the least rational Explication upon them, as those mentioned upon <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 4. viz.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Of the Light being natural, because the Light of the Eternal Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:105069:139"/>Secondly, <hi>That 'tis divine as in God, but natural as in man;</hi> for this thou didst not shew so much as the least Colour of Reason or rational Explication.</p>
                  <p>And must I be accounted a <hi>Knave,</hi> guilty of <hi>Deceit,</hi> a <hi>false deceitful Fellow</hi> for not writing all thy Impertinencies? And yet thou takest the Liberty to leave out my Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was most material to my Position (for the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Demonstration of the Spirit) while it was set down in Print before thy Eye. Oh! what gross Hyocrisie art thou guilty of, thus to rail and revile such as wish thee no Harm, when thou hast no Occasion given thee; and yet art guilty of that which thou falsly accusest another for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An other dark Accusation of thine is, of a Servant Maid, that should say the Bible is a good honest thing, but she lik't our Friends Books better, p.</hi> 29.</p>
                  <p>If thou hadst mentioned the Name of this Maid, and proved the Accusation, what is this to the Body of the <hi>Quakers?</hi> Though I suspect this Accusation not true; but if it were, doth thy inference follow, <hi>that our Proselites are thus taught?</hi> O abominable Wickedness! Where or when did we ever preach such Doctrine? We utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, and never heard any of our Friends held or owned it; knowing in our Conscience, the eminent and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Esteem we have of the Scriptures or Bible, as the principle Book extant in the World, though we may not slite but esteem all other Books dictated by the Spirit of Truth in their Places, and for the good ends intended.</p>
                  <p>Another Accusation is, that <hi>Fox and Hubberthorn said, the Scriptures are no standing Rule and that it is dangerous for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant People to read them, p.</hi> 29.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> First, As for being the only and standing Rule, they no where call themselves so, but refer us to God and Christ or Spirit within.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2ly,</hi> Thou hast wronged and mis-cited their Words in a more general terms then they are; their Words not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>'tis dangerous for ignorant People;</hi> but to their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary they say, <q>
                        <hi>The Letter which killeth is dangerous; for thou takest it here to war withal against the Saints, giving out thy carnal Expositions upon it — you read with Danger who make a trade of Scripture — but blessed is he that does read and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, &amp;c.</hi>

Now let the ingenuous <hi>Reader</hi> take notice of thy Abuse herein. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3ly,</hi> That it is dangerous for some ignorant or unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed People to read them, is evident, while unstable and prejudiced in their Minds, not regarding the Spirit or Light that gave them forth to learn by, and give them the right Understanding; for 'tis such as are unlearned who wrest them to their own Destruction.</p>
                  <p>Is not this dangerous for any to pervert them to their own Destruction? Is it therefore just in thee to compare them to <hi>Jesuites</hi> and <hi>Romanists</hi> who thus intend? Yet 'tis not dangerous but useful and profitable to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Honesty and Simplicity of mind, having regard to that divine Light and Inspiration of the Almighty that gives the true Understanding of them.</p>
                  <p>Another Story is of one <hi>Holbrow</hi> that should say, that the <hi>Scriptures were no better to him then an old Almanack.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This verifies the old Saying, that the Devil will play at a small game rather then stand out. But we utterly deny any such gross Comparison concerning the Scriptures. I am credibly informed of a <hi>Ranter</hi> that spake these Words above twenty Years ago; what's that to the <hi>Quakers?</hi> And we have heard of some <hi>Ranters</hi> that have thus grosly slited the Scriptures, but never any real <hi>Quaker.</hi> Howbeit thou art not wanting in Envy to brand us with such Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, how utterly soever the things be disowned &amp; abhorred by us: Some <hi>Baptists</hi> have turned <hi>Ranters,</hi> and others have mantained <hi>Ranterism,</hi> and others of them <hi>Poligamie;</hi> others again, eminent among them (as namely of their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) have turned <hi>Papists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now wouldst thou take it well, if I should endeavour to render you all odious upon their Account? 'Tis probable when they turned <hi>Ranters</hi> they had a very mean Esteem of the Scriptures. And if I should take this Course of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105069:140"/>
against the whole Body of you <hi>Baptists</hi> and <hi>Dippers;</hi> I might make a large Narrative of the gross Wickedness of many that have been eminent among you; but that is not my Way of confuting mens corrupt Principles, though sufficient to spoil the Credit of the guilty, and to render them unmeet Guides to others. Yet far be it from me to asperse all amongst you therewith, believing many called <hi>Anabaptists</hi> to be far more honest and sincere then thy self, or divers of thy Brethren.</p>

                  <p>As for that Contest between thee and <hi>John Story,</hi> I have heard a more full and impartial Account then thou givest, and how thou wast sufficiently baffled at it, and proved a false Accuser of the Principle of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as leading from Christianity to Heathenism, which could not be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to relate to those <hi>Gentiles</hi> that walked up to the Light or Law of God in their Hearts (for that was really pious and therefore Christian) but to the impious idolatrous Part: And though <hi>John Story</hi> and his Friends might justly except against the Priest's Book, as being an Adversary to us, perverting our Principles and representing them to our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage; yet <hi>John Story</hi> never receded from the suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of that divine Light of Christ in every man, to guide them to Salvation who believe in it and are obedient to it; not excluding the Counsel of such faithful Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters where they are sent, so to direct and turn mens minds from Darkness to the Light, wherein they still submit to the Light of Christ, as the Ground of their Ministry, and the sufficient chief Rule and Guide, which implies no defect in Christs Light, but on the Creatures Part, whose mind is alienated from the Light; the Insufficiency is not in any degree of the Light it self as a Rule, but they that are turned to it ought solely to depend upon it, in it to know and receive the Light of Life, and Power from Christ against Sin and the Devil.</p>

                  <p>T. H. <hi>What intollerable Pride and Arogancy have you arrived to? And all this in following (as you pretend) the Conduct of the Light within, improving it to the subverting and anihilating the Covenant of Grace, which is the only Way God hath revealed (since the Fall) for the Salvation of Sinners: Surely then this Light, which instead of directing what you do in a Way of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviency to the Ends of this Covenant, doth directly oppose it, is in that so far from being a sufficient Rule, that it ought to be rejected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Are all these no disparagement to the Light within? let the ingenuous Reader judge. Hast thou not herein manifestly opposed and deny'd what thou sayst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the Serviceableness of each degree of Light to its end: But what Service, if the following or Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any degree of the Light doth either anihilate or oppose the Covenant of Grace: What dark, mad and blasphemous Work hast thou here made against the Light within, which if it ought to be rejected, what account will be given to God for it; And he, should he give a Light so repugnant to his own Covenant?</p>

                  <p>T. H. <hi>How comes it to pass that Jesus Christ as to the great end of coming into the World, is so much neglected, and the Stress of many men's Hopes laid upon something in themselves? Hence the Hope of the Hypocrite is compared to the Spiders Web, being spun out of their own Bowels? Do you not see this in your selves who are the greatest Admirers of the Light within, p.</hi> 38.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Still thou runs upon thy gross mistake of the Light within, whereby thou falsely reflects upon us for relying on it: for,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>First,</hi> Our Hope and Dependance upon the least degree of the Light of Christ in us, which is the divine Life of him, <hi>as</hi> the Eternal Word; this can neither oppose nor neglect the great ends of Christ's coming into the World in the Flesh, any more then <hi>John</hi>'s bearing witness to the Life of the Word, being the Light of men, could oppose the Word becoming or taking Flesh.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2ly,</hi> What were those great ends of Christ's so coming into the World, but evidently to shew forth and exalt that divine Light and Salvation in a greater Fulness and Manifestation, which in some degree did before universally shine throughout all Ages; or otherwayes how could Christ be the Rock of Ages, or his Outgoings from of old from everlasting?</p>
                  <p>And whence in the dayes of his Flesh shewed he Light through his innocent Life, Ministry and Miracles, but from that divine Power and Glory of the Father in him; for God did work them by him?</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3ly,</hi> After its testified concerning God the Eternal Word, that in him (or in it) was Life, and the Life was the Light of men, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 4. Its said, that the Word was made Flesh and dwelt amongst us (or tabernacled in us) and we beheld his Glory, as of the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and of his Fulness have all we received Grace for Grace, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>Now mark, this discovery of his Glory, Grace and Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was a divine discovery, being <hi>as</hi> of the only begotten of the Father, of whom <hi>John</hi> said, he that cometh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me is preferred before me, for he was before me, <hi>verse</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>The divine Light of the Word was that by which they had this discovery of Christ, which was beyond that of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105069:143"/>
the outward or fleshly Appearance, which might be seen with a visible Eye, but the other only seen by the Eye invisible and Spiritual; So that this coming of Jesus Christ into the World, was so far from lessening or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying his spiritual Light of him as the eternal Word in men, that it was to increase the Knowledge of it, and in order to bring it forth in its Brightness and Glory for the Revelation of the perfect Day of Salvation, And herein he came to render the Appearance and Testimony of his Light within the more valid and effectual, men having er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and been estranged from it.</p>
                  <p>Now is it consistent with the Hope of the Hypocrite to obey the measure of the Light of Christ within, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to receive more? Is it not rather consistent with the Hope of the Hypocrite to hope that their Sins are pardoned and they justified by the Righteousness and Obedience of Christ wholely without them, while they are rebelling against, sliting and rejecting his Light within them, and so living in their Sins and Impurity?</p>
                  <p>And this is thy State and Hope as will further appear; for who have received Power to become the Sons of God, whom the World knoweth not, because it knew not him; they have that Hope and Expectation of being made like unto Christ, through his Appearance, and every man that hath this Hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. therefore this Hope which they have in them is both living and effectual, and to be fore it is not placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Darkness, but upon the Light.</p>
                  <p>For it is the Inlightening of the Eyes of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby a Soul is capable of seeing what is the Hope of his calling, and the Power that wrought in Christ, when God raised him up from the dead: Therefore thou who rejects the Light within, thy Eye is blind, thy Hope is the Hope of the Hypocrite, thou neglects the great ends of Christ's coming into the World, which was not only to condemn Sin in the Flesh, as his Light within effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doth, but also to shew and increase Light, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest the day of God's Salvation by his divine Power in delivering man from Sin and Wrath.</p>

                  <p>When did ever any of us express such contemptible Thoughts of Christ, his Offices or Sufferings? If we had never exprest any such thing, how comest thou to judge our Thoughts to be such?

                     </gap>hief? The Lord rebuke thee for this thy abominable Slander, as I doubt not but he will.</p>
                  <p>T. H. <hi>And esteem Justification by that Righteousness which Christ wholy fulfilled in his own Person without us, to be a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils, p.</hi> 38.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Though these are not our Words, we do not own the Doctrine, viz. That men are justified wholy without them, by what Christ fulfilled in his own Person only; for this is not the Language of the Scriptures which thou pretendest to be thy Rule, Christ fulfilled the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the Law in his Person, but here thou makest no Exception, but that Justification is by that Righteousness which Christ wholy fulfilled in his own Person without us, men will only believe this when they reject the Light within, as thou hast taught them.</p>
                  <p>But we are not justified by the Righteousness of the Law, nor by any Act of Christ, meerly as done in his Person, but by the Righteousness of Faith in which we are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105069:144"/>
interested in Christ, as we are Partakers of living Faith which are inseparable.</p>
                  <p>But what is this Justification thou wouldst advance, as wholy wrought without thee? Is it either in Reallity a making men just, or an accepting of them as Just and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous who are so in Reallity, or is it a reckoning of them so, who are actually sinful?</p>
                  <p>If the former, then 'tis not wholy wrought without, but the inward Effect of the Blood of Christ in cleansing from Sin is witnessed in order to bring forth this justified State.</p>
                  <p>If in the latter Sence (as thy Words import) then all must be in a justified State for whom Christ dyed; If their Justification was wholy wrought without them in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and then all men must be in a justified State; for Christ dyed for all men; and then what hast thou to do to revile or condemn any as thou hast done? those whom thou se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely opposest must be in as justified Estate as thou canst think thy self.</p>
                  <p>But if men receive the Pardon of Sin through true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Justification through living Faith in the Name of the Son of God, and by his Vertue and Blood, then are not all men justified, nor the Justification of any effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor fulfilled wholy in his Person without them; for,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Men are not in a justified State while their Sins are unremitted. 2. They are not in a justified State while the Wrath of God abides upon them: And mens Sins are unremitted while they impenitently persist in Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and the Wrath of God abides upon them who bc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not the Son.</p>
                  <p>Again we do not affront either the Grace or Wisdom of God in adding what more Light he pleases to any measure that he hath given, while we are witnessing against mens affronting that measure of Light and Grace which he hath already given to Man-kind.</p>
                  <p>T. H. <hi>This Light within directs not our Actions to those Holy and Spiritual Ends which the Scripture does: Alas, whereto do the best of mens Actions naturally tend, p.</hi> 37, <hi>and</hi> 38.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Here like a dull and dark Opposer still thou endeavourest to confound the Light within with man's cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature; whereas thou hast confest it to be not only such a Light as can discover God, and that he is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105069:144"/>
but also that Christ is the Life and Light of men; and also that it can discover morality, that its serviceable to its end, and that God's Soveraignity over man, and man's Inferiority to God ought to be acknowledged.</p>
                  <p>And doth not this extend to the same holy and spiritual Ends which the Scriptures direct to? What more holy then God's Soveraignity over man, and man's Subjection to, and Adoration of God? But according to Scripture, is it not an holy and spiritual End truely to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Besides, 'tis most natural and proper to a spiritual and divine Light to direct to sacred and spiritual Ends.</p>
                  <p>And if thou didst not vary and waver in thy Confusion from thy Concession to the Divinity of the Life and Light of the eternal Word, which is the Light of men, thou wouldst have spared much of thy Babylonish Work to the contrary, who in thy 39 pag. sayst, that thou <hi>opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And why dost thou oppose the Scriptures to the Light within? Or imply such a Difference between the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the Light within, while thou hast granted that the Light within is not only serviceable, but ought to be improved, as that which chccks for many Evils, and excites to Good: And does not this agree with the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Scriptures?

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Every one that doth Truth brings his Deeds unto the Light, which Light within being divine is sufficient to evince it self as supream Rule in the Conscience: And as it is so manifest where it is not withstood, but obeyed, its own Brightness, Vertue and Operation sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it self; but where Enmity is lived in, and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness loved rather than Light, the Excellency of it cannot be known.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Rule that the Patriarchs or Holy Men had before the Scriptures, thou tellst us, <hi>they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by Dreams, Visions and Angels, pag.</hi> 40. But were these the standing Rule? Had they these Dreams and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to instruct them in the sole Course of their Lives, or rather on particular Occasions? Surely these were neither the standing, nor yet their chief Rule: They had a Rule to know the Truth of those Visions; and whether those Angels were good Angels or no; a Rule of divine Light to discover whether they were good Angels or evil Angels transforming themselves into Angels of Light, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which is divine can discover; for the Saints in this Light shall judge Angels.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had both a Vision and Voice (when in the Mount) from Heaven; yet <hi>Peter</hi> himself testifieth, We have also a more sure Word of Prophecy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Though the former Vision and Voice were true, yet not so universal and abiding, as this shining Light was. That Vision and Voice was only seen and heard by a few, the other was seen and known by all who attained to the dawning of the Day, and the arising of the Day.

Its evident that this Light or Word so shining was a Light of the same holy Ghost which moved the holy men of God to speak forth Scriptures, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. and therefore the Apostle prefers it before the Scriptures, as the Cause of their being given forth.</p>

It appears this is the manner of thy Expectation and Belief, expecting to be saved by Jesus as a Person without thee, though thou hast no real Knowledge of him as such.</p>
                     <p>But it is to be minded, how plainly before thou hast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted thy Faith, as thus declared, where in thy <hi>24th. page</hi> upon 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. 16. thou dost thus paraphrase, viz. <hi>Though I</hi> Paul <hi>when a</hi> Jew, <hi>and in my unconverted State only knew Christ after a fleshly manner, to be a King of the</hi> Jews, <hi>and to deliver only from outward Bondage and Captivity, yet henceforth, from the time of my Conversion I know him so no more; for now I know him according to that design of infinite Grace and Love, which he came to carry on in the World, in being a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of Sinners from Sin, Death and Hell, which before I knew not.</hi> Thus far thou.</p>

                  <p>And the Life of Christ as manifest in mortal Flesh, hath pertaken of the Afflictions of the Upright in all Ages; and the Spirit of God is grieved, the just Principle oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and offended with mens Iniquities and Transgressions: So Christ considered as <hi>a Seed,</hi> and in that low Estate is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being formed in man, both of being raised up in man by the Power of the Father, of growing up as a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Plant, and as a Root out of dry Ground; and so of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Power and Help from him, as indeed every Seed thats sown, and every Plant that takes Root is capable of receiving Vertue and Nourishment according to its kind, or else it cannot be quickned to Life, grow or bring forth Fruit: And such a Growth of the immortal Seed was both in Christ and in his People, which must be owned, if the Seed of the Kingdom within, and the Spiritual Birth or forming of Christ within (or he as a <hi>Seed</hi> or <hi>Plant of Renown</hi>) be known and owned, or a Suffering, Crucifying, Dying and Living with Christ be witnessed by man.</p>

                  <p>How agrees this with thy former confessing, <hi>that Man was alwayes under an Obligation, that God's Soveraignity over him, and his Inferiority unto God might be acknowledged.</hi> Now if this be truely to be acknowledged by Man or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, why are <hi>Indians</hi> excluded? And if God's Soveraignity over man, and man's Subjection thereto be known, doth not this extend to Perfection? If either the Rule be perfect that thus obligeth man, or if in God's Rule Power or Soveraignity (as over man) be Perfection, which we affirm is able to evince it self, where true Fear and Subjection to God is lived in, or Sincerity and Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness towards him retained: Though to such as thou art, who opposes Sin-less Perfection as attainable in this Life, there is a need especially of producing Scriptures to prove it, while you pretend a Belief of them; for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105069:150"/>
the perfect Light or Gift of God within you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in.</p>
                  <p>Yet thou hast granted to Perfection, <hi>as sincere and upright,</hi> p. 50. and is not this Perfection of Sincerity and Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness without Sin? Were it good Doctrine to say, that Persection, as it respects the Sincerity and Uprightness of Saints is sinful?</p>
                  <p>But that a perfect Freedom from all Sin in this Life is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, we intend is by the all-sufficient Power of Christ; and no true <hi>Christian</hi> doth dissent from us herein: Nor doth this cause either Pride or Presumption, as thou falsly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates; but the contrary Sin-pleasing Doctrine thats for Imperfection and Sin while in this Life.</p>
                  <p>And while thou confessest <hi>a holy Fear, Humility, Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Industrious Endeavours to persevere in a Holy Course to the End, p.</hi> 50.</p>
                  <p>Either thou dost hereby grant Perfection, or a perfect Freedom from all Sin attainable in this Life; or else thou excitest People to be industrious, and endeavour for that which thou believest is not attainable; which is as much faithless Inconsistency as to say, use your industrious Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to persevere in a holy Course (that is sinless) to the End, but it is not attainable: Were not this a sad and Heartless Way of Preaching, to put People upon Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities.</p>
                  <p>Again upon <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15. as many as are perfect, be thus minded. Thou sayst, <hi>By Perfection, no more can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in this Text, then Sincere and Upright, accompanied with an earnest reaching after Perfection, as</hi> Paul <hi>did, p.</hi> 51.</p>

                  <p>But if in this Sence sincere and upright Men do earnestly reach after a sinless Perfection, and that <hi>Paul</hi> did so, then

                  <p>But this perfect Resemblance of the Heavenly Father, such Sin-pleasers and pleaders (as <hi>T.

                  <p>Is it therefore ingenuous that I should be thus accused in these general Terms? And when I cannot in Reason or Conscience own <hi>T.

                  <p>Besides, in some of his Positions, the very Substance of his Reason or Argument, is therewith inserted in my Paper; others of his Positions are so absurd and gross, that he could not make so much as the Colour of a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

Explication upon them; and therefore I did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to induce him upon more deliberate Conside rations, to produce what Explications he could for his Doctrines; for which these were my Words, <q>If our Opposer say we have not inserted his Explications upon his Assertions; our Answer is, thats his Work, he hath Liberty to do it himself.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if for this he must revile me in the open Street, calling me Knave, and shaking his Stick at me: If the <hi>Baptists</hi> will prove men Knaves at this Rate about Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Opinions, they will make all Knaves that oppose them, who do not relate all Circumstances of Words, as well as their Assertions, how impertinent soever.</p>

To excuse him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, some of his Companions said, it was his Zeal; but this Cover was too narrow; such hypocritical and false Excuses will not hold up the Credit of <hi>T.

                  <p>And be it reminded, that in divers things he hath both curtail'd and wholy left out my Explications, particularly of that Passage cited by him in his 28. pag. viz. <hi>That which is spoken from the Spirit of Truth in any, is of as great Authority as the Scriptures, and greater;</hi> here he stops and leaves out, <hi>As received and proceeding immediately from that Spirit, and as Christ's Words were of greater Authority when he spoke, then the</hi> Pharisees <hi>reading the Letter,</hi> as before hinted: See here he hath called me a Knave for that which he is more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly guilty of; and so is condemned out of his own Mouth, in that which he allows himself in.</p>
                  <p>And I desire that <hi>Tho.

                  </head>
                  <p>HIs accusing me of so much <hi>Partiallity as renders me Guilty of very Great Imperfection,</hi> p. 54. about a Relation of what happned betwixt him and me, at a Meeting in <hi>Devonshire House,</hi> the 18th of the 7th Month, 1672.</p>
                  <p>This is of little value to me, while I and many others know the contrary: and while he neither proves his Accusation; nor gives either a true or impartial Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative thereof himself.</p>
                  <p>But his chief pretended Proof against me, is our saying, the <hi>Baptists</hi> seemed more like Beasts then Men, several at once making a bawling and hideous noyse, &amp;c. The truth whereof many were eye and ear. Witnesses; and he cannot clear them herein: But instead thereof, falsly says, <hi>the Quakers manifested as much Rudeness, as the worst of men are wont to do to their Opposers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in this also, he hath very grosly belyed the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers:</hi> And he may know in his own Conscience, that he himself was a pattern of Incivility towards us; stirring up his Proselytes into Rudeness by his Passion and ill Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as Knave, deceitful fellow, audacious fellow, impudent fellow, &amp;c. whereas he had no such Language, nor Behaviour from me, or my Friends.</p>
                  <p>Besides, there were many of his Friends, and but very few of mine had notice; Because some of the <hi>Baptists</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended before, to me, that there should be but a few of their friends, and therefore I acquainted but very few of mine; otherwise, I should have made it more publick, if they had but dealt ingeniously by me, which I must say, they did not herein.</p>
                  <p>And for him, thus to charge the <hi>Quakers</hi> with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing as much Rudeness, as the worst sort of men. He doth not so much herein, as ex e pt common Revilers,
<pb facs="tcp:105069:155"/>
Drunkards or Persecutors; so that his slander is the more gross and notorious.</p>
                  <p>He saith that <hi>they called to speak directly to the Question (viz.) Whether this Body of Flesh and Bones shall arise again?</hi> To which <hi>Whitehead</hi> answered, he saith, <hi>that this Body of Flesh and Bones, shall not arise again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Herein again he hath wronged my Answer; sor it was not stated in these words, but in the very words of the <hi>Apostle Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 35, 36, 37, 38. as in the Narrative is fully related; for being aware of their carping, caveling, spirit, I kept close to the plain Words of Scripture in my positive answer,</p>
                  <p>How be it when <hi>W. Kiffin,</hi> said, <hi>That the Seed, that's sown, is this same Body of Flesh and Bones which shall arise, though otherwayes qualified, viz. more glorious,</hi> &amp;c. This being upon my Question about the Seed, to which God gives a Body as it pleaseth him: <hi>I did deny that the terrestrial Body, or Body of Flesh, Blood and Bones, as dead and buried, is the Seed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Apostle, to which God gives a Body, as it pleaseth him; And that the very same Carnal Body, should arise again: I say, it hath not yet been proved to me;</hi> nor am I satisfied therein, from any who have obtruded this Question and Controversie upon me. To which I now add, nor am I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by these men; but the Question may be further examined hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Again, after I am accused for leaving out of the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>oresaid Answer, <hi>viz.</hi> About this Body of Flesh and Bones, falsely obtruded upon me, the pretended Omission is supposed to be either from <hi>a bad Conscience, or a defective Memory,</hi> p. 54. wherein my own Conscience doth clear me; and my Innocency concerning the first, and Experience of the latter is better known and judged of in my self then by an envious and salse Accuser, that neither knows my Conscience, nor Capacity.</p>
                  <p>And yet after thus doubtfully he hath accused me, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>an evil Conscience or bad Memory,</hi> he presently saith, <hi>hence I conceive it to be more proper for him to be angry with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, for being deceitful, then sor another to tell him that he is so,</hi> p. 35. See here what a positive Judge he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb facs="tcp:105069:155"/>
over my Conscience, when as before he is so doubtful and wavering in his Charge.</p>
                  <p>For suppose any Omission through defect of Memory; Is this sufficient ground to conclude a man deceitful? Mark the Inconsistency of this mans Work of Envy against me: And I do not only reflect his false ill Language upon him; but also testifie against his Malice and slandering of me, (as he doth divers others) And particularly his Outrage against <hi>G. F.</hi> most malitiously and falsly reproaching him <hi>as a Blasphemer and Deceiver;</hi> and for instance tels us, <hi>he has been publickly detected, as namely by a Book called, The Spirit of the Quakers tryed,</hi> p. 55.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which I would have the Reader to take notice, that the Book he here cryes up, is a <hi>Socinian</hi> Book, wherein the Divinity of Christ is denyed; and that <hi>G. F.</hi> is chiefly opposed sor asserting the Divinity of Christ, and particularly, for his confessing, that Christ was in being, and in Glory with the Father before the World began. See here, from hence it is observable, this Adversary of ours makes little Conscience, whom he takes part with, so he finds them to be Enemies to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He now questions whether to attain to Perfection, be the Priviledg of any on this side Death,</hi> p. 55. When before he hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed its being attainable here, and put it off till he be in <hi>Heaven,</hi> p. 50. But now he is uncertain whether Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be attained by any on this side Death. He should have appeared thus ingenious at first; and not positively op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that which afterwards he questions; But this is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Tenour of his uncertain confused Work.</p>

                  <p>THe implacable Enmity of divers <hi>Baptist</hi> Teachers against us, our present Liberty and Prosperity is very obvious, by their several perverse confused Pamphlets; although the sad Experience and Fruitlesness of Coertion has not been shewn by their Valour: They have Cause rather to be abased and humbled for their timerous obscuring themselves (many of them) in the late stormy times, then now either to boast, or thus come croak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in warm Weather, with Blasphemy and Revilings against the Light of Truth, or us its Children: As also for their many Divisions among themselves, contrary to this Man's pretended <hi>Order and Communion of him and his Brethren of their baptized Churches,</hi> as in pag. 53. being divided about Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Doctrines; as some of their Leaders and Chieftains preaching up a <hi>personal Election;</hi> others <hi>general Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> some for Christ's dying <hi>for all;</hi> others for his dying <hi>but for a few;</hi> some for the Jews <hi>Seventh-Day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,</hi> others opposing it; some holding the <hi>Souls mortality</hi> with the Body, others the Immortality: They should have been reconciled among themselves, before they had thus appeared in Print against us called <hi>Quakers;</hi> for as yet we have no consistent matter from them to deal withall.</p>

                     <p>THe Light or Life of the Eternal Word, which is the Light of men, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 4. is spiritual and divine, as is that Word; and therefore able to direct man his Way out of Sin, and to give him Power against it; what Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Partiallity doth he therefore (like the partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Electioners) reflect upon God in saying, that <hi>this Light</hi> or Illumination <hi>of the Eternal Word, leaves man like the Priest and Levite in his Blood and Wounds?</hi> and yet how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly is this contradicted in his granting, <hi>That by this Light Mankind may come to understand there is a God, and also their Duty as he is their Creator?</hi> Now this their Duty is both truely to love, obey and sear him; as also the man grants, <hi>the Light to convince them of Sins, and teach them to do unto all men, as themselves would be done unto; and that if the</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens <hi>do follow the Light</hi> (they are enlightened withal by the glorious Creator) <hi>they would shine forth in the Principles of Morality and just Living, p.</hi> 9. Now then it appears that this Light in all men, can both teach them their Duty to God and one another; so then it would teach them both to begodly and just: Then the Question is, whether all that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105069:158"/>
are so taught, and are such, be they called <hi>Heathens,</hi> or others, be not in Reality <hi>Christians?</hi> Can a man be godly and not a <hi>Christian?</hi> Surely if the <hi>Heathens</hi> do mind and follow so much Light as God has given them, they shall be saved; for is there any more required then what is given? Or doth God condemn Men for not improving more then he gives them? How can they then be inexcusable, or left without Excuse before him?</p>
                     <p>Observe again, that this Opposer is not only cruel, in leaving men in their Blood and Wounds, though they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low so much Light as is given them; but he is greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded about the Light in all men; one while calling it, <hi>The Substance of the Law of the first Covenant, p.</hi> 11. another while saith, <hi>That Law was a more glorious Ministration, and did convince of Sin more clearly then this Light, p.</hi> 10. (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the inward Convincement or Conviction does not arise from the Law, meerly as written without; but from the Law or Light as received from God in the Heart) another while he calls it, <hi>the Spirit that God has formed in man, Zach.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>The Candle of the Lord, p.</hi> 9. Let the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Reader judge how this man is shattered in these his Contradictions, Inconsistencies and Variations, and how plainly he hath broke the Neck of his own Cause in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing that the Lord Jesus, <hi>as</hi> the eternal Word, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all men; for Jesus Christ and his Light <hi>as</hi> the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word, is the divine and highest Light.</p>

Or that any should be thus detained in Prison, so long after the Debt is paid, and Satisfaction made, as he imagines? But in this Notion of Satisfaction, he appears very short and shallow, though it be not a Scripture Phrase, as <hi>T. Danson</hi>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:105069:159"/>
grants, <hi>Synops.</hi> p. 19. and though it depends but upon <hi>some Notions of Law,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> saith, <hi>Declar.</hi> p. 150. Now that all mens Debt should be so strictly payed, or such a severe Satisfaction made to vindicate Justice by Christ in their Stead (which God never imposed upon the Son of his Love) and that <hi>for Sins past, present and to come</hi> (as some say) how inconsistent is it? Besides the gross Liberty this gives to Sin; how agrees it with his teaching them to pray, Forgive us our Debts? <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 12. for what needed that if they be all fo strictly paid in their Stead? Howbeit that Christ in another or more acceptable Sence, was a most satisfactory Offering and Sacrifice for Man-kind, for a sweet smelling Savour to God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 2. this we confess and own; and that he tasted Death not only for some, but for every Man, and is a Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World.</p>
                     <p>And that Men are not justified, nor all their Debt pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Stead, while they are actually in Chains in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Kingdom; see this Man's Concession to his own Confutation, touching the Power of true Conversion that is taught by Christ and his Ministers, viz. <q>That a man must repent, that true Repentance is a through Change of the mind, and that it consists in (1) A clear Sight and Sence of Sin (2) Godly Sorrow in the Sence and Burthen of it (3) In utter Abhorrence and forsaking of it: And also — Faith is required and must be wrought with Power in the Hearts of the Penitent, &amp;c. p. 15. 16.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mark then, here is some Debt for men to pay through the Help of Christ's Power and Work within; but to go round again, he is sliting that <hi>inherent Holiness</hi> which is wrought within, and accusing his Sister for not having a deep dependency on that Sacrifice of Christ's <hi>Crucified Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without,</hi> p. 14. The Truth on't is, she or they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Christ to be risen, and know his Power in their Hearts may think it improper to have their Dependancy on that his Body, as crucified without, but rather on him that lives for ever, as knowing the blessed Effects of his Sacrifice, to wit, the Relief and Redemption which his Flesh and Blood affords.</p>
                     <p>His saying, <hi>The Debt is paid,</hi> and yet fearing <hi>his</hi> Sister's <hi>remaining in Prison and Darkness, notwithstanding her Teacher near, p.</hi> 14. proves no more against the Light, the inward Teacher, then against Christ's Sufferings: She may as well
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105069:159"/>
say, Brother for all thy Dependance upon the crucified Body without thee, I fear thou art yet dead in thy Sins and in gross Darkness, and thou takest not the Course to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me, nor at all to draw my Heart towards thee and thy Brethren, by such sad and wicked Work as thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest against the Light.</p>
                     <p>Concerning his <hi>Water-Baptism,</hi> its not Reasonable in him, either to impose it, or judge us Transgressors in not submitting unto it, p. 18, 27. until he prove his Call, or himself or any of his Brethren commissionated from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as <hi>John</hi> was, to administer it; for we do not own it to be Christ's Baptism, and till they prove themselves so called, they should let us alone without it, we being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the one <hi>Baptism</hi> of the Spirit.</p>

                     <p>His meaning from <hi>Paul</hi>'s not being sent by Christ to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, but to preach the Gospel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. is, <hi>that he gives us to understand, that to baptize was not the alone or chief Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness he was sent to do, p.</hi> 27.

'Tis not to be supposed, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> should think that <hi>Paul</hi> was to do nothing else, but baptize or plunge them in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but he himself gives it as the chief Reason why he baptized none but those few mentioned; namely, for Christ (saith he) sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel: So he did not thank God for neglecting part of his Commission, in baptizing so few, but partly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their wrong Use thereof, and chiefly because his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission did not extend to <hi>Water-Baptism.</hi>

                     <p>And admitting his Instance in <hi>Adam,</hi> that he was not deceived, namely, that he was not first deceived, taking in the Word [first] from the Verse before; this is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impertinent unto his Purpose, about <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>not</hi> being sent to baptize, there being no such Discovery, that <hi>Paul</hi> was sent at all to baptize, as there was of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, but the contrary, in that <hi>Paul</hi> expresly said, Christ fent me <hi>not</hi> to baptize, but to preach the Gospel.</p>

As also to his being endued or anointed with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from on high, which Power is that divine Unction, and in that Christ is called the Power of God, and the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24 He may as properly be called, the Anointing, as where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty, now the Lord is that Spirit; this Anointing is not an outward Unction, nor outwardly received upon the Flesh or Body; but being a divine Unction of Glory and Power from above, its inwardly and spiritually received by an immortal Seed and Birth born from above, as that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit. As for his Term, <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> and <hi>Glorious Unity between the divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, p.</hi> 36. he talks he knows not what, besides Scripture-Language: the Word human is not applicable
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:105069:161"/>
to Christ in Glory by the Scriptures, but originally relates to the Earth, and so to the Body of man as coming thence. But Jesus Christ was the Anointed, as he was the Son from the Father's Substance (which he was before he came in the Flesh, or took upon him that Body that was prepared for him) and the Anointed and Saviour by the divine Power given him, when in that Body upon Earth; though more highly exalted or anointed, as ascended far above all Heavens, and exalted in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Glory; the Anointed and Saviour also, as revealed and formed in the Saints, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. the Anointed as set up from Everlasting; the Anointed both in Sufferings and in Glory; the Anointed both as he came in Flesh, and as coming and revealed in the Spirit in his People; and his <hi>Name</hi> by which Life and Salvation comes, and is given, is his divine Nature and Power, to which his Name re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates that is above every other Name.</p>
                     <p>One thing this man <hi>H. G.</hi> and his Brethren stumble at, and at which his Soul is wounded (as he saith) p. 30. is, that Christ was never seen with an outward (or rather carnal Eye) which <hi>H.

                        </gap>nd Persecutors saw him in that Sence with their outward Eyes, when they did neither truely see nor know him to their Salvation, it being the Spirit that quickneth, and such a Sight of Christ as that of his Body or outward man, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105069:162"/>
man can be so absurd as to say, it was not obvious to the Bodily Eyes, and as absurd for any to imagine, that any of us should intend otherwise.</p>
                     <p>Now these <hi>Baptists</hi> Faith concerning the Son of God, according to their carnal Discourse of him, may be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized into this or the like Argument, viz. If Jesus Christ, the Son of God be also the Son of man glorified on the right Hand of God in Heaven, then he consists of human Body of Flesh and Bones, as some say; or of a body of Flesh, Blood and Bones, as others say.</p>
                     <p>But he is the Son of man glorified, &amp;c. Ergo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of a human Body, either of Flesh and Bone, or of Flesh Blood and Bones in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> I deny their varied Consequence as inconsequent; for Christ was called the Son of man in a higher Sence then this human, earthly or carnal Sence, which they represent him in, in that he himself said, no man hath ascended up to Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of man which is in Heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 13. and what if you shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before; it is the Spirit that quickneth, the Flesh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitteth nothing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 62, 63. who will affim, that as he came down from Heaven, or as he was before in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he so consisted of a carnal human Body, either made up of Flesh and Bone, or of Flesh, Blood and Bone in their gross and carnal Sence; <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> had not such mean Thoughts of Christ, as these carnal <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> have; for <hi>John</hi> said, he that cometh from above is above all, he that is of the Earth is earthly and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Earth, he that cometh from Heaven is above all, <hi>John</hi> 3. 31. and the Flesh of the Son of man, which he gave for the Life of the World is that Bread which came down from Heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 50, 51. Except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood ye have no Life in you, ver. 53. Yet that the Name Son of Man was applyed to him as a Sufferer, and as he said, so shall the Son of man be three Dayes and three Nights in the Heart of the Earth, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 40. I deny not; but this doth not limit him from being called the Son of Man in a higher State, also each of God's Prophets might be called (as divers were) a Son of Man; but Christ the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the Son of Man, the Apostle distinguisheth between the first man and the second man thus, The first man is of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105069:162"/>
the Earth earthly (or human) the second man is the Lord from Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47. therefore the second man is not human in their Sence, nor consisting of a human or earthly Body as the first man, and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 9, 10. now that he ascended, what is it, but that he also descended first into the lower Parts of the Earth, he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things, and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21, who shall change the Body of our Lowness, that it may be fashoned like unto his glorious Body, &amp;c. Now if it should be read according to these <hi>Baptists</hi> Sence, it must be, who shall change our vile Bodies, that they may be fashoned like unto his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body, as if they were not such already, and how dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable is it to say, Christ consists of a human Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of flesh, blood and bones in Heaven; but the Saints must have a spiritual glorious Body in the State of Glory hereafter; yet to prevent these mens Scruples concerning our owning the man Christ, or the Son of man in Glory; I tell them seriously that I do confess both to his miraculous Conception by the Power of the holy Spirit overshadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and to his being born of her accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Flesh, and so that he took upon him a real Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (and not a fantastical) and that he was real Man, come of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that he in the Dayes of his Flesh preached Righteousness, wrought Miracles, was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and put to Death by wicked Hands, that he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and rose again the third Day according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;<note place="marg1">

                     <p>And as God created man in his own Image; and yet its said, he formed man of the Dust of the Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 27. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 7. and its said, That the rich Man dyed and was buried (which was his Body) and in Hell he lift up his Eyes, &amp;c.

                     <p>But farther, let the Reader observe how evidently <hi>H.

Which we have answered, as the Apostle did such, Thou Fool, that which thou sowest is not quickned except it dye, and thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of Wheat, &amp;c. but God giveth it a body as it pleaseth him, and every Seed his own body, or its proper body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 35, 36, 37, 38. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105069:164"/>
and unto the day of Destruction; for both shall rise to their several Ends and Rewards; yea, the Sea, Death, Hell and the Grave shall deliver up their dead to be judged, &amp;c. and he giveth to every Seed his own proper body, as he pleaseth; and we know, that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle be destroyed, we have a building given of God, that is, a House not made with Hands, but eternal in the Heavens: Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50. <hi>H.

Which though reproved as foolish, yet not so foolish as to ask whether Corruption be raised? And more absurd it is to imply, that by flesh and blood he doth not intend <hi>Body,</hi> but only <hi>Corruption.</hi>

                     <p>It is none of our Assertion, <hi>that Christ in his Death and Sufferings, was but only a Pattern or Example of that which must be wrought over again in us;</hi> for though we own him to have left an Example, yet he was more then an Example, and he did not only end the Types, but was a Sacrifice and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for Man-kind, and opened the new and living Way, giving Testimony of God's free Love towards all, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Way for the enforcing of the new Testament or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Life: But yet that either all or any men are cleansed, or justified, or saved meerly by the outward Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, Crucifixion, Death or Blood shed of Christ, the Scripture proves not (but by Christ himself, and his Blood, Life, Spirit and Power) nor yet that men are acquitted or saved by their outward Application thereof: And this man to his own Confutation confesseth to the Power of Christ s Spirit being risen <hi>in us,</hi> for our Sanctification and Renovation, as well as Christ was raised from the dead for our Justification, p. 54. then all is not fully doneby his

And whether will they go, and to what End, if they obey and follow it? Does not the Apostle for a Proof of a justified State, instance it in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:105069:169"/>
shewing the Effects of the Law written in their Hearts? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 13, 14, 15, 16. And what Nature was that by which those Gentiles did those things contained in the Law; surely it was not the corrupt Nature, for that is inconsistent, the Law being holy, just and good; and though these <hi>Gentiles</hi> had not the Law in the Letter of it, as many now have not the litteral Discription or histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Relation of Christ's outward Sufferings, must they therefore be damned to Hell? What Cruelty were this, to condemn Nations for want of the Scriptures? But as those <hi>Gentiles</hi> who had not the Law in the Letter, and yet had and obeyed it in the Spirit, were both therein a Law to themselves, and excused in the Sight of God, in the day when he judgeth the Secrets of Men by Jesus Christ accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
                     <p>So those <hi>Gentiles</hi> and Peoples who obey the Light and Life of the Son of God in them, though they have not the historical Knowledge and Profession of Christ as he was Man, and suffered Death in the Flesh, &amp;c. Yet they are truely accepted of God, and more real <hi>Christians</hi> inwardly then many of you, that have the Scriptures, and an histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Faith and Profession of the Man Christ, and of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> outwardly; for in all Nations, every one that fears God and worketh Righteousness is accepted of him.

This is the highest Morality or Duty of Man-kind, even this Love to God and one another, which is the fulfilling of the Law: And this is both taught by the Light within, and Power given by the Grace of God to fulfil it, which the Law without in the Letter cannot do: Now if the <hi>Jews</hi> Way to inherit Eternal Life was (through the Grace or Help of God) to fulfil what was written (as before) then if a <hi>Heathen,</hi> that hath not this Law outwardly written, should ask the same Question, what shall I do to inherit Eternal Life?

                     <p>And Christ being exalted at the Father's right Hand, is no Proof that he is remote, separate or absent from his People and Members, any more, then that the Father's right Hand of Power is absent and remote from them; though we see what gross Apprehensions some Men have of God and Christ; who thus would exclude, limit or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe them, yea, God and his right Hand of Power only to a Place distant from his People and Children, which doth not only strengthen gross Apprehensions in the Ignorant, to keep them in Ignorance, dark Thoughts and car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That ever did attain, meerly, by that Light within, to the Knowledge of one Jesus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>that was crucified without the Gates of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>that meerly by the Help and Guidance of that Light within, came to find out so much as the Name or historical Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a cruciefid Jesus, p.</hi> 70.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. As an historical Knowledge and Profession concerning Christ and his Sufferings in the Flesh cannot save you; so its very uncharitable in you <hi>Baptists</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all Nations that have it not, meerly for want of the History or that historical Knowledge. 2. Though you have a historical Faith and Profession of Jesus, as he came and suffered in the Flesh; I deny that this Faith will either save you (for they have as much Faith at <hi>Rome</hi>) or that you have from thence any real Knowledge of Christ, either as in the Flesh or in the Spirit, either as crucified, as put to Death, or as living and reigning: Its still your Mistake to count your dark Opinions and litteral Notions the Light of the Son of God: Nay, if you have no further Faith and Knowledge of him, then whats meerly historical and litteral. If you have not a spiritual and divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, as inwardly revealed, you'll dye in your Sin, and perish for lack of Knowledge: And many of those called <hi>Heathens</hi> who follow the Help and Guidance of the Light of Christ within, shall come from the East and from
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105069:172"/>
the West, and from the North, and from the South, nd shall sit down with <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Kingdom, as Children of Faith and Heirs of Promise, who have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved God, and obeyed his Light in them, when you and such like litteral Professors shall be utterly rejected, unless you return to Christ's Light within, and believe and wait in it to know Christ's inward and spiritual Appearance and Revelation. 3. In the Gospel preacht to <hi>Abraham</hi> (in whose Seed all Nations should be blessed) It was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen, that <hi>God</hi> would justifie the <hi>Heathen</hi> through Faith; and accordingly, Christ was absolutely promised and given for a Light to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to be God's Salvation to the Ends of the Earth; that he might say to the Prisoners, go forth, and them that are in Darkness, shew yourselves, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. <hi>and Ch.</hi> 49. Now observe, that the Promise of Christ, both for a Light to the Gentiles, and Salvation to the Ends of the Earth, and himself to speak to the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to go forth, &amp;c. its absolute, and not restrained or limitted to the spreading of Scripture, nor to any such Condition, as to be a Light and Salvation (or to speak) only to such as get the Bible, and have the Scriptures or an historical Knowledge and Profession of Jesus Christ; but he is given both for a Light to the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and Salvation to the Ends of the Earth, and so to call forth the Prisoners where the Scriptures are not; he being in himself absolute and perfect, and so able to be whatever he is promised of God; and this Salvation is absolutely placed upon the Son of God, who is given both for a Light, a Leader, God's Covenant and Salvation; and therefore he is to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, obeyed and depended on for Life and Salvation. 4. Moreover, Its possible to have both the Sufferings and Glory of Christ revealed by his Light and Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Scriptures; seeing the Spirit of Christ shewed and testified aforehand unto the Prophets of his Sufferings and of the Glory that should follow, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. to be sure, they who first wrote Scripture of these things aforehand, had them first discovered or opened unto them by the Spirit. 5. And when <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> said, <hi>Lo,</hi> I see four Men loose walking in the midst of the Fire, and they have no Hurt, and the Form of the fourth is like the Son of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 25. How came this <hi>Heathen</hi> to have any such Impression or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the Son of God in his Mind, as thus to speak of the Son of God, or of the fourth, as represented to him
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105069:172"/>
like the Son of God? And what Scripture could he have for this pray you? Or for <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> to speak so truly and admirably as they did of the Kingdom and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the most high God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 3. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 26. Let the narrow-Spirited Litteralists, and partial Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators (who would place all true Knowledge upon the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and confine it within the Compass of a few Professors of Scripture) consider these things. 6. But seeing that Christ dyed for all Men, tasted Death for every Man, and gave himself a Ransom for all; God doth therefore (no doubt) afford a Way for the universal Conveyance of the Vertue and blessed Effects inwardly of his Death and Blood to Man-kind, and that is his divine Light, though many have not the outward Description thereof.</p>

To this I say, Its an easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Intruders to ask unlearned and unnecessary Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereof this is one; of those many other Signs and Things that Jesus did, its said, If they should be written every one, I suppose that even the World it self could not contain the Books, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 25. how then should this Querist be capable to contain them? I suppose he doth not think himself able to contain more then the World it self: If he saith, it is an hiperbolical Expression, then is his Question hiperbolical to be sure. And if we cannot give him Account of all those Signs and things in particular, while we are not sollicitous to know them, nor do we think it needful; is that any valid Plea or Proof against the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of the Light within or Spirits Teaching?

                        <hi>G.

                     <p>H.

And for what end is it given universally to Man-kind? That they may be saved; or onely to condemn them?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Christ's enlightning all men <hi>as</hi> the Eternal Word and that with a spiritual Light <hi>flowing</hi> from himself, (as the Eternall Word Enlightening) It is not with the Letter which killeth and Cannot give Life but with an Immediate Illumination or Influence of Light from himself which can both kill and make a live; it hath both the Law, or sentence of Death in it to the transgressor, and quickning Vertue and Gospel in it to make alive to God, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister Life and Justification from God to them that truly obey it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Do not you say, that this Light which is in every Man that cometh into the World, is God, is Christ, is the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Blessed Comforter, and a Saving Light, and that it will convince a Man of every Sin and Transgression, and lead into all Truth, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> He here questions the things which in his 18th. pag he affirms, <hi>The Quakers speak of the Light within, viz. That it is the Divine Essence, the Lord Jesus Christ, the holy Spirit, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I ask him, where, or in what Book and page do the <hi>Quakers</hi> speak all this of that Measure or Gift of Light that is in every man (he deals disingenuously in not citing our own Books and Pages for these Words, that we might
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105069:177"/>
consider further thereof, seeing the Stress of his Charge lies so much on them, which though we assert it to be a divine Light of God, and Christ, and holy Spirit, which are one, and omni-present, filling Heaven and Earth, over all, and through all, God unlimitted in his Presence, which to man is an Enlightning Presence; yet God and Christ is not revealed in all; for he was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not, yet his divine Light or immediate Shining in Man is manifest by measure or Degrees, as man is capable to receive it; the least degree whereof is saving to them that obey it, and tends to direct and draw Man towards God, who is the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and alone Saviour, and he and his Light in men are inseparable, whose Salvation is manifest by degrees, as his Light or Grace in man's Heart is, which hath taught us to wait and to look for that blessed Hope, and the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apprearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>The Measure or Manifestation of this Light and Grace, which immediately directs and leads to this Appearance of the great God and our Saviour, must needs therefore be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: And because God or his Son, in his infinite Fulness and Knowledge, as in himself, cannot be contained in man, in that the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain God; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not therefore, that the Measure and Manifestation of his Light in Man is not convincing, sanctifying or saving, whilst it is confest to be <hi>a Light</hi> or Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>of Jesus Christ, as the Eternal Word, enlightning all Men and Women.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the infinite Fulness or Giver of this Light cannot be contained in Man; yet God hath promised to tabernacle with Men; and to dwell in them; it follows not, that a little degree of the Light, Vertue and Knowledge thereof is not saving or sanctifying.</p>
                     <p>A small Stream can wash, and a little Fire kindle and increase to more, and a little convenient Food nourish and satisfie, and a little Water quench one's Thirst, or a small Seed grow and bring forth great Increase; and so a little Light from Christ can increase and shine more and more till it discover the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ the anointed; these things are truely known in the Mystery through true Obedience to so much Light or Illumination as God hath given man; for he (the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105069:178"/>
Glorious Creator) hath given a Light to all men sufficient to save, or else they could not be left without Excuse; but it would reflect upon him for condemning them for Sin, if he did not afford them a Light sufficient to guide out of Sin unto Salvation.

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Can either Christ's Light within, or our following of it, invalidate or make void his Sufferings without? Or deprive us of the End thereof, or of the Vertue of his Blood? When they that crucified, murthered Christ were turned from his Light within? Or can any receive the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Christ's Sufferings and Blood without (or out of) his Light within? Or are the Sufferings and Death of Christ absolutely meritorious for Man's Justification with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Dependance upon his Light within? If so, how can any be deprived of Justification for whom Christ dyed? Which was for all Men; but what Proof hath he from Scripture, <hi>That the shedding Christ's Blood was the Meritorious Cause of Justification?</hi> Seeing it was shed by wicked Hands; and surely, had the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> obeyed and walked in that holy and just Light that was in them, they had not crucified nor murthered the just One, the Son of God, whose giving up to the Death of the Cross (though of Necessity) yet it was occasioned because of Sin and Death that was come over all, which man must only be convinced and truely sensible of by the Light of Christ within; and its such only as walk in his Light, who come to know the Blood of Christ to cleanse them from all Sin. And there is a certain Congruity and Oneness in being san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, redeemed and saved by his Life, Light, Blood, Power, Arm, Ingrafted Word, Spirit, Fire, Water or by Grace; these do not oppose Christ as Saviour, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the great Workman of God, through whom God
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105069:178"/>
hath saved us by the washing of Regeneration and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the holy Ghost, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 4, 5. These being one in Substance with him, and of himself, as the Spirit, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Blood agree in one: And as his offering up himself, being a Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World, pouring out his Soul to Death, and making In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for the Transgressors was by the <hi>Eternal Spirit,</hi> so the blessed Effects thereof are spiritually and inwardly received by them that obey and walk in the Light of his Spirit; wherein his Life and Vertue of the Blood of the Covenant is received unto Cleansing, Sanctification and Reconciliation with God: The great Sufferings, Burthens and Afflictions of Christ were occasioned by man's Sin, Disobedience, and turning from his Life and Light within; and this brought Darkness and Death over Man-kind; and therefore Christ deeply travelled in the Spirit of Prayer and Intercession, through all his Sufferings, to bring forth his own Life and Light for man's Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of Death and Darkness, that he might see his Seed, and the Travel of his Soul, and be satisfied. And this is the Seed that shall serve him throughout all Ages, which shall be counted unto the Lord for a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this serves him in his Light, and worships him in Spirit; therefore they that oppose this Light of Christ to the End of Christ's Coming, Death, Sufferings, Blood or Intercession, as if his Light in Man did invalidate these; they are darkned and cheated by the Devil, and not these who obey Christ's Light within for Life and Savati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in him.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>G. W. Answer,</hi> The Contradiction is very obvious to say, the Spirit <hi>cannot be the Saviour,</hi> when it can save the Soul out of the <hi>horrible Pit;</hi> can it save and not be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? Or can it bind the strong Man, or kill man's Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and yet not save him? And if the Father, the Word and the holy Spirit be God, cannot God be the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? When as Christ's being the Author of Faith, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Power to others to become the Sons of God, is a Proof of his being God, <hi>Light from the Sun,</hi> p. 91. And Christ said, The Son can do nothing of himself, &amp;c. The Father that dwelleth in me he doth the Works, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19. 30. <hi>and</hi> 8. 28. <hi>and</hi> 14. 10. And the holy Spirit where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, also maketh Intercession according to the Will of God, and by this Spirit Christ prayed unto the Father; but to say, the Spirit or blessed Comforter cannot be the Saviour, is also to deny Christ in his spiritual Appearance, to be a Saviour, and so to confine the saving Work to him <hi>only,</hi> as man, or in the Flesh without (or separate from) us, whereas he said, I will not leave you comfortless, I will come to you, <hi>John</hi> 14. 18. which plainly denotes him to be the Comforter in that Spiritual Appearance, wherein he that was with them promised to be in them, and as revealed in them; his Appearance was another or diverse to his outward Appearance in the Flesh, whereas <hi>H. G.</hi> saith, <hi>Are there not three that bear Record in Heaven?</hi> I say yes, and these three are one; and is not Christ (the Saviour) that Word, which is one of the three, which are but one divine Being, Thing or Substance, though revealed under several Considerations and Diversities of Manifestations, and Degrees of Discoveries? yet all one divine Life and Being, as God is the Word, the Life, the Light, and so is Christ; and the holy Spirit is Life to the Righteous, and so is Christ the Way the Truth and the Life: In him was Life, and the Life the Light of Men; the Life affordeth Light to all, and the Light Life

to all that obey it, and in it follow Christ, such receive the Light of Life, and come to walk in the Light of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as the Light of Life is received unto Justification and Peace, the holy Spirit is received in that glorious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration as Comforter, after a State of Desolation and Sorrow of whom Christ said, He shall receive of mine and shew it unto you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13.</p>
                     <p>H. G. <hi>Did the true Saviour die on the Cross or not?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, as concerning the Flesh, but not as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Spirit or most noble Principle, by which he was impowred to his Work of Salvation.</p>
                     <p>H. G. <hi>I affirm once again, That neither the Comforter, viz. the holy Spirit, nor the Deity of our Lord Jesus distinct from his Manhood or human Nature, could be the Saviour and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor which dyed on the Cross, &amp;c. pag.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This is a meer impertinent Shuffle to prove the holy Spirit could not be the Saviour; he now tells us, that neither the holy Spirit, nor the Deity distinct from his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature (as he calls it) could be the Saviour that dyed; who of us ever affirmed that his Deity or holy Spirit dyed? But seeing the holy Spirit or Deity dyed not with the Flesh of Christ that was crucified, then the whole Saviour did not dye, but what he calls <hi>the human Nature:</hi> But if we take his Words according to his Doctrine before, for Proof (that the holy Spirit or Comforter cannot save or be the Saviour) only thus, viz. <hi>Neither the Comforter the holy Spirit, nor the Deity of our Lord Jesus distinct from his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood or human Nature could be the Saviour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This were all one as to tell us, that God cannot be the Saviour, or that God cannot save, if the holy Spirit or Deity be God; he should rather have said, that the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood could not save without the holy Spirit, divine Power or Deity, which alone is sufficient (and only that which is felt and experienced in Man) to effect his Salvation and Deliverance from the Power of Sin and Satan: Ye are my Witnesses saith the Lord, and my Servants whom I have chosen, that ye may know and believe me and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that I am he, before me there was no God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, neither shall there be after me; I even I am the Lord, and beside me there is no Saviour, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 10, 11.

murtherous Act of <hi>killing</hi> the Sacrifice if he mean) Christ as his Discourse implies? For though Christ Jesus (by that inherent Holiness, and original Righteousness, and Grace of God in him) offered and gave himself up to suffer, and tasted Death for every Man; yet the crucifying and <hi>killing</hi> him, according to the Flesh, was an Act of Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Persecutors, who by wicked Hand put him to death; so that the Dignity and Worth was in Christ and on his Part through all his Sufferings, and not in the Act of <hi>killing</hi> him by wicked Hands, nor on their Parts; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Sufferings and Death of Christ were of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue with the Father, and his Power did appear through all to the bruising the Serpents Head.</p>
                     <p>And if it be the Work of the Spirit to sanctifie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new us; is not this a saving Work? And doth not this bring us to receive the Attonement, and to enjoy Peace?

                     <p>For Christ's Appearance and Suffering in the Flesh did really and directly point at those spiritual Ends (which are for man's Eternal Advantage) to be fulfilled by his Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Spirit.</p>

And have we not the more Reason to deny your Practice, if it be not in the same manner as pretended here? Whereas in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42. its said, They continued stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine and Fellowship, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers (wherein is no mention either of the Wine, the Cup, the Supper or Passover) also its then said that all that believed were together, and had all things common, and sould their Possessions and Goods, ver. 44, 45. Now if what they did must be binding to Posterities because practiced; why do not the <hi>Baptists</hi> imitate those Believers in this of selling their Possessions, &amp;c? But were it not a very preposterous Way of arguing, to conclude a continuance of Commands and Duties from Practices. And in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. Upon the first day of the Week the Disciples came together to break Bread, and that <hi>Paul</hi> had broken Bread, ver. 11. (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>First, Was he the Christ and true Saviour that was born of the Virgin yea or nay?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:105069:192"/>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, he was the true Christ, the Son of God, both then and before he took on him that Body, or was so born.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly, <hi>If you say he Was, I query, whether that same Christ be in the Heart of every Man and Woman?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The same Christ is spiritually in (yea, revealed and dwelling in) the Hearts of true Believers and Saints, and they in him, but not <hi>so</hi> in every man, though he enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens every Man, and in his Light he is to be revealed and known.</p>
                     <p n="3">3dly, <hi>Whether he that you own to be the Christ, and true Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was put to death, or Crucified on the Cross?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> As concerning the Flesh he was.</p>
                     <p n="4">4thy, <hi>Whether you believe there is any other Christ then what is in the heart of man, yea or nay?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The true Christ is but one and the same for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though variously manifested, as both in the Flesh and in the Spirit, both In his Flesh or Body Intirely (wherein he came unto his own, the Jews, who received him not) and spiritually in his followers who have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him; for he said to his Disciples, he that is with you shall be in you; and to his Father, I in them, and thou in me, &amp;c. that the Love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them; but thus not universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly In Man, though in some Degree and Sence he appears universally in man.</p>
                     <p n="5">5thly, <hi>If that Body that was nailed to the Cross, was but as a Garment, which the true Christ did wear, or as a House in which he did dwell: why may not any other Man in whose Flesh Christ is manifested, and doth dwell, be called the Christ, as well as</hi> Jesus of Nazareth?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> There's not the same Reason for any other man to be Called the Christ.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1st. Because of his divine Pre-existence, both before
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105069:192"/>
he took upon him that Body or Flesh, and before man or other things were made, which God created by Jesus Christ.</item>
                        <item>2dly, Because of his Miraculous Conception, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Body.</item>
                        <item>3dly, Because he was anointed with the Oyl of Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness above his Fellows.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Lastly, He that compared that Body or Flesh, which he took upon him to a Garment or House, intended no Detraction from the Honour or Dignity of the true Christ; for his Flesh was called the Vail, his Body, <hi>the Body of Jesus, this Temple, the Form of a Servant,</hi> and his Saints are his Members.</p>
                     <p n="6">6thly, <hi>If you own the man Christ, why do you affirm it a Contradiction to say, he is God, of the Substance of the Father and yet truly man, made like unto us in all things, sin only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted?

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou hast herein Queried like a disingenious Shuffler, to obscure thy own self-Contradiction, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach us; whereas thy Contradiction was not between Jesus Christ's <hi>being of the Substance of the Father,</hi> and yet truly <hi>Man in time,</hi> but between his <hi>being from everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Son of God by eternal generation (or of the substance of the Father)</hi> and thy asserting, that <hi>Jesus Christ consisteth of human Flesh and Bone, which</hi> (to be sure) the Substance of the Father doth not consist of.</p>
                     <p>But Let H. G. and his Assistants Shuffle off this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction if they can.

                        <q>This Truth is by some denyed, and by others too carnally looked upon, some thinking that our Bodies of Flesh shall be raised, in the same Form in which it dyed, &amp;c. p. 93.</q>

                     <p>And further he saith;</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>That the Form in which they shall be raised that is in a Spiritual Form, not in a Fleshly, for as the Spirit of Christ raiseth us up in the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>first Lye, is their saying, that Christ is in every Man that cometh into the World, whereas the Scriptures say, where Christ is in Persons, the Body is dead to sin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>there is a People without God and Christ — in a reprobate State, in a Course of Life unappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God — though under a Profession, as the Church at Corinth was — surely then may such be accounted without Christ, that are neither under a Profession nor Practice.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Again, Its not our Doctrine to say, that Christ is <hi>so</hi> in every Man, prevailing or ruling, as that the Body is dead to Sin, nor is he revealedly or unitedly in every man; which the Phraise, <hi>Christ in you,</hi> or <hi>Christ dwelling in you,</hi> imports and includes the Saints being in him, as he saith, <hi>I in them</hi> and <hi>they in me;</hi> yet in some Sence, he is in all, and through all; or else he could not be God, nor Omni-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;

and some <hi>Baptists</hi> themselves have confest, that <hi>Christ</hi> in Respect of his <hi>divine Nature, is every where;</hi> therefore he must needs be in Man; and in Respect to his divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he is God, and God is Light, and in him is no Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at all: They that are without God, and without Christ, and Reprobates, &amp;c. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 11, 12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. they are without God and Christ, or as being Strangers to both, and without the true and living Knowledge of them not as if God or his Light were limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Distinct or Remoteness of Place from them. For then, how were he either infinite or omni-present? But, as <hi>he was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not, so some are without God;</hi> and know ye not how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates?

not only on the Doctrinal, but on the Historical Part, when they are minded to oppose the Sufficiency of the Light of Christ within?

                     <p>S. S. in p. 32. saith, <hi>though the Counsels of God's Spirit in Believers Hearts, be IN themselves as certainly the Truth of God as are his Counsels in the Scriptures; yet are they not to Believers so certainly the Truths of God.</hi>

                     <p>And as to his pudder he makes about <hi>Water-Baptism,</hi> 'tis very confused and silly (as at the Dispute) not plainly asserting whom he would have the <hi>Subjects</hi> of it, whether <hi>Infants</hi> or <hi>Believers;</hi> yet brings some of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though we still suppose he intends <hi>Infants,</hi> but durst not tell us whether it be his Practice now.</p>
                     <p>So see what a Laborynth and Loss his Work tends to bring People to; neither plainly telling them <hi>the Subjects,</hi> nor showing who are the Ministers of this imposed <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Baptism,</hi> whether himself, or such as he, or who? and yet injoyns it as <hi>a Means of Sanctification, a Means of Salvation,</hi> which we do not believe.</p>
                     <p>As also he explains not his terms of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> what he means by <hi>the Lord's Supper;</hi> whether the Shaddow or the Mystery, and what is his own Practice therein? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ministers Bread and Wine as a Figure, or the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance?

                  <p>S. S. <hi>If the Righteousness we are justified by is a Garment, a</hi> Arg. <hi>Robe, even the best Robe, then we are justified by a Righteousness wrought without us; for our Garments are not wrought within us, but without us.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> This justifying Righteousness then is a Garment to be put on; but whether its being a Garment, and to be put on, doth prove that it is not within, but without only, let them that have put it on judge: It appears, that this Opposer hath disputed and pleaded so long for the Being of Sin to remain within, that he has no Room <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>or Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness within: But I would enquire of him; Is every Thing that is to be put on therefore not within but without? Is this a good Argument? As, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And so he might as well say of Salvation, with which the Meek are cloathed; or of the Zeal of the Lord, which the Upright do put on for a Cloak, and Righteousness <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>or a Garment.</p>
                  <p>But to give him his due; After he hath concluded that <hi>the Righteousness for which we are Justified is wrought without us, is a Garment,</hi> &amp;c. He confesseth <hi>that the holy Ghost doth not alwayes</hi> (using this Similitude) <hi>intimate to us, that that Righteousness which is put on, is wrought without us,</hi> p. 99. And what Righteousness is that which is put on that is wrought within us? Do we both put on a Righteousness that is within us, and a Righteousness that is not within us? what Scripture has he for this Distinction? And what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion is the Man fallen into, to conclude that the Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteousness is not wrought within but without, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause put on as a Garment; and yet that there is a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness put on which is not wrought without us but within us? See what a profound <hi>Logician</hi> this man would shew
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:105069:223"/>
himself; but thus he confounds the Minds of the Simple, and darkens Counsel by Words without Knowledge. To Luk. 15. 22. <hi>Bring forth the best Robe and put it on him,</hi> he saith, <hi>By this Robe the holy Ghost understands Christ's Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto Death; not to speak of Increated Righteousness, even the essential and incommunicable Righteousness of God, which never was wrought within or without, but is the eternal Godhead,</hi> pag. 99.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> However he hath sufficiently confessed that the Righteousness by which we are Justified must be <hi>put on;</hi> but while he denies it either to be within or <hi>Essential,</hi> he denies our Participation of the divine Nature (which is essential to God himself) or of Christ, who is God's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, who was delivered up for us all, and with whom the Father will give us all things; Is <hi>He</hi> then Incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable or not to be given, whenas they that are Christ's have put on Christ? Is not He the best Robe? And is not He then within us? And <hi>He</hi> that obeyed and suffered for us (who wrought Righteousness) Greater then the Act of Obedience? Is not the Worker above and Greater then the Work? But while this Opposer endeavours to exclude or shut Christ and his Righteousness (or the Robe which the Saints put on) all out of his Members, and counts Christs Obedience unto Death without them this Robe, and not a Robe within them; because a Robe put on, as he argues, we are to understand that by [Put on] he must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p n="1">1st, Was not this in Man while in Innocency in the Image of God; though he then not Immoveably Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in it, however accepted while he stood in it?</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, Doth not the fincere Obedience of an upright Man in Christ, flow from his Inward Participation of the Divine Nature and Image in him, and therefore accepted from the Excellency of that Divine Root and Seed from whence his Fruit Springs?</p>

And though Man doth not partake thereof from the beginning of Life, Can this Man think that Christ's Death or Obedience without, doth Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Men, or make them be deem'd Righteous from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Life to the End? howbeit, when Men are converted
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:105069:224"/>
and become the Righteousness of God in Christ, and come to Live and Dye (or end their Dayes) in him, they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and blessed; yea blessed are the Dead which dye in the Lord, for their Works follow them. <hi>Mark the Perfect Man, and behold the Upright, for the End of that man is Peace:</hi> But all this Man's <hi>Imputation</hi> of a Righteousness and <hi>best Robe</hi> (which he sayes, <hi>is a Righteousness wrought without us, there being none wrought within us; so God,</hi> &amp;c. p. 99.) depends upon his Doctrine <hi>for Sin and Imperfection term of Life,</hi> which he &amp; his Brethren have not only concluded must continue in the best of Men <hi>and their best Actions</hi> all their Dayes; but Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection even <hi>in Christ's Work or Righteousness</hi> wrought in his People, which therefore he disclaims from being concerned in our Justification; but sayes, we are Justified by that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which Christ wrought <hi>without us,</hi> though he cannot deny, but that Christ wrought the Righteousness of the Law without us (and conformed to the Law in the Dayes of His Flesh) which I suppose will not be deemed our Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But if I ask, By and to Whom was this Obedience, Righteousness or Satisfaction made without us, to be Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us as ours, or men thereby Justified while Unjust, Imperfect and Sinful, without the Robe of Righteousness in themselves; or rather accounted Just from the beginning of Life to the End?

Is this the <hi>Compensation, Payment</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in our stead to vindictive Justice, so much pleaded by our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers? Were it good Doctrine to say, either that God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, and satisfied his own Revenge by obeying himself (as if he were divided and at Variance with himself) or that he was revenged on himself, considered as Christ in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Flesh? I cannot own this Doctrine, that such a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Payment and Satisfaction could be required in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the great Propitiation and Sacrifice for Sin; but a Pacification or Attonement and a Condescension to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of Sin past, to be receiv'd on true Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. 2. That Christ in the Flesh did by his divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perfectly obey the Father <hi>agendo &amp; patiendo,</hi> i. e. <hi>by doing and suffering;</hi> and therein was an acceptable and satisfactory Sacrifice for Sin, is not any Matter in Question or Doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

While he shuts out Justification, as done or effected by <hi>God obeying God,</hi> as he saith; how is the Creature to put this on as a Robe, seeing these Men like not to be concerned in Christ's <hi>inherent Righteousness</hi> or <hi>Holiness,</hi> as a Matter of <hi>Justification?</hi> Which while they are not Partakers of, nor cloathed with, they are cloathed with Sin and Iniquity, the <hi>Rags</hi> of old <hi>Adam</hi> and self-Righteousness, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And note, that if all Works and obeying God, even from Faith, must be counted the <hi>Deeds of the Law,</hi> by which none

be justified; then this makes the Apostle <hi>James</hi>'s Testimony void, as thwarting <hi>Paul</hi>'s, where <hi>James</hi> said, Was not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> our Father justified by Works? &amp;c.

                  <p>Again, If <hi>Abraham</hi>'s believing God, was imputed to him for Righteousness; and so the Righteousness of true andliving Faith be imputed to them also, who walk in the Steps of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was faithful &amp; obedient; for any to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Imputation of this Righteousness, as to its being within, or endeavour to exclude this Righteousness of Christ and Faith from true Believers, <hi>as only wrought without them, and not within them,</hi> because imputed or reckoned theirs; it were as good Doctrine to exclude true Faith and Obedience of it, as all wrought without us, not within us, and yet say, tis imputed to us; for living Faith which worketh by Love, and the Righteousness of it, are inseparable.</p>

                  <p n="1">For 1st, I never affirmed any such Doctrine, as that any Righteousness wrought by the Creature, doth redeem man s lost Soul to God; nor place any such Infinite Worth, Price or Merit upon any temporal Act or Work of Man; but Christ Jesus, who is God's Righteousness, is the Redeemer, Deli verer, and so the Redemption of the Soul to God, by whom also the Soul is enabled to true Obedience: It is by Grace in him, through Faith, that we are saved; not of our selves, it is the Gift of God; nor of Works, lest any Man should boast; howbeit, Good Works are ordained of God that we should walk in them; for we are his Workmanship, created in Christ again unto good Works, see <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, I never undervalued the Worth of Christ's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Flesh; far be it from me so to do, though yet I cannot own this man's placing mens absolute Justification on them, and from thence shutting out Christ's Inward Work of Sanctification; yet thereto both the Travil of his Soul.

                  <p>But I further perceive my Opposer is confounded in this matter of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Justification</hi> as he states it; for one while he reckons, tis only by <hi>God obeying God in our Nature;</hi> an other while, '<hi>tis only by the Sufferings and Death of Christ</hi> (which he calleth his Righteousness imputed) wherein also he contradicts divers of his eminent Brethren, <hi>who say, that Christ could not satisfie divine Justice as Man simply, by temporal Death and Suffering, because Infinite Justice must be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered with an infinite Satisfaction, Price or Payment</hi> for Man's Redemption: Others again are of the mind, <hi>that God Being Infinite and Perfect in all his Attributes both in Goodness, Love and Mercy as well as Justice; and Omnipotent in Power, he could

And can we be justified without pleasing God, or please God without Justification? or is not that of a justifying Nature which pleaseth God?

                  <p>But <hi>S.

                  <p>Again, <hi>John</hi> the beloved Disciple said, Hereby we know that we are of the Truth, and shall assure our Hearts before him; for if our Heart condemn us, God is greater then our Heart, and knoweth all things; but if our Heart condemn us not, then have we Confidence towards God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19. 20, 21. to the End.</p>

                  <p>The true Apostle said, Let us draw near with a true Heart, in full Assurance of Faith, having our Hearts sprinkled from an evil Conscience, and our Bodies washed with pure Water, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22.</p>
                  <p>But our Sin-pleasing <hi>Presbyters</hi> think to draw near unto God in a justified Condition on the Account of Christ's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings

                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostle <hi>Johns</hi> Testimony was, Herein is our Love made perfect (viz. in our dwelling in God, and God in us) that we may have Boldness in the Day of Judgment, because as he is, so are we in this World, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>But the Imperfection and Sin pleading <hi>Presbyters</hi> think to have Boldness in the Day of Judgment, because Christ was perfect and suffered in the Flesh, although they remain all their Dayes <hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>sinful,</hi> seeing <hi>nothing</hi> but <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Condemnation in themselves;</hi> and so are not at all like God nor Christ in this Present World: They think it will be a Sufficient Plea, that Christ was Perfect and Sinless in their stead; <hi>that God obeyed God,</hi> and so was like himself, how Imperfect and unlike him soever they be on this side the Grave; they conceiting themselves Elect Persons Christ said, If ye love me keep my Sayings, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 23. and <hi>John</hi> said, By this we know that we love the Children of God, when we love God and keep his Commandments; for this is the Love of God that we keep his Commandments and they are not Grievous, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 2. 3.</p>
                  <p>But our Opposers, the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and others, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they love God and his Children, while they are daily breaking and violating his Commandments, and will not believe it possible for any to keep them in this Life, though assisted by the Power of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> testified, That even <hi>Baptism</hi> doth now save us, not the putting away of the Filth of the Flesh (or outside Washing) but the Answer or (as some have it) Demand of a Good Conscience towards God by the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jesus Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                  <p>But our Opposers Belief and Principle is, That 'tis only Christ's Obedience, Sufferings and Death in the Flesh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, that doth save and Justifie them; and on this is only their Plea and Demand, and not from his Spirit's Work of Sanctification or spiritual Baptism, nor the Answer or Demand of a Good Conscience towards God; they have both shut out Sanctification and Holiness, (and so excluded Good Conscience) from being needful to Justification, or to constitute a Justifying Righteousness, <note n="*" place="marg1">

S.</hi> preaches such impious Doctrine: It was not Sanctification or Holiness within; nor yet the Works or Obedience of Faith that <hi>Paul</hi> either abhorred or rejected for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ, or that he might win Christ; but it was his former Confidence in the Flesh, his own self-Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, which was of the Law, and all those things that had been deemed as Gain to him, that he counted Loss for Christ, and for whom he suffered the Loss of all those things, and counted them but as Dung, that he might win Christ, which<note place="marg1">Phil. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> he could not so account of all Sanctification or Holiness, wrought by Christ within, nor of the Works of Faith: Can it be any less then Blasphemy (as in this man's Sense) thus to present and read <hi>Paul?</hi> viz. <hi>I abhor all Sanctification within, all Holiness and Works of Faith; and I count them but all Loss for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ Jesus; and have suffered the Loss of all my inward Holiness, Sanctification and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:105069:230"/>
Works of Faith, and do count them but Dung, that I may win Christ? &amp;c.</hi> How unlike <hi>Paul,</hi> odious and gross were it, thus to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his Words, as to say, <hi>Let us with</hi> Paul <hi>abhor all Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in us, &amp;c.</hi> neither doth <hi>Paul</hi> make any such Difference or Repugnancy between Christ's inward Work of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the Excellency of his Knowledge; nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween being in the Faith or Obedience thereof, and being in Christ and his Righteousness; but really desired that he might be found <hi>in</hi> Christ, not <hi>having</hi> (said he) mine own Righteousness, which is of the Law; <hi>but</hi> that which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. so far was he from either putting the Righteousness of Faith afar off, or abhorring Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within, that he desired to <hi>have</hi> it and be possessed with it, as one found <hi>in</hi> Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For that only doth God justifie us, which doth suffice to turn away</hi>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I deny his <hi>minor,</hi> as it depends on the Word <hi>only;</hi> for then, why are not all Men in the World justified, for whom Christ suffered and dyed? which was for <hi>all</hi> Men; he tasted Death for <hi>every</hi> Man, for the Sins of the whole World: And yet, he that believeth not on the Son hath not Life, but the Wrath of God abides upon him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without Faith, Repentance and Conversion (which are Effects of Christ's inherent Righteousness and Work) the Wrath is not turned away, nor are Men justified.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>Let us then place no Confidence in Sanctification, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Faith, and the Works that follow, as if these (laying aside Christ's Death on the Cross) could turn away God's Wrath, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Herein he varies from his Argument before, which was, that Christ's Sufferings <hi>only</hi> can turn away Wrath, justifie, &amp;c. Note, It is <hi>not</hi> Sanctification, Holiness, Faith, &amp;c. <hi>only</hi> can do it, without Christ's Death (or laying it aside) But while here he implies, that Sanctification, Holiness, Faith, &amp;c. (with respect to Christ's Death) can turn away Wrath, he hath contradicted his own Argument before of Christ's Sufferings <hi>only,</hi> which also cannot be slited; nor his Death made void, where true Faith &amp; Sanctification in him are enjoyed; for therein Christ himself is enjoyed, and we dare not preach nor own such Doctrine, as <hi>to abhor all Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in us;</hi> nor the having <hi>no</hi> Confidence in Faith and Sanctification, which are wrought in the Soul by Christ Jesus.</p>

                  <p n="1">1st. That Man's Dying in the Day he so eat, was the Fruit of his Fall into a State of Misery, <hi>in</hi> dying from that State of Righteousness and Felicity he was in before; and it was the Natural Effect of his Transgression; and yet not so as that God was absolutely bound to bring eternal Death on Man in that day, no, no; nor was divine Justice so narrowly tyed up or short sighted, as not to reserve a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, for God had the Seed of the Woman in his eye; and divine Justice doth not require that eternal Death or the second death, shall remain upon any, but on the finally Impenitent, who continue in Sin under the Power of the first Death; for all they who return to God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ the promised Seed, he proves to them both a Just God and a Saviour: neither Justice nor the Curse of the Law can limit him from shewing Mercy, Remission or Salvation to the Creature, upon true Repentance and Faith in Christ Jesus, who overcomes the World and the

evil Nature; from whence those cursed Actions have sprung, mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 15. to the end of the Chapter.

                  <p>Yet what the Law saith, it saith to them that are under the Law, that every Mouth may be stopt, and all the World may become Guilty before God: This Law there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as thus convicting) is Spiritual and tends to man's Conversion, in that it is to prepare him for Mercy, which divine Justice doth not hinder, nor detain the World under the Guilt; divine Truth being concerned in the gracious Promises, which are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Seed that ransoms Man, slayes the Enmity, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Transgressors or first Birth which must dye, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Law and its Sentence of Death must pass; and Man that is guilty must feel this in himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be delivered into that State wherein there is no Condemnation, or be united to the Lord who <hi>Kills</hi> and makes <hi>Alive:</hi> So that neither Justice nor Truth in the Law are frustrated; the Law is not made void through Faith, but established in the Spirituality and Purity of it; the Righteousness of the Law being fulfilled in them that walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit; And 'tis said, that the Righteousness of God without the Law is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, being witnessed <hi>by</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> and the Prophets, even the Righteousness of God, which is by the Faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. Christ came to condemn <hi>Sin</hi> in the Flesh; and is the End of the Law for Righteousness, to all them that believe (and not for the Continuance of Unrighteousness) and where Sin is put an End to by Christ, the Curse and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of necessity ceaseth with it, and the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Faith takes place in the Soul.</p>

                  <p>Is it not evident, that God is not engaged under Revenge (nor his Mercy and Truth divided or opposite) as this Man

renders him? For both must be received, and have their place where Judgment and Mercy meet, and men through the Law become dead unto the Law, so as to know Christ to live in them, and through God's Judgment and Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to find a Ransom and an Attonement; and God hath Power to turn away Wrath, as he doth upon men's true Repentance, Humiliation and Return to him; as when the King humbled himself, the Wrath of the Lord turned away from him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 12. And also <hi>Hezekiah</hi> seeing the Wrath of the Lord upon <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil in his Sight, and turning their Backs, &amp;c. He said, Now is it in mine Heart to make a Covenant with the Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi> that his fierce Wrath may turn away from us, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 8, 10. And (in the King's Letters) be ye not stiff necked but yield your selves unto the Lord; serve the Lord your God, that the Fierceness of his Wrath may turn away from you, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 30. 6, 8. The King did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Curses pronounced before in <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Offenders, did obliege God to perpetual Revenge, or not to turn away his fierce Wrath, if the People turned from their Iniquities: And said the Lord unto his Church (that was to be gathered of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) In a little Wrath I hid my Face from thee for a Moment; but with Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Loving Kindness will I have Mercy on thee, saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, <hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 8. And concerning <hi>Israel,</hi> whose Heart was not right with God, neither were they stedfast in his Covenant; 'tis written, But he being full of Compassion, forgave their Iniquity, and destroyed them not; Yea, many a time turned he his Anger away, and did not stir up all his Wrath; for he remembred, that they were but Flesh, &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 37, 38. Yea, in the midst of Judgment and in Wrath he hath remembred Mercy; Righteousness, and Equity are the Stablishment of his Throne; Mercy and Truth go before his Face, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 14. See how well consistent his Mercy and Truth are: also <hi>Psal.</hi> 57. 3. and 61. 7. and 98. 3. and 103. 8. and 115. 1. and 119. 64. and 130. 7. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 4.</p>
                  <p>Therefore neither his Justice, Law nor Truth could intend (or be) any Limitation or Tye to his Power or Soveraignity, not to turn away his Wrath, or shew Mercy to them that turn away from Evil; and Mercy rejoyceth against Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (or Condemnation) <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 13. His Truth is so far from stopping the Mouth of Mercy; yea, 'tis most evident

to the spiritual Travellers, that though God hide his Face, and send forth his Terrors because of Mens Iniquities and Sins, he hath Power to turn away his Wrath, extend Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and shew the Light of his Countenance (as he really doth) when Men turn from Iniquity, and depart from Evil, and with broken Hearts submit themselves to his Power, who keepeth Covenant and Mercy toward them that love him, and them that keep his Commandments, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.

                     <p>Quest. 1. <hi>WHat was the Nature and Extent of Christ's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

The Weight and Burthen of Sin and Grief of Soul because thereof, as seeing the Punishment and Wrath incurred by the Rebellious. 2. The Fury of his Persecutors, in his undergoing that cruel Death of the Cross, inflicted on his Body by wicked Hands and Murtherers; so that his Sufferings were two-fold, both inw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

His real Desire, Travil of SouI and good Will through all, was for the Benefit and Good of all Mankind, even for the whole World (for whom he suffered and dyed) that all (who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him) might be spiritually influenced with his holy Life, and partake of his Mind and Will, which stood in subjection to the Father.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 2. <hi>What was the true Signification, Intent and Ends of Christ's Sufferings?</hi>

Mediator of it. 5. To shew God's great Condescension to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive poor lost Man again on the Terms of this new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, reinforced by the Death of his Son, that Man coming into this new Covenant, he might experience a real Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with God, even in the Son of his Love.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 3. <hi>How far the Light in Man is necessary, and answers the Intent and Ends of Christ's Sufferings?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It is absolutely necessary to Salvation, being that divine Principle of <hi>Light</hi> within, which directly guides all them that obey it, into the Way and Dispensation of the new Covenant, whereby they secretly experience the real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Virtue and Ends of Christ's Sufferings and Blood.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 4. <hi>Whether the Light of Christ within (in each Degree of it) be not the</hi> New-Covenant Light <hi>in Nature and Kind, and the certain Guide into this Covenant?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It is; being it was the Life that was in Christ (as the eternal Word) that was and is the Light of Men; which Life or Light is therefore divine and spiritual, as the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Covenant Dispensation is.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 5. <hi>Whether the Word within, the Law within, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment within, the Kingdom of God within and the Light within, be not one and the same thing, and so the Life of the New Covenant?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> They are: The Names, Degrees and Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do not alter or vary the divine Nature or Life thereof.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 6. <hi>The</hi> Satisfaction, <hi>what? and in what did it consist?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Not rigid Payment from Christ to God. 2. Not of the Nature of Payment, for all Sins past, present and to come (as stated by Sin-pleasers) 3. Not Christ's undergoing infinite Wrath or Revenge from his Father (for these were never exacted nor required of him) But the Satisfaction was in Christ, as the Son of the Father's Love, the Delight of his Soul, and as he was a Sacrifice of a sweet smelling Savour to him; both the Father and the Son condescended in one and the same Infinite Love for Man's Recovery out of Sin and Death, and for his Deliverance from Wrath to come, being
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:105069:239"/>
confessed to be equally kind to Man, and equally angry at Man's Sin) God so loved the World, that he freely sent his only begotten Son, &amp;c. And in the same Love the Son free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave his Life, yea, even himself a Ransom for all, for a Testimony in due Time.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 7. <hi>What is true</hi> Justification?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It is properly and strictly <hi>a making Man Just</hi> (viz. through the Washing of Regeneration) It is also not only God's pardoning Sins past for Christ's sake, through Faith in his Name; but also God's absolute accepting, owning and blessing all them who faithfully obey, persevere and walk in the Light and Law of the new Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Q. 8. <hi>What is the true or real</hi> Imputation <hi>of Righteousness?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It is the same with <hi>Justification</hi> (as it relates to God's reckoning or esteeming that Man Righteous that partakes of the everlasting Righteousness of Christ by a living Faith in him) and so the same Righteousness and Holiness of Christ as inwardly revealed and brought forth in the new Creature that is made conformable to his Image; and so all the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Fruits and Effects of Christ's Power and inward Work of Righteousness, as true Faith, Love, Obedience, Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Holiness, Integrity of Spirit to God, are acceptable to him, accounted of and reckoned unto his People for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and all still for Christ's sake, who is the Author and Finisher of true, living, saving, justifying Faith; as, <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, and it was reckoned to him for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; We say then, that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith was so recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or imputed to him: It has been by some confest (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Creature) <hi>That there can be no liking one another without Likeness of Disposition;</hi> nor doth God receive Man into actual Friendship with himself, without being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed after his Image.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 9. <hi>Who are the</hi> Subjects <hi>of everlasting Wrath and Vengeance?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Wicked and Rebellious Persons, who reject the Love of the Truth tendered to them, such as tread under Foot, crucifie or contemn the Son of God, sleight the Blood
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:105069:240"/>
of the Covenant, and do Despite to the Spirit of Grace.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 10. <hi>Whether it consists with divine Justice or Truth in God, to shew Mercy and to be an absolute Saviour, after so much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done against him and his Commands by</hi> Adam's <hi>Fall, and the actual Disobedience of his Posterity in the Fall?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes; It is not inconsistent with divine Justice, sor God to be the absolute Saviour of all that return to him and believe in him, he being a just God and a Saviour, besides (or without) whom there is no Saviour: Absolute divine Justice in God doth not limit him, nor withold Mercy from the Creature in the first Place; nor doth it produce Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Revenge, until his Goodness be rejected and wholy slighted; for he saith plainly, I am a just God and Saviour, &amp;c. I, even I, for my own sake do pardon Transgression.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 11. <hi>Whether Divine Justice did properly and strictly require a full Payment and Punishment upon Christ in man's stead, for all the Debt contracted, and Injury done by fallen Man?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> No; Christ's Sufferings were not of that Nature or Intent; but as it was by the Grace of God that he <hi>tasted Death</hi> for every Man: They shewed God's Patience, and proclaimed his Mercy, in Order to pardon all that return to him from the Evil of their Wayes.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 12. <hi>Whether God as Rector and Judge, could dispense</hi>
                        <note place="marg1">Object.</note> 
                        <hi>with the Act of Law, and not rather with the immediate Object? Did he not substitute an Innocent Person to undergo the Punishment or Severity of the Law due to Sin and Sinners?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rep.</hi> This is objected by some of our Opposers, which m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>st needs imply a great Dispensation with, and Digression from the very Intent of the Law: If the severe Punishment of it be removed from the Unrighteous (for whom it was made, and who have incurred it) and fully inflicted upon Jesus Christ, the Righteous <hi>One</hi> that never Sinned, Could God thus far dispense with the Intent of the Law, and yet not forgive Sin, without such a kind of Satisfaction and Payment supposed? Oh, sad Blasphemy and Inconsistency! And seeing it hath been confessed by some of our Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Opposers, that <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is not a Scripture-Phrase but

a Notion of Law, and made <hi>agendo &amp; patiendo,</hi> viz. by Christ's Obedience <hi>in Doing,</hi> and Subjection in <hi>Suffering</hi> the Penaltey, which the Law should have inflicted upon Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, I propose these <hi>three Questions</hi> to our Opposers.</p>
                     <p>Q. 1. Were it <hi>Reasonable</hi> or true to say, the Creditor has forgiven both the Debt and Injury, if it be all paid and fully punished in the Surety?</p>
                     <p>Q. 2. Were it <hi>Justice</hi> in the Creditor to detain the Debtor in Prison, if his Debts be all paid by the Surety? or to suffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Q. 3. Doth not your Doctrine of such <hi>Rigid or Severe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> oppose Christ's Intercession? Howbeit we still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, the Man Christ was greatly acceptable and most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently satisfactory, considered as a Sacrifice of a sweet smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Savour to God, and as the first Fruits.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 13. <hi>What did the</hi> Blood of Christ <hi>that was shed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak? and what is our Sense of Christ's Blood; and for what End owned?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1st, It did bespeak Remission of Sin past to all that truly repent and believe in him. 2dly, Our Sense of the Blood of Christ is a living and spiritual Sense of the Virtue and Efficacy of it, as through it we receive Redemption, even the Forgiveness of Sins. 3dly, We really own and confess to the Blood of Christ, both in the History and in the Mystery, as most significant to express his Life which he gave a Ransom; and the Value of the one Offering, we do in the sight of God confess, and own the Blood of Christ both as shed for us, and as sprinkling and purging our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences from dead Works: And this We are come to know by his Light shining in our Hearts, which as we walk in [the Light] we have Fellowship one with another, and the Blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all Sin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.

That God poured down his <hi>Wrath</hi> or Revenge upon his Innocent Son, for <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to divine Justice in Man's stead that had done the Injury: I say, all the Scriptures alleged by them, can never prove this; but rather, 1.

And as the Reproaches, Suffering and Death of the Cross that he sustained from the Wicked &amp; Murtherers, were temporal or had an End; and not as infinite Wrath and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge from God, due to wicked Men. 3. Yet Christ was rendred a Curse, and as made to be Sin; This he could not properly be a in his own being for <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>a Curse</hi> (in this

abstract Sense) couldnot strictly relate to his pure and sinless being; but so made or reputed with respect to his bearing the Reproach and Sin of many, the outward Punishment Crucifying, Death, and Blood-sheding: And all that was in him, which in any sense might be said to Suffer, was offered and given for the Advantage and Good of Mankind; and that which he so gave and offered, was called his <hi>Life, Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, a Ransom,</hi> and all some times in Scripture comprehended and expressed under the Phrase <hi>The Blood, the pretious Blood</hi> of Christ, that redeems from the vain Conversation, purgeth the Conscience, &amp;c. and even the outward part of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, most Innocent Example, his Cross, Death, Blood of his Cross, his reviving again, were so far from yielding ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Indulgence or justification to men as in Sin and Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that they did very eminently preach and openly proclaim to Mankind, both the Condemnation of Sin in the Flesh, Repentance, Mortification, Remission, and Man's reviving again to real Righteousness and Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therein; and all to be experienced through Faith in the Name and Power of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God; in sending of whom the Father's Love was manifest, that we might live through him.</p>
                     <p>And, as Christ's Travil of Soul was inward, and so his Suffering inward, as well as outward, what is more obvious to the spiritual Eye and Mind, then that his Travil and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and his holy Design therein, were to have an inward Effect, and inwardly to be fulfilled by his Word and Power, even in them who receive and believe in the same? as that Instance of the holy <hi>Evangelist</hi> is very plain and pertinent, where 'tis said, They brought unto him many that were possessed with <hi>Divels,</hi> and he Cast out the Spirits with his Word, and healed all that were Sick, that it might be <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled</hi> which was spoken by <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet, saying, <hi>Himself took our Infirmities, and bare our Sicknesses;</hi> see Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Let it be seriously here minded, 1. That those Scriptures relating to Christ's Death, Reconciliation, Sanctification, and putting away Sin, as by Way of Sacrifice, &amp;c. as <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 22. which intimate the Work, as if universally done; yet it is with respect unto the general Favour and Good-Will of God in Christ, as by the which Will, we (Believers) are sanctified through the Offering of the Body of Jesus; and so we are said to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled in the Body of his Flesh through Death: Withall note, that it was the manner of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Prophets and Apostles, to speak many Things in the Spirit of Prophecy, <hi>as done</hi> or <hi>past</hi> before they were accomplished in the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, God having an Eye of Pitty and Compassion open to

lost Man for his Redemption, even before it was fulfilled, whereby he saw and lookt beyond the former Transgressions, Sins and Infirmities; for the Sin of the World is not actually taken away, purged out or put away, as to its Nature and Be ing (nor are Men in a State of Reconciliation or Friendship) while actual Sinners and Enemies in their Minds, but as they come to be converted and sanctified by the Spirit: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God's reconciling the World in and by his Son, shews his gracious Will, and was intended conditionally to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in them (viz. Upon Faith and Obedience) It was done so, as with respect unto Christ as the first Fruits, and with an Eye to the Condition, before it was actually fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in them; and what was outwardly signified as to the Good of Man by Christ's Sufferings and Death in the Flesh, as our great Exemplar (in his Obedience and Holiness) is inwardly to be fulfilled and answered in Spirit, as to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, End and Design of God therein: as for Instance, <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the World to himself;</hi> yet the Apostle added, <hi>We pray you in Christ's stead, be you reconciled to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20. And to the Saints at <hi>Colos.

Mark, on this Condition they were reconciled and to be presented to God; <hi>Not</hi> as being Enemies and in wicked Works, <hi>But</hi> as made Friends by Conversion to and continuing in the Faith: And God shewing forth Mercy to all, and universal Pardon of Sin past, in and for the sake of his Son Christ Jesus (he being the Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his not imputing their Trespasses unto them according to Severity; but his being reconciled to them, that they may be reconciled to him.</p>
                     <p>Finally, Because God was in Christ reconciling the World to himself; and because he commended his Love to us, while we were Sinners, and we reconciled, &amp;c. by the Death of his Son, as our Representative: If from hence any infer, <hi>That their Sin being not imputed, therefore they are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the Imputation of Christ's Death and Blood, though they continue in Sin and Disobedience to him, and remain Unsanctified,</hi> I must deny their Consequence, and tell them, that there is <hi>a two-fold non-Imputation</hi> of Sin; or, under a two-fold conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

                        <p>Believe that it is God's good Pleasure, Sin <hi>should be</hi> in you all your Dayes, to keep you humble; and that Christ <hi>hath satisfied</hi> for all your Sins past, present and to come.</p>
                        <p>Believe that God hath poured out all his Wrath <hi>upon his Son</hi> Jesus Christ, and punisht your Sin to the full in him, to satisfie Justice for your Injury done him; Therefore there remains no more Wrath behind <hi>for you,</hi> being Elect and Justified Persons: Though you commit Sin, as did <hi>David,</hi> and have Corruption remaining in you all your Dayes, and and daily Sin in your best Duties, and have Sin mixt with your Graces; your Salvation is eternally secured for you, as Persons whom God has had in his Eye to save; you need not fear any final Fall, or falling away from Grace, once in Christ and <hi>ever</hi> in Christ.

they had not from all Eternity; and so seeing the Way and Act of God's chusing Men, must be through Sanctification, and of the Spirit, and Belief of the Truth (which Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on answers this Decree) he hath not designed nor ordein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the contrary Condition (of his Wrath against Man) as Sin and Unbelief, though they are come to pass upon many, whose Repentance and Return God rather willed, then their Death or Destruction.

(which may be rejected by Man) 2. The Words [from the Beginning] are so far from signifying <hi>from all Eternity,</hi> that in this place they reach not so far as to the Time of the Beginning of the Creation; but rather to the Time of their first Reception and Belief of the Truth, according as they import in divers other places, as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 11.

And then it is plain, they were both <hi>of</hi> and <hi>in</hi> the World, before they were chosen <hi>out</hi> of the World; for could they be chosen out of that-which they were never <hi>in?</hi> So that Christ's Chusing his <hi>out</hi> of the Corrupt Wayes and Spirit of the World through <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> is the Reason why the World hates them, which it did not while they were Conformable to the World.

They cloak this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reserve with general Tenders of Good, imagining God to be as partial in his Intentions, and both as slighty and Contradictory in his Call and Proffers as themselves; as if he should call all to Repentance and Life, and yet to have created them with Intention to leave the Greater Part in the Fall for Eternal Death (or rather, to have from Eternity reprobated them) or as his Masters of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly<note place="marg1">Confession of Faith.</note> say, He hath <hi>before ordained</hi> them to everlasting Death; the Contradiction of which Doctrines both to God's uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Love, Grace, and Call, as also to themselves, how manifest is it? That he should from Eternity ordain them for Reprobation, whom in due time he gives Light unto, and calls to Repentance, how plainly inconsistent are these and contradictory? One while to say, he hath <hi>reprobated</hi> them; another while, he <hi>passeth by</hi> them: One while, he hath <hi>before ordained them to everlasting Death;</hi> another while, he <hi>creates them with Intention to leave them</hi> without Recovery; which though all in curreth the same End (as is supposed to a certain fore designed Number of Persons) yet the State of the Case (as it reflects upon God) is as much opposite and contrary, as to say, God doth absolutely, eternally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree Man's Destruction, or did reprobate them from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and then that he purposely passeth by, and leaves them

to destroy or kill themselves; whereas his good Will, and Kindness, and free Proffers of Grace and Salvation to lost Man admits of neither, to wit, neither of such Cruelty to, nor Carelesness of his Creatures; his Mercies are over all his Works, and his Grace and Mercy in the first place exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all: And that saying, <hi>He will have Mercy on whom he will,</hi> is no Limitation to the first extent of his Grace and good Will; But that he will have Mercy, both by way of Encrease and Continuance to the Upright-hearted, even to them that fear him, who Love and obey him; but those that are destroyed, their Destruction is of themselves, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, But my People would not hearken unto my Voice, <hi>Israel</hi> would none of me; <hi>Therefore</hi> (mark the Cause) I gave them over to their own Hearts Lusts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 11. and as <hi>S.

And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Fall of those Angels that fell, <hi>1st,</hi> God did neither particularly design it; nor was he the Author of it, no more then of Men's Transgressions in general; he hath ordained the Punishment of the Ungodly, not their Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for in <hi>Jude</hi> 6. it is said, The Angels which kept not their first Estate (or Principality) but left their own Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he hath reserved in everlasting Chains under Darkness, &amp;c. To that Saying, <hi>God could have preserved them,</hi> I answer, They provoked him, which was their great Sin and Loss to themselves; Therefore he saw it not meet to continue his Love and Favour to them which they had so abused: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it his Will or Way to detain or restrain any forceably in his Way, whether they will or not; nor to preserve any without their Diligence in attending upon him, and keeping
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:105069:256"/>
their Habitations. <hi>2dly,</hi> So likewise concerning those that were ordained of old to this Condemnation, <hi>Jude</hi> 4. (or as it may be read) who were of old prescribed to this Judgment of the Ungodly) however they <hi>as</hi> Ungodly Men, were so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for Condemnation; not meerly <hi>as</hi> particular Persons, but as such, who were so far fallen from the Grace of God, as to transfer his Favours unto Luxury, <hi>denying the only Lord God;</hi> They were also <hi>Trees</hi> whose Fruit wither d, twice dead, &amp;c. <hi>Jude</hi> 12. Surely they could not be twice <hi>Dead,</hi> if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been <hi>Quickned;</hi> but their Ingratitude and Abuse of the Grace of God that had quickned them, caused their Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnation; as, God spared not the Angels that sinned, but cast them down to Hell, they having left their own Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and spared not the old World, nor the Cities of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> whom he condemned with an Overthrow, making them an Ensample unto those that after should live Ungodly, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. This sufficiently declares the Reason &amp; Cause of Condemnation, both to Angels and Men to be their Sin, in forsaking the Lord, and living Ungodly.</p>
                     <p>But whereas <hi>S. S.</hi> renders God's fore-knowledge of all his Works, as the Reason or Proof, That he from eternity <hi>decreed</hi> particular Angels and Men for Destruction (which appears Contradictory to his Masters of the Assemblies confessing, viz. <hi>That God hath not decreed any thing because he foresaw it as future,</hi> Confess. Chap. 3) This Proof is as impertinent as the rest of his shallow Arguments; for his fore-Knowledge being infinite, it is no Proof that he hath absolutely decreed or ordained all things that come to pass, because he foresaw all; for he hath not ordained that Men should live in Sin, though he hath designed their Punishment who do so live; yet known unto the Lord are all his Work's, both those of his Creation which he wrought according to his absolute Pleasure, both in Heaven, and in Earth, and in the Sea, &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 135. 6. and Man was not capable of resisting his Maker in forming of him; he was as the Clay in his Hand; as also, the Lord foreknew his work of Sanctification and saving of man from Sin and Death; but this is not effected without a Subjection to his Will, and a Compliance with his Spirit, and Power in his Work within: They are not Partakers of Salvation from Sin, who wilfully gain-say the Truth, resist the holy Ghost, and act Despite against the Spirit of Grace.</p>
                     <p>But further, I find <hi>S. S.</hi> so uncertain in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his partial Proposition for a personal Election and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:105069:256"/>
Reprobation, that he is made sometimes to grant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to Truth to his own absolute Confutation, and the Break neck of his graceless Cause; As by his Confessing, <q>That <hi>God hath no Pleasure in the Death of him that dieth; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered</hi>

Or, if particularly &amp; unchangeably ordained to Life and Salvation from all Eternity, Could there be any such Danger of their perishing, or that they should thus need to be threatned with Cursing and Perishing, if their Heart turned away from the Lord? For had they been unchangeably designed of God for the one End (whether Life or Death) were it not very inconsistent to propose both conditionally to them? as namely, to exhort them to chuse Life; or if they refused, to threaten them with perishing &amp;c. do not you partial-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Calvinists</hi> by such kind of Preaching, and Propositions so contrary to your partial Principle, most grosly dissemble with People, and mock them contrary to your own Belief? whenas <hi>Moses,</hi> the Prophets and Apostles in such like Conditional Promises and Threats believed what they spoak; they believed and therefore spoak from the Spirit of God, which cannot lie nor dissemble. If you say, God hath decreed particular Persons Salvation by such Warnings, you thereby tell us that he hath decreed it by Threatning them with Damnation, and thereby you affix your <hi>non-sense</hi> &amp; incongruous Doctrine upon God, rather then you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess your own <hi>nonsensical Contradiction</hi> therein, which runs thus, <hi>That God hath from all Eternity unchangeably designed some Persons eternal Salvation, and yet that he warns and threatens the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with eternal Damnation or Perdition, if they refuse Life, or to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

[<hi>all these</hi>] he intends all these conditional Promises and Threats, are so subservient (as I think he doth) then God's Decrees of Men Salvation or Damnation, are also conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal accordingly: as <hi>first,</hi> If you seek the Lord he will be found of you (and then as all are called to seek the Lord, he hath also given Liberty and a Capacity to all to seek him that they may find him) this I grant to be according to his good Will, and subservient to his Decree, as his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Son into the World, not to condemn the World, but that the World through him be saved; for he verily was fore-ordained before the Foundation of the World, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20, 21. But <hi>then</hi> I deny, that God hath either decreed or ordained that men's Hearts should turn away from him, or that they shall forsake him; or love Darkness rather then the true Light (which is come into the World) whereby many cause their own Condemnation: How dare any say or <hi>think,</hi> that all these are subservient to the soveraign Design of Gods Decrees, as they must who say, that he has <hi>unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably decreed whatsoever comes to pass?</hi> which renders him to be the Author of those and such Sins and Abuses against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his Love, and that in order to serve his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; which is very blasphemous against God, who hath testified otherwise, as namely, <hi>Thy Destruction is of thy self, but in me thine Help,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>Hoseah,</hi> 13. 9. <hi>and why will ye die, O house of Israel?</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Let the <hi>Reader</hi> observe the State of the <hi>Question,</hi> which is not, <hi>Whether the Saints had Failings,</hi> or upon extream Tryals, might not be tempted into Impatiency? but, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such a State of Perfection be attainable in this Life?</hi> which we affirm.</p>

                     <hi>Attainable,</hi> chiefly, because of the Aid and Assistance of God's Power afforded unto them who wait upon him, and

                  <p n="4">4. Christ's Work and Ministry <hi>is, to destroy the Work of the Devil; to present men perfect; to bring them to a perfect man in him; to subject every Thought unto his Obedience,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, to affirm the contrary, or that a State free from all Sin is <hi>not</hi> attainable in this Life, is to oppose the all-Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of God's Almighty Power, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Whereas he puts two differing Senses on the word <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;</hi> viz. <hi>a State free from all Sin,</hi> as that of the Spirits of Just men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. And yet that it doth <hi>not</hi> alwayes sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Is it in any thing consistent with Sin; or in himself in whom is no Sin, whom he that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in, sinneth not? I cannot understand that <hi>Perfection,</hi> as it is the Effect of Christ's Work in true Believers, can admit of the Continuance of Sin all their Dayes, while it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies both the Reality and Compleatness of his Works.</p>
                  <p>His Instance for <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>rfection not free</hi> from <hi>all Sin,</hi> is <hi>Job</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Job</hi> was a Perfect man, yet <hi>not without Sin;</hi> for he Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Day.</p>
                  <p>It is evident that <hi>Job's</hi> Perfection had none of this Extream in it, nor did it consist with Sin; for it is thus explained, <hi>He feared God &amp; eschewed Evil.</hi> — And upon his Loss of Goods and Children, being told him, its said of him; <hi>in all this</hi> Job <hi>sinned not, nor Charg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>But, he Cursed his Day, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>He was then under an extream Tryal and Grief divers wayes aggravated; the most that can be reasonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from thence, is, that a Perfect or Upright Man that fears God, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>d eschews Evil, may possibly through great Tryals, Temptations or Provocations, be drawn into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream to express his Grief: but this only, if God suffers <hi>Satan</hi> so to affict, or deeply to try: for, he could not have so afflicted <hi>Job,</hi> if God had not suffered him, in that he saw the Lord had hedged him about.</p>
                  <p>From whence observe, that what is granted hereupon, and what he argues, is not in pursuance of the State of the Question, as to grant, that a Perfect <hi>Job</hi> may be tempted into some extream Expressions, if God Suffer <hi>Satan</hi> so deeply to afflict him: but, Whether it be not possible for such a one to be delivered as well from all Failings or Sin, as from the Tryal or Temptation? For was not <hi>Job a Perfect Man</hi> both before and after his Deep Affliction? and is not his Patience highly commended of, who said, <hi>when I am tried I shall come forth as Gold?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, when I affirm that this refined State was <hi>attainable</hi> in this Life, were it not absurd to object, that it is not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Job</hi> cursed his Day? for did <hi>Job</hi> do so all his Life time; or did his Perfection reach no higher?</p>
                  <p>His Instance, <hi>That God took six Dayes to create the World, when he could have done it in a Moment,</hi> is no Proof that he is <hi>only</hi> a mortifying Sin more and more in this Life, and that he will remove its <hi>Being in the next,</hi> pag. 63.</p>
                  <p>Neither do the Scriptures any where say, that the <hi>Being of Sin</hi> (yet mortified <hi>in part</hi>) shall remain in the Saints till, the next Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e; though we grant, God took six Dayes to create the World, and rested the seventh; and so he carrieth on his Work gradually in the true Believer for the perfecting of the new Creation; the six I ayes Work thereof, as also the Seventh Day of Rest, are to be experienced in this Life: the Work o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> Holiness is to be perfected while in the Body, and he that believeth enters into his Rest or Sabbath, to injoy the <hi>holy Day</hi> in that inward retired waiting upon the Lord in his own Light, wherein Man must not think his own Thoughts, nor speak his own Words: And as for God's Work, it is perfect; each Day's Work was perfect (as such)
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:105069:265"/>
the first Day's Work not mended on the sixth Day; and he that hath begun a good Work in the Soul is able to perfect it.</p>

                     <hi>First,</hi> How Impiously he reflects upon God; as seeing it <hi>Good</hi> to suffer Corruptions, either but in part mortified, or in part unmortified in his Saints (in this Life) for his Doctrine bears the same Sense on both Hands, as that God sees it good to suffer Corruptions; if but in part mortified, then in part <hi>unmortified</hi> in his Saints.

                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> What a great Use and Service doth he place upon the remaining of Corruptions in the Saints, as namely, to <hi>keep them humble,</hi> exercise and drive them to his Blood and Righteousness, which is as good Doctrine, as to say, <hi>There is a Necessity for the Saints to sin, that they may be humbled,; to do Evil, that Good may come of it:</hi> and by this, the more they sin, the more humble; the more Unrighteous or Corrupt, the more Partakers of the Blood &amp; Righteousness of Christ; which are gross I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

God forbid.</hi> Christ's Blood cleanseth us from all Sin, as we walk in the Light; and his Righteousness admitteth of no Iniquity to continue: For us to feel the Remission of Sins past, through the Blood and Righteousness of Christ, when we are come to the lively Act and Operation of Faith, therein doth sufficiently render the infinite Perfection of Pardoning Grace both splendent and glorious; and not to say, That <hi>God sees good that Corruptions in part should continue in his Saints to keep them humble:</hi> for this is a manifest plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:105069:266"/>
for Sin, and a Commendation given to it, as to those good Effects (vainly supposed) of Corruptions, viz. <hi>To keep the Saints humble, to drive them to his Blood;</hi> whereas when they are truly humbled, and Partakers of the Blood and Righteousness of Christ, and living in the Sence thereof, they withstand all Sin and Iniquity, and dare not give way thereto, that they may be righteous: They that will teach men true Humility, must not teach them to be Proud, that they may be Humble; nor tell them, that it is God's good Pleasure that the Being of Sin and Corruptions must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in them all their dayes, or till the Life to come, to keep them humble; neither is a perfect or holy State so void of true Humility as this Sin-pleasing Doctrine implyeth.</p>
                  <p>But this is something like the <hi>Papists</hi> high Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man's Fall, where, in their <hi>Saturday-Mass,</hi> in the <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>'s Hymn are these words, <hi>O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <head>THE ANSWER To Tho. Hicks about the RESURRECTION, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>First,</hi> T. H. accuses us from what one <hi>Tarner</hi> should say; but answers not what he said, or his Argument.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> He accuseth us in general words, <hi>with manifest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of the Resurrection of the Body.</hi> For which his Instance is our saying, That Flesh and Blood shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</p>
                  <p>Observe hence, That 'tis no marvel that he reviles and slanders us, and thinks we have some reserved Meaning, like the <hi>Jesuitical Equivocation;</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="marg1">Dialoge,</note> p. 56. when he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused us for making use of the Apostles plain words, which he hath not answered: Would it be well taken if he should positively say, That the Apostle denyed the Resurrection, when he saith, Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50. Its one thing to deny Men's carnal gross Thoughts about the Seed, Resurrection and Body: And it is another thing wholely to deny the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body in those general Expressions.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> He pretends to desire Information what the Body is we believe shall arise again; when before he hath positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accused us with manifest <hi>Denyal of the Resurrection of the Body,</hi> that is, of <hi>any</hi> Body, if he meant as his words import.</p>
                  <p>And here again he is obtruding upon us that Fool's Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, which the Apostle reproved, when in answer thereto he said, Thou Fool, that which thou sowest is not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened except it dye: And thou sowest not that Body which shall be; but God gives it a Body as it pleaseth him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 35, 36, 37, 38.</p>
                  <p>For which again he queries, Whether we do not tacitely <hi>deny</hi> the Resurrection of the Body? For all this man's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Scripture being his <hi>Rule,</hi> he is not content with the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:105069:278"/>
Scripture-Language, nor yet willing to resign up himself to the Pleasure of God, in giving to every Seed its own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as it pleaseth him.</p>
                  <p>But such busie Intruders will be inquisitive concerning the manner of God's executing his Pleasure in this thing: Whereas men's present Concern should be rather to wait to know, and submit to the good Pleasure of God in this Life; and to find a part in Christ Jesus, who is the Resurrection and the Life, that they might be assured of the good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and Fruits of God's good Pleasure hereafter.</p>
                  <p>For it is a Design of Satan to busie and puzzle men's Thoughts about their Existences in Heaven, while he keeps them in Sin and Darkness, in the Way to Hell: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if they would faithfully serve God in the Way of his Grace here on Earth, they would freely trust him with the Manner how he will Glorifie them hereafter.</p>
                  <p>And my saying, We ought not to be Curious in these Matters, to inquire into God's secret Pleasure in things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our Capacity; neither do I desire to make my self wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser then I am; nor to appear wise above (or besides) what is written (<hi>viz.</hi> in this Case.)</p>
                  <p>Doth this argue that the Divine <hi>Light within</hi> is not the <hi>Rule</hi> above the Scriptures? as is implyed in his 57th page; when I confess it to be that, that gives the true Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; and to be wise according to what is written, And not to pretend the Scriptures for Proof of what they prove not.</p>
                  <p>As for Instance; When I am called to answer an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptural Question, by such as profess Scripture to be their Rule; I think it most meet to answer them in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Language, which while they are not satisfied with, they inquire but to Cavil, and for Advantage, as my Opposer and some others of his Abettors did. As for a more particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, when they query about the Resurrection of the Body; as desiring I would inform them, what Body that is, that shall arise again? which being the same with that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle reproves for, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 35. it deserves the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof for Answer, vers. 36, 37.</p>
                  <p>Again, Though I really confess the Universal Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body of Mankind, or of the whole <hi>Adam;</hi> which implieth,</p>
                  <p n="1">

to the Resurrection of Damnation; yet for the very Phrase, namely, <hi>The Resurrection of the Body of Flesh, &amp;c.</hi> I find not in Scripture; But the <hi>Resurrection of the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> Upon my Answer in the Apostle's very words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 35. the feigned <hi>Christian</hi> saith, This Answer <hi>Whitehead</hi> said, is sufficient for such busie intruding Fools, p. 57. By which he hath contradicted what he saith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Whitehead</hi> answered in p. 54. But then he adds, The Apostle calls Fools, not they that believed; but they that deny the Resurrection of the Body, Persons of the same Perswasion with the <hi>Quakers</hi> in this Point, p. 57.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did positively deny the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> he hath not proved; But that some questioned like him, How, and with what Body are the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ead raised? &amp;c. whose Folly the Apostle reproved: And this is not <hi>Quakers</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion thus to question, much less to deny the <hi>Resurrection</hi> in the true Sense and real Mystery of it; For so to question, With what Body are the Dead raised? is not a Question necessary to Salvation, nor essential to the being of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> who knows a part in Christ, who is the Resurrection and the Life.</p>
                  <p>Now come we to examine <hi>T. H's</hi> Meaning upon the Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 37, 38. wherein he proceeds thus, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>this Mortal,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Body given it, is the same for Substance, the same that was sown, &amp;c. only called a Body given to it, because it is so changed from its Accidents of Corruption and Mortality.</hi> Thus far <hi>T. H.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What reasonable man can make Sense of this piece of Oratory, as to say that the <hi>Body</hi> given to <hi>it,</hi> is the same for Substance: Like as if he had said, This same mortal Body is the same <hi>It</hi> which is given <hi>it,</hi> or it is the same <hi>It</hi> that is sown, that is given <hi>it</hi> self; or the same Body for Substance is given to the mortal <hi>Body.</hi> What rare <hi>Rhetorick</hi> is this?</p>
                  <p>And so his Brother <hi>Kiffin</hi> saith, That the Seed that's sown, is the <hi>same Body</hi> of Flesh, &amp;c. <hi>which shall arise, though otherwise qualified:</hi> If so, what is that Body that God giveth to it, as it pleaseth him? For if it be lookt upon in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Seed, it must be supposed that it is another Body, that's given unto it, as is to every Seed sown, according to its kind: For it is plain Non-sence to say, That that which is sown, is the same Body that is given to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:105069:279"/>Besides, that which is not quickened except it dyes (which may be spoken of every kind of Seed, that hath Life in it first) doth not dye be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ore it is sown, but after 'tis sown; as Christ saith, Except a Grain of Wheat fall into the Ground and dye, it abideth alone; but if it dye, it bringeth forth much Fruit: Now the Fruit or Ear brought forth, is the proper Body given to it, which is not the very same which wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> sown in the Earth. But I pray, how holds this dying aftersown, with these men's fleshly Opinion of the carnal Body in the Grave being the Seed? for that being Dead before, doth not dye after 'tis buried; neither do these men intend to be buried alive.</p>
                  <p>And seeing every Seed hath its own proper Body, what Body can be proper to the Terrestrial Bodies? which if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them must be lookt upon as the Seed, to have each a proper Body given, what a plurality of Bodies must there be besides what are? And will it not amount to this, That every man shall not only have these very Terrestrial Bodies, but each a Body besides; and so every man two Bodies, and those of the same Substance that these are now, to wit, Terrestrial or Carnal?</p>
                  <p>He cites <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. thus, He shall change our vile Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.

                  <p>But doth not this evidently make against him; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that Christ's Glorious Body is not a Carnal, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial or Earthly Body, but a Spiritual, Transcendent, Glorious Body? And the changing of our Low Body, in fashion to be like his, implieth not the same Terrestial or Carnal Bodies, or to be of this Fashion and Substance, as now they are; For Celestial, Spiritual and Glorious Bodies are much different from Terrestrial, Carnal and Mean Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>T. H.</hi> addeth from Phil 3. 21. <hi>This cannot be meant of a new created Body; because such a Body cannot be said to be either vile or changed. If then this</hi> IT <hi>be not the Body which dyed, but another, how can that be called a Resurrection; for that supposeth the same?

What Sense or Congruity can be made of this? Many Thousands being dissolved, and turned to as real Dust of the Earth, as man was at first formed of, how should Living and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Bodies be raised out of that Dust, without Creating anew first? But if it cannot be a new created Body, it is not the same Natural, Carnal or Terrestrial Body for Substance after dissolved: It is not this very same corruptible Flesh, Blood and Bones, that is given to every Seed as it pleaseth God, or that shall inherit God's Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, As to be <hi>Quickened,</hi> implieth a <hi>Death</hi> first; and <hi>Resurrection,</hi> a <hi>Fall</hi> before; and to <hi>be Changed,</hi> that there was either a vile, corruptible Suffering, or low Estate before: So all that come to know Christ in them, and the Body dead because of Sin, know the Spirit to be Life because of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness: And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the Dead dwell in you, he that raised up Jesus from the Dead shall also quicken your mortal Bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12, 13.

                  <p>And as in the first <hi>Adam</hi> is both the Fall and Death come over all men; so in the second <hi>Adam,</hi> who is the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and the Life, all are made alive, and that unto Righteousness, who first come to see the Body dead because of Sin, and the Deeds of the Body mortified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. or who come to know Christ, and the Power of his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and the Fellowship of his Sufferings, being made conformable unto his Death, these attain unto the Resurrection of the Dead, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10, 11. Such do not strive for a Notion thereof, but to attain to it.</p>
                  <p>As to the manner of Existences or Beings of all men in the World to come, there is no Necessity for any to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thought or busying their Minds about them; it being in the Pleasure and Wisdom of God, to reserve all to their due and deserved Ends in an immortal Capacity.</p>

                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> That there is a Seed of God, and a Seed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in Mankind, according to <hi>G. F. Junior's</hi> relation, he further tells you, that they that discern the Body of each Seed, are not the Fools which are questioning, how the dead should be raised and with what Body; for they know that all Mankind will be found in one of these two Seeds. By which it is plain, he doth not exclude men from a future Being or Immortality, nor confound them with the very Being of God; though it is by his invisible Power, that all are upheld in their respective Existences, in Immortality, whether they be found in the Nature and Image of the good Seed, or of the evil.</p>
                  <p>T. H. <hi>And since he calls them Fools, that is, the Apostles and all true Christians that say, This Body of Flesh and Bones shall arise,</hi> pag. 59.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> He should have produced his plain Scripture for the Apostles so saying: where are these Words to be found in all the Scriptures of the new Testament, that this Body of Flesh and Bones shall arise again? Doth not the Apostle say the contrary, Thou sowest <hi>not</hi> that Body that shall be? And Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God?</p>
                  <p>But must we then suppose, as some Professors do, That these Bodies of Flesh and Bones, shall inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, without any Blood in them? Or, that after
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:105069:281"/>
they are returned to Dust, they shall arise again the self same as they are, without any new Creation? I confess, this is such kind of new <hi>Philosophy</hi> as I have not read of before.</p>
                  <p>The man has run himself into such strange Confusion; and wholy misses the Sense of the Resurrection and the Life; and over looks the true Seed and Root of the Matter, while in his vain mind he is imagining, muddling and <hi>Devil-like</hi> disputing about the Body, which in Comparison of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Existence and being of Man, is but an outside Case, earthly Shell or Husk that disolveth.</p>
                  <p>Again he saith, <hi>If this Seed of the Serpent be only Sin, and the Seed of Christ only Grace, it is only Sin and Grace which shall arise again,</hi> p. 60.</p>
                  <p>Oh the gross Darkness and Ignorance of this Man! He knows not the Seed of the Serpent, from whence Sin springs; nor the Seed of God, from whence Grace and Life flows: But falsly supposes, that our Principle extinguishes the future distinct beings of Men, though it hath been plainly told him, that all Mankind will be found in one of these two Seeds.</p>
                  <p>As also we testifie, from that Sence of Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, that is brought to Light in us through the Gospel, That the Soul, whole spiritual Man, and spiritual Body, shall exist in Immortality; yea, though our outward Man perish, yet the inward Man is renewed day by day, and in order to possess an eternal Weight of Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. This inward Man is neither extinguish'd by the perishing of the outward Man; nor thereby deprived of that Advantage, which is an eternal Weight of Glory:</p>
                  <p>And that God giveth it a Body as it pleaseth him, and to every Seed his own Body, or his proper Body.</p>
                  <p>The Man would know what this <hi>It</hi> is, shewing his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biousness of his own Assertion before, viz. <hi>"That it is a mortal Body of Flesh and Bones</hi> (whether it shall be raised and go to Heaven with any Blood in it, he tells us not) <q>
                        <hi>and that the Body given it is the same for Substance;</hi> that is as good</q> Sense as to say, the Body of Flesh and Bones shall (when it is raised) have the same Body of Flesh and Bones given to it; whereas it is to every Seed his proper Body, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive both of the Seed of the Righteous, and the Seed of the Wicked; of the Seed of God, and the Seed of the Serpent: and so comprehends and takes in the whole Body
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:105069:281"/>
of Mankind under those two Relations and Natures; not to dissolve or extinguish their Rational, Intelligible Beings, with the perishing and dissolvable Earthly Outside or Case, but that all shall be reserved for their due and proper Ends, according to the Seed, Nature and Image, which their Soul carries with it when it parts with the Earthly Cloathing.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is said, that It is sown a Natural Body, it is raised a Spiritual Body; the great Stress is laid on the particle [IT] which may as well be applyed to Wheat or other Grain; <hi>It</hi> is sown, and <hi>It</hi> is raised, when the Body, or outside of that very Corn that is sown is dead, though the innate Virtue or Life, doth not in it self dye, nor fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly expire: Thou sowest <hi>not</hi> that Body that shall be, &amp;c. yet in these two relations, <hi>It,</hi> is used as relative both to that which is sown, and to that Body that shall be, while in the very next Words to those before cited, it is said, there is a Natural Body, and there is a Spiritual Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 44. and these can no more be the self-same, then Celestial and Terrestrial Bodies can; or then the first <hi>Adam</hi> and the laft <hi>Adam,</hi> or the Earthly and the Heavenly, which the Apostle plaiuly distinguisheth between, as he doth betwixt the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and the Spiritual.</p>
                  <p>But whereas <hi>T. H.</hi> and his Brethren so much argue from the word <hi>It</hi> [as, It is sown a Natural Body, It is raised a Spiritual] they take this <hi>It</hi> for <hi>Idem corpus,</hi> the self-same Body in both: Their Mistake is evident; they have not this either from the Greek or Latin: see <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This admits of no such Transubstantiation, as that the self-same Natural Body should become Spiritual, or be the Subject of such an Accident.</p>

                  <p>And as the First Man is of the Earth, Earthly, the second Man is the Lord from Heaven; and <hi>As</hi> is the Earthly, <hi>Such</hi> are they also that are Earthly; and <hi>As</hi> is the Heavenly, <hi>Such</hi> are they that are Heavenly, <hi>ver.</hi> 47, 48. which if this be owned, it must be granted, that they that are Heavenly must have Bodies sutable, <hi>viz.</hi> Heavenly or Spiritual Bodies; this Heavenly being the second Man, the Lord from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>ver.</hi> 47. And mark, <hi>As</hi> is the Heavenly, <hi>Such</hi> are they that are Heavenly; which cannot be the same with Earthly any more then the Image of the Heavenly can be the Image of the Earthly.</p>
                  <p>And as to our being asked, what this Mortal is that must put on Immortality? Though Mortal in this place implies a dying Condition of Man (as the Effect of Sin) as in <hi>Adam</hi> all dye; yet it cannot (as having put on Immortality) be relative to Flesh and Blood, but as admitted in a Heavenly and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sense; for the Apostle plainly tells us but a little before, Now this I say, Brethren, that Flesh and Blood cannot inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Kingdom of God; neither doth Corruption inherit Incorruption: Behold, I shew you a Mystery! We shall not all Sleep, but we shall all be Changed, <hi>ver.</hi> 50, 51. And so by that Life and Immortality which is brought to Light, we see beyond Death and Mortality; and we (though as in a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing State, yet) behold Immortality, being quickned by the second <hi>Adam,</hi> and renewed again into the Image of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly; being made alive in Christ, who redeems Man from Death, &amp; ransoms the Soul from the Power of the Grave; who swallows up Mortality and Death in Life and Victory, and saith, <hi>O Death, I will be thy Plagues; O Grave, I will be thy Destruction,</hi> Hos. 13, 14.

And if you do not come to know a Righteous Seed raised up in you, and Truth to spring up out of the Earth and to witness Christ to be your Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Life, you remain dead in your Sins, and short of the Glory of this Resurrection.

into absolute Spirituality, the more capable we are of that full Fruition of an eternal Weight of Glory in the Heavens; in order to which let us be Spiritually minded, and walk in Holiness of Life while here in our earthly House. As also we cannot hold that the Resurrection is past already, while we, or any of us, are suffering with Christ, and travailing in order to attain unto the Resurrection of the Dead, that is, perfectly to be raised up with Christ; who is the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Life (in some Degree at least) of all that truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Name and Power: Neither is this to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Foundation of true Faith, Hope or Holiness of Life, while we confess Christ to be that Foundation.

He tells us, <hi>It cannot be a new Created Body, but a Resurrection;</hi> Of what? he would have it of the self-same Body for Substance: But if there must be no new Creation, but a Resurrection of these Carnal Bodies, opposed to Creation, it must only be a raising of the Dust of these Bodies; and then what a sad Garment would this invest the Souls of the Righteous with? But if on second Thoughts, he will admit of any new Creation of Bodies out of the Dust, this cannot imply, that they shall be the very self same that now they are in Matter and Form. But if any of them shall yet say, <hi>They shall be specifically the same Bodies,</hi> That varies from their Principle of being the self-same that now they are.

Such is the course of some carnal Cavillers, who while contending about Bodies, and musing how they shall exist in Heaven, they are now neglecting the Way thither, more busying themselves about their carnal Bodies, then regarding their poor Souls; or minding the Spirit of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, thereby to become Sons of God, and of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; or to be converted from Sin and Pollution to Holiness; or turned from Satan's Power to God, which is the Way to Glory. And now in short to answer what we and our Religion are charged within the Conclusion of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary's bitter reviling Dialogue:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>First,</hi> We testifie that the <hi>Resurrection</hi> is not past.</p>

                     <hi>2dly,</hi> That the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man is not God, nor Christ; but God is the Saviour of it; and so we (alwayes since we knew our own Souls) have distinguished between the Soul and the Saviour of it.</p>

                     <hi>3dly,</hi> That we confess future and distinct <hi>Beings</hi> after Death, as well of Men as of Angels; and that the Children of God and of the Resurrection shall in the World to come be as the Angels, yea, equal to them.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4thly,</hi> Though it be said, <hi>Thou sowest not that Body that shall be; and Flesh and Blood shall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. It doth not therefore follow, that <hi>our Religion</hi> denies any eternal Advantage that is to be reaped; much less that it is <hi>a Cheat,</hi> or <hi>Calculated to the Service of the Devil,</hi> as most wickedly and malitiously <hi>T. H.</hi> hath reviled and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed that Religion and Testimony which we know, is given us of God; for we have not by distinguishing between the Natural and Spiritual Bodies, denyed the Saints, their proper Existences, Spiritual Body, or House eternal in the Heavens, when the Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved: and unless the Man holds the Mortality of the Soul, that it dyes with the Body, or the extinguishing of the spiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Man, I do not see how he can suppose a denying of any eternal Advantage on our parts; unless he place it all upon the Earthly Body. It is true that some of his Brethren
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:105069:285"/>
do hold, that <hi>the Soul dyes</hi> with the Body, and sleeps in the Dust, till both be raised; and this also depriveth all the Saints deceased from having any eternal Advantage, in the mean time at least: But we are not of that Faith, Hope or Religion that will expire or perish with the Carnal Body, as our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers will, who in his fruitless, carnal Work and Discourse consists more of and for gross Body, then Spirit; he is too car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal &amp; gross in his Apprehensions, to discern so much as a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the future Beings and State of Saints: But both they that think they shall reap no Eternal Advantage without their Terrestrial Bodies of Flesh and Blood, as <hi>T.

But <hi>T. H.</hi> his carnal Contest is for magnifying his earthly, carnal Body, and not for magnifying Christ therein; for he scornfully slights our witnessing Christ (and his being risen) in us; though it is evident the Apostle did not place his eternal Felicity and Advantage upon the Earthly House, Flesh or carnal Body that perishes and turns to Dust; for if he set his Heart upon Man, if he gather unto himself his Spirit &amp; his Breath, all Flesh shall perish together, and Man shall turn again unto Dust, <hi>Job.</hi> 34. 14, 15. But <hi>T.

to Dust (If he intends any Blood in it) he will admit of no new Creation of it; and by this, his Religion and Hope do expire and perish with his corrupt Body, and must only be renewed when the Dust of that Body shall be raised without Creating it a new Body: And if there be no eternal Advantage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this kind of Resurrection, as described by him, this doth either wholly deny the <hi>Original and Spiritual Being of Man,</hi> and comprehends the whole Man, only as consisting of a mortal and perishing Body; or else admits not of the reasonable Soul really to injoy her self in any condition out of the outside pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Vesture or decay'd Cloathing, which for Man to be divested of, can be no more Loss to him, as to his immortal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then 'tis to the Wheat to dye &amp; bring forth much Fruit, unto which [<hi>Resurrection</hi>] is applicable as well as to Man, though not to the Sameness of Body: And as it cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a Man to put off his Old Cloathing, that he may put on New; no more can it annihilate our Spiritual Existences to have the Earthly Cloathing put off and dissolved, but be to our far greater Advantage &amp; Glory, to be invested with that Spiritual Transcendent Cloathing, &amp; most Excellent House Eternal in the Heavens; which State they only attain to, who become Sons of God and of the Resurrection, and desire Christ may be magnified in their Bodies here. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more from that Belief and Discovery I have received in the true Light, of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> and future <hi>Rewards,</hi> according to the holy Scripture; I desire it may be minded, that God<note place="marg1">Acts 17. 30, 31.</note> commandeth all Men every where (in their Day and Time) to <hi>Repent,</hi> because he hath appointed <hi>a Day</hi> in the which he<note place="marg1">Mat. 10. 15. &amp; 11. 22, 24. &amp; 12. 36.</note> will judge the World in Righteousness, by that Man whom he hath ordained: So that there will be a Day of Judgment,<note place="marg1">Job. 21. 30.</note> Wrath and Perdition of the Ungodly; unto which Day the<note place="marg1">2 Pet. 2. 9. &amp; 3. 7.</note> Lord <hi>Knoweth</hi> how to <hi>Reserve</hi> the Unjust to be punished; and this will be a Terrible Day to all that make Lyes their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and reject the universal Call of God to Repentance: And seeing that in the Great Day of the Lord a final Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution<note place="marg1">Psal. 102. 25.</note> may be expected of all those things that are perishing<note place="marg1">Hebr. 1. 10, 11, 21.</note> and dissolvable, even of the Heavens and the Earth, and that they shall be changed, what manner of Persons ought we to be here in all Holy Conversation and Godliness?</p>

God; thus to render him visible to their Flesh and fleshly Eye, supposing that <hi>Job</hi> in his Belief herein, and God in his being, were like themselves; whereas God is invisible and an infinite Spirit, not made up of Flesh and Bones to be seen with Flesh and carnal Eyes. As also the man has perverted <hi>Job's</hi> words which are (as translated) <hi>Though after my Skin Worms destroy This Body; yet in my Flesh shall I see God,</hi> Job. 19. 26. (who before said, my Flesh is cloathed with Worms. <hi>Job.</hi> 7. 5.) It is not, that <hi>with My Flesh,</hi> or <hi>fleshly Body,</hi> I shall see God after Worms have destroyed it; but I N my Flesh I shall see God. Neither did <hi>Job</hi> quiet himself in his Perplexity with the Belief that his Flesh should see God (as is imagined) but that he should see God, as afterwards he did, when he said, <hi>I have heard of thee by the Hearing of the Ear; but now mine Eye seeth thee; wherefore I abhor my self, &amp;c.</hi> Job. 42. 5.</p>
                  <p>Now that wherein <hi>Job</hi> was quieted, was, That he knew that his Redeemer lived, who should redeem him out of all his Troubles that he had in the Flesh; and that after his outward Body was destroyed out of his perplexed Flesh, he should see God in an Immortal State: He had no reason to quiet himself upon any Confidence in, or concerning that Flesh, when he was so disquieted and perplexed in it; for those words, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. are differently rendered in the <hi>Margins</hi> thus, <hi>After I shall awake, though this Body be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet OUT of my Flesh shall I see God;</hi> see the Margined Bibles of the last Translation, with <hi>Hebrew</hi> notes and various Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: Now there is a great Difference between seeing God <hi>With</hi> my Flesh, and seeing God <hi>Out</hi> of my Flesh after it is destroyed.</p>
                  <p>But to these men that believe, that with their Flesh or fleshly Bodies they shall see God, he may say, as he said to the Wicked, <hi>Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thy self; but I will reprove thee, and set them</hi> (to wit thy Iniquities) <hi>in order before thine Eyes, Psal.</hi> 50. 21. yea, thou thoughtest that I was so like thy self, as that thou mightest see me with thy Flesh and fleshly Eyes: But thy Thoughts in this were very carnal, and thy Apprehensions very gross; thou shalt find thou art mistaken, I am an invisible All-seeing Spirit, that searches Hearts, and penetrates through the dark Spirits and Cogitations of Men, to bring their secret Thoughts to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and set their evil Actions in order before them.</p>

from these Passages, is, that <hi>Christ's Body is a Carnal Spiritual Body,</hi> as if <hi>Carnal and Spiritual</hi> were both one; or that the Spiritual Body that's raised or given to the Seed, is Carnal. Let these Passages be kept in Record, as the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> Doctrine and Testimony; whereas the Apostle's own Testimony proves the Contrary, and that <hi>W. B.</hi> has belyed the Apostle: For 'tis sown a natural Body, it is raised a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; and there is a <hi>Natural</hi> Body, and there is a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Here the Apostle clearly makes a Distinction and a Difference between the <hi>natural</hi> Body and the <hi>spiritual;</hi> He doth not say, 'tis sown a natural Body, and raised a natural or Carnal Body also, but a spiritual Body; as he also distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth between the Bodies Celestial and the Bodies Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial; as those of Sun, Moon and Stars differ from those of Men, Beasts and Fishes: Now you would count him a very blind <hi>Philosopher,</hi> that should make no Difference, but say, they are all one and consistent, or that the Bodies of Sun, Moon and Stars, were all one with those Earthly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Men and other Creatures; and so blind and such Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant <hi>Divines</hi> are these <hi>Baptist's.</hi> He understands not the Difference between the Natural Body and the Spiritual, any more then if a Person should be so ignorant as (when he sees the Sun, or Moon, or Stars) To ask, if these were not Men, or Birds, or Beasts, or Fishes, in the Firmament; or on the contrary, if he should see Men, Beasts and Fishes, to ask, if these are not the Sun, Moon and Stars; or rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they are, because he knows not which are Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial and which Teriestrial, no more then this <hi>Baptist</hi> doth discern between Bodies natural or carnal, and Bodies spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: But how should he do other, or see better while his Mind is so much upon Flesh, and so little upon Spirit; or so much upon Flesh and Blood which cannot inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and so little upon that spiritual Birth or Seed that doth inherit the Kingdom of Glory and Peace.</p>

                  <p>Are we therefore (as by this) to read the Words thus, viz. <hi>God is not the God of the Dead, that are so Dead as that they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return to Life; but of the Dead that shall return to Life?</hi> And then what are those Dead that shall <hi>never</hi> return to Life; Or those Dead that God is <hi>not</hi> the God of, if <hi>the Living</hi> and <hi>Dead</hi> must all be applyed to the Outward or Earthly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? But had he been sensible of his Sense before, that to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> (and so of the Living) notes a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Relation, and that Christ speaks of such as shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy to obtain that World and the Resurrection, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. 35. he might have understood that the <hi>Dead,</hi> whom he is not the God of, are such as are Strangers to that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Relation, and live not to God, however their Souls be Immortal.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>But of the Living, that is</hi> (saith he) <hi>of them whom God intends to restore to Life, or whose Bodies live potentially; not only of them whose Souls live actually; for all Live to him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If the Living must intend the terrestrial Bodies of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> then that Denomination <hi>Living,</hi> is given to those that are truly Dead (as he saith) and then I ask, if it be good Doctrine, or proper to say, that all those dissolved Bodies do <hi>live unto God?</hi> Whereas in Christ's words there
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105069:295"/>
is no mention of their Elementary Bodies, but that the Dead are raised, and that he is the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and these were they that <hi>Lived</hi> unto him, who were counted worthy to obtain that World, and the Resurrection. And it is further evident, that when the <hi>Saducees</hi> (who said, <hi>there is no Resurrection, Angel, nor Spirit</hi>) asked Christ about the Wife, <hi>whose</hi> (of the Seven) <hi>She should be in the Resurrection?</hi> their Thoughts were carnal, and upon the Carnal or Earthly Bodies, which Christ's Answer did not gratifie in his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting the Resurrection (as to the State of the Righteous after this Life) He said, <hi>The Children of this World marry, and</hi>
                     <note place="marg1">Luk. 20. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>are given in Marriage; But they which shall be counted</hi> worthy to obtain <hi>that World, and the</hi> Resurrection from the Dead, <hi>neither Marry, nor are given in Marriage:</hi> Neither can they dye any more; for they are equal unto the Angels, and are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, being the Children of the Resurrection, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. 35, 36.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Note here first, That he speaks of a Resurrection-state in the World to come, wherein the Children of God so much excel in their Beings, as that they are equal unto the <hi>Angels,</hi> whose Bodies are not such as these <hi>Earthly ones</hi> of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this World, wherein they Marry; but in that World they are in another Capacity, more Sublime and Spiritual; even Equal unto the Angels: whereby Christ doth not only assert the Resurrection and an Immortal State; but also the Spirituality and Glory thereof far Transcending this earthly State and Body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As thus considered, it is plainly implied that there are but some that are counted worthy to obtain that World and the Resurrection, that is, the Children of God, who live unto him; as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>if by any means I might attain unto the Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> Phil. 3. 10, 11. Now, therefore to apply this Resurrection to the Terrestrial Body of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and hence to argue for Immortalizing that Dust, which that Body returns to; it implieth thus much, that <hi>Only</hi> the Bodies of the Children of God (who are counted worthy) shall rise: and how agrees this with our Opposers Intention?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Moreover, while Christ intended by his Answer, that those that were counted <hi>Worthy,</hi> &amp;c. even the Children of God, and such as <hi>lived</hi> unto God, were the Children of the Resurrection; and that they cannot dye any more, &amp;c. This agrees with his Answer to <hi>Martha,</hi> Joh. 11. 24, 25, 26. <hi>I am the Resurrection, and the Life; he that believeth in me, though
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105069:296"/>
he were dead, yet shall he Live; and who soever liveth and believeth in me, shall never dye.</hi> Though this be a plain asserting of the Resurrection, yea, and that of the Dead; yet it is as plain a Diversion (as far remote) from the carnal and gross Thoughts and Apprehension that the <hi>Jews</hi> in that Age had of the Resurrection, as his Answer to the <hi>Saducees</hi> was from their gross Thoughts about it.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Scope of these words of Christ before cited, He <note n="*" place="marg1">T. D.</note> saith, <hi>There are different Apprehensions; Some conceive, that Christ hereby proves the Immortality of the Soul (which the</hi> Saducees <hi>denyed, as appears</hi> Act. 23. 8. <hi>for if there be no Soul of a Spiritual Nature in Man, it must needs be Mortal, as his Body) and by Consequence, the Resurrection of the Body. The</hi> Saducees <hi>denying the Resurrection of the Body, because they denied the Immortality of the Soul (as these Interpreters conceive) Others, that Christ intends only to prove the Resurrection of the Body: So</hi> Calvin. <hi>Others, that Christ intends both directly: So</hi> Beza <hi>Diodati.</hi> And from these Differences <hi>T. D.</hi> differently frames his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument several times, p. 76. From hence it is observable, that this Man not seeing with his own Eyes, proceeds to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue doubtfully from the different Apprehensions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of others, viz. Some <hi>Conceiving,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That Christ hereby proves the Immortality of the Soul, and by Consequence only the Resurrection of the Body.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>See how these Learned Men and Students differ and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose each other in their Apprehensions and Conceivings; and what Certainty can we expect from <hi>T.

And how came he to undertake such a Controversie, about such a weighty and mysterious Point upon such dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uncertain Grounds, as only mens different Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, Conceivings and Consequences can produce or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to? (which argues more Confidence then Knowledge in him) And <hi>T.

                  <p>These prove the blessed Resurrection of the Children of God, who are Children of the Resurrection: But what Proof hath he produced herein of the <hi>self-same</hi> Earthly, numerical Body's rising? His Assertion being the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the Body in general; his Proof is the Resurrection of those whom God is the God of, viz. <hi>Believers;</hi> and that their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy must be glorified: which so far as Christ intends, is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. That in the World to come they are equal unto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, what is this to the Earthly, Elementary Bodies of all in general, which Angels do far surmount and transcend in Glory? Neither hath he by all that he hath said, proved, that the Promise of Eternal Glory (he mentions) extends to the same Earthly Body of Flesh and Blood (that now is) after dissolved to Dust, or its first Elements; or that it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of that Glory which is Eternal, though the Believer be as in his Spirituality, or spiritual Body glorified.</p>
                  <p>Now, as touching the Promise of God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, it was not only of a Temporal Inheritance or outward <hi>Canaan;</hi> but also of an eternal Inheritance of Life and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for the Injoyment whereof they had a two-fold Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, an Outward and an Inward, a Natural and a Spiritual; and so far God was their God in each. But that the Eternal Glory was promised to the Terrestrial or Natural Body of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>T.

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It is evident that this Man doth give this account (<hi>that the Happiness of the Soul is not perfect without the Body</hi>) not from any spiritual Sight of the Souls Happiness or Glory; <hi>for in Page</hi> 81. he confesseth, <hi>that the different Disposal of the Spirits of Man and Beast is not visible to the Eye of Sence, and but dimly to the Eye of Reason and Faith;</hi> although he has taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by Tradition from <hi>Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. to assert, that the Happiness of the Soul is not perfect without the Body: It
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105069:297"/>
may be understood, that they have neither clear Reason, nor perfect Faith for this; and to be sure, while he and others assert it without either, we have no Reason to believe them. But to answer him closely; Both <hi>Calvin, T. D.</hi> the <hi>Schools,</hi> and divers <hi>Anabaptists</hi> are mistaken in this very Matter, and see not with the Eye of true Faith, either <hi>that the Happiness of the Soul is not perfect without the Body;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, <hi>that the Soul hath a strong Desire to a Re-union to the Body,</hi>

                     </gap>hile they intend the Terrestrial, Elementary Bodies: for this implies the Soul to be in a kind of <hi>Purgatory</hi> or Disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, till the supposed Resumption of the Body; and their Assertion and Determination herein is Contraty to what the Apostle saith 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>for we know, that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a Building of God, an House not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens,</hi> ver. 1. <hi>for we that are in this Tabernacle, do groan, being burdened, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 4. <hi>We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the Body, and to be present with the Lord,</hi> ver. 8.

                  <p>See now the Stress of the Controversie where it lieth, and that it is not only between these our <hi>Opposers</hi> &amp; <hi>Us;</hi> but also between <hi>them</hi> and the Apostle <hi>Paul:</hi> Thus (<hi>viz.) Calvin,</hi> the <hi>Schools, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </hi> and <hi>Anabaptists</hi> determine and conclude, <hi>That the Happiness of the Soul is not perfect without the Body; and that the Soul</hi> (when separate) <hi>hath a strong Desire and Inclination to a Re-union to the Body:</hi> But,</p>
                  <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> as knowing, <hi>that when their Earthly House was dissolved, they had a far better, namely a Building of God, Eternal in the Heavens;</hi> Therefore, in the Earthly Tabernacle they <hi>gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ned, being burdened, as willing rather to be absent from the Body.</hi> By which it appears, they expected a more full Fruition or Felicity in the Heavenly Tabernacle, then in the Earthly: Their Soul did not desire after the Flesh, as these <hi>Opposers</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; neither had they any such Delight therein, as fleshly Minds, and carnal Contenders have. Moreover, the Apostle from the Visions and Revelations of the Lord, saith, <hi>I knew a Man</hi> in Christ, <hi>above fourteen Years ago, whether</hi> IN <hi>the Body, or</hi> OUT <hi>of the Body, I cannot tell; God knows: Such an one caught up to the third Heaven — caught up into Paradise, and heard upspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Words,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>From hence consider, that being <hi>caught up to the 3d Heaven, into Paradise,</hi> he doth not place the Sight and Sence of this Condition upon the <hi>Body;</hi> for that he knew not whether he was <hi>In</hi> the Body, or <hi>Out</hi> of the Body, yet knew, that he was a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105069:298"/>
                     <hi>Man in Christ,</hi> and <hi>in the Revelation of the Lord:</hi> But he did not concern himself about this Earthly Body being so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Heaven or Paradise, as these Men do, and carnally think, who have neither Visions nor Revelations of the Lord concerning any such State, but <hi>Calvin</hi> and the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Determination, contrary to the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>But the presumptuous Confidence of our <hi>Opposers</hi> appears the more, in undertaking to assert or demonstrate the future State of the Soul, as not being in perfect Happiness without the Body, and as having a strong Desire after it, while yet they neither know the State of the Soul, nor have had so much as a Vision of the Glory thereof, or of the glorified spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual State of the Saints hereafter; for <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> they deem to be ceased long since; and a Disposal of the Spirits of men after Death is <hi>not visible to the Eye of Sence, and,</hi> he saith, <hi>but dimly to the Eye of Reason and Faith:</hi> However, while these Men cannot but appear themselves so Dim in these Sublime Matters; and that, while their dim Reason cannot reach them, they cannot demonstrate to others, either that the Souls of the Just in Heaven are not yet perfectly Happy, or that they have such a <hi>strong Desire to a Re-union with the Body dissolved,</hi> the shew themselves imaginary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders, puft up in their fleshly Minds, exercising themselves in things too high for them; and it were better for them to sit down in Silence, and wait in the Light to have some Sence and Knowledge of the true immortal Life, to quicken them to God; and not thus to busie themselves with unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Talk, brought forth from Imaginations of men, and not from any true Sight or Revelation of the Conditions of Saints, either here or hereafter.</p>
                  <p>His telling of <hi>Abraham's Soul living actually,</hi> is true; and as true it is, That his Soul is in perfect Felicity and Glory, and the more, being out of the Earthly Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>But his saying, that the Body of <hi>Abraham</hi> (or Bodies of the deceased Believers) liveth <hi>potentially;</hi> for this we have his own Traditional Assertion, but not any Scripture-Proof or Phrase that suits it, nor rational Demonstration for it.</p>
                  <p>As to his saying, <hi>That if any shall say, that Christ's Argument, and his Application of it, proves but the Resurrection of the Good, &amp;c.</hi> I say, his Application thereof seems but to extend to the Good, as in his saying, <hi>They whose God, God is, shall rise;</hi> yet he hath not proved the Rising of their Earthly Bodies, after they are dissolv'd to Dust, and reduc'd to their first Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but <hi>that there is a Resurrection of the Good;</hi> and who of us
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105069:298"/>
questions that? The Resurrection of the Good or of the Just, being Glorious, and extending not only to Arising out of the Fall, out of Death that came by it, out of the Grave of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which hath followed, yea, out of the Dust of that Earth, and out of all Afflictions here; but also unto an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Eternal Glory hereafter; as, They that be <hi>Wise shall shine as the Brightness of the Firmament; and they that turn many to Righteousness, as the Stars forever and ever:</hi> So that they shall be so Celestial and Glorious, as that they shall incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably excell these Terrestrial Bodies.</p>
                  <p>And therefore where it is said, <hi>That the</hi> Saducees <hi>and</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>Proposition be, that there is no Resurrection from the Dead;</hi> This is a Falshood against the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and their <hi>Sufferings</hi> testifie the Contrary: If a Man should say, that the Wheat or other Grain in the Eare, is not <hi>the self-same</hi> that was sown in the Earth; doth it therefore follow, that he denies the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising of Wheat, or any Grain at all? Or that, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle in Answer to the Question, that some foolishly put, said, <hi>Thou Fool, thou sowest not that Body which shall be;</hi> doth it therefore follow that his Proposition was that there is <hi>No Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> from the Dead?</p>

                  <p>That if the Objecter understand Terrestrial Flesh and Bones, is it a Fault to deny it? That the Body of Christ in Heaven is not Terrestrial Flesh and Bones, but of a more refined Nature; for the Apostle saith expresly, That <hi>Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 50.</p>

                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:105069:306"/>That according to Testimony in Scripture. we shall find, that a Glorified Body, or that Body wherewith they shall be rewarded, who shall attain to that blessed Resurrection, which is the most precious Hope of all true <hi>Christians,</hi> may be dignified with these three Titles, <hi>Angelical, Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Celestial:</hi> It is an Angelical Body, because the Sons of the Resurrection are said to be in every actual Respect, that tends to any real Perfection or Happiness, equal unto Angels, <hi>Luk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

(<hi>viz.</hi>) not only in that thing of Immortality, but the Sons of the Resurrection are absolutely in all such actual Respects (as above intimated) equal to the Angels: nor can the Condition of the Bodies be left out as touching the Nature and Glory of them; but a Son of the Resurrection, and an Angel must be in every such Regard all one; our Saviour seems plainly to assert so much.</p>
                  <p>That those that are once the Sons of the Resurrection, plainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Angels thereby — for they were Sons of God in a moral or spiritual Sense before.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>That the Fathers were of this Opinion, <hi>Agrippa</hi> in his <hi>Occulta Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophia</hi> hath also noted.</p>
                  <p>That there are many Instances how <hi>Igneous</hi> and <hi>Lucid</hi> they, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Bodies of the Angels, are, with which the best of them are invested, as truly that of <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 30. which answers well to that of <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                  <p>The Bodies of the more Glorious Angels are <hi>Igneous</hi> and <hi>Lacid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That also is a remarkable Example of the Lucidity of the Bodies of Angels, which we have <hi>Acts</hi> 12. where, while <hi>Peter</hi> was sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt two Souldiers in the Prison, bound in Chains, the Angel of the Lord is said to come upon him, and a Light to shine in the Prison, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I will add one Instance more, which is, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 5. where the Angel that instructed <hi>Daniel,</hi> is thus described; <hi>Then I lifted up mine Eyes, and looked, and behold a certain Man cloathed in Linnen, whose Loins were girded with fine Gold of</hi> Ophaz; <hi>his Body was also like</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryl, <hi>and his Face as the Appearance of Lightening, and his Eyes as Lamps of Fire, &amp;c.</hi> This Appearance certainly of this Angelical Shape is Fiery, Lucid and Glorious: It is manifest that they are very Luminous and Glorious.</p>
                  <p>Whoever is invested with such a Body, as is reserved for the Sons of the Resurrection, will be, if he please to shew himself thus Lucid and Glorious; of which I shall want no more Examples then that one of our Saviour Christ's Body; for all ours, at the Resurrection, are to be made like to his Glorious Body; and how Lucid and Angelical his Body was after his Ascension into Heaven, may appear from
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:105069:307"/>
                     <hi>Apocal.</hi> 1. 13. where one like unto the Son of Man, is said to be <hi>cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with a Garment down to the Foot, and girt about the Paps with a Colden Girdle; his Head and his Fair to be white, like Wool, as white as Snow; that his Eyes as a Flame of Fire, and his Feet like unto fine Brass, as if they were burning in a Furnace; and his Voice as the Sound of many VVaters; a sharp Two-edged Sword came out of his Mouth; and his Countenance was as the Sun, shining in his strength.</hi> This Body, I think, is sufficiently Lucid, and expresly and almost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly conformable to that of the Angel which appeared to <hi>Daniel,</hi> as any one may observe, that listeth to compare them.</p>
                  <p>The like Appearance of our Saviour se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>meth to be also, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 10. where an Angel is said to be <hi>cloathed with a Cloud, with a Rain-Bow on his Head, and his Face to be as the Sun, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will add his Appearing to <hi>an</hi> out of the Heavens, as he was going to <hi>Damascus, Acts</hi> 9. that <hi>suddenly there shined round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him a Light from Heaven, &amp;c. above the Brightness of the Sun,</hi> Chap. 22. 6. &amp; 26. 13. Which again doth not only assure the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but the exceeding great Splendor of the Corporeal Presence of Christ; which is also agreeable to that in <hi>Apocal. And his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was as the Sun shining in his Strength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of all which, I hope, it is plain enough, that as our Saviour hath said, That the Sons of the Resurrection do become <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Body of our Saviour, after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furrection, being so accurately answerable in Light and Glory to the most illustrious Appearances of Angels, in either the Old or New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and this alone, one would think, might be sufficient to assure us of the Lucidity or Luminosity of the Body of Christ, as also of all our Resurrection-Bodies.</p>
                  <p>For the Spirituality of this Body, see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 44. <hi>It is sown a natural Body, it is raised a spiritual Body; there is a natural Body, and there is a spiritual Body, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I think it is most reasonable to understand the Resurrection-Body to be called Spiritual, not for that it is actuated by a Spirit (for the Soul is a Spirit, that actuates the natural Body) but for that the Body it self is become spiritual; which I must confess, <hi>Calvin</hi> seems abhorrent from, but meerly out of his Ignorance in Philosophy; for he reprehends those, <hi>qui substantiam corporis putant fore spiritualem, &amp;c. Calvin</hi> seems to be afraid of the Opinion of the Body being spiritual, as implying a substantial Change, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There is not any Inconvenience to admit, that the Resurrection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>That the Heavens are fluid, according to the most ancient and divinest Philosophy, as the very Notation of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word intimates.</p>
                  <p>Our Resurrection-Bodies will be furnished with the Seeds and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Light and Splendour, and be more Beautiful, and more full of Lustre and Glory, then the Heavenly Matter it self; as that part of the Earth, which becomes an humane Body, is more precious and beautiful then the Earth it self before it be modified into a Frame fit for the Functions of Life: So that whether we consider the Angelical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; Spirituality or Heavenliness of the Body at the Resurrection, there is all Reason to conclude, that it will be of a Bright and Lucid Nature; which is not only agreeable to Reason and the Scripture, but also to the Sayings of the Fathers themselves, as S. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
