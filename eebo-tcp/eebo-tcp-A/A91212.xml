         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>TWas not an Ambition to ſpeak in Print,
nor to lay lime-twigs for any other
advantage, which encouraged my
Pen to this undertaking: Theſe are
toyes to delude thoſe who underſtand little of the
World, and leſs of their own Merits. Wouldſt thou
know the Occaſion? Twas this. About a week
ſince, I had the happineſs to viſit ſome of my Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and judicious friends. Their diſcourſe was a
while various, till it was fixt on <hi>The Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Revived.</hi> And therein (having no Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Common Lawes) their judgements were
fluctuating and uncertain But the Novelty of the
queſtion and the confidence of the Author, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
them, though not to an Aſſent, yet to a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Cenſure of his Opinion. A ſtranger among them
would needs prove it to be true, and produced only
<hi>that it was the ſence of the City</hi> for his evidence.
At length they demanded my judgement. I diſcourſed
the queſtion at large, anſwered their objections, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
their Arguments, and in the end left them well
ſatisfied that it was but a Parradox. One of them
(whoſe commands are to Mee more obligeing then the
Acts of a Poſthumous Parliament) enjoyned me to
<pb facs="tcp:115433:3"/>
commit my thoughts to paper, and hath ſince condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to the Preſs. Whether he were in this my
friend or my enemy, be thou the judge. I have been
forced in this Argument to make moſt uſe of reaſon,
deduced either from its firſt principles, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
notions of our Law. For the queſtion is a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſendent
and in vain it were to look preſidents either
in our Law-books or Hiſtories. Several Arguments
are uſed, but thoſe upon the expoſition of the Act it
ſelf 17. <hi>Car.</hi> I conceive to be of themſelves a full Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to the Authors principle objection. This queſtion
might have been the triumph of a more able Pen: But
that the Eagles do not quarrey upon flies. And if ſome
one of the Sages of the Law had undertook this task;
the Author might have pleaded, <hi>Qui bonam tue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
cauſam, dum victus eſt, non vincitur,</hi> That
he was conquered by the man, not by the truth. But
now againſt any ſuch ſuggeſtion, the undertaking of
the queſtion by one of a leſſe Name, is a ſufficient
Counterplea. I ſhall willingly abide the ſentence of the
judicious. But to cenſure before thou underſtandest,
is to condemn a man unheard. If I have brought any
Light to the Queſtion or benefit to my Countrey by
this ſmall Labour; my deſires herein are in their
Haven. As for thy favour I ſhall neither Flatter
it, nor Refuſe it. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

            <head>THE
LONG-PARLIAMENT
TWICE
DEFUNCT,
Or, An ANSWER
To a Seditious Pamphlet, called
The LONG-PARLIAMENT
Revived.</head>
            <p>THE Contrivers of evil Deſignes, are
not more ſollicitous to accompliſh
their miſchievous Ends, then they are
Crafty to palliate and mask the courſe
of their undue proceedings. For de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
and an ill-favoured aſpect, is entayl'd upon
wicked and unhandſome Actions, and the ſoul of
Man hath retained ſo much of its original Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and primitive Light, that it ſtarts, and feels the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115433:6"/>
effects of Antipathy upon the firſt diſcovery of a
foul and vicious Object, when ever it ventures it ſelf
abroad undiſcovered and appearing in its own ugly
proportions. And therefore evil minded Men finde
it both the ſafeſt, and the ſureſt, and the eaſieſt way
to hide their pernicious purpoſes under the fair and
plauſible pretences of Vertue, or Religion, or the
publick good. That great Heretick in Religion and
Policy, <hi>Machiavil</hi> hath taught them the ſame Leſſon,
who though he rejects Conſcience in the ſubſtance
as no good Guide, yet he perſwades his diſciples to
embrace the empty ſhew of it, as the beſt Vizard in
the World. But Truth is Eagle-eyed and can look
through all their thin pretences, and meaſure their
perverſe intentions by the end to which their actions
are naturally tending, and the effects which they are
likely to produce. Herein can be no Hypocriſie, no
Diſguiſes to elude the inquiries of a wiſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The means they uſe do certainly point out the
Ends they aime at, as he that ſhoots at a mark will
be thought to intend to hit it if he could, whatſoever
he tells us to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Author of the late Pamphlet called <hi>The Long-Parliament
Revived,</hi> hath rendred himſelf an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the truth of this Aſſertion, who being great
with Childe of a Paradox deſtructive to the peace of
this Nation, could not be ſatisfied till by the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifry
of the Preſs he was delivered of his Chyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Birth, though with the hazard of his Liberty
in the production.</p>
            <p>For though the whole ſcope and deſigne of his
book be only to ferment the Minds of the Vulgar,
and as he calls them, injudicious ſort of people, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115433:6"/>
to blow the Trumpet of Sedition to the diſturbance
of the publick happy peace: Yet he hath the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
to preface his old rags with pluſh, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with theſe crafty Inſinuations, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the End the peace of this Nation may be eſtabliſhed
upon a firm and laſting foundation and that after one
ſhipwrack hardly eſcaped, we run not again upon a more
fatal and irrecoverable Rock of Confuſion, The Author
of this ſmall paper out of tender Compasſion to his native
Countrey, and with all humble reſpects of allegiance to his
Royal Majeſty that now is, hath thought fit to offer Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to the world, &amp;c. which if timouſly harkened
unto, may yet prove a healing Remedy againſt the ſad
breaches of this ſhattered Kingdom and prevent Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sure this man was an Apothecary he is ſo good
at gilding of his bitter Pills. Let us therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
whether the ſubſtance of his diſcourſe do cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond
and ſuite with theſe fair and plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of Loyalty, and the publick benefit of theſe
Nations. Which will the better appear if we
Conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, the rancour of his heart againſt the preſent
Government, expreſſed in the fourth page of the
Pamphlet, to this effect, <hi>viz. That when the ſubjects
of this Nation have ſeriouſly conſidered of his Arguments,
which (as he would have it) do prove the being and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
authority of the Long Parliament viſibly exiſtent by
vertue of the Act 17.</hi> Car. <hi>They will doubtleſs ſee they
have no reaſon to hold themſelves ſafe in their lives, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and eſtates till it have made proviſion in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
and be legally diſſolved.</hi> What is, if this be not
to ſow Sedition, and to lay the foundations of a new
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115433:7"/>
Warre, and to angle for proſelytes of Rebellion,
which the Phantaſtick baites of the vindication of
Laws and the Subjects ſecurity? We have (one
would think) bought the experience of truſting the
pretence of fears and jealouſies at too dear a rate, to
be again involved in the ſad conſequence of a perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Credulity. The preſent age is too wiſe to thruſt
themſelves into a true and real ſlavery, to avoid a
painted one. And therefore the Author might have
ſpared that clauſe which gives the lie to his proemial
flouriſhes, and is not likely to ſerve to the ends he
intended it, the generality of the people (bleſſed be
God) being now of true and loyal principles and of a
Conformable temper to the government eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Conſequence of the opinion he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends,
will plainly demonſtrate that the Author is no
ſuch great friend to the publick good of his native
Countrey, as is pretended. For then he would have
it to follow, that the preſent Parliament is of no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to binde the ſubjects of this Nation, and that
their Acts have not the force of Laws, and if ſo, then
all their Acts are voide and of no force that they have
made in order to thoſe excellent ends of reſtoring
his ſacred Majeſty to his juſt birth-right, and the
Laws and liberties of the people to their free exerciſe
and ſplendor, which this preſent Parliament have, to
their eternal glory and honor, with great prudence
and moderation effected? How will the Author and
the Nation be ſure of another Act of Oblivion, of ſo
full and comprehenſive Mercy as that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
paſſed and publiſhed. If that ſhould not be an
Act of Parliament, it is only the Kings Declaration
which is pleadable in no Court for any mans diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115433:7"/>
Beſides his Majeſties Declaration from
<hi>Breda</hi> referres to this Parliament now ſitting, and by
his letters to them, hee obliged himſelf by his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
word to paſſe thoſe Laws which are already En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
and others now in Agitation for the quiet ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
of the Nation, and therefore he is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in Honor or Conſcience (for otherwiſe he is
not obliged) to give his Royal Aſſent to thoſe Acts
when they ſhall be preſented to him by the Long-Parliament
if they could get a being <hi>quaſi ex poſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minio</hi>
as the Author hath conceited it. And let him
be confident the deſires of the Nation are utterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, who will never willingly be brought to
ſeek a plaiſter from thoſe very men that have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
their heads.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Authors malevolent nature appears
in this, That relying upon one diſtinction only, that
there is a difference betwixt the nature of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in its ordinary conſtitution, and a Parliament
ſtrengthened by a ſpecial Law made to that purpoſe,
and ſome few ſhreds out of the third Inſtitutes,
he dares to croſs the general opinion of learned men,
and like a pigmy upon the ſhoulders of a giant, bid
defiance to all oppoſers; 'tis a curſt cow that will be
fighting though ſhe hath ſhort horns, and he hath a
great minde to ſwimming that will adventure to croſs
the Seas in a cockboat.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">P. 3.</note>But not to dwell in the porch; it will be agreed
to the Author, that Parliaments rightly conſtituted
in the general, are very inſtrumental for the ſafety
and happineſs of this Kingdome, and that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Parliament ought to enjoy their due privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.
But his inference will not hold in applying
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115433:8"/>
the general rule to every particular Parliament. For
though the general conſtitution be good and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the nature of our Government, yet ſome of
the particular inſtances may be defective and erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in their judgement and proceedings. And no
wonder, ſeeing the rule in <hi>Livy</hi> is generally true, <hi>in
conſilijs major pars plerumque vincit meliorem.</hi> We
have had <hi>inſanum Parliamentum</hi> of old. And the
effects of the late Long Parliament, cauſed by the
faction and perverſneſs of ſome predominant parties
amongſt them, even to the diſſolution of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
is a ſufficient proof in the judgement of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and unbiaſſed perſons, that the general theſis
ought to be underſtood with ſeveral limitations. And
although the Members of Parliament ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
their lawfull privileges, yet it doth not follow
that therefore thoſe men ſhould be permitted to ſit
whoſe Authority is determined by the courſe of Law,
as ſhall be hereafter moſt manifeſtly proved.</p>
            <p>His particular Arguments are drawn from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and preamble of the Act of 17 <hi>Caroli.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 4.</note> Firſt from
the preamble he endeavours to prove by way of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
That that Parliament intended to ſecure
themſelves againſt all the cauſes of diſſolution, as
well by the Kings Death as otherwiſe, and thus he
argues in effect, That the Parliament being neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to borrow money for the publique Service (for
he waves the other ends mentioned in that preamble
of that Act, and therefore I ſhall take no notice of
them in the diſcourſe) and ſeeing no body would truſt
them becauſe it was hazardous, they might be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
before repayment, therefore was the Act made
to eſtabliſh their continuance till the money being
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115433:8"/>
ſatisfied they did diſſolve themſelve by Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament;
But ſaith the Author, If they had been not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
diſſolvable by the Kings Death, the
Act had been of no effect, becauſe their diſſolution
was ſtill hazardous; the Kings life (ſaith he) being
more uncertain then other mens, and ſo <hi>ex abſurdo</hi>
he reaſons, That the Parliament ſhall not be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to omit this cauſe of their diſſolution out of the
ſaid Act.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That the principle end of this
Act being only to ſecure the payment of the publique
debts, which they were then contracting. If the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of thoſe debts did not ſo depend upon the
Parliament, that they would be neceſſarily loſt, if
they were unpaid at the time of their diſſolution;
then that Parliament was not abſolutely neceſſitated
to ſecure their ſitting till thoſe debts were paid, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſufficient to eſtabliſh themſelves againſt being
diſſolved by the Kings will, which had moſt often
recurrence, and whereof they ſtood in moſt danger.
But thoſe debts which they then contracted, were
either ſecured by Act of Parliament, actually made
and paſſed at the time of the money borrowed, or
they were not. If they were ſecured by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
that Act was as good a ſecurity after the
Parliament diſſolved, as it was while the Parliament
continued. But if they were not ſo ſecured, the debts
were as likely to be paid, and the Creditors had the
ſame ſecurity <hi>(viz.</hi> the Honour and Juſtice of the
Kingdom, which is all the ſecurity or compulſive
power Creditors have againſt Parliaments) for the
repayment thereof by a ſubſequent Parliament, as by
the Parliament then ſitting which borrowed the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115433:9"/>
which is apparent; firſt, becauſe the Parliament
then ſitting, by the Authors own confeſſion, took no
care for repayment of the ſaid money, and another
Parliament could not poſſibly be more remiſſe; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
becauſe thoſe debts were the publique debts
of the Kingdom, contracted by their Repreſentatives
in Parliament, in their publick, and not in their indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
Quality, and therefore every following Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
comming under the ſame Repreſentation,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ere bound to take the ſame care for the payment
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hereof, being a part of their publique Service or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
And it is no ſtrange thing for a latter Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to pay ſums which were drawn on the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by a precedent Parliament, witneſſe the paying
off the Souldiers by the Honourable Aſſembly now
ſitting, which Souldiers were the moſt part of them
firſt ſet on work by the Long Parliament, ſince
which time, till now, we could never have the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to ſhake hands with them, So that it appears
that there was no ſuch great neceſſity, as the Author
inſinuates, to Bulwark themſelves againſt a diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the Kings Death, which was a remote poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
But that in caſe that accident had happened
(which was unlikely) the debts notwithſtanding
would not have been loſt, but had been in as much
likelihood to have been paid by the next Parliament,
as if the Parliament in 17 <hi>Caroli</hi> had not been diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Kings Death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, at the time of this Act made, there was
no danger of the Kings death, nor any ſuſpition that
it would happen within ſo ſhort a time as was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for them to have raiſed the ſaid monies, and
therefore they ſhall not be reaſonably intended to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115433:9"/>
have made proviſion againſt the Kings death. For
his late Majeſty of ever bleſſed Memory was ſprung
of longaevous Parents, and was in the Meridian of his
age, of a ſtrong and healthfull conſtitution, and of
great temperance in his diet and recreations, which
are all ſymptomes or cauſes of a long life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis unlikely they ſhould miſtruſt he would die
within one or two years, which was time more then
ſufficient for the raiſing and payment of the ſums
borrowed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if the caſe had been ſo that his Majeſty
had been of a languid and valetudinarious habit of
body, yet the Act had not been fruitleſs. For a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
may be diſſolved either by the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
or by diſcontinuance, or by the Kings death. But
ſeeing by this Act they were defended againſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſſolved by the Kings pleaſure (as is agreed by
all parties) whereof there was moſt danger: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Author will not deny, but that their Seſſion
was more eſtabliſhed by this Act then it was when it
lay open to all the three accidents or cauſes of diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
An eſtate determinable upon the ſurrender or
forfeiture of the particular tenant is a leſſe defeaſible
eſtate then another eſtate determinable by his death,
ſurrender or forfeiture.</p>
            <p>And now reader, you may breath a little, and
conſider the emptineſs of the Authors argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
upon the preamble of this Act, which appears
to be like the crackling of <hi>Solomons</hi> thorns under a
pot, makes a great blaze and a great noiſe, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
little of ſolid heat to the veſſel that hangs
over it.</p>
            <p>Yet to be further quit with him before I diſmiſſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115433:10"/>
the preamble, I ſhall thereupon frame this argument
which I think flowes more naturally from it then his
deduction, That it appears from the preamble the
Parliament only intended to ſuſpend the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
and the ordinary courſe of diſſolving them
till they had cleared their credits and repayed the
money borrowed, for this they make the principal
end and drift of that Act, and when the end of an Act
of Parliament is ſatisfied, the Act looſes its force,
<hi>Aquiſito fine ceſſat operatio,</hi> which is proved by thoſe
temporary Statutes for Aſſeſments &amp;c. when the
money is paid, the Statute is become of no further
uſe or effect. And therefore if all the ends for which
the Act 17. <hi>Caroli</hi> was made be ſatisfied accordingly
by the payment of the money therein mentioned, to
be borrowed upon the ſecurity of that Parliament,
Then is the ſuſpenſion taken off, and the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
and the ordinary courſe of diſſolution of
Parliaments is revived again as it was before that
Act made, and by conſequence they are diſſolved by
the Martyrdom of his late Majeſty. Now the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and worthy Patriot Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Prynne</hi> aſſerts that the
ends of this Act are all ſatisfied,<note place="margin">Perfect Narrative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and the Author doth
not endeavour to prove the contrary. But if the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
by them borrowed be not paid. Yet I ſuppoſe
the authority given them by that Act, ceaſed before
the Kings death for not performing the ends of that
Act within the time which was limitted them by
the conſtruction of Law and Reaſon. And for proof
hereof, and our more orderly proceeding we will
inquire what time was allowed them by a rational
interpretation of that Act to performe the ends in
that Act deſigned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:115433:10"/>
There is no man, I think, ſo irrational as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
that by this Act they are a perpetual Parliament;
Firſt, becauſe it is contrary to the end deſigned in the
preamble. Secondly, becauſe it is againſt the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Conſtitution of the politick government of
this Kingdom, &amp; againſt all the preſidents and books
of Law, which alwayes mention ſucceſſive Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
Thirdly, 'tis againſt the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
which a Parliament cannot alter in ſo principal
a part, eſpecially ſeeing the Lawmakers may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
reaſonably to do it for their own benefit, who
in their own caſes, by the Law of Reaſon, can be no
co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>petent Judges. And that for many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
In ſucceſſive Parliaments the Country
have every time power to chuſe a new, and 'tis not
often (though ſometimes) ſeen, that one man is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
in many ſucceſſive Parliaments: which variation
is neceſſary for ſeveral Reaſons; Sometimes becauſe
they would ehuſe perſons aptly qualified in parts or
Affections, or both, to the Matters of State then in
agitation; Sometimes they elect perſons having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
by their own greatneſſe or alliance to procure
ſome particular buſineſſe of Conſequence effected
for the County or Corporation for which they ſerve,
So that to endeavour a perpetual Parliament, would
prejudice the peoples repeated election, which is not
to be allowed. Beſides, this inconvenience would
follow a perpetual Parliament, that the perſons cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
may be altered in Body, Mind or Morals, and ſo
unfit for that ſervice, yet their authority would be
continued;<note place="margin">3d Inſtit. 8, &amp; 12.</note> For a Knight, Citizen or Burgeſſe can
make no proxie, and Sickneſſe, &amp;c. is no cauſe of
Removal. And further, if thoſe perſons ſhould
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115433:11"/>
grow old in that power, they would engroſſe the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the kingdom into their own hands, and by great
means, and friends, and privilges overtop their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen
and make them meer Under-woods.</p>
            <p>And if it be proved that this Act doth not eſtabliſh
this Long Parliament in an abſolute perpetuity,
Then it is to be conſidered what is the time of their
duration, within the meaning of this Act; for if it
be conſtrued that they have a continuance till they
diſſolve themſelves, without reſtraining their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
to the time of the performance of thoſe ends
for which the ſaid Act was made: This is potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
a perpetuity, and cannot be abridged but by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
own wills, which would never militate (as he phraſes
it) againſt their own advantages. So that then this
expoſition labours under the ſame Abſurdities and
Inconveniences with the former, and therefore not
to be ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>Therefore I conceive the moſt natural and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
interpretation of this Act is, to make the drift
and purpoſe of this Act, the limits of its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and this drift is the payment of the ſaid debts;
And ſeeing by the rules of the Common Law,<note place="margin">Cor l. 6. f. 31.</note> which
may be confirmed by Reaſon, when an indefinite
time is given for the performance of a voluntary Act
poſſible to a third perſon, the Act ought to be done
within convenient time; hence I infer, that if the
publique debts which were the end of the making of
this Act, be not ſatisfied by the Long Parliament;
yet becauſe they have had time and power more
than ſufficient between the making of that Act, and
the Kings death, to have raiſed and paid them off,
and did actually levy monies, amounting to a far
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115433:11"/>
greater ſum, which were otherwiſe imployed. The
Gentlemen of that Parliament ought not to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of their own neglect; but having ſurpaſſed
the time which by Law and Reaſon was ſufficient to
accompliſh thoſe ends, they loſt the advantage they
gained by that Statute, the Kings Prerogative, and
the ordinary courſe of Diſſolution relapſed into its
old Chanel, and conſequently the ſaid Parliament
was by the Kings death actually diſſolved. And
ſo much is argued by way of Admiſſion, That the
Act of 17 <hi>Car.</hi> did provide againſt all the Cauſes of
Diſſolution, but not granting it; for I doubt not, but
I ſhall prove the contrary afterwards in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
But now we muſt haſten to the body of the
Act.</p>
            <p>His ſecond Argument is drawn from the body of
the Act,<note place="margin">P. 5.</note> the words whereof are theſe, <hi>viz. That this
Parliament be not diſſolved unleſs by Act of Parliament
to be paſſed for that purpoſe.</hi> Whence he concludes,
<hi>that this negative Clauſe is excluſive of all the cauſes of
Diſſolution;</hi> which I deny: But before I give my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
I ſhall obſerve.</p>
            <p>That ſeeing this Act is derogatory in a matter of
the higheſt nature to the Law and Cuſtome of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
but eſpecially to the Kings Prerogative,
which the Law ſupports and cheriſhes as a ballance
to the two other Eſtates, to preſerve the perfect
Craſis and equal Temper of the Politick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The general words therof ſhall be expounded
ſtrictly in reference to the thing altered, and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as to the reviviſcency of the Law and Cuſtome
of Parliament, and of the Kings Prerogative, which
in obedience to ſome neceſſity was for a time laid
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115433:12"/>
afleep and ſuſpended; for 'tis a rule, that <hi>bonum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarium
extra terminos neceſsitatis non eſt bonum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being premiſed I doubt not but I ſhall give a
full Anſwer to the Authors ſecond Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</note>And therefore I make a Queſtion, whether an Act
of Parliament by expreſs and appoſite words, which
is ſtronger than our Caſe can continue their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after the death of the King in whoſe life it was
ſummoned.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe that after the death of the King, if they
be a Parliament, they are either ſuch by the Common
law and cuſtom of Parliament (which is a principal
and fundamental part of the Common law of the
Land) or by the ſpecial Statute, ſo by both they
cannot be a Parliament. But they are not be a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
by either of thoſe two wayes, for the reaſons
hereafter alledged, Not by the Common law and
cuſtom of Parliaments; becauſe (as the learned Mr.
<hi>Prynne</hi> hath proved in his ſaid booke, and the
Author agreeth it, and 'tis not doubted by any man
that hath any underſtanding in the Law) That Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
as it was a Parliament by the Common law,
naturally determined by the demiſe or death of the
King: Nor are they a Parliament by the eſpecial
Statute, becauſe then it would be another thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from that Parliament which was ſummoned in
the Kings life, to which the power of Repreſentation,
which was conferred upon the Members thereof, by
the people in their Election cannot extend; for the
Country being enabled to chooſe them by the Kings
writ, the perſons elected received no power from
them, but according to the tenour of the Kings writ,
which determining with the Kings life, the power of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115433:12"/>
repreſenting the people, wbich they received at their
Election was then likewiſe determined, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
they were no longer the peoples Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives;
and therefore no Parliament.</p>
            <p>Or to expreſſe it in plainer terms, If they be a
Parliament after the Kings death by the force of their
own Act, as I have proved, they muſt be, if they be
a Parliament; Then it would follow, that a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by their own Act may only create another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
to exiſt after they themſelves ſo conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
are diſſolved; and the conſequence of this would
be, that the people ſhould be bound by the Laws
of that other Parliament to which the people never
conſented being made by perſons that were not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
by them to be their immediate Repreſentatives,
which is abſurd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing materially to be objected to this
in my opinion, but that the people are parties by
repreſentation to the Act that conſtituted the ſecond
Parlrament, and ſo the ſecond Parliament might ſit
by their mediate, though not by their immediate
choyce and election. To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p>That the power that the people gave to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives
at their Election was limited and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to their perſons in that quality, and is not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrible
either to other perſons, or to themſelves in
another quality; becauſe all Authorities are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
in the perſons authorized to ſome certain end;
and therefore are perſonally and ſtrictly taken, and
cannot be communicated to others, or themſelves in
another manner than they were at firſt given. As for
ample, If I ſubmit my ſelf to the arbitration of a
Stranger to ſtand and fall by his judgement and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115433:13"/>
though I am bound to ſtand to his ſentence,
yet if he transfer over the power I gave him to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I am not obliged by the award of the 3d perſon.
So if there be Arbitrators which are limited to make
their arbitration during the life of a third man, If they
award within that time, that what award they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſhall make after the death of the third perſon,
ſhall be good and binding to the parties concerned;
Such award would be voyd, becauſe they are not
arbitrators after the death of the third perſon, by
the choyce and ſubmiſsion of the parties concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but by their own award; which was beyond the
intention of the parties that gave them power, and if
they could hand over their authority beyond the date
of the firſt limitation of its continuance, they might
do the ſame thing infinitely, which is abſurd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient,
and againſt the nature of an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Second Argumen:</note> I conceive it will be a hard a matter for
the Author to prove, that a Parliament hath a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
power ordinarily as a Parliament, to alter the
Fundamental laws, which are ſo concorporate with
the eſſence of Government, that one cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
and be the ſame without the other, unleſſe it
be in a caſe of great &amp; invincible neceſsity, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
with the punctilio's of all Laws, or by the
peoples conſent ſpecially ſignified, and the
implyed conſent by their ordinary Election ſhall
not be ſuffiicient. And 'tis not a general ſentence ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Author out of the <hi>3d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inſtitutes</hi> will evince
the contrary. Which poſition I prove,</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Inſtit.</hi> p: 14.</note> becauſe the Author might have found in his
beloved third <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> That it is the courſe for the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115433:13"/>
Members of Parliament to deſire leave to conſult
with their Counties before they conſent to any new
Law of extraordinary and important alteration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it being the Root and foundation of all
the Liberties of the Subject, not to be bound by any
new Law to which they are not parties by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Repreſentatives, and to make ſucceſſive Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
It will not be reaſonably intended, That the
people did intruſt them with their authority to thoſe
ends, <hi>viz. to change the Government, or to deprive them
of their fundamental privileges,</hi> as I have before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is done by this Act, according to the Authors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> are of two ſorts,
either they concern the being, or the well-being of
the Policy of this Nation; Thoſe of the laſt kinde
are the proper work and object of Parliamentarie
power,<note place="margin">3 Inſtit. 35, 37.</note> theſe may be enacted, repealed, revived, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
expounded, and as to them a Parliament hath
unlimited juriſdiction, as by the particular examples
cited by my Lord <hi>Cooke</hi> appears; But thoſe Lawes
that concern the Being of the Kingdom, as 'tis a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
are inalterable, except in the ſpecial caſes
of Neceſſity or the peoples ſpecial Conſent; Becauſe
firſt, thoſe firſt and fundamental Lawes are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
and the Meaſure of the uſefulneſſe or diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of all the other Lawes, which are collateral to
the Eſſence of Government; All Lawes being fitted
to the nature of Government, as a garment is ſhaped
to the body, and therefore thoſe Laws ought to be
as Standards to ſupport and regulate all the reſt.<note place="margin">3 Inſtit. 41.</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
becauſe an Error in ſuch alteration would be
fatal, and next door to an Impoſſibility to be redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115433:14"/>
If the Walls or the Roof of a building be altered,
there is no great danger, but to move a ſtone in the
foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, threatens the whole ſtructure with a certain
downfall. I may ſay of it as my Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> to his
Son in another caſe, <hi>To attempt a change in the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
of Government, is like a Stratagem in War, wherein to
faile once is to be undone for ever.</hi> And that the limits
of the natural duration of a Parliament, is part of the
Fundamental Laws of this Nation is ſo clear, and
common a Truth, that it needs no further proof.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, every Statute hath the formality of a
Law, by the Law and Cuſtom of Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a Conſtitution agreed on by perſons choſen
by the people with the Royal Aſſent, without the
material Circumſtances required by the Law and
Cuſtom of Parliament, is ordinarily no binding Law,
which proves that the Law and Cuſtom of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
gives the eſſence &amp; formality of every poſſitive
Law, as tis a Law; and therefore it cannot be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the ſubſtantial part of it, except in the caſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
excepted; For all the power and force which
a Statute hath to command obedience as it is a Law,
being derived from the Law and Cuſtom of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if this Law might be altered by a Statute, it
would then follow, That the force and effect of one
and the ſame Law, could be bent againſt it ſelf, and
have an efficiency to its own deſtruction; which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
and unnatural, and not to be imagined.</p>
            <p>And for a further proof of the premiſſes, I do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
That there be ſeveral things which a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot do by their Act <hi>de jure,</hi> though <hi>de facto,</hi>
ſometime it be done,<note place="margin">Hobard 87.</note> as to make a Law that a man
ſhall be Judge in his own cauſe, or any other thing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115433:14"/>
which is againſt natural equity, the Act is void, <hi>quia
jura naturae ſunt immutabilia.</hi> So if an Act be made to
Condemn and Attaint a man of Treaſon,<note place="margin">3 Inſtit. 37.</note> without
hearing him in the way of a legal Tryal, although
my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ſaith, that the attainder ſtandeth of
force, becauſe there is no higher Court to controul
it, yet he addeth this clauſe to ſhew it is not good <hi>de
jure,</hi> viz. <hi>Auferat oblivio ſi poteſt ſi non, utcunque ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium
tegat,</hi> for (ſaith he) the more High and Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
the Juriſdiction of the Court is, the more Juſt
and Honourable ought they to be in their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and to give example to inferiour Courts. I ſhall
not mention the Books cited by Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Libr.</note> which
pertain hither,<note place="margin">Citato.</note> but refer the Reader to his Book.</p>
            <p>But to come nearer, tis the Judgement of a whole
Parliament, in theſe words, <hi>viz. <note place="margin">Ro Parl. 42 <hi>E. 3.</hi> num. 7.</note>It is declared by the
Lords and Commons in full Parliament, upon demand
made of them on the behalf of the King,<note place="margin">3 Inſtit. 14.</note> That they could
not aſſent to any thing in Parliament that tended to the
diſheriſon of the King and his Crown, to which they were
ſworn.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. in Margine.</note> And my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ſaith, That although it
might be done (<hi>i. e. de facto</hi>) yet it is againſt the
Law and Cuſtom of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Now the ſaid Act of 17 <hi>Caroli</hi> according to the
Authors Interpretation, is expreſly againſt the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of the Kings Succeſſor, to call his own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and hath many other inconveniences, which
need not to be here again repeated, and therefore in
the words of the Parliament in <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d. his
time; They could not make an Act to bear ſuch an
Interpretation, to the diſheriſon of the King and his
Crown, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yet I will not deny but that the Kings Majeſty
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115433:15"/>
might binde up his own hads, and ſuſpend his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
power from an actual diſſolution of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
morally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by his promiſe, or legally, by an Act
made for that purpoſe. For a Parliament may bee
diſſolved either by an external principle which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental,
<hi>viz.</hi> the declaration of the Kings pleaſure;
or by an internal principle which is natural, <hi>viz.</hi> the
want of entring their Continuances, or the Kings
death, whereby the Kings writ, which is the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
they have to convene together, is determined.
Now the King (as over his Subjects) ſo he hath a
ſoveraignty over his own Will, and being obliged
by his Royal aſſent to that Act, he might and ought
to ſtave off the accidental cauſe of their diſſolution.
But for the aforeſaid Reaſons, I doubt whether the
Kings Majeſty, or his two Houſes, or altogether,
could legally change the ſubſtance of the Parliament,
and defend it againſt the natural Cauſes of its Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
This being underſtood under the limitations
expreſſed in my firſt Theſis or Poſition.</p>
            <p>But that which I will rely upon is this,<note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note> that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
it be in the power of a Parliament with the
Royal aſſent by their Act to make themſelves a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Parliament after the Kings death by apt words;
Yet in the Act of 17. <hi>Caroli</hi> there are no ſuch words,
as according to the rules of Law will bear any ſuch
conſtruction. For the words, <hi>That this Parliament
ſhall not be diſsolved unleſs it be by Act of Parliament,</hi>
are a general negative, which by a proper interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
cannot extend to all the cauſes of diſſolution,
but only to that which moſt often happened, and
which was the pretended grievance at that time, <hi>viz.</hi>
the diſſolution by the Kings will and Pleaſure: For
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115433:15"/>
it belongs to the Judges to expound the general Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
Laws according to reaſon and the beſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,<note place="margin">Hob. 346.</note>
and to mould them to the trueſt and beſt uſe.
And in all times the Judges have excepted particular
caſes out of the general negative or affirmitive words:
of Statutes, though ſuch particular caſes have come
within the comprehenſion of the general words.
Where the letter of thoſe Statutes in the largeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of it doth intrench upon the Kings Prerogative
or the nature of the thing, or enforces to an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
or an impoſſibility.</p>
            <p>By the Satute of <hi>Magna Carta</hi> c. 11.<note place="margin">2d Inſtit. 23.</note> 'tis enacted,
That <hi>common pleas ſhall not follow</hi> (or be ſued in) <hi>the
Kings Court</hi> (or Bench) which is a general negative
clauſe, yet notwithſtanding becauſe 'tis a maxime in
Law that the King is preſent in every Court (and
cannot for that reaſon be non-ſuited) It is clear Law
and ſo holden, that the <hi>King is not within theſe general
words,</hi> but may ſue in his Bench or in any other
Court at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Wincheſters</hi> Caſe,<note place="margin">Co. l. 3. f. 2.</note> though there
was an Act of Parliament 28. H. 8. that <hi>the Lord</hi>
Norris <hi>ſhould forfeit all his rights, &amp;c.</hi> Yet adjudged
that a right of action being an inſeparable incident to
the perſon attainted <hi>could not by general words be made
ſeparable contrary to its nature;</hi> and therefore were not
given to the King by the generality of that Law.</p>
            <p>So in <hi>Englefields</hi> Caſe,<note place="margin">Co. li. 7. f. 13.</note> though the Statute 33 H. 8.
<hi>gives all conditions of perſons attainted to the King,</hi>
which being a general word comprehends all ſorts
of conditions, yet a condition of revocation of uſes
by any writing under the hand of the Duke of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
that was attainted <hi>being appropriated to his own
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115433:16"/>
perſonal act</hi> was not forfeited within that general
Statute.</p>
            <p>The Statute of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> is a general Statute,<note place="margin">Co. l. 7. f. 6.</note> that
<hi>the Hundred, &amp;c. ſhall make ſatisfaction for all Robberies
and Felonies done within the Hundred;</hi> Yet Reſolved,
that the Hundreds ſhall make no ſatisfaction for the
robberies of a houſe, becauſe the houſe was the Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Caſtle, and he might have defended himſelf, and
<hi>ſo twas inconvenient</hi> that the Hundred ſhould be put to
take care of him that had ability to preſerve himſelf
and his goods: Nor for a robbery done in the night,
becauſe it was the Travellers folly to travel by night,
and <hi>it was impoſsible</hi> that the Hundred (who by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment
were in their beds) ſhould take notice of
ſuch a Robbery.</p>
            <p>The Statutes of <hi>Marlebridge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plowd 204, 205.</note> cap. 4. <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 2d.
cap. 49. and 25 <hi>E. 3.</hi> cap. 16. are in the general Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative;
Yet the Judges have ſo expounded thoſe
Statutes, that they extend not to many particular ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
caſes which are within the general Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of thoſe words. It were infinite to enumerate
all of them;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> true and perfect Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, p. 24.</note> Therfore to apply this. Seeing it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
by the Author, and otherwiſe proved, That it
is the nature of a Parliament ordinarily to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by the Kings death; and the contrary is (as I
have proved) againſt the liberty of the Subjects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
and in prejudice of the Kings Succeſſors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of calling his own Parliament, and this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Clauſe may be very fully ſatisfied by ſuſpenſion
of the Kings prerogative to diſſolve them at his will
and pleaſure; 'Tis againſt all reaſon and preſident,
that it ſhould be extended any further to change the
eſſential nature of a Parliament, abridge the ſubjects
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115433:16"/>
Liberty, and ſhackle the prerogative royal, withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
any ſpecial and expreſſe words to manifeſt certainly
that the intention of the Lawmakers was ſuch, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any manner of Queſtion. For if they had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to preſerve themſelves againſt diſcontinuance, and
the Kings death, they would have added ſuch ſpecial
words as theſe, <hi>viz. That this Parliament ſhall not be
diſsolved by the Kings Majesty, nor by neglect of the due
entring of Adjournments, nor by his Majeſties death, but
onely by Act of Parliament:</hi> Which would have made
their Intention manifeſt; and in ſuch Caſe they
would never have been contented with general
words, which are uncertain and ambiguous.</p>
            <p>And laſtly,<note place="margin">Argum 4.</note> if I ſhould admit, which can never be
evinced, That the ſaid negative Clauſe ſhould forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Parliament againſt all the cauſes of diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as it ſtands ſingly by it ſelf; yet upon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the other part of the ſame Statute, it will
appear that there are other words which do reſtrain
the generallity of the former negative clauſe or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and ſhew, that the intent of that Parliament
was never to continue themſelves a Parliament after
the Kings death. And to prove this: It is a good
Rule in Law, that it is moſt natural and genuine to
expound one part of the meaning of a Statute by an
other. The firſt general clauſe of the Statute 17 <hi>Car.</hi>
reſpects the Effect, viz. <hi>That they ſhall not be diſſolved,
&amp;c.</hi> and this I call Conſervatory. And after comes
another clauſe, which reſpects the Cauſe of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
viz. <hi>And that all and every thing and things,
done or to be done for the Adjournment, proroguing, or
diſſolving of this preſent Parliament, contrary to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Act, ſhall be utterly void and of none Effect.</hi> Which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115433:17"/>
Clauſe is prohibitory of the Cauſe of their diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And in this laſt Clauſe it appears, that the Cauſe
of diſſolution which they intended to prevent, was
ſomething that ſhould conſiſt in Action, by the
words <hi>(thing or things done or to be done)</hi> Which
words could be applicable only to an actual diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the Kings Pleaſure. For the non-entry of
continuance upon adjournments, is not a Thing, but
a Defect, nor Done, but Omitted; and the Kings
death is not a Thing, but a Ceſſation of his perſonal
Being, and of the dependents thereupon. Nor is an
Action, but a Termination or Period. So that the
laſt clauſe which reſpects the cauſe of their diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
extending only to a diſſolution by the Kings
pleaſure, the Author cannot with any Reaſon or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
ſtrain or extend the negative words of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
general Sentence, which Reſpects the Effect, to
any of the other wayes of Diſſolution, unleſſe hee
would have the Effect, as 'tis an Effect, to be broader
and more capacious than the Cauſe, which is not to
be endured. So that it is evident, that this later Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
reſtrains the general words of the former, to
the particular kind of diſſolution by the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and upon the whole, that the Long Parliament
had no eſtabliſhment of their continuance againſt a
diſſolution by diſcontinuance or the Kings death,
which having both happened during their Seſſion,
they are twice dead inſtead of being once revived.</p>
            <p>And now let the impartial and underſtanding Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
judge what reaſon the Author had to trouble the
world with this Paradox, which is built by him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo ſandy foundation, that it is no glory to demoliſh
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115433:17"/>
and kick it down. It is the humor of ſome Men to
make Election, rather to doe Miſchief, than to doe
Nothing. Though I cannot but ſpeak him ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
yet I could wiſh he had exercis'd his Curioſity
in a matter of leſſe dangerous conſequence to himſelf
and the Peace of theſe Nations.</p>
            <p>There remain ſome Little things to be diſcuſſed and
anſwered in the Authors diſcourſe of the Exiſtency
of the Long-Parliament, which I ſhall touch only,
and diſmiſſe the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>To Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> firſt Argument he anſwers, That
the Kings death legally diſſolves a Parliament; but
not ſuch a Parliament as is eſtabliſhed by an Act of
the three Eſtates, and requires a preſident to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
This diſtinction is fully anſwered before in
this Diſcourſe by my arguments upon the body of
the Act: So that Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> Objection ſtands in its
full force and efficacy. And for his preſident, this is
<hi>iniquum petere,</hi> to demand an example of that which
is without a parallel in any of the former Ages. It
ſufficeth, that we have evinced by Reaſon and a legal
interpretation of the Act of 17 <hi>Car.</hi> that the Long
Parliament hath no legal exiſtence.</p>
            <p>To Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> ſecond Objection he furniſhes out
the ſame diſtinction; for hee hath no weapons to
fight with but a fork, and if that break he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
of Victory. But he fortifies his diſtinction with
an Interrogatory, upon which he frames a <hi>Dilemma,</hi>
which is anſwered before, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That a Parliament cannot <hi>de jure</hi> extend its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
beyond the Kings life in whole time they
were ſummoned, but by the peoples ſpecial conſent,
or an invincible neceſſity: And this is not to be ſuch
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115433:18"/>
a pedling neceſſity as the pretence of borrowing of
Money in our particular caſe. He ſayes, <hi>That Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſecurity was ever looked upon as inviolable,</hi> viz. (as
I think he means) juſt and punctual, and it hath been
alwayes ſo eſteemed before and ſince that Act, and
moneyes have been alwayes borrowed in great Sums
upon their Security, without ſcrupling their Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Ask any Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> he will give you
a preſident of it which is not beyond the memory of
man. Yet I confeſſe, that if the Moneys borrowed
by the Long Parliament in 17 <hi>Car.</hi> were not paid by
that Parliament (although they ſate till the Kings
death, which was many years afterwards) 'tis moſt
certainly true, that the general Rule did fail in that
particular inſtance. And till now very few of this
Kingdom did ever know or ſuppoſe that that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had left the Nation in Debt: So that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hath no Reaſon to expect the Thanks of the
Houſe at their reſitting, for making this diſcovery ſo
publique.</p>
            <p>To Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> third Objection he oppoſes the ſame
magnanimous diſtinction, which ſurely is not of
<hi>French</hi> extraction, for it ſhrinks not at the 3d. charge.
But 'tis now almoſt out of breath, and therefore to
ſecond it, he ſayes, that the King virtually waved
the authority of his Writ of Summons, and fearing
that for all this it may be repulſed, he ſounds a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
by another Interrogation, which is in effect but
his old diſtinction wheeled off and re-enforced, &amp; this
as I have ſaid, is all anſwered before in this diſcourſe,
and I would not tire my Reader with repetitions.</p>
            <p>To Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> fourth Objection he ſayes nothing
material, only that paſſage muſt not eſcape unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115433:18"/>
               <hi>viz. That the King is a part of the Parliament
in his politick, rather then in his natural capacity; and
therefore when the King dies, the Parliament diſsolved
not, becauſe the politick capacity remains after his death.</hi>
To which I anſwer, That the intent and uſe of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
is to adviſe that particular King that ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
it, and all their counſels muſt be directed to
him as he is a Man capable of Advice and aſſent:
And when he writes <hi>Le Roy le veult,</hi> it is his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
act, though as this act gives the inſtrument which
he ſignes the validity and efficacy of a Law, it is done
by his Royal Authority.<note place="margin">3d Inſtir. 6. 28.</note> And further, every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ought to begin and end by his perſonal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
or by him in repreſentation; which ſhewes,
that every Parliament depends upon the perſon of
the King; And this is further evident, by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
diſſolution of the Parliament at his death. And to
the Authors <hi>application, that a Parliament may be ſuch
though the Kings perſon be utterly withdrawn, becauſe his
politick capacity lives and is preſent with them.</hi> This is
an out-worn and thredbare Diſtinction, which the
common ſtory of the Knights being perjured in his
politick, and going to Hell in his natural Capacity
ſufficiently confutes. For the politick capacity is a
ſecond Notion,<note place="margin">Plowden 213.</note> and cannot ſubſiſt but in the natural;
To which it is ſo ſtrictly united, that it is inſeperable
otherwiſe than by our underſtanding, which cannot
alter the nature of any thing. The Murthering of
his late Majeſty, as it was Treaſon, was an offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his politick capacity as he was a King, though
that horrid and ſhameleſſe Butchery was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt his natural perſon as he was a Man.</p>
            <p>But that ſaying that the King is a part of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115433:19"/>
muſt be cautiouſly underſtood, becauſe a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
in it, hath been a great cauſe or pretence of all
our late Civil Wars. For, hence ſome would infer
a Coordination of power in the Parliament, which
cannot, I conceive, be made good by Reaſon or the
Laws of this Nation; For the King hath undoubted
power to call and diſſolve Parliaments, which are
properties inconſiſtent with a coordinate power.<note place="margin">3d Inſtit 25.</note> The
Stile of all Acts anciently was by way of Petition,
<hi>(that it may be enacted)</hi> which doth not ſmell of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
authority,<note place="margin">3d Inſtit. 35.</note> and the Act of 17 <hi>Car.</hi> was in
like form. The Members cannot conſent upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
which ſhewes, that the binding power of an
Act, as it is a Law, doth not paſſe from them, (for
<hi>cujus eſt dare, ejus eſt modificare)</hi> but only a bare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
which is neceſſary to perfect the Act of another,
as in Atturnments. The Members during the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of Parliament may be committed, and be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
for Treaſon, which could not be, if they were
in a Coordination with the King; And the Writs of
Summons, under favour, (notwithſtanding my Lord
<hi>Cooks</hi> marginal notes) do confirm this aſſertion. I
ſhall conclude with the Teſtimony of the learned
<hi>Grotius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">l. 1, c. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

true,<note place="margin">Forteſc. cap. 9.</note> that in our Legal Monarchy the King cannot
make or alter any Law without the aſſent of his Peers
and Commons in Parliament: So that upon the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115433:19"/>
whole it appears, That the King is ſo a part, as he
is the head of the Parliament and Nation; and though
it be true, that <hi>totum eſt dignius ſua parte,</hi> yet the head
muſt be a part of this <hi>totum,</hi> or elſe that Maxime is
untrue and fallacious.</p>
            <p>To Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> fifth Objection, he chops in again
the diſtinction of the Kings politick and natural ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
which my former confutation hath rendred
toothleſſe. <hi>But he ſayes the diſſolution of the Parliament
by the Kings death, might prove dangerous and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Kingdom,</hi> I anſwer, he that intends to be
believed, muſt not affirm things in general terms,
which do <hi>nihil ponere,</hi> and to which no certain anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
can be given. Again, 'tis preſumption in the
Author to think himſelf wiſer then all the ages that
liv'd before him, who finding no inconvenience, have
derived the cuſtom down to our times, and 'tis a

            </p>
            <p>To his anſwer to the ſixth Objection, affirming,
<hi>That the Parliament was not diſſolved by the Act paſſed
lately, upon the Admiſsion of the Secluded Members,
for their diſſolution, becauſe it was but an Act of the
Houſe of Commons only, which is no Act of Parliament.</hi>
I anſwer that it is moſt true, That it was no Act of
Parliament according to Law; But by the Authors
favour, thoſe very men (that were the greateſt part
of the Commons of the Long Parliament then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving)
ought not themſelves, nor their advocate, to
ſay that they were no Parliament, for they impoſed
an Aſſeſſement upon the Nation, and ſtiled their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
<hi>Acts of a Parliament,</hi> ſo that thoſe men
ſhall never in reaſon averre any thing in diſability of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115433:20"/>
their own Acts, though they were otherwiſe not
agreeing with the rules of Parliamentary proceedings.
Beſides that Act at leaſt amounts to a Declaration
of their Judgement, that they were diſſolved, and it
was true, for they were long before diſſolved by the
Kings death.</p>
            <p>To his anſwer to the ſeventh Objection, <hi>That this
Act 17 Car. is not void, although the Biſhops (who were
outed before this Act paſſed) did not aſſent to it.</hi> I ſhall
ſay <hi>obiter,</hi> That 'tis the hope of the greateſt part of
the Learned, Loyal and Moderate party of this
Nation, that this preſent Parliament, (if the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of other more important affairs would permit)
or ſome other Parliament, will out of their zeal to
Common Juſtice, and the honour and ſafety of the
Kingdom, take the Caſe of the Reverend Biſhops
into conſideration, and reſtore unto them their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
honours and privileges of ſitting in the Houſe of
Peers: Their undoubted and very ancient right, and
the neceſſity of their Re-eſtabliſhment, in order to
the preſervation of the ancient policy of this Nation,
for the better ſupport of the Royal Authority, for
the ballancing of the other two Eſtates, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Clergy of this Nation, who have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives
in Parliament, for the preſervation of
the rights and privileges of the Church, and for the
better eſtabliſhment of the integrity of Orthodox
Religion; being ſtrong and important advocates for
their ſo juſt Reſtitution.</p>
            <p>After which ſhort digreſſion, I anſwer, That if an
Act of Parliament, that diveſts ſo many Members
of the ſame Parliament of their rightfull and ancient
privileges, and lawfull inheritance, without any
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115433:20"/>
crime committed or alleged, or without being called
to anſwer in any judicial way of proceeding, be good
and valid, then the Authors poſition is true, and not
to be denyed; But if ſuch an Act be againſt natural
juſtice and equity, and againſt the law and cuſtom of
Parliament, (for I ſhall deſire the liberty to be ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
in this particular) then on the otherſide it will
appear, that the Biſhops were excluded againſt their
Wills, and they being ſo great a part of the Houſe of
Peers, that their voices if they had been preſent,
might by joyning with other Lords of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
have carried the Act of 17 <hi>Caroli</hi> in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
It follows that the Secluſion of the Biſhops
rendred that Act, and all other Acts made after their
Secluſion, void and of none effect.</p>
            <p>And this caſe of the Biſhops hath no ſimilitude
with the point in Mr. <hi>Bagſhaws</hi> reading (lately prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
becauſe there the Biſhops are ſuppoſed volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to abſent themſelves,<note place="margin">P. 17.</note> or being preſent to diſſent,
and ſo an Act paſſed by the greater number of voices.</p>
            <p>Nor doth the caſe cited by the Author, come up
to the caſe in queſtion. For there the Baronies being
appropriate to the Abbots, as they were Abbots,
when by Act of Parliament their Abbies were given
to the Crown, and the Covent or Society of Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
diſſolved; the Correlative, <hi>viz.</hi> the Covent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſtroyed, they ceaſed to be Abbots, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
their Baronies which they enjoyed as Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots
(the foundation failing) were naturally annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
But the Biſhops though they were Barons of
the Realm,<note place="margin">Seldens Titles of Honor p. 282, 347.</note> 
               <hi>ratione fundi &amp; officii Epiſcopalis:</hi> Yet the
Act which ouſted them of their Peerage, left them
Biſhops as they were before the Act, and it was the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115433:21"/>
Biſhoprick that was the Foundation of their Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Dignity.<note place="margin">Grotius de jure Belſi l. 2. c. 21. ſect. 10.</note> And there is a great difference between
the taking away of an Eſtate, which by conſequence
deſtroys a Dignity that depends upon it, and an Act
which directly and intentionally ſtrikes at the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Dignity it ſelf, which appears by the
particular inſtance, that the Abbots were not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reld
at for their Baronies, but for the Diſſoluteneſſe
and Enormity of their Abbeys.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to his project,</hi> That if the King would pleaſe
to permit the Long Parliament to ſit; To prevent their
perpetuating themſelves, (which <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> may inſlave
the King and Kingdom to ſuch a yoak of Bondage,<note place="margin">P. 18, 19.</note> as we
may never be able to break off our own necks, or the necks
of our poſterity any more) his Majeſty may Summon them
before their ſitting, and take their perſonal Promiſe and
Engagement to confirm the Acts of this Parliament, and
the firſt thing they do within a certain time to diſſolve
themſelves. <hi>I would willingly know what coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ground or pretence there can be for ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal?
For</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, they are diſſolved and of no authority, as I
have before manifeſtly proved.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſecurity of their performance is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Promiſe or Engagement, which are eaſily bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and if it were an Oath, and they ſhould by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
do contrary to it, 'tis very probable that the
Author would pretend he could Salve up their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits
and their Conſciences too; again, with his uſual
Diſtinction of their natural and politick capacity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if they ſhould break their Promiſe or
Engagement, by the Authors own confeſſion (for
he ſayes, <hi>the Objection is very rational)</hi> both the King
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115433:21"/>
and People are enthrall'd to a perpetual bondage, and
where there is ſo little aſſurance on the one ſide, and
ſo much danger on the other, the Prince cannot in
common Prudence put his own and his Kingdomes
ſafety and honour upon ſo great a hazard, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the Honeſty of a certain number of Men;
who poſſibly may fail his expectation, eſpecially (as
in this caſe) for their own Advantages.</p>
            <div type="response_to_postscript">
               <head>To the Postſcript.</head>
               <p>HE begins his Poſtſcript with a falſhood;<note place="margin">P. 18.</note> and tis
not likely that he will penetrate farre into the
Houſe that ſtumbles in the Porch: For there are not
any great nor general diſſatisfactions concerning the
legality of this preſent Parliament, whoſe authority
he endeavours to ſhake, becauſe</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">P. 19.</note> the Lords had no writs of Summons.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Commons were not choſen by the
Kings Writ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That this Parliament began not with the
Royal preſence.</p>
               <p>To the Firſt I anſwer, that the uſe of a Summons
is but to give notice to the Peers of the certainty of
the Time and Place of their Convention, and to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe
their Meeting, which is the ſubſtantial part of
the Summons. Now the King at his coming into the
kingdom found them all met together, and therefore
the ends of a Summons being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> already ſatisfied by
their being met at one time and place, and this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
being authorized by the Kings perſonal preſence,
there was no need of an actual Summons; And the
writ is but a legal circumſtance: ſo that a Failer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
is but a defect in Formality, and not in Subſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:115433:22"/>
To his Second I anſwer likewiſe, they are the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
own words, <hi>page 10.</hi> of his Book, <hi>that the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Parliaments in this or that Kings name, to conſult
or adviſe with this or that King, theſe are but Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
things, and nothing of the eſſentials of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the Kingdoms welfare;</hi> Which is true, if it be
rightly applyed. And the Subſtance or end of the
Kings writ is to authoriſe the Country to Elect, and
to notifie the time and place of their Meeting, which
was ſignified by that Writ whereby this Parliament
was called. And as to the deficiency of that Writ
that it ran in the Name of a Commonwealth, that
fault is but in the point of formality. And every one
knew that at that time, though the writs ſpoke a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
yet they meant the Kings Majeſty. And
the Author cannot deny, but that all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of a free and legal Election were purſued in the
choyce of thoſe honourable and worthy perſons that
are now ſitting in this preſent Parliament, which
ſhews, that herein likewiſe there is no deficiency in
Subſtance, but only in Circmſtance.</p>
               <p>Now the Subſtantial part being well obſerved, the
neceſſity of the then preſent State of affairs in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
was and is a good juſtification and excuſe of the
defects alleged only in Circumſtance and Ceremony:
<hi>Neceſsitas Legum irridet vincula;</hi> For even the divine
Lawes do admit a diſpenſation in the particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of an invincible neceſſity, as the Laws of the
<hi>Shew-bread,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kings c. 21.</note> and that of the <hi>Sabbaoth.</hi> And therefore
much more ought it to prevail againſt the ſmaller
Ceremonies in queſtion,<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 1.</note> enjoyned by the Law of this
Nation, which is a human Law. And this may be
proved,</p>
               <p>Firſt becauſe that in the Caſe in Queſtion it will
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115433:22"/>
not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, That they who firſt laid
the foundations of the policy of this Nation did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that thoſe punctilio's in the writ of Summons
ſhould be ſo ſtrictly obſerved, That in a Caſe of ſo
great Neceſſity as ours was, the non-obſervance of
them ſhould vitiate their Acts, who are not deficient
in any of the material and ſubſtantial requiſites to a
Legal Parliament.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 1. c. 4. ſect. 7.</note> And this is the argument of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
in his <hi>Jure Belli</hi> in a like caſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſeeing the circumſtantial inſtances,
which the Author excepts againſt in this Parliament
do only regard convenience, (for the Kings pleaſure
is the ſubſtance of the power that is given to the
Lords to meet, and to the Counties and Boroughs to
elect Members to ſerve in Parliament, and the end
of the Writ of Summons is only for the more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
and certain manifeſtation of the Kings pleaſure,
in order to a conſultation for the publique good:) It
follows that when by reaſon of ſome extraordinary
evil or danger, which oppreſſes or threatens the
kingdom, it appears to be utterly inconvenient to the
weal-publique, and impoſſible, to uſe thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
(as it was at the Calling of this Parliament;)
That in ſuch a ſpecial caſe thoſe Circumſtances ought
to be omitted, becauſe herein they are uſeleſs, nay
oppoſite to the ends to which they were ordained in
their firſt Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, 'tis common (as in all other Laws) ſo by
the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> to allow a ſpecial priviledge to
all thoſe caſes which are uſhered in by a Neceſſity not
to be reſiſted, as you may read at large in <hi>Plowden,
Fogaſſas</hi> caſe, fo. 9. &amp; 13, 18, 19. Not to trouble my
Reader with particular caſes, in a matter that will
brook no Denyal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:115433:23"/>
Now who knows not, that at the Time of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of this Parliament, there was an Armed power
in this Kingdom inimical to the reſtauration of his
Sacred Majeſty, and the ancient and legal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Nation; And that to have ſummoned the
Peers at all, or the Commons, in the Kings name,
might then have been the occaſion of a Civil Warr,
and have hindred all thoſe excellent Defigns which
by a more calm and prudent managery have been
ſince effected and brought to paſſe: And therefore it
is plain, that there was a neceſſity of calling the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
becauſe nothing but a Parliament could repair
the breaches of the Nation, and the Parliament could
be called in no other Manner, then it was without
the hazard of a new War, and (Victory being uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain)
of the diſſolution of Government.</p>
               <p>But it may be Objected, That the Neceſsity ended
with the Kings coming into <hi>England,</hi> and therefore
another Parliament ought afterwards to have been
legally called. To which I anſwer,</p>
               <p>That the Neceſsity which occaſioned the Calling
of this Parliament, was not only to invite home his
Majeſty, but to confirm and ſecure him in the Throne,
and to do ſuch other things for the Safety and Peace
of the Nation as could be only done by them with
ſecurity to the King and Kingdom; And therefore
the Neceſsity of their ſitting continued:</p>
               <p>Firſt, till they had paſs'd the Act of Oblivion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it being offered of the Kings free grace, who
was not otherwiſe bound but by his Royal word in
his Declaration from <hi>Breda,</hi> which referred to ſuch
Exceptions as this preſent Parliament ſhould make:
It had been unſafe for the Nation, and would have
be got fears in a great number of guilty minds, which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115433:23"/>
might quickly have broken out into open Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if this Parliament had been diſſolved before that
Act had been paſs'd for their Pardon and Indemnity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The King and kingdom were not
ſafe, whilſt an Army was on foot, that was but
a reconcil'd Enemy; and had not the authority
of this Parliament over-awed them till, and in, their
disbanding, No man is certain (and it had been great
Folly to have put a matter of that import into hazard)
whether they might not have broken their Faithes
and Allegiance, being ſpurred on by Deſpair, to have
attempted ſome great Rebellion, which might have
brought us into a Relapſe of all our Miſeries, before
an other Parliament could have been ſummoned and
Convened. They who know the Hiſtory of that
Army, will not think ſuch an accident impoſsible:
And therefore this Parliament was neceſsitated to ſit
till they had disbanded the Army, and effected all
the other buſineſſes that were depending thereupon,
or in order to that End, which are now well nigh, but
yet not fully perfected.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I conceive that the Kings Majeſty is the
only and proper Judge when this neceſſity will be at
an end, wherein (as in all other things) there is no
doubt but he will govern his Counſels with ſuch care
and prudence, as will deſcribe him not to be more
deſirous of the love and affection of his particular
Subjects, then he ſhall be tenderly cautious, for the
eſtabliſhment of the peace and happineſſe of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in general.</p>
               <p>As to the Authors third Exception, That the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was not begun with the Kings perſonal or
repreſentative preſence, what I have already ſaid is a
full Anſwer. But I might ſay further, that there is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115433:24"/>
no neceſſity that I ſhould yield to him, that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
is true. For all the Acts of this Parliament
which have the effect of Laws, were made with the
Royal Aſſent, ſince his Majeſty was perſonally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with them, and though they met ſometime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
yet that doth not hinder but that it might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to be a Parliament upon his Majeſties firſt acceſs
to the two honourable Houſes.</p>
               <p>And in the general, I affirm that the power and
faculty of determining what is a Parliament, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Laws of this Nation, lies not in any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
as ſuch, but in the Kings Majeſty, or the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or both together, or in the Judges of the Land.
But the King and Parliament have by their Act, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,
<hi>An Act for removing and preventing all Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Diſputes concerning the aſſembling and ſitting
of this preſent Parliament,</hi> with particular mention of
all the Authors three Exceptions, determined the
Queſtion againſt the Authors raſh and inconſiderate
opinion. And the Judges of the Land do every day
impliedly adjudge the ſame thing, by allowing the
benefit of the Act of Oblivion to all thoſe that are
within the words or meaning of the ſaid Act. So
that the Author ought not to have interpoſed his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
opinion, ſeeing it is a certain truth, That the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Judges of the general Courts of Record
is the Law of the Land, till it be altered by ſomething
elſe, of as high or a higher nature and quality.</p>
               <p>Again, the principal defects which are alledged in
the aſſembling of this Parliament, are the want or
defect in the Writs of Summons, which is only a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
ſignification of the Kings command or authority
for their Election and Convening; And this is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
by the Kings confirmation afterwards, in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115433:24"/>
aforeſaid Act. It being a rule in Law, That <hi>Omn-is
rati habitio mandato aequiperatur,</hi> a confirmation after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
is looked upon in Law as the ſame thing with
a command in the beginning. There is no need to
cite any Caſes to prove this, whereof there is no ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Inſtances, if I aſſerted a long diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Not to inſiſt upon his unmannerlineſſe with the
preſent honourable Houſes, I ſhall only wonder at
his boldneſſe and folly, who might have been fore
warned by that paſſage in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Inſtit. chap. Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which he ſo much Inculcates, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Arthur Hall, a Member of the Houſe of Commons,
for publiſhing and diſcovering the Conferences of the
Houſe,<note place="margin">3d Inſtit. 23.</note> and writing a Book to the diſhonour of the Houſe,
was adjudged by the Houſe of Commons to be committed
to the Tower for 6. months, fined at five hundred Marks,
and expelled the Houſe. <hi>Yet I know the Authors caſe is
ſomewhat differing, he being (tis ſaid) no Member of

               </p>
               <p>But to conclude,<note place="margin">Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> 'Tis a ſtrange thing that there

                  <hi>Neque morbos noſtros nec Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia

                     </gap>.</note> becauſe we cannot finde, wee
make the cauſes of our own Diſtempers. But the
body politick hath had already too much of Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting,
&amp; there is no man but hath found a miſerable
experience too of the Phlebotomy of Purſes. Why
then being poor, ſhould we by our folly ſeek to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
from our ſelves the only good Companion of Poverty,
Quietneſs? There was never any Government ſo perfect
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115433:25"/>
but it had ſome <hi>Naevi</hi> in the Conſtitution, and ſome Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and Miſcarriages in the Practice. He muſt take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to go to Heaven, that will not brook Defects on Earth.
And therefore we ought not critically too enſure the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our Superiors, becauſe we know not all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
that encouraged and gave occaſion for their
Counſels, and if we did we muſt make abatement of ſome
grains to humane frailty, and the ſhort-ſightedneſſe of our
knowledge, and the multitude of Accidents which can
neither be foreſeen, nor prevented. Such are the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Wiſe and Moderate. But Detractors are the
Authors of their own Blindneſſe, and are like Flyes which
refuſe the ſound parts of the body, but ſuck and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

beſides, <hi>Nil mihi vis &amp; vis cuncta licere tibi;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Martial.</note> There is no need
to apply it. I ſhall only adde one Leſſon that the late wars
have taught me, To reſiſt the Prince (beſides the ſting of
Conſcience) can tend to no good End in Policy. For every
unlawfull change is deſtructive or hurtfull to the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of that change: (The moſt of thoſe men that
were the firſt movers in the late Wars, or their Executors,
will make affidavit of the truth hereof.) And if the Prince
prevails (which is moſt likely) the Rebels are undone in
their Lives, Relations, Eſtates. If the Rebellious prevail,
the ſtirring ſpirits among them will rule and tyrannize
over the Reſt, till by ſupplanting one another they make
way for the Princes Reſtitution:<note place="margin">Machiav. in Princ.</note> ſo that after all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
loſſe and danger of a warre, and the ſubjection to
the Tyrannical government of their Equals, the greateſt
and beſt end of all is this only; to be as they were; and
like the Dove of <hi>Noah,</hi> after a tyreſom and dangerous jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in the Air, to return into the Ark again for reſt and
ſafety. I hope the Nation will not any longer be deluded
by Impoſtors, who make Religion and the Liberty of the
Subject the ſtalking horſes to their own privat Deſigns; but
that if they muſt needs contend, they will rather ſtrive
who ſhall be moſt forward to be an inſtrument for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Religion, and the ſettlement of this hitherto
diſtracted Nation upon the Pillars of Juſtice and a Laſting
Peace. <hi>Eritis inſuperabiles, ſi fueritis inſeperabiles.</hi>
