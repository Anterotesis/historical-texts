            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Saying, this pallace faire and fresh, wherein so many are,</l>

            <l>I tell thée plaine is vile Delight, the place is called Loue.</l>
            <l>It hight the loue of worldly welth, with pleasures of the same,</l>

To enter in among the rest, she did me much procure,</l>
            <l>With striuing I sure féeble was, not able to endure.</l>
            <l>Good <hi>Memorie</hi> did me defende, which vnto life do runne,</l>
            <l>And charged me to flie desire, as I had earst begonne.</l>
            <l>Forthwith was showed to me a glasse, wherein I saw full cléere,</l>
            <l>The former facts that I had done, as well those past as néere.</l>
            <l>Within that glasse espide I <hi>Age,</hi> which noted well my trade,</l>
            <l>And frowning browes to me he bent, awaye consumde as shade:</l>
            <l>Bicause I did so small regarde, mine othe and promise iust,</l>
            <l>He shewed himselfe most wrathfull still, euen bent to bate my lust,</l>
            <l>No sooner I graye heares espide, and face with wrinkles full,</l>
            <l>My youthfull courage then decreased, lo thus did <hi>Age</hi> me pull.</l>
            <l>Yet Lust and eke Concupiscence, assaulted me so sore,</l>
            <l>By their attempt I scarce could get, then languisht I the more,</l>
            <l>In sorrowes fell and deadly thoughts, had not <hi>Remembrance</hi> bin,</l>
            <l>No way coulde I escape them sure, from that allured sin.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Memorie</hi> declarde to me,<note place="margin">By the corse, the Author meaneth the whole state of the earthy man, being corrupted in sinne.</note> such words of liuely force,</l>

            <l>As one full bent no more to straye, hir counsell did I craue,</l>
            <l>And she forthwith did show full plaine, which way my selfe to saue.</l>
            <l>No man that liueth on the earth, may sinne so from him moue,</l>
            <l>Therfore to suffer paines thou must, so doth it thée behoue:</l>
            <l>For Sathan he will tempt thée still, and doe the best he can,</l>
            <l>To trap thée fast in deadly sinne, such is his trade with man.</l>
            <l>Therfore in time doe call to minde, away will go thy youth,</l>
            <l>And séeke those things that will thée saue, for troubles oft ensuth:</l>
            <l>Disturbe not once thy memorie in things that passe thy wit,</l>
            <l>For who doth so, by fraude is caught, for thée it is vnfit.</l>
            <l>And albeit Concupiscence and Lust doe thée assayle,</l>
            <l>Refraine them still, then be thou sure, in time thou mayst not quayle.</l>
            <l>When I had well behelde them both, then did I vnderstande,</l>
            <l>Their counsels tolde to be deceit, and foes to euerie lande.</l>
            <l>Forthwith I called <hi>Memorie,</hi> wherein stoode all my staye,</l>
            <l>Desiring hir me to excuse, from Lust I tooke my waye,</l>

Thus in the ende all was but vaine, that Lust doth take in hande,</l>

            <l>From them she did me still defende, and brought me in plaine way,</l>

            <l>Now to declare the ayrie state, some what I minde to saye,</l>
            <l>Of all Complexions what they are, and how they do decaye.</l>
            <l>Sanguine fierce and valiant, as Authors doe declare,</l>
            <l>Melancholy full of ire, with bodie leane and bare.</l>
            <l>In Choler he full grosse doth waxe, as grim as <hi>Bacchus</hi> grace,</l>
            <l>And Flegmatike no cowarde is, where he may hide his face.</l>
            <l>But where these foure in one are knit, by noble <hi>Nature</hi> shée,</l>
            <l>There for a time the bodie spredes, euen as the herbe or trée.</l>
            <l>But when these signes do disagrée, and <hi>Sperma</hi> doe decrease,</l>
            <l>Then streight beginnes to putrifie, the inner parts and grease:</l>
            <l>To drinesse then the bodie growes with parched hands and skinne,</l>
            <l>And so continues to the ende, but <hi>Youth</hi> no more can winne.</l>
            <l>Who woulde not trauaile all his life such science for to knoe,</l>
            <l>As able is to rid from strife this carcasse bare and woe:</l>
            <l>The state it selfe is nothing sure, full soone doth vade away,</l>
            <l>No earthly thing doth long endure, but once he doth decay.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:4732:30"/>
Why then is man so loth to goe, this fickle life to leaue,</l>
            <l>Sith he so well the state doth know, he doth himselfe deceaue:</l>
            <l>The pompeous state and worldly welth, doth many mindes so blinde,</l>
            <l>That when they should accomptes repay, most farthest are behinde.</l>
            <l>The Birde that in the Cage doth sing, somtimes both shrill and cleere,</l>
            <l>In ayrie skye with better note, as doth full well appéere,</l>
            <l>Bicause his kinde is there to be, if he the Cage may scape,</l>
            <l>Most ioyfull then beginnes his laye, no more for feare doth quake.</l>
            <l>But mans regarde is nothing so, the Cage of sinne to flie,</l>

AS I behelde this combat great, twixt <hi>Age</hi> and all his foes,</l>
            <l>And how they thought him to resist, as straight I shall disclose:</l>
            <l>And eke had vewde the barrainesse of all this ioylesse lande,</l>

            <l>And violations bitter streames, approching fast to mée:</l>

            <l>To thinke vpon my youthfull state, it grieued me apace,</l>
            <l>Considering that my bewtie now, <hi>Age</hi> shoulde so soone deface.</l>
            <l>Then as alone I rode full sure, appointed for to fight,</l>
            <l>With speare made apt, for Horsemans course al harnessed so bright.</l>
            <l>As quite despairing of my selfe, I soone hung downe my head,</l>

            <l>Espying that no Speare ne shielde, coulde saue me from such ill,</l>
            <l>Nor long experience coulde resist, that withered <hi>Ages</hi> will.</l>
            <l>Now entering the dale of wo alone my selfe so sad,</l>

            <l>That would haue tasted of the Cup, of <hi>Age,</hi> as well as I.</l>
            <l>And staring long none I could vewe, of high nor low degrée,</l>
            <l>Then quite dismaide I thought such chaunce, should hap to none but mée.</l>
            <l>Well forth I rode with trembling corps, and face both wan and pale:</l>
            <l>So entring in the hollow caue, and way to <hi>Ages</hi> dale.</l>
            <l>With troubled braynes of wyt bereft, and saue a quaking hart,</l>

            <l>Still looking rounde on euery side, if any I could sée.</l>
            <l>Then thought I sure to turne agayne, and scape that crooked way,</l>

            <l>I sawe no way that I mought take, I put you out of doubt.</l>
            <l>My horse was then with me dismayde, and so began to réele,</l>
            <l>Sith he no path of stable ground, nor sitting sure could féele:</l>
            <l>There was no comfort to be rept, but wo and much distresse,</l>
            <l>Sith none I coulde espie, that might to me the path expresse:</l>

            <l>Well: yet I thought some way to finde, and spurres I set to side,</l>
            <l>Then leapt my horse and plunged sore, a pace forth on to glide.</l>

            <l>The Champion stout of Death so pale, it is the verie same:</l>

            <l>Death doth triumph by his great force, as daily we may finde.</l>

            <l>That King in courage was so stoute, against that Champion bolde,</l>
            <l>That scarce he could, the chalenge made, his fingars from him hold,</l>
            <l>For he was not afraide to passe the seas with all his hoste,</l>
            <l>And bid his foes the battell stoute, in their owne lande and coste.</l>
            <l>He feared not to pitche his Campe in hart of forreine lande,</l>
            <l>And battell wage with enimies force, yea, euen hand to hande,</l>
            <l>At last Dame <hi>Memorie</hi> lookte back, and straight she bade me stay,</l>
            <l>And there I saw a worthy fight, as truth I will display.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Debilitie</hi> the chalenge gaue, and Death in iudgement sat,</l>
            <l>But yet this worthy King did showe no blushing face thereat:</l>
            <l>Then came <hi>Defiance</hi> with a scroule, thou king sayd he, take héede,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Debilitie</hi> shall thée conuince, and vanquishe thée with spéede.</l>
            <l>Though many Kings thou hast dismayde, with that thy manly face,</l>
            <l>And made thy foes abashed oft in presence of thy grace,</l>
            <l>Yet thinke thou not vs to withstande, yéelde therfore if thou wilt,</l>
            <l>Least hap contemning long, thy dayes with wearinesse be spilt.</l>
            <l>The Champion now <hi>Debilitie</hi> or Weakenesse is by name,</l>
            <l>At this triumphantly reioyste, as glad to heare the same,</l>
            <l>Then sent the King stoute <hi>Valiauncie,</hi> ambassage for to tel,</l>

            <l>Ne yet will yéelde at thy prowde boast, though hored heares he haue,</l>
            <l>It is not thou with all thy bragges, that canst him yet depraue:</l>
            <l>With that the Champion made his course, &amp; eke the King him met,</l>
            <l>Then was the sight full cruelly betwéene them fiercely set.</l>
            <l>Their fierie strokes and dreadfull blowes abasht my fearefull eyes.</l>
            <l>I thinke the sounde of them was hearde abeue the lower skyes,</l>
            <l>At last they paused for breath, well nie both being quite dismayde,</l>
            <l>Till iudgement came from <hi>Thanatos,</hi> a while they stoutly stayde.</l>
            <l>

The sentence definite was this, as I could vnderstande,</l>
            <l>The winde so bare away the sounde, that it could scarce be scande.</l>
            <q>Omnia mortali mutantur lege creata,</q>
            <l>All things created must chaunged be by mortall law no doute,</l>
            <l>Therfore in vaine thou valiant King, art thou so highe and stoute:</l>
            <l>Abase thy selfe, he must conuince, yet now these words descrie,</l>
            <l>Mori non turpe est, sed turpiter mori:</l>
            <l>It is not filthie for to die, his file must cut the thréede,</l>
            <l>But filthily to die, that same is filthinesse in déede.</l>
            <l>When as the King had heard these wordes, he gan for to recite,</l>
            <l>His noble actes which he had done, that might him then requite.</l>
            <l>No might sayde he, no strength ne fame, triumph nor victorie,</l>
            <l>Can me resist, which am the Prince of fatall destinie.</l>
            <l>With that the King began againe, a stroke or two to fight,</l>
            <l>But soone he was by weakenesse spoylde, and voide of courage quite:</l>
            <l>Lo, sayde Dame <hi>Memorie</hi> to me, this Pageant didst thou vew,</l>
            <l>All Wightes must suffer this conflict, by destinie most trew.</l>
            <l>First <hi>Age,</hi> then eke <hi>Debilitie,</hi> and Death must sure extende,</l>
            <l>As of this King, so of the rest, in time to make an ende:</l>

            <l>Till we the sight of the bare fielde, had wholy passed oute:</l>
            <l>And then I askte Dame <hi>Memorie,</hi> if I might make report,</l>

            <l>Yea, quoth she, feare it not to tell, for doubtlesse this is trew,</l>
            <l>King Henrie was a King full stoute, as all men then well knew,</l>
            <l>Which raigned thirtie seauen yeares, as Chronicles doe tell,</l>
            <l>And did in Marciall prowes then, all other farre excell.</l>
            <l>And yet at last with <hi>Dauid</hi> King and <hi>Salomon</hi> his sonne,</l>
            <l>With <hi>Iosaphat</hi> and <hi>Iosias,</hi> his strength must néedes be donne,</l>
            <l>And so must all mankinde likewise, sayd she, there is no way,</l>
            <l>Of fatall stroke there is a meane, to make a perfite stay.</l>
            <l>Though long they liue as <hi>Nestor</hi> did, or as <hi>Methusalye,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Yet once the time approches neare, wherein they néedes must dye:</l>
            <l>And therfore sayd she thinke thou still on Death and on thine ende,</l>
            <l>And thou shalt kéepe thy life so straight, that thou shalt not offende.</l>

This talke we had as we did ride, with much more I confesse,</l>

For why <hi>Debilitie</hi> gan praunce, when he was nere the king,</l>

            <l>And suffer not olde <hi>Age</hi> to gayne, ne yet thy power to quell.</l>
            <l>With that the king espyed a farre, this Champion stoute and strong,</l>
            <l>And he to sende to knowe his minde, did not the time prolong:</l>
            <l>(High Enterprise) it was that rode, Ambassage to display,</l>

            <l>I here am set him to preuent, his iourney to restrayne.</l>
            <l>High Enterprise retirde agayne, and tolde the aunswere so,</l>
            <l>Which made the kings couragious hart, to be enflamed tho:</l>

            <l>To make the Champion stoute relent, and eke his purpose quayle.</l>
            <l>There Hope stept out, and went before, and he came downe amaine,</l>
            <l>And met the Champion with such force, that he had néere him slaine:</l>
            <l>Then did Defiaunce sound the Trumpe, of Death against the king,</l>
            <l>At which the Champion gaue a blow, that did him shrowdly wring.</l>
            <l>He faynted at the stroke in déede, and yet so stoute was hée,</l>
            <l>That his yong Princely hart respire, and thought reuengde to bée,</l>

            <l>That Féeblenesse behinde him came, and did him much preuent.</l>
            <l>Then strake <hi>Debilitie</hi> that Wight, and downe fell <hi>Edward</hi> flat,</l>
            <l>It would haue gréeued a faythfull minde, for to haue bene thereat.</l>

WHen we had rode a good long space in fielde that is so gréene,</l>

            <l>We came at last vnto a Dale where we went downe apace,</l>

            <l>How likest thou this, said <hi>Memorie,</hi> sure saide I, gracious Dame</l>

            <l>It is but vaine, quoth she certes, for them thus to contende.</l>

            <l>Your powre and strength is little worth except I be your guide,</l>

With that they stayde and flong their speares, ech one out of his hand,</l>

            <l>And through the Dale amaine we rode, our horses for to trot.</l>

            <l>Of many things she put in minde, which she before did saye,</l>
            <l>And eke how these two champions had, ful many a Wight down cast,</l>
            <l>And eke how man was but a flowre, a bud or westerne blast.</l>
            <l>And so among much other talke, it came into my minde,</l>
            <l>Talking of Princes and of Kings, which yet was left behinde:</l>
            <l>To aske hir who succéeded next after in Britaine lande,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Marie</hi> succéeded <hi>Edward</hi> sure, a braunche of <hi>Henries</hi> blood,</l>
            <l>Though that hir reigne with <hi>Hesperus</hi> did Britaine land smal good.</l>
            <l>A noble Prince no doubt she was, respecting reigne and crowne,</l>
            <l>As reigning ouer such a lande, as beares so high renowne:</l>
            <l>And wise she was as such one coulde, so left in brothers steade,</l>
            <l>And wiser if she would haue sought, to be the supreme heade.</l>
            <l>But she cast downe that father raisde, which brother eke made sure,</l>
            <l>And set vp that which they cast downe, of all things most vnpure:</l>
            <l>Yet royally she ran hir race, as fancie did hir guide,</l>
            <l>And sure right godly was hir life, if knowledge had bene tride.</l>
            <l>A iust religious minde had she, but wanting skill of truth,</l>
            <l>Which caused in Britain land much wo, much wailing, paine &amp; ruth</l>
            <l>If thou wilt more said <hi>Memorie</hi> to me, of <hi>Maries</hi> raigne,</l>
            <l>The Actes and Monuments put forth, of that time show thée plaine:</l>

She séemed as yet to show a grace, that fatalls to defie,</l>
            <l>And with these Champions both she sought, as time did them descrie:</l>
            <l>But she alas was all to weake, for all the pompe she had,</l>
            <l>And all the helpe of <hi>Balams</hi> flocke, which prayed as they were mad.</l>
            <l>Which roared and bleared in euery route, that she had lost hir life,</l>

When clowdie night so darke and grim, was paste then we arose,</l>

            <l>When <hi>Cinthias</hi> hornes were hid, when <hi>Phaebus</hi> tooke his race?</l>
            <l>In glittring Chariot through the skies, fro Esterne throne apace.</l>

            <l>The chéere, the banquet and repast, the pastaunce and delight.</l>
            <l>She had a thousand merie tales, of stories past and gon,</l>

            <l>Sometime by trauayle I gan tyre, and was right dull in minde,</l>
            <l>But shée espying me, forthwith adrest some mirth to finde.</l>
            <l>So passing on with mery tales, and wauering thoughts of mée,</l>
            <l>We gan about the eleuenth houre, a pleasaunt fielde to sée.</l>
            <l>I should haue tolde first of the hill, where that the Forte did stande,</l>
            <l>Where we had lodgde all the night, right worthy to be scande.</l>
            <l>For on that hill the way laye right, a stréete bright, faire, and plaine,</l>
            <l>Much like the way that mountes the hil, <hi>Pernassus</hi> as they faine:</l>

            <l>Of all the places where I came, or aye haue séene to tell,</l>
            <l>To none I can compare this hill, whereon our iournay fell,</l>

            <l>My minde was so bereft with toyes, and fancies that I sawe,</l>

            <l>I was much lyke then as I thought, to some that I did knowe,</l>

            <l>To passe the fielde of barren <hi>Age,</hi> so much my minde did moue,</l>
            <l>That sore I was therewith dismayde, that <hi>(Will)</hi> no more to proue,</l>

            <l>Thus musing still the life to come, quoth <hi>Memorie</hi> beholde,</l>

            <l>That place is called <hi>Consumpsion,</hi> so emptie, voyde and bare,</l>
            <l>Which thou must passe, there is no way, thy selfe therefore prepare.</l>
            <l>Within that place the Champions are, which mindes thée to assayle:</l>

            <l>The night I meane of worldly cares, which many doe estéeme,</l>

            <l>This worldly vale and dungeon darke, doth man from life procure.</l>
            <l>Therfore quoth she, now let vs ride apace till we haue got</l>
