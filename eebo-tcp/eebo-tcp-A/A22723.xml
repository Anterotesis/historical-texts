            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and perceaue good brethren, that we are not made Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to be carefull for thys lyfe. For (as ſayth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoſtle) <note place="margin">1. cor. 15</note> yf we in this lyfe onelye doe beleue and truſt in god, then are we of all other the moſte wretched and miſerable.

For what other thynge doe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes care for, but onelye to eate, to drincke, to ſlepe, and to lyue voluptuouſlye? And euen ſuche are all they that thynke moore vppon theyr bodyes, then vppon theyre ſoules: that loue glottouye and lecherye, more then iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyce or chaſtitie. Therefore my dearelye beloued, ye muſte vnderſtand, and know
<pb facs="tcp:15841:16"/>
that we are made chriſtians, to thynke continually vppon the eternall world, &amp; reward that is to come: and to labor more for the ſoule, then for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodye.

we do good chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s workes. To hym it is ryght profitable to be called a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiane, that loueth chaſtitie, that exchueth ebriete, that abhorreth pride, and that as very poiſon doth reiect enui. He is a righte good Chriſten man, that ſtealeth not, that beareth no falſe witnes, that lyeth not, that vſeth no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury, that committeth no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultery, that doth frequente the churche, that doeth not taſte of his fruytes, vntyll he fyrſt haue offered part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto God, that doth pay his tythes yearelye, to be deſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amonge the nedy, that doth loue his curate, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth preiſtes, that loueth euery man as hym ſelfe, and hateth no man.

not onely a chriſten man that doth feare and exchewe as the ſwearde of Satan deceit full weyghtes &amp; double mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but chriſt him ſelf doth alſo dwell in hym. He is a good chriſtiane, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the churche, doth exhibite and offereth vp his offering and that after his poſſibilitie and ſubſtaunce, doth geue a peny, or a morſell of bread to ſome poore man: that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the pore into his houſe: that waſſheth the pore mens fete: that doth not only make no debate, but reduceth ſuch as are at diſcorde and ſtryfe, to vnitie and concorde: that doth ſhew reuerence, and the loue of vnfayned charitie vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to his frendes &amp; elders: that doth lyue chaſt, and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth

But he ſhall inuite nor call

brethren, the lorde doth ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>horte, and ſo admoniſh vs by the holy prophet to do almes dedes, that there is in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner no man ſo pore and nedy, that can excuſe hym ſelfe.

He ſayth not, geue hym a whole loafe, for perchaunce the pore man hath it not to geue, but he ſayth, breake it, that is to ſaye, yf thou be ſo nedye and pore, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou haſt but one lofe of bread, yet breake of a pece therof, &amp; geue it to the poore.

And therfore I praye you agayne and agayne, yea and lykewyſe I deſire you, that as he whyche would be maryed, dothe couet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to fynd hys ſpowſe a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, ſo in like maner, let him (vntil he be maried) kepe his virginitye, for yf he do not, he ſhal not accepte nor recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the benediction with hys ſpouſe. And ſo the ſcripture ſhalbe fulfylled in hym, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che <note place="margin">Pſa, 107</note> ſayeth, he would haue no benediction, &amp; it ſhalbe farre from hym. Nowe then yf pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naunce do not helpe, what
<pb facs="tcp:15841:59"/>
ſhall become of thys manne? Or what ſhalbe hys iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in tyme to come, that in thys worlde was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to receaue the benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to be bleſſed wyth his ſpouſe? And note this my bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren, yf they whych haue no wyues, throughe kepyng of concubines, or medling with other mens wyues be in ſo greate daunger, what ſhall they mooſte vnfortunates thynke of them ſelues, that perchaunce haue wiues, and yet committe adultery, and through a certayne madnes do deſpere of the iudgement of GOD, nor feare not the paynes of hell, nor deſire not the eternall reward. Uerely yf they were in true and per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect fayth, they would beleue
<pb facs="tcp:15841:59"/>
in God, and feare the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is to come. And this may wel be proued, that all ſuche do beleue and truſte more in man, then they do in God: for where they do ſee &amp; perceaue that men be, there they do feare to committe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, but to do it ſecretlye (where God doth ſee it) they feare not. But yf they had ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer ſo lytle a ſparke of true fayth, as they ſuffer not their ſeruantes to treſpas in their owne ſyghte and preſence: ſo woulde they not preſume to do and committe adulterye in the preſence and ſyght of the Lorde their God. But of theſe ſpeaketh the holy gooſt by the Prophet, The vnwiſe man ſayde in hys hearte and <note place="margin">pſal, 13, &amp;, 52,</note> mynde, there is no God. For
<pb facs="tcp:15841:60"/>
thys is wythout peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he beleueth not, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> there is a God, whych ſecret lye dothe thoſe thinges in gods ſyght and preſence, the which he feareth to do in the preſence and ſight of manne. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wretche knoweth not that the face and anger of God is vpon al thoſe that do <note place="margin">Pſal, 33,</note> euyll, to deſtroye them for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore. But perchaunce ſome do ſaye thus, howe can I, that throughe my greate buſyneſſe, or by the kynges commaundement am abſent from my wyfe ſo manye mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes or yeares kepe chaſti tye? Unto thys I may geue thys aunſwere, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne home vnto hys wife. But when I aunſwere the merchaunt ſo, he ſayeth, that
<pb facs="tcp:15841:60"/>
yf he leaue of the feate of mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chaundiſe, he ſhall not be able to lyue. The man of warre doth ſaye, yf I departe from the hooſte, the kynges maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie wyll be diſcontente wyth me. But vnto theſe a manne may ſaye, that yf he feare the kynge and vpon that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on retourneth not home to his owne wyfe, he oughte ſo to feare God, that he teache nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panye with none other mans: for as the kynge maye put hym to death that retur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth home from the hooſt to hys wyfe, without licence, ſo maye God punyſhe hym per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuallye, that beynge farre from hys wyfe, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth adulterye. I praye you good brethren, yf ſo be that any of you through your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb facs="tcp:15841:61"/>
buſynes, or by the kin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges commaundement be at ſome tymes farre from your wyues, why ſhoulde ye not lyue ſo longe in chaſtitye for the loue of God, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> welth and ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your ſoules. Doe thy buſyneſſe, and the Kynges commaundemente, inforce the for ſo many dayes not once to touche thy wyfe, and the loue and precepte of God ſhall not perſwade thee to touche none other mans? but I would that all they, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whyche for lucre ſake onelye and riches, and at the kinges commaundement do obſerue and kepe theſe thynges and diſſemble to kepe them for Gods ſake, ſhould knowe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yf penaunce do not ayde and helpe them, that, they (when

And becauſe there be certayn prei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtes (the which ſhuld prohibit and forbydde ſuch thynges) that enforce and compel men to drynke more than nedeth, let them from henſeforth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn to correct and to amend them ſelues, and ſo to chaſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other, that they whan they ſhal appeare before god, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not for theyr owne drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, and other mens to:

but that through their owne amendment, and the correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other, they may merit to come to the eternal &amp; euer laſting reward.
