         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>curſed it, and commanded that it ſhould be cut downe, and cast into the fire. If he dealt ſo with trees, that did beare no fruite at all, we may warrant and aſſure our ſelues, that he will curſe, cut downe, and cast into the fire that neuer ſhall be quenched, euery tree, that is, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man, that bringeth foorth ſuch fruits, as this tree beareth. If the Lord his curſe belongeth to a barren tree, that beareth no fruit, much more doth it belong, to thoſe trees, which bring foorth bad fruites. If trees that are vnprofitable, bicauſe they beare nothing but leaues, are fitter for the fire, then to trouble the earth, then much more thoſe trees that are ſo heauie loden, and ſo full of poyſon, that a man cannot touch one twig of them, but it killeth his ſoule and bodie, for euer. Such a tree is euerie one that beareth ſuch fruites in his life and manners, as this tree doth. No good Christian therefore, will delight &amp; pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the ſhadow of ſuch a tree, neither build his nest in any part, or branch of it: but rather will do his greatest indeuor to pull it downe. Do thou (good Christian) thy best, and be ſure the Lorde will take thy part. And howſoeuer earthlie iusticers, let ſlip their parts, and forget to do their duties, the Lord will neuer forget nor let ſlip his part. Heere thou ſeest Iustice hath faſtened his coard to the top of the tree, and Veritie is hacking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the roote, betweene them both to ouerthrowe it. Now if thou louest righteouſnes, and art a friende to truth, take their parts in this buſines, pull downe with Iustice, and ſtrike with Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, lend ech of them one of thy hands, and thy hart too, and keepe neither hart nor hand to thinke or to worke any maner of euill, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thee, to haue no hand, no eie, no foote, then wicked ones. Do thy best that this tree may be destroied heere in this world, whiles it is to day, leaſt to morrow thou be deſtroied, for not labouring about it. I meane not that thou ſhouldeſt rend this paper and caſt it in the fire, but that thou ſhouldest examine, thy owne hart and thy conſcience, to ſee
<pb facs="tcp:16494:5"/>
whether any root, branch or twig of ſuch a tree be there, and if thou ſhalt finde any, to plucke them out and to cast them into the fire. Otherwiſe thou haſt nothing elſe looke for, but euen that which made the figge tree to wither, to wit, the malediction and curſe of God. And although Couetouſnes heere doth keepe the roote, and Selfe-loue the top of the tree, yet there is not any fruite, that this tree beareth, that is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to bring foorth, as great and as tall a tree as this is, and alſo to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it, and throughly to load euery twig of it, that they bend and break, with ſuch poyſonfull and curſed fruits as theſe be. For the ſinnes of men are innumerable, as the ſands vpon the ſhore by the ſea ſide, and the ſtars of heauen. Who can tell ſaith the holie prophet, how often he offendeth?

But there was neuer théefe, nor traitour, more ſurely bounde, to be executed, and to loſe his life, then he will make ſure worke, and binde thée to thy owne conſumption and vtter vndooing, in body, goods, and name.

For euen as, when ſome great and huge fiſh, is drawen out of a riuer in a net, many ſmal ones, which are about him, are taken and drawn out with him: Right ſo, it is the Lords maner, not onely to tangle and to trap, within the infringible net, of his indignation &amp; heauy iudgements, the firſt authors, and chéefe bruers, and brochers of idolatrie, treaſon, trecherie, or any other kinde of euill whatſoeuer: But all thoſe alſo will he cenſure, with the ſame weight and meaſure of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which haue anie pleaſure in thoſe forbidden euils, and

are ſo far, from being offended, and gréeued at the ſame, that they wiſh in their harts, good ſucceſſe, and continuance vnto them. I will (ſaith the Lord) euen glue &amp; faſten vnto thy ſkales, the fiſhes of thy floods or riuers, and I wil draw thée out of the midſt of thy riuers, and all thy fiſhes ſhall ſticke vnto thée, &amp;c.

And ſo indéede it came to paſſe. Therefore it behooueth all men, to haue a good and ſure ground, for euery thing that they do, and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther companie drawe them, nor authoritie conſtraine them, nor feare to loſe goods, libertie, nor life, driue and compell them, to do that thing, which is directly againſt the worde, and will of God, and is by him abſolutely forbidden. And this is well woorth the marking, that the prophet doth cal men fiſhes, which are toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and tumbled, in the troubleſome waters, and waues of the world. For what els is this world, but a ſea, continually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted with fearce flouds, of infinite temptations, &amp; toſſed with ſtormes of innumerable troubles, and ſhaken with windes of al maner of vanities? Is there any Euripus, Syrtes, or Charyb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, that hath ſo many, and ſo monſtrous flouds, and dangerous waues, and that hath ſo ſundrie, and ſtormy motions, as this world hath? What vaſt gulph, what ſtrait and narrow ſea, is ſhaken with ſuch whirlewindes, and troubled with ſuch bluſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring blaſts, ſuch raging ſtormes, and cruel tempeſts, &amp; with ſuch thicke, blacke, and vncomfortable clouds, as this world is? There be in the ſea of this world, two chéefe and principal fiſhers, the one is Chriſt, our moſt ſwéete and only ſauiour: the other is the diuel, our moſt cruel, and deadly enimy. Chriſt doth fiſh for men, that he may giue them life, and ſaue them for euer: but the diuel doth fiſh for men, that he may bind them in the chaines of death, and deſtroy them for euer. The waters of the ſea of this world, are worldly riches, dignities, promotions, fleſhly luſts, and filthy pleaſures, &amp; they are like bitter and ſalt water, which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer quench a mans thirſt, but the more he drinketh, the thirſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he is. But the water of Chriſt, doth indéed quench the thirſt, of him that drinketh it, and doth laie the heate, of the luſtes, and lawleſſe deſires of the fleſh. For he himſelfe doth ſaie: That if a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:16494:74"/>
man drink of the water of this world, he ſhal thirſt again: But if he drinke of the water (ſaith he) that I wil giue him, he ſhall not<note place="margin">Ioh. 4. Luc. 16.</note> thirſt for euer. The rich man mentioned in the Goſpell, had his belly ful of the water of this world, but now he is tortured in the heate, and tormented in the flames of hell, &amp; ſhal be a thirſt there for euer: But poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> that ſought for the water of Chriſt, &amp; did drinke of it, is now in heauen, in the boſome of euerlaſting bleſſednes, and ſhall neuer be a thirſt any more. Chriſt doth fiſh for men, that he may draw them out of the bitter waters of this dangerous ſea, and that he may giue vnto them, the water of grace. But Chriſt doth fiſh with an angling rod, and an hooke, and he taketh few. But the diuell, that wicked and craftie fiſher, with his great, large, long, and broade nets, taketh and draweth vp great multitudes, and infinite numbers of fiſhes, which vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily giue themſelues vnto him, and do ſuffer him moſt eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to take them. Chriſt doth fiſh, that he may bring grace, and giue vnto them, whom he taketh, eternall life, and the fiſhes flie from him, they will not come néere him: And the diuell doth fiſh, that he may kill and deſtroy, and bring men into endleſſe, eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and remedileſſe, condemnations and torments, and the fiſhes run and flie to him. Chriſt as he walked by the ſea of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,<note place="margin">Matth 4.</note> with his angle tooke ſoure, <hi>Symon</hi> and <hi>Andrew, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn:</hi> but the diuell walking by the ſea of this world, may in as little ſpace and ſhort time, take foure thouſand. The diuel fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with a hooke, and doth catch many mo, then Chriſt doth take, the reaſon is, bicauſe his baite is ſwéeter, and more pleaſant to mans appetite, and doth better agrée with the depraued will and graceleſſe diſpoſition of man, then that baite which Chriſt vſeth, doth. The diuels baite, is voluptuouſnes, the foule pleaſures,<note place="margin">The diuels baite.</note> and rotten delights of the fleſh, worldly wealth at will, the vaine glory of the world, innumerable riches of all ſorts, power, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, vanitie, an inſatiable deſire to beare rule, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch others. The ſéelie poore fiſhes being deceiued with theſe baites, do neuer féele the hooke, vntill it ſticke ſo faſt in their iawes, that there is no ſcaping, but the diuell maketh a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, as of his owne.

                  <hi>MArcus Antoninus</hi> with an oration that he made, vpon<note place="margin">232</note> the death of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> is ſaid to haue greatly delighted the people of Rome, and that he mooued very many of them, to ſhed great ſtore of bitter teares, when he put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, of the great benefits, which they had fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> &amp; withal did ſhew them <hi>Caeſars</hi> garment, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his enimies, <hi>Caſſius</hi> &amp; <hi>Brutus,</hi> had ſlaine him, all full of blood: whereat they were ſo mightily mooued, that they expulſed the homicides out of the citie, ſo that they durſt not, if they woulde liue any longer, come néere it: And yet in theſe daies of ours, let come neuer ſo good, and heauenly an orator, with the oracles of God himſelfe, in his mouth, and ſhew moſt plainly, what Chriſt the redéemer of the world, hath done for man, and prooue that man hath receiued vnſpeakable, and innumerable benefits, by and through Chriſt, and declare what bitter teares of water and blood, did trickle downe his chéekes, and what déepe and deadly ſighes, with many fearfull and gréeuous grones, did riſe from his hart, before he came to the croſſe, and let him rip vp his paſſion ſtitch by ſtitch, as the holy booke, and diuine word, ſhall direct and leade him, and let him particularly ſhew, how, and where he was wounded, that he was beaten, ſpit vpon, crowned with thornes, nailed hand and foote to the croſſe, ſcorned and mocked of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16494:81"/>
the Iewes, and let him ſhew moſt liuely, the wicked and cruell Iewes imbrewing their hands in his blood, &amp; giuing him vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and gall to drinke: and who for all this will ſhed one teare, giue one grone, or ſigh once from the bottome of his hart? yea let the preacher declare and prooue, that, beſides the death and paſſion of his bodie, he ſuffered in his ſoule, the heauie wrath and indignation of his father, and the extreme tortures and torments of hell, for a time, no leſſe than the reprobates, that be there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, and no leſſe then, all we, by iuſt deſert, ſhould haue ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for euer, if Chriſt had not done it for vs: And who for al this, will driue out of the citie, not <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> that killed <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but thoſe horrible, abhominable, and moſt damnable ſins, for the which Chriſt was ſlaine? For ſo ſaith the ſcripture: He (ſaith the prophet, meaning Chriſt) was wounded for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.<note place="margin">Eſa. 53.</note> And a little after, the prophet bringeth in God himſelfe ſpeaking thus of Chriſt: For the ſinnes of my people haue I ſmitten him. And the Apoſtle telleth the Romanes the ſame<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> thing: Chriſt was giuen (ſaith he) for our offences. And to the Corinthians: Chriſt died for our ſinnes, according to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> The matter then being ſo plaine, that no man, high nor lowe, whoſoeuer, can cléere himſelfe of the death of Chriſt, but muſt néedes, will he, nill he, confeſſe that there is in him, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Chriſts arraignment, bitter paſſion, and curſed death, and that he is no leſſe giltie of the ſame his death and bloodſhedding, than thoſe that cried, Away with him, away with him, it is no reaſon, that he ſhould liue any longer: nor than thoſe, that did ſpit in his face, and nailed his hands and féete to the croſſe. It muſt needes followe, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was more beholding to his friends, than the ſonne of God is, to many thouſands of thoſe that do profeſſe his name: and <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> was more behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Romanes, which were ſo readie at one oration, to purge and cléere the citie, of homicides and murthers, than a great number of faithfull preachers of Chriſt be now, to infinite thouſands of their auditors, which are ſo far from abandoning and thruſting out of cities and towns, euen groſſe, vile, and moſt lothſome ſinnes, that in their owne priuate houſes, yea euen in their owne boſoms and bodies, they harbour, nouriſh, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them: although they heare euery day, the heauie iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and deſtroying wrath of God, denounced againſt them, not with a generall houering ouer their heads, at al aduentures,

as though no body were ſpoken to, but euen with a particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> toutching, and as it were an vnlacing of euery ſinne in it kind, to lay open the ſtinch and abhomination of the ſame, that men might (if they had grace) be aſhamed, and afeard, to ſtaine and to blemiſh themſelues with ſuch things, as the Lord vpon paine of condemnation, hath inhibited and forbidden: and yet all will not ſerue. No man, that will beleeue the holy ſcripture, can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this, that the almightie, did, with the heauie hand of his<note place="margin">Iob. 4. 18.</note> wrath, caſt angels out of heauen, when they were poiſoned with pride, and would not be contented with their owne eſtate, and<note place="margin">2.

And yet all theſe ſinnes, with infinite others, do in as bad maner, and no leſſe meaſure, ſwarme, raigne and reuell in England, than when they were at the woorſt, they did in Sodom. What ſequele then is to be feared, and daily to be looked for, with ſilence I paſſe ouer. There is neuer a man, that beareth the name of a Chriſtian, but he will confeſſe, that his great grandfather <hi>Adam,</hi> was expulſed, and thruſt out of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 3.</note> for eating one apple, forbidden him by the Lord, vpon paine of death: and yet that man, that with open mouth, will make that confeſſion, will euery day eate ſeuen apples, as bitter and as ſtraightly forbidden as that: and will he then, for eating ſeuen, thinke to ſcape better cheape, than his grandfather that did eate but one? No, no: the eater of ſeuen, ſhall finde the way, into euerlaſting life, as hard to enter, as the way into paradiſe, was to his grandfather, being once thruſt out, vnleſſe he ſpéedily, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and truly repent him, and giue ouer the eating, of ſuch fruits, as the Lord hath forbidden him.

And yet for all that, we procéede in our wickednes, and are woorſe and woorſe euerie day. So that we ſéeme to be that wicked crue, and pack of fooles, mentioned by the prophet, which haue ſaid in their harts, there is no God. Thoſe mariners, and méere idolaters, which were<note place="margin">Pſalm. 14.

We do nothing for gods ſake, nothing of conſcience, nothing of loue, all our actions (the Lord amend it) do ſauour and ſmell of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. It is to be feared, that were it not, for vaine glory ſake, and to haue commendations and praiſes of men, verie few would do any good: and were it not, for feare of ſhame, or puniſhment, few would abſtaine from any ſinne.

Children in theſe daies, thinke it great wiſedome, to controule, yea to ſcorne, and to diſobey their parents, elders, and ſuperiors: To murther is manlines: to commit adulterie, and fornication, is but a tricke of youth: to ſteale, a pretie ſleight: to beare falſe witnes, is counted a gainful trade, and ſerueth finely to pleaſure a fréend: and as for coueting another mans houſe, his wife, his ſeruant, his maide, his oxe, aſſe, or any thing that he hath, it is ſo common, as houſes be in England, yea in London, where they ſtande neereſt one to another. What then, ſhall the Lords mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, meſſengers, and preachers, keepe ſilence, giue ouer their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ceaſe vtterly to crie out againſt ſinne?

Againe, the harts of al men are in the hands of God, as he made them of nothing, now they are made to conuert men from ſinne: Let all the ſeruants, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, in this caſe trie, what they can do with the Lorde, and neuer giue ouer calling vpon him, for their ſaluation, if it be his will to grant it.

And if thou for thy part, wilt begin &amp; euen ſtriue to be the firſt, thou ſhalt do well. Wed thou thy ſelfe, as in déede we all ought, to do the will of God, whatſoeuer it coſt thée: ſomthing for my ſake, thy poore brother in Chriſt, that moſt déerely doth loue thée in the Lord Ieſu: and ſomthing for thy ſoules ſake, to kéepe it out of hell, and that it may come to heauen: but eſpecially for Gods ſake, to whom thou oweſt all obedience, and ſo ſhall I thinke my paines well beſtowed, and be ready all the daies of my life, to labour ſtill, to do thée good. Loue to thée in Chriſt Ieſu, hath conſtrained me, to ſend abroad this little booke of Similies, to let thée know, that I wiſh well to thée, and that I daily deſire, and beſéech the almightie, that ſinne may be deſtroied, and that the feare of God may euer poſſeſſe thée, dwell in thy hart, and floriſh in thy hands. True it is (good reader) that we ought to deſire, to liue no longer, than we haue a care to liue well, and that the whole courſe of our liues, may be acceptable to God: That is the Apoſtles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">2.

And a little after, the ſame Apoſtle ſaith: that Chriſt<note place="margin">2.
