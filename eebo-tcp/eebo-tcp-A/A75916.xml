            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Advice about the New <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Stock, in a Letter to a Friend.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have received yours of the 14th. Inſtant, requiring me to give you an Account of what hath paſſed at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> about the Affairs of the <hi>Eaſt-India-Company,</hi> and my Opinion of the New Joynt-Stock lately ſubſcribed, and whether I would adviſe you to be concerned in it. You might certainly have made Choice of ſome other of your Friends here, who would have been able to give you better Satisfaction therein than I can do; But our Friendſhip ties me to oblige you not only in this, but in all that you ſhall command me.</p>
            <p>The Old <hi>Eaſt-India-Company</hi> are to Morrow to hear before a Committee of the Houſe of Commons, the ſeveral Complaints which are ſaid will be proved againſt them, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sixteen Articles drawn up by the pretenders to a New Company, who are thoſe that proſecute them, and not their own Members as you have been miſinform'd, except it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ſome few who have ſold their Stocks for that purpoſe, and now think they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd of their Oath, making themſelves therein their own Caſuiſts, which let them look to.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble you with our various Diſcourſes here about theſe matters, but give you my Opinion of the New Stock becauſe you deſire a ſpeedy Anſwer fearing you may be excluded.</p>
            <p>It is promoted by a great many of the Companies Factors who have in their Service got great inſtates in <hi>India,</hi> but chiefly by the <hi>Interlopers,</hi> who are ſworn Enemies to them; thoſe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſt having failed of their Proſits they propos'd to themſelves in their Trade to <hi>India</hi> by the Companies aſſerting the right of their Charter, which now they hope to revenge upon them by their Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Theſe Gentlemen, as I hear, pretend to be Incorporated by Act of Parliament, with a Stock of Two Millions, to carry on the Trade to <hi>India,</hi> and give out that they may with ſuch a Fund ſetled by Law, command two or three Millions more at Intereſt, or more, if their Deſigns ſhould require it. With this vaſt Treaſure they ſay, they may in time Command the whole Trade of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> to the Excluſion of the <hi>Dutch, French, Portugals</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> and may ſoon call the firſt of them to an Account for the ſurprizal of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and ſet up our Ancient Right to the <hi>Spice Iſlands</hi> as a juſt pretence to make War upon them, and ſo wholly extirpate them out of all <hi>India.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, Sir, are mighty things, but in my Opinion not practicable, and I believe not in yours neither, but all projectors make a great noiſe to favour their undertakings.</p>
            <p>And after all I am inform'd, that many conſidering Perſons, begin to be very cool in the Matter as to the Eſtabliſhing by a Law ſuch a New Company, although they were at firſt great Favourers of it, not knowing of what fatal Conſequence it might hereafter prove to this Nation, to entruſt an <hi>Eaſt-India Committee</hi> with the command of ſo Vaſt a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, with which they may at any time ſet up to be Arbitrators of the Affairs of <hi>England,</hi> and command the Government both as to the Monarchy and the Church alſo. For the King with the Revenue of the Civil Liſt cannot Vye Treaſure with them, and Money you know commands all. Beſides, I hear, that the Chief Men among the Diſſenters from our Church are deeply concern'd in the New Subſcription, which might give no unreaſonable Jealouſie that that Party may have form'd this Deſign to change the Government hereafter into a Commonwealth, which they have ſo long, and do continually thirſt after.</p>
            <p>To tell you therefore my Thoughts of this matter I believe the great Wiſdom of the Parliament will reject the Eſtabliſhing of ſuch a New Company, for theſe and many other good Reaſons. But if ſuch a thing ſhould be done, I ſhall give you timely Notice that you come in if you deſire it. I am</p>
