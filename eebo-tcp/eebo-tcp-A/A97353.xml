            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THese Papers were written ſome of them in 1668. and ſome ſince, when the Nonconformiſts Judgement of the Intereſt of Reaſon in Religion was printed, with but 15 ſubſcribed names: Thoſe about <hi>Grace and Morality,</hi> and <hi>Things indifferent,</hi> and <hi>what our Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity is not,</hi> were alſo peruſed by many and conſented to (of whom Doctor <hi>Manton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sanger</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> are ſince dead) and with that of <hi>Scandal</hi> were printed many years ago. But my prudent friends perſwaded me to lay them by, (though the printing coſt dear) partly as not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elaborate and accurate, and partly leſt any defence ſhould but exaſperate our (then) afflicters, and occaſion more wrath and unpeaceable writings. This Counſel I have till now obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But ſeeing ſuch as the <hi>Counterminer,</hi> the <hi>Popiſh Dialogue</hi> and many others, continuing loudly to accuſe us, and make men believe that we are plotting a new war, and that our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are rebellious, and remembring what a ſuſpicion of us is left on record in the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act of Confinement, and hearing by the Publiſhed Narratives of <hi>Oates, Bedlow, Prance, Jeniſon, Smith, Dugdale,</hi> and ſpecially <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> that it was <hi>part of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:194351:3"/> 
               <hi>the Plot for the deſtruction of the King, and change of Government and Religion,</hi> to make <hi>King and People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> that the <hi>Presbyterians had ſuch a Plot,</hi> and finding ſo little ſaid to vindicate the Innocent, and laſtly finding great reaſon to think that my change is ſo near, that I muſt do it now or never, I durſt not die in the guilt of ſilence. 1. Leſt I ſhould betray the King into a belief of this pernicious plotted ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. 2. Leſt I ſhould betray the Nation into a ſelf-deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing belief of ſeditious Liars. 3. Leſt I ſhould betray both the Reputation and Lives of many thouſand Innocents. What diſmal effects muſt needs follow, if the King ſhould believe that ſo many of his People and Parliament as are thus accuſed, are his enemies and ſeek his hurt? Whilſt the odious and horrid uſage of his Father is in his memory, who can wonder if he deſtroy thoſe who he believeth would deſtroy him?</p>
            <p>Therefore though this Book be truly guilty of much defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveneſs, diſorder, repetitions, being but many Papers written on ſeveral occaſions, long ago, now ſet ſome how haſtily toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neceſſity conſtraineth me to think that it is better <hi>thus</hi> than not <hi>at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have already publiſhed the firſt part of <hi>our Plea,</hi> written ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years after almoſt all this: which you muſt eſpecially obſerve when you read, <hi>What our Nonconformity is not:</hi> For then I thought to go no further. That about <hi>ſcandal</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> by <hi>accident</hi> was written purpoſely to anſwer the groſs miſtaking charge of <hi>B. Morley,</hi> and the new <hi>Eccleſ. Politician,</hi> juſt when that Book came out; and ſomewhat occaſioned by <hi>Mr. Durels Book:</hi> Therefore that I am there ſo diſtinct as will be troubleſome to common readers who love but few words, was long of the quality and charge of the learned accuſers whom I anſwer.</p>
            <p>I thought it time to ſpeak the Truth in how broken a manner ſoever, when I read that even ſome that ſeem to condemn the
<pb facs="tcp:194351:3"/> Papiſts Plotters, do yet publickly joyn us with them, as more dangerous than they, and make our deſigned Rebellion to be a <hi>Neceſſitating Reaſon,</hi> for doing that <hi>againſt us, againſt Parliaments,</hi> and the <hi>Peoples choice of them,</hi> which I dread to mention; as if it were neceſſary to all Loyal Subjects to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a League, or ſubſcribed Covenant to ſave the King from us.</p>
            <p>It is now about twenty years ſince <hi>Dr. Gauden, Mr. Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and my ſelf preached at a Faſt to the Parliament for Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and the King the next morning was voted home to his Crown and Government: and ſince the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> cauſed the Printing of <hi>Mr. Gaches</hi> Letter to me for the King. What is it that we have Preached, Printed or done ever ſince to this day that ſhould bring us under this horrid accuſation? Have we been proved guilty before any Judge? Beſides Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel (to which we were devoted, and dare not for fear of ſacriledge and perſidiouſneſs caſt off) what have we done theſe twenty years againſt the King or State? Vnleſs it be our crime to live under reproach and ſcorn and poverty, and ſometimes impriſonments, and never once ſo much as Petition a Parliament either to pity us, or to hear us once ſpeak for our ſelves, and give us leave to tell them or the Nation the true caſe and reaſons of our Not-Conforming. What is it that we have ſaid or done? and how came our accuſers to be ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to us as never to call us before the Judicatures, for any thing but <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>coming within five miles</hi> of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, or ſome for not communicating with them, which yet other of us never refuſed? If any odde perſons, or whoſoever have ſaid or done any thing againſt the King or Kingdom, or their neighbours right or peace, or have been guilty of any fraud, drunkenneſs, perjury or immorality, beſides their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable Nonconformity, let them be puniſhed as the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, but let not the Innocent, yea thouſands be ſlandered and deſigned to deſtruction for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I never yet was by
<pb facs="tcp:194351:4"/> any abuſed, or hurt, but I was accuſed by them as deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it.</p>
            <p>Our accuſations are, 1. That we are Presbyterians and Fanaticks. 2. That we began the War in 1641, and 1642. 3. That we deſtroyed the King. 4. That our Principles are diſloyal. 5. That we are plotting a rebellion. To all theſe.</p>
            <p>I. What a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> is with theſe men is to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable; what he is with thoſe that have written <hi>for and againſt</hi> them is eaſily known; we take <hi>Dr. Heylins Deſcription</hi> in his Hiſtory againſt them: They are ſuch as hold not only Church Government without <hi>Biſhops</hi> (for ſo do the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents alſo) but alſo by Presbyteries, conſiſting of two ſorts of Elders, Preaching and Ruling (called by ſome <hi>Lay)</hi> and over th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>ſe <hi>Claſſes,</hi> and over theſe a <hi>National Aſſembly,</hi> conſiſting of the ſame two ſorts. Be it known that whiles I diſown any thing of this, it is not that I think my ſelf wiſer or better than ſuch as I have been acquainted with of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. My own opinion I have oft enough declared, <hi>viz. 1.</hi> That <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> one Church hath no Governing Power over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 2. That every particular Political Church ſhould be a ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety capable of perſonal preſential communion, and have their own Elders to govern them all of one Order and Office, and if each one have a Biſhop that ſhall have a Preſidency and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or Negative voice, I ſhall like it the better, for Antiquity ſake, and Vnity. 3. That theſe Churches ſhould keep ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary correſpondency for Love, Concord, and mutual helps, by Meſſengers and Synods of their Biſhops or Paſtors; but not as Law-makers to their brethren. 4. That it will not be unmeet for the Magiſtrate, or if he permit it, for the Biſhops or Paſtors by conſent to appoint ſome of the wiſeſt and graveſt and beſt, to viſit and overſee the reſt of the Paſtors and Churches in ſeveral Precincts, ſo far as to teach the young and ignorant, and exhort them to holy, prudent diligence, and reprove them that are blame-worthy, but not to have the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing power of the Sword.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:194351:4"/> But it is not my <hi>judgment</hi> only that is in queſtion, Reader, judge by the proof that I ſhall offer thee what truth or modeſty there is in our accuſers.</p>
            <p>1. I have elſwhere told you, when the King called us to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our deſires in 1660. the Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> were commonly invited to come to <hi>Sion Colledge</hi> that their common conſent might be known: And there we agreed to deſire or offer nothing for Church Government, but <hi>A. B. Uſhers</hi> model of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Epiſcopal Government as it was then Printed (which to me the <hi>A. Biſhop</hi> owned) And was <hi>Uſher</hi> a Presbyterian? What new names have our adverſaries made, as <hi>Presbyterian A. Biſhops and Primates?</hi> Are not all the Dioceſes, Lordſhip, Wealth and Power of Biſhops ſecured in that Model, and is that Presbytery?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Biſhop Reignolds, B. Worth,</hi> and <hi>Dr. Wallis</hi> and other Conformiſts agreed and joyned with us in this Offer. And were theſe alſo Presbyterians?</p>
            <p>3. When his Majeſty would not grant us that model, nor the Biſhops once treat about it, he was pleaſed in his gracious Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration about <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Affairs</hi> to offer and preſcribe the Epiſcopacy of <hi>England</hi> as it ſtood, with little alteration, ſave that the Pariſh Miniſters conſent was allowed to the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any in his Pariſh, and the Rural Dean with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of his Deanery to meet oft for meer Pariſh perſwaſive work, to the ſcandalous. And this Declaration we joyfully and thankfully accepted, as a hopeful means of common Conformity and Concord. And was this Presbytery too?</p>
            <p>4. That this might might not paſs as the private Act of a few, a meeting of the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters was deſired to give the King thanks for this Declaration in ſignification of their conſent, which was done, and at that meeting there were but two diſſenting Votes, and thoſe two (both dead) profeſſed their thankful acceptance, though they ſubſcribed not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:194351:5"/> 5. Vncontradicted fame told us that the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons gave the King their publick thanks for that his care ſo to unite his people. And if that Houſe of Commons alſo were Presbyterians, I know not who is not.</p>
            <p>6. And I never heard that any of all theſe conſenting and ſubſcribing Miniſters recanted his conſent to this day.</p>
            <p>7. Nor did Iever hear that any abſent Miniſters in City or Countrey, ſent us any notice that they diſſented. Only ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Dr. Conant</hi> who no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Conformeth, at one meeting ſaid, <hi>Our attempts for reconciliation with that party were vain, as to reconcile fire and water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Abundance of Countrey Miniſters, (and all that ever I heard from) joyfully expreſſed their approbation of what we did.</p>
            <p>9. In all the County of <hi>Worceſter</hi> where I lived there was but one Miniſter <hi>(Mr. Tho. Hall</hi> of <hi>Kings Norton)</hi> taken for a Presbyterian from the year 1647. till the King came in, 1660. Nor did I hear of many out of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> that ever ſet up that Government.</p>
            <p>10. I know not of one Congregation now in <hi>London</hi> of Engliſh men (the French and Dutch are not accuſed as plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) that exerciſeth the Presbyterian Government, nor ever did ſince the King came home: what they may be in <hi>ſecret judgement</hi> I know not, nor how far the <hi>experience of our late Prelacy</hi> may <hi>have changed any;</hi> But, 1. Certainly they have <hi>no National aſſembly:</hi> 2. They have no <hi>Claſſes:</hi> 3. They have no <hi>coalition of many Churches</hi> to make a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</hi> 4. And I hear of none (unleſs perhaps the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, which I know not) that have ſo much as <hi>Ruling Lay Elders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Set all this together and tell me whether it be likely that thoſe men believe a life to come and a judgement of God, who would make King and people believe that <hi>Parliaments, Non-conforming Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>their hearers</hi> are <hi>Presbyterians,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:194351:5"/> and <hi>ſo many</hi> and <hi>ſo bad</hi> as that King and Kingdom are in danger of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> As to the ſecond point of <hi>the late War,</hi> it's unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able here to ſay any more but this, 1. The <hi>King</hi> hath ſaid ſo much for the <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi> that it's no ſign of Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and peace to violate it. 2. Though falſe reporters ſay, that <hi>the Papiſts were the Kings party,</hi> and the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians the Parliaments</hi> at the <hi>beginning of the Engliſh war,</hi> (not medling with <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland)</hi> the contrary is ſo well known to men yet living, that the Reporters can hope to ſeduce none but <hi>young men</hi> and <hi>ſtrangers.</hi> I again deſire him that would know the truth, but to read <hi>Ruſhworths Collections</hi> and <hi>Heylins life of Laud,</hi> and the <hi>names</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Lord Lieutenants</hi> and <hi>Commanders,</hi> and ask thoſe what they were that knew them: <hi>Heylin</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you that the quarrel was long growing up between two <hi>parties</hi> of the <hi>Epiſcopal Church:</hi> of which he maketh in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Arch-Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> the Head, and the Convocation there to follow him; and in <hi>England, Arch-Biſhop Abbot</hi> to be the Head, and Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> to be the Head of the other party, and a very few Biſhops at firſt to follow him; ſo that the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> (if the Convocation be the Church) were on the ſide that <hi>Laud diſſented from;</hi> And the <hi>Parliaments</hi> went the way of the <hi>Church</hi> as then they called it, and one after another continued accuſing the other ſide, 1. as <hi>promoting popery, 2.</hi> and <hi>Arminianiſm, 3.</hi> and <hi>arbitrary abſoluteneſs;</hi> againſt <hi>Law, priviledges, Liberty and property:</hi> And where former Parliaments left, that of 1640. began, and between theſe two parties of the Church of <hi>England</hi> it was that the war began, and not between Papiſts and Presbyterians, (though the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts in Ireland</hi> began there). The <hi>Papiſts</hi> were but <hi>Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries</hi> to the King, and <hi>moſt</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterians Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> long after the beginning of the war. By God great mercy there are yet living the truly
<pb facs="tcp:194351:6"/> worthy and Right Honourable Lords, the <hi>Earl of Bedford firſt General of the Horſe,</hi> and the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Radnor, Lord Preſident</hi> of his <hi>Majeſties Council,</hi> a <hi>Colonel then</hi> in the <hi>Earl of Eſſex's Army,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> (and the <hi>Lord Hollis</hi> is but lately dead) Ask theſe faithful Lords yet living whether the <hi>Earl of Eſſex,</hi> or any four or five of all his Colonels were Nonconformiſts, or any <hi>two</hi> of them <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> But of this elſewhere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> As to the death of the King, I have in the times of uſurpation, proved that the Presbyterians deteſted it. That it was a proud conquering Army, by the Contrivance of <hi>Ol. Cromwel,</hi> and the applauſe of a <hi>few fanaticks</hi> that did it by the conſent of a <hi>ſmall part</hi> of the <hi>old Parliament</hi> called The <hi>Rump,</hi> that durſt not truſt the King in power: That they could never do it till, 1. They had new modelled the Army, and got out the <hi>Earl of Eſſex's Souldiers,</hi> and <hi>all the Parliament men</hi> ſave <hi>Cromwel;</hi> 2. Till they had firſt driven away the <hi>Eleven accuſed members; (Hollis, Stapleton, Maynard,</hi> &amp;c.) 3. Till they had got all the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades</hi> and <hi>Gariſon Souldiers</hi> beſides disbanded, leſt they ſhould reſiſt them. 4. Till they had forcibly impriſoned a great part of the worthieſt members of the Parliament, and kept and caſt out the moſt of the Houſe, and left only the foreſaid ſmaller remnant. 5. Till they had conquered the City by ſudden ſurprize; when <hi>Maſſy, Hollis, Brown</hi> and others tryed to have armed the City againſt them. 6. Till they had conquered <hi>Scotland,</hi> and their Armies. 7. The <hi>London</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters went to the General to charge him to reſiſt it. 8. They printed their abhorrence of it to the world. And Mr. <hi>Love</hi> was beheaded and others impriſoned and fled beyond Sea. 9. I have reaſon to believe that <hi>Monks</hi> Army that reſtored the King had twenty if not forty times as many Presbyterians in it, as the Earl of <hi>Eſſex's</hi> Army had when the war began. 10. The <hi>London</hi> Presbyterians and Sir <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> Lord Mayor
<pb facs="tcp:194351:6"/> were they that turned the Scales for the King by inviting <hi>Monk</hi> and declaring their conjunction with him. 11. What the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians did with Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> and what Miniſters were impriſoned for it, and other ſuch things I need not report. 12. As ſoon as ever the members of the old Parliament were reſtored, they took effectual care for the Kings reſtitution: eſpecially the Council which they ſettled and left. The Right Honourable the <hi>Earls of Angleſea, and Shaftesbury,</hi> and many others yet living can tell you enough of this: And if you believe not me, beſides the forementioned worthy Lords, ask the worthy <hi>Maſter of the Rolls</hi> Sir <hi>Harbottle Grimſtone,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Maynard</hi> his <hi>Majeſties Serjeant at Law,</hi> who were eminent members of the foreſaid Parliament, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or any other of them yet living, whether the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Presbyterians and Nonconformiſts when the war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, or Conformable members of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and they can reſolve you.</p>
            <p>IV. But <hi>if</hi> all this had been otherwiſe, muſt this age an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for their fathers deeds? What's all this to the <hi>preſent Nonconformiſts,</hi> of whom I do not believe there is one of 40. now alive that had any hand in any wars againſt the King? Are the Hollanders or French guilty of it becauſe they <hi>are Presbyterians?</hi> If not, why are the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> will <hi>Names</hi> make men Traytors? If ſo, do not they make us Traytors who falſly gave us thoſe names? Either they muſt prove that we <hi>hold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious principles,</hi> or they ſhew that they do but <hi>in Plot accuſe us.</hi> Therefore I have thought it my duty to give this account of our Principles as far as they are known to me.</p>
            <p>In 1649. I wrote a Book called <hi>Political Aphoriſmes,</hi> in which, 1. I aſſerted the <hi>Univerſal Monarchy of God,</hi> 2. The <hi>Preheminence of Monarchy before Democracy</hi> againſt <hi>Mr. Harington's Oceana,</hi> 3. The way <hi>to ſecure a</hi> pious <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy;</hi> 4. And I added the <hi>reaſons why I then had adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Parliament,</hi> out of a deſire of conviction if I had
<pb facs="tcp:194351:7"/> erred: But for great Reaſons I have ſince deſired that the book be taken as <hi>non ſcriptus.</hi> But what I judge undenyable I here declare.</p>
            <p>Were ſin and madneſs any wonder in the world, it were a wonder that <hi>England</hi> is not as happy and concordant a Nation as any under heaven. God hath kept us from taſting of thoſe miſerable wars, which have diſtreſſed many other Nations: God loudly calleth us to peace: old and ſad experience of the miſchiefs of war, do call unto all that are in their wits if poſſible to avoid it. The militant Nations round about us, have left us to ſweet peace. But ſin, folly and pride, will not conſent: How many years have we begg'd for peace, of thoſe that ſhould have been the preachers and wiſeſt promoters of peace, and cannot yet obtain it, nor quiet them that call for fire and ſword, not knowing what ſpirit they are of? A miſerable Nation's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of confuſions, prayeth <hi>for the King and all in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and honeſty:</hi> and the <hi>Declaration about Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical affairs</hi> telleth us that the King would have given the people Peace: but with unpeaceable Clergymen, no plea, no petition could prevail. The things that have been, are; and the confuſions of our age have come from the ſame cauſes and ſorts of men, as the confuſions in former ages did; which in an <hi>Abridgement of Church Hiſtory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I have lately opened: we rejoyce with <hi>Paul</hi> that Chriſt is preached: but alas, that ſo many preach him not ſincerely, of good will and love, but in envy, ſtrife and contention, to add affliction to the afflicted, <hi>Phil. 1. 15, 16, 17, 18.</hi> We are all bound; if it be <hi>poſſible,</hi> and as much as in us lyeth, to live peaceably, yea to follow peace with all men: <hi>Rom. 12. 18. Heb. 12. 14.</hi> But none are more obliged to it than Princes that muſt preſerve the peoples peace, and Chriſtian Paſtors that ſhould preach it.</p>
            <p>Mans ſoul hath three faculties, <hi>underſtanding, will,</hi> and <hi>executive vital power:</hi> The Image of God on theſe three is 1. holy knowledge, faith or Light, 2. Holy Love, 3. and holy Life.
<pb facs="tcp:194351:7"/> The Devils Image is the contrary to theſe three, 1. In dark ignorance, error and unbelief, 2. In malignant enmity to good things and perſons; 3. In deadneſs to good, and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or evil works. Therefore the Devil is deſcribed by Chriſt, 1. As the Prince of darkneſs and deceit, 2. As the enemy of God and Goodneſs and good men, and, 3. As a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer. And ſo he is called <hi>A Lyar, A malignant enemy</hi> and <hi>A Murderer:</hi> And by theſe properties his children may be known, whatever they profeſs.</p>
            <p>I unfeignedly declare that I wiſh no <hi>cruelty</hi> againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor <hi>any hurt</hi> but what the neceſſary ſafety of thoſe whom <hi>they</hi> would <hi>hurt</hi> requireth: But I muſt ſay that their Canons and their writings and practices have had ſo much of theſe three properties, <hi>Lying, malignity againſt good men,</hi> and <hi>hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> and <hi>bloody cruelty,</hi> that the nature which God hath planted in me, is no more reconcileable to it, than to the life of high-way robbers. And let who will make a prudent trial, and I am confident he will find as I have done, that on whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you find theſe three Diabolical Symbols or properties, <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Malice</hi> and <hi>Bloody-hurtfulneſs</hi> againſt men that are moſt ſerious and practical Chriſtians, they will prove either <hi>open</hi> or <hi>ſecret Papiſts,</hi> or by <hi>nearneſs</hi> much prepared for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Could they be content to forbear DOMINION and BLOODINESS, we might live quietly with them as with other erroneous men. But how can that be hoped for while their Religion eſſentially is,</hi> 1. That all Chriſtian Princes <hi>and</hi> People on earth, muſt be the obedient ſubjects of their Pope, or elſe be no members of the Church of Chriſt? 2. <hi>That</hi> approved General Councils muſt be believed and obeyed, <hi>of which (beſides others) that at the</hi> Lateran ſub Innoc. 3. obligeth all temporal Lords on pain of <hi>EXCOMMVNICATION, DEPOSITION and DAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATION to</hi> exterminate all their Proteſtant ſubjects
<pb facs="tcp:194351:8"/> if they are able, <hi>(and other Canons and Decrees are for burning them) And he that</hi> underſtandingly profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Papiſt, profeſſeth both theſe.</p>
            <p>As I have here deſcribed the judgment of ſuch Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts as I have converſed with (not undertaking for every odd perſon whom I know not) I do deſire thoſe that ſeek our blood and ruine by the falſe accuſation of Rebellious principles, to tell me if they can <hi>[what body or party of men on earth have more ſound</hi> and <hi>Loyal principles</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>obedience.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> If they ſay <hi>the Papiſts,</hi> Let them read <hi>H. Fowlis hiſtory of them,</hi> and <hi>Biſhop Barlows recitations of multitudes of their Doctors,</hi> and my <hi>Abridgement of Church Hiſtory,</hi> and then believe it if they can: The world knoweth that the Papiſts ſet <hi>two ſuperiors</hi> over Kings, 1. <hi>The Pope</hi> and <hi>his Councils,</hi> who have decreed it to be the <hi>Henrician Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Simony</hi> to hold ſo much as <hi>Princes Power of Inveſting Biſhops,</hi> and that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath not power <hi>pro meritis</hi> to depoſe them. 2. The <hi>People</hi> are commonly made by their Divines and Politicks the <hi>Givers</hi> of the <hi>Princes power,</hi> who ſhould not ſo much as <hi>tolerate him</hi> if he be an Infidel or Heretick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> Is it the <hi>Church of England</hi> only whoſe Principles they prefer? 1. Wherein do we differ from them? Do we not ſubſcribe their Articles, Canons and Homilies as to civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? And if we ſubſcribe not the <hi>New Covenant or Profeſſion,</hi> for the Phraſes <hi>[Any Commiſſioned]</hi> and <hi>[on any pretence whatſoever]</hi> that proveth no <hi>Doctrinal</hi> difference from <hi>them,</hi> that ſubſcribe them only in a ſenſe which we never were againſt, and who would not do it, if they underſtood them properly. 2. Were <hi>B. Jewel, Bilſon,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Hooker,</hi> none of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> were not the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Convocation</hi> in <hi>A. B. Abbots</hi> days, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative Church of <hi>England?</hi> Were not the Parliaments
<pb facs="tcp:194351:8"/> that followed them of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Was it only <hi>Dr. Sibthorp</hi> and <hi>Dr. Mainwaring</hi> and a few ſuch cried down by Parliaments and Prelates that were the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Doth not <hi>B. Bramhall</hi> own <hi>Grotius</hi> as deſigned for preferment in this Church? 3. And are not the worthy Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Clergy, and Parliament, who are yet againſt the Principles of <hi>Sibthorp</hi> and <hi>Mainwaring</hi> part of the Church of <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It may be you will ſay</hi> [All the Nonconformiſts be not <hi>of</hi> your principles, <hi>and</hi> what then is this <hi>to</hi> excuſe <hi>the</hi> reſt?] <hi>And many talk of one</hi> Goodman <hi>and</hi> Buchanan <hi>in</hi> Scotland, <hi>and of</hi> Vindiciae contra Tyrannos <hi>(falſly charged on</hi> Beza, <hi>and written by</hi> Hubert Languet.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> And indeed, are all the Church of <hi>England</hi> of one mind? Are they all of <hi>Sibthorps</hi> mind on one ſide? Or are they all of <hi>Jewel, Hooker</hi> and <hi>Bilſons</hi> mind on the other ſide? Did they not differ when moſt followed <hi>Abbot</hi> (the refuſer of <hi>Sibthorps</hi> book,) and the reſt followed Biſhop <hi>Laud?</hi> and when the two parties began the war, were they all of the mind of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> who was a Commander in armes for the Parliament? Shew us the doctrine of the Church for Loyalty which we receive not, and wherein in this we come behind you. Do all the Church of <hi>England</hi> agree with Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dodwel,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Heylin?</hi> Read this mans Hiſtory of the Reformation, and ſee how he expoſeth it to ſcorn? Read his hiſtory of Presbytery, and his life of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and tell as whether you are all of that mind. There is a Papiſt that hath written an <hi>Hiſtorical Collection</hi> of the horrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of the Engliſh Reformation almoſt all <hi>verbatim</hi> out of Dr. <hi>Heylins Hiſtory,</hi> half as reproachful as <hi>Philanax Anglicus;</hi> or the <hi>Image of both Churches,</hi> or any that a <hi>Pateſon</hi> or a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> could have written. Yet this was a Dr. of the Church? I do not think that all the Church will joyn with Biſhop <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal</hi> &amp; Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> in the Vindication of <hi>Grotius</hi> as a Proteſtant, who writeth for <hi>Romes common Miſtriſhip,</hi> and for belief
<pb facs="tcp:194351:9"/> of the <hi>Doctrine of all the General Councils,</hi> even that of <hi>Trent.</hi> I do not think you all hold that our Reformers followed the meaſure of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> though ſome ſay ſo? Nor that you all blame the caſting of Images out of the Churches as much as Dr. <hi>Richard Cox</hi> did in his epiſtle to <hi>Caſſander?</hi> Was the ſharp Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whitgift</hi> and the reſt that were for the <hi>Lambeth</hi> Articles, and our great Divines that went to <hi>Dort,</hi> and the Parliaments that decryed <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> of the ſame mind as Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud, Neal, Buckeridge, Corbet and Mountague?</hi> Why then do you tell us of an odd diſſenter, or of ſects that we own not, or expect that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us there ſhould be no differences? Are we not men?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> Is it the Principles of the <hi>Old Greeks and Romans</hi> which you prefer before ours? If you never read them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not me, but believe <hi>Hobbes</hi> and multitudes of other ſorts that ſay, They moſtly hated Kings; and even <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato, Cicero, Plutarch,</hi> &amp;c. took it for a meritorious act to kill tyrants: (and whom did they mean?) Of all men ſet not them before us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IV.</hi> Is it the <hi>new Philoſophers;</hi> ſuch <hi>Carteſians</hi> as <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> and ſuch as <hi>Hobbes</hi> that you prefer? I ſhall tell you after, what are their politicks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V.</hi> Is it the famous Lawyers and Politick writers of <hi>Europe,</hi> Papiſts or Proteſtants? I have told you after what they hold. What heaps of Teſtimonies doth the Great Lawyer <hi>Hottoman</hi> in his <hi>Franco-Gallia</hi> bring, to prove the Power of Nobles and Parliaments limiting the Monarch formerly in <hi>France?</hi> And <hi>Bodin</hi> is againſt him as to the Conſtitution of <hi>France,</hi> and by the information of <hi>Dale</hi> the Engliſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, taketh <hi>England</hi> alſo to be an Abſolute Monarchy, and that the Parliament hath no <hi>Authoritative</hi> part in <hi>making Laws,</hi> but only a <hi>requeſting</hi> and <hi>adviſing</hi> part, and the King the only Legiſlative. Yet ſee what are even <hi>Bodins</hi> Principles. 1. Pag. 98. He ſaith <hi>[Soveraign

            <p>3. Page 88. c. 8. <hi>He maketh Monarchy to be the gift of the people,</hi> voluntarily diſſeiſing and deſpoiling themſelves of the Sovereign power to ſeize and inveſt another in it. (As if a man ſhould by pure gift deliver to another man the propriety and poſſeſſion that to him belongeth): <hi>And ſo he maketh the Ruler to have juſt ſo much power as the people give him. And at this rate Lawyers ordinarily ſpeak both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. He ever excepteth from the abſolute Sovereigns pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, all that is commanded or forbidden by the Law of God and Nature, which no man can abrogate, <hi>pag. 89, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>5. Pag. 85. <hi>He tells us how of old the Chief Juſtice thus inveſted the King of</hi> Arragon. <q>We which are to thee in virtue nothing inferior, and in power greater than thy ſelf, create thee our <hi>King,</hi> Yet with this condition, that one among us ſhall have more power and command than thy ſelf]</q> 
               <hi>But he believeth not that the people of</hi> Arragon <hi>choſe the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. <hi>He ſaith that</hi> a Prince <hi>is</hi> not ſubject to <hi>his</hi> Laws, <hi>but he is</hi> to his own juſt <hi>and</hi> reaſonable Conventions: <hi>and that</hi> many <hi>are</hi> deceived <hi>that</hi> confound Laws <hi>and a</hi> Princes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts which they call alſo <hi>Laws (Conſtitutions or Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Laws they are called)</hi> The Law depends on the will of him that hath the Soveraignty. But <hi>the</hi> contract between <hi>the</hi> Prince <hi>and his Subjects</hi> is <hi>mutual,</hi> which reciprocally bindeth both parties, ſo that the one party may not ſtart therefrom, to the prejudice, or without the conſent of the other. <hi>(As Conſtitutions are made by contract, ſo ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys make Governing laws by contract).</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:194351:10"/> 7. Pag. 95. <hi>He ſaith the</hi> Prince cannot derogate from <hi>the</hi> Laws <hi>that</hi> concern <hi>the</hi> ſtate of the Realm, <hi>and the</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing thereof.</p>
            <p>8. Pag. 97. <hi>He ſaith</hi> [It is not in the power of any Prince in the world (no more than the King of <hi>Englund)</hi> at his pleaſure to raiſe taxes on the people, no more than to take another mans goods from him, <hi>as</hi> Philip Commines wiſely ſhewed in the Parliament at <hi>Towres.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. Pag. 97. <hi>He objects</hi> [that the Eſtates of <hi>England</hi> have power to condemn; as <hi>K.

L. 2. c. 2. <hi>He diſtinguiſheth of</hi> Lawful <hi>or</hi> Royal Monarchy, Lordly Monarchy <hi>and</hi> Tyrannical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy: The Lawful <hi>or</hi> Royal Monarch <hi>is</hi> that where the Subjects enjoyning their natural liberty <hi>and</hi> propriety of their goods, obey the Laws of a Monarch, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch <hi>the</hi> Laws <hi>of Nature.</hi> The Lordly Monarchy is that where the Prince is become Lord of the goods <hi>and</hi> perſons of his Subjects, by Law <hi>of</hi> Arms <hi>and</hi> lawful War, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>them</hi> as the Maſter of a Family doth his ſlaves. The Tyrannical Monarchy <hi>is</hi> where the Prince contemning <hi>the</hi> Laws of Nature <hi>and</hi> Nations, imperiouſly abuſeth <hi>the</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his free-born Subjects, and their goods as his own.</p>
            <p>11. Though he juſtly blame <hi>Ariſtot. (p. 206.)</hi> for defining a King to be him, who choſen by the people, reigneth as they deſire] <hi>from whoſe will if he never ſo little depart he becometh a tyrant;</hi> And though <hi>Althuſius</hi> blame <hi>Bodin</hi> for being for <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarchy,</hi> yet <hi>Bodin l. 2. c. 4.</hi> deſcribeth a Tyrant juſt as <hi>Althuſius</hi> (after cited) doth, if not more copiouſly and odiouſly: The learned Reader may peruſe <hi>pag. 212.</hi> his dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb facs="tcp:194351:10"/> between a King and a Tyrant, too large to be recited, and ſcarce ſafe for the vulgar to read, leſt they ſhould think moſt Princes by thoſe Characters to be Tyrants: I am ſure it goeth far beyond our Language.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>And it's the more dangerous in that</hi> c. 5. p. 220, 221. <hi>he teacheth</hi> [that it is a fair <hi>and</hi> magnifical thing, for a Prince <hi>(of another land)</hi> to take up Arms to relieve a whole Nation <hi>and</hi> People unjuſtly oppreſſed by the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Tyrant. <hi>[And that</hi> [it is lawful for any ſtranger to kill a Tyrant,] that is to ſay, a man of all men infamed and notorious for the oppreſſion, Murder and ſlaughter of his Subjects. But as for Subjects to do the ſame, it muſt be known whether the Prince be an Abſolute Sovereign, or not: For if he be no abſolute Sovereign, then muſt the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of neceſſity be either in the people or the nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in which caſe there is no doubt but that it is lawful to proceed againſt a Tyrant by way of Juſtice, if ſo men may prevail againſt him: Or elſe by way of fact, and open force, if they may not otherwiſe have reaſon. <hi>As the</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>did againſt</hi> Nero <hi>and</hi> Maximinus.—<hi>p. 222.</hi> It ſhall be lawful not only for ſtrangers but for the Subjects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo to take them out of the way].</p>

               <hi>Albericus Gentilis</hi> was made <hi>Profeſſor</hi> of the <hi>Civil Law</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi> (where he unſucceſsfully wrote for Stage-Plays againſt <hi>D. Jo. Reignolds):</hi> And therefore he was one of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And in his book <hi>De jure Belli</hi> he holdeth,</p>
            <p>1. That unavoidable ignorance may make a war to both ſides lawful, <hi>l. 1. c. 6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>He joyneth with</hi> Bodin <hi>againſt war or foreing men to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> c. 9, &amp;c. <hi>with notable teſtimonies of</hi> Tertullian, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius, Arnobius, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bernard, Caſſiodorus, Eraſmus, Hoſpitalius, Victoria, Govarruvia, Baldus, P. Aemilius <hi>and others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Approving <hi>Cujacius</hi> that ſaith [Religio non eſt quae ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
<pb facs="tcp:194351:11"/> in caedes civium &amp; perniciem patriae.]</p>
            <p>3. C. 11. <hi>He ſaith diſtinguiſhing</hi> [Ita cenſeo; ut qui ſubditus privatuſque non eſt, is ſe defendere contra Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipem in iſta cauſa religionis, etiam per bellum poſſit: Qui ſubditus ſimul &amp; privatus non eſt, is ultimo loco &amp; pro remedio ultimo poteſt ſe &amp; in aliis cauſis bello tueri, ut quem non juvat ratio propter potentiam dominii, arma eum defendant—ut Baldus, Defenſio iſta contra omnes eſt, nec debet ullum Patrono honorem: Privatus qui ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo eſt, nihil horum poteſt.</p>
            <p>4. C. 13. Defenſio etiam brutis jus eſt naturae; non opinione nobis, ſed innata quadam vi perſuaſum &amp; conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutum.

            <p>5. And to prove that men muſt defend each other, contrary to <hi>Hobs</hi> and <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> he notably ſheweth that Chriſtians and Heathens agreed that all the world is one Body, houſe, city, of which all are members, made under one law, <hi>c. 15.</hi> and citeth <hi>Bartolus, Baldus, Alciatus, Albericus</hi> and many more Lawyers to prove that the omiſſion of defending others is a ſin: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they are our near friends: citing <hi>Ulpian</hi> and <hi>Tully</hi> for it as the Law of Nature.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>C. 16.</hi> He writeth for Princes defending the Subjects of other Princes, if unjuſtly oppreſſed, yea ſometime though the Subjects were unjuſt, to keep them from immoderate penalty: Much more I paſs by. And are theſe Lawyers Doctrines more loyal than our here profeſſed?</p>
            <p>In a word, Libraries and Bookſellers ſhops abound with ſuch Books, as teach ſuch Doctrines, Philoſophers, Hiſtorians, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and Proteſtants; and yet no ſuch outcry of Treaſon and Rebellion hath been raiſed againſt them, but the Books commonly
<pb facs="tcp:194351:11"/> tolerated and read: And we that never owned ſuch things are by Plotters repreſented as if we were ready by our diſloyal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to deſtroy the King and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And the foreſaid <hi>Greg. Sayrus</hi> ſaith <hi>Clav. Reg. l. 3. c. 6. p. 134.</hi> 
               <q>That mens Laws bind not, unleſs the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. For it is not meet that men ſhould be ſo govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by humane power, as that they ſhould againſt their will be driven by a Law, to do any thing, which neither by the Law of Nature nor of God they are bound to do:—And this muſt not ſeem hard or abſurd to any one, ſeeing that the power of the Prince who is the maker of the Law, ſeemeth in a ſort to depend on the will of the people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the authority of Secular Power is delegated to the Prince himſelf or Magiſtrate by the people, for the making of Laws which ſhall ſeem profitable to the good moderating of the Common-wealth; ſo that the Laws which are made by Princes or Magiſtrates, are therefore to be called valid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are judged to have come from the conſent of the people themſelves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hence <hi>Alph. à Caſtro</hi> gathereth, <q>That if a Prince or Magiſtrate having ſuch power from the people, would by a Law of his making compel the gainſaying people to any thing which is not <hi>neceſſary by the Law of God or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he is to be judged a Tyrant; becauſe he exerciſeth greater power toward the people committed to him than he truly hath.</hi> But <hi>à Caſtro</hi> ſheweth, that this is to be underſtood only of the Lay power; becauſe only this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth its ſtrength from the people.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>p. 120.</hi> he ſheweth, <q>that a Law binds not, if it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to thoſe things, which exceed the Law-makers power: and that therefore the Civil Magiſtrates cannot make Law of matters Eccleſiaſtical.—Alſo if they are not for the common good—</q>
            </p>
            <p>I name <hi>Sayrus,</hi> becauſe you are not to look for better from
<pb facs="tcp:194351:12"/> a Papiſt, his Book being the beſt of Caſes of Conſcience, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in mine, but the common judgement. And <hi>ſee here how near he and Mr.</hi> Hooker <hi>agree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems heretofore ſome Canoniſts thought otherwiſe: But the great Politick Writer <hi>Ad. Contzen li. 5. c. 5.</hi> tells you,
<q>That now the common vote is againſt them: And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth as the true and common judgement, that the power of making Laws, is by nature in the multitude or whole Common-wealth; and that no one Prince hath more than the people give him. And that the people when they chooſe a Royal Perſon or Family, may reſerve this right, that he ſhall abrogate or make no Law without them: that all Civil power flows from the people; and that none without Tyranny can take this power from them: And that ſuch a Tyrant is worſe than he that beateth the innocent, becauſe he wrongeth and oppreſſeth more.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And of all forms of Government, he concludeth</hi> [Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiam temperatam, in qua Optimatum, ſive Senat sva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leat authoritas, in qua Civitatum, atque aliorum Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſit nonnulla poteſtas, praeferendam eſſe, <hi>li. 1. c. 21. p. 43.

            <p>But enough of this comparing of our Doctrine with other mens, whoſe Books are commonly ſold and read. An impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial hearing when accuſed, is that which we have in vain long deſired of our hurtfulleſt enemies. But well ſaith the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Contzen. l. 9. c. 44. p. 732. Abſolvit Judex quem audire formidat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have oft wondred that when Chriſt was accuſed as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the Jews nor Romans did not charge him for <hi>gathering the multitude as his guards,</hi> to the awe of the Rulers, who durſt not lay hands on him leſt the people ſhould ſtone them or riſe for him againſt them: For they <hi>feared the people, Luk. 22. 2.</hi> and 20. 19. <hi>Mark 12. 12. Mat. 21. 46.</hi> when they ſought to lay hands on him, they feared the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, <hi>becauſe they took him for a prophet,</hi> Yea, K. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> durſt not put <hi>John</hi> to death for fear of the multitude that took him for a prophet, <hi>Mat. 14. 5.</hi> And when the Phariſees bid Chriſt rebuke the multitude that cried <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> he would not. Yet he declared that his Kingdom was not of this world, and he was not made a divider of inheritances, and paid tribute to Caeſar to avoid offence. I wonder that the Rulers did not proſecute the people rather then fear them. But I will not believe that Chriſt ſinned in this, though Infidels think ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VI.</hi> But ſtay: Perhaps it is the ancient <hi>Biſhops and Canons</hi> which they ſay agreed in more Loyal Doctrine than I here profeſs? But 1. I have newly in my <hi>Abridgement of Church Hiſtory</hi> ſaid ſo much to anſwer this that I fear not the cenſures of any impartial reader. 2. How greatly doth the great Antiquary <hi>Albaſpineus</hi> reverence the Apoſtolical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, as the Greek Churches ancient rule: But I diſown
<pb facs="tcp:194351:13"/> their Doctrine, <hi>l. 8. c. 2. Neque vero Rex impius Rex eſt amplius, ſed Tyrannus:</hi> Neque <hi>Epiſcopus ignorantiâ aut malo animo oppletus, Epiſcopus eſt, ſed falſus Epiſcopus, non à Deo, ſed ab hominibus promotus.</hi> If I ſhould cite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance ſuch I ſhould but anger ſome. Read <hi>Nazianzenes</hi> deſcription of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> and others of the caſes of <hi>Theoph.

            <p>Among a multitude I will add one inſtance of my own uſage, that you may ſee more of my reaſon for this writing. The <hi>Tranſproſer rehearſed p. 48.</hi> ſaith <q>
                  <hi>M. Baxter in his holy Common-wealth maintaineth that he</hi> (the King) <hi>may be called to account by any ſingle Peer.]</hi>
               </q> Muſt we ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſuch bloody ſlanders? Never ſuch a thought was in my mind, nor word ſpoke or written by me, but all is a meer falſe fiction: Nay, in all the times of uſurpation, and ſince, I ſaid, and wrote that the Kings perſon is inviolable, and to be judged by none, either Peer or Parliament; and that it is none but Subjects that they may call to account and judge and puniſh; and that neither the King may deſtroy or hurt the Kingdom, nor the Kingdom the King (much leſs a Peer) but their Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the Kingdoms life. And the very Book accuſed goeth on ſuch Principles, and hath not a word meet to tempt a man in his wits to this accuſation. Judge now by this one inſtance, and by the cry of the Plotters now againſt us, ſeeking our deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Parliaments as ſuppoſed to favour us (which for ought I know never did any thing for our relief or eaſe) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be meet that I ſhould die in ſilence under ſuch horrid accuſations: againſt which I appeal to the great and righteous Judge, before whom I am ſhortly to appear, begging his pardon, and reforming-conviction, where ever Ierre.</p>

            <p>§. 1. WE have no reaſon to blame our Rulers, for being offended with all principles of Anarchy and Rebellion, and being jealouſly watchful againſt all real appearances of them: for that <hi>ſuch are among us,</hi> and that the tendency of them is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious effects, is paſt denyal: and all lovers of God, their Country and their King, will hate and oppoſe them, when they do diſcern them.</p>
            <p>§. 2. What the Papiſts principles are, is ſo largly prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Henry Fowlis,</hi> and by Doctor <hi>Barlow,</hi> the preſent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:194351:16"/> worthy Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> after many others, that no addition is neceſſary; but that ſuch as the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminer</hi> and many others in Preſs and Pulpit ſhould lay ſomewhat like it to the charge either of the preſent <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> or to <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> as ſuch, and cry out to Rulers and people, as they love their power, Eſtates and lives not to tolerate us (that is, to deſtroy or baniſh us) and ſpecially that the Parliament in the beginning of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act which baniſheth us from Corporations, ſhould leave on record ſuch ſuſpicions of us as the reaſon of their Act, are things that have long ſeemed to me to make ſuch a Defence our duty, as tendeth to the ſatisfaction of the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecters and accuſers; Leſt we ſeem 1. To own the charge, 2. and thereby tempt the people to think that we take not rebellion for a ſin; 3. or to deſpiſe both the Law-makers, their Laws, and the ſaid Preachers that thus accuſe us.</p>
            <p>§. 3. I have not yet heard of any ſuch ſevere proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of the Bruitiſts that are for <hi>Hobbes, Spinoſa, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponatius, Vaninus, &amp;c.</hi> as have been uſed againſt truly Loyal <hi>Nonconformiſts.</hi> But their principles are ſo perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſubverting humanity, morality and Government, that I will begin with the recital of them as <hi>Spinoſa</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them down, and then add the true fundamentals of Government and morality which confute them.</p>
            <p>§. 4. Bened. Spinoſa <hi>in</hi> Tractat. Theolog. polit. <hi>cap. 16. pag. 175, 176,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſaith</hi> [<q>
                  <hi>Jus naturae nihil aliud eſt quam,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. The Right of Nature is nothing but the Rule by which every thing is determined to his manner of being and operation, as fiſhes are to ſwim, and the great ones to eat the little ones. That natural Right extendeth as far as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. That every Individual hath the Higheſt Right, to all things that he is able to do: That it is the chief Law of Nature, that every thing do its utmoſt to continue in its own ſtate, having no reſpect to any other, but only to it ſelf;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:194351:16"/> that here there is no difference between men and other things, nor between rational men, and Fools or mad men: that while men live under the Empire of nature only, they live by the only Laws of Appetite, and that by the higheſt Right: that the natural right of every man is not determined by ſound reaſon, but by Luſt and power: All being born ignorant, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long before they know the true reaſon of living, and get the Habit of Vertue, though they have good education, they are no more bound this while to live by the Laws of a ſound mind (or reaſon) than a Cat by the Laws of Lions. Whatſoever any ſuch ſhall judge profitable to himſelf, either by guidance of ſound reaſon, or by the force of affection, it is lawful for him by the higheſt right of nature to deſire it and to take it, and that by force or fraud, or requeſt, or by what other way he eaſilieſt can; and to take him for his enemy that would hinder the fulfilling of his deſire: ſo that the Right and Law of nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which all are born, and for the moſt part live, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nothing, but that which no man deſireth and which no man can do, not contentions, not hatred, not wrath, not frauds. Whatſoever in Nature ſeems to us abſurd, ridiculous or evil, is becauſe we know things but in part. It is the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Law of humane Nature, that no man neglect that which he judgeth good (for him) but in hope of a greater good, or the fear of greater damage; nor endure any evil but to avoid a greater, or in hope of greater good: that every man of two goods chooſe that which he thinks beſt (for him) and of two evils, that which he thinks leaſt, be it ſo or not: and this is ſo firmly written in mans nature, that it is to be numbred with the eternal veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which no man can be ignorant of. Therefore no man is to promiſe without fraud, nor to ſtand to his promiſe made, to give up this right (in civil ſociation) unleſs for fear of greater evil or hope of greater good. As if a robber force us to promiſe him our goods, we may frandulently promiſe and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it; yea if I miſtakingly think I have promiſed a thing to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:194351:17"/> my hurt, I may break it: whence we conclude that Covenants can have no force but for our profit ſake, which being taken away, the Covenant is taken away and remaineth void. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in conſtituting Republicks, it's fooliſh to require fidelity, further than you make ſure, that Covenant-breaking ſhall prove the breakers hurt: For every man by natural right, may deal deceitfully, and is not bound to ſtand to his Covenants. He hath the ſupreme Right over all men, who hath the greateſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by which he can retain them by force or fear of the greateſt puniſhment: which Right he ſhall have no longer, than he keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the power of executing what he liſt: Otherwiſe he ſhall rule precariouſly, and no one that is ſtronger than he ſhall be bound to obey him, unleſs he will. And thus ſocieties may be formed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any wrong to the right of nature: and he that hath moſt power is bound by no Law. And thus we are bound to execute all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that hath moſt power, be they moſt abſurd: becauſe reaſon bids us chuſe the leſs evil: But then this Right of commanding what they will, no longer belongeth to chief Powers, than they have chief power: which if they loſe, they loſe their Right of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, and it falls to him or them that get it and can keep it.</p>
            <p>Then having extolled Democracy he proceedeth to ſhew that, <hi>There is no injury but in a Civil life (the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his will that hath moſt power) and that all things are lawful to them that are ſtrongeſt, and they can do no wrong, and Juſtice is a conſtancy of mind to give every man that which by (this) civil Right belongs to him, (that is, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get from him without his own hurt)</hi> And <hi>that if two States Covenant, none but a ſool that knoweth not the right of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Powers, will expect they ſhould ſtand to it, longer than is for their own ends or good; and ſo in matters of piety and Religion. Alſo, that all are to be taken for enemies ſave ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and confederates, though they never did us wrong: and we may compel them to ſubjection or confederation, if we are able,</hi> with <hi>much</hi> more to this purpoſe, taking off all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:194351:17"/> of charity, juſtice and common honeſty, except what mens private intereſt, or the will of him that is ſtrongeſt doth infer. Otherwiſe making it as lawful, yea as much duty to murder any man, or as many as we can, as to ſave mens lives, to ſteal and rob as to forbear, to lye and be perjured as to ſpeak truly, to be adulterous as to be chaſt, to be a Traitor as a Loyal ſubject: openly diſſolving and deriding all divine obligations, ſave mans, and releaſing all mens conſciences from them: As if he proclaimed to the world, that if once they can but think it to be for their own good, they may kill any man, they may murder Kings and turn their Guns, their ſwords, their poyſons againſt them, notwithſtanding any oaths to the contrary, without any ſcruple of Conſcience or fear of puniſhment in the world to come. And if once all mens conſciences were thus turned looſe, no guards, no Army could ſecure the lives of Kings, as the caſes of <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi> have proved. Yea he thus telleth, Every General of Armies, or any other ſubject that can but kill the King, and take poſſeſſion of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that he hath as much right as the King had as long as he is ſtrongeſt, and that all the ſubjects have the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to defend him that hath depoſed the King, as they had before to defend the King. In a word, that no man is to be truſted by another any further than he thinketh it good for himſelf, nor oweth any duty to any, but himſelf, not excepting Parents to children or children to their Parents.</p>
            <p>It is the will &amp; mercy of God to Princes and to mankind thus to permit thoſe that will be Atheiſts and Rebels againſt him to ſhew the conſequents of it, by their inhumane and rebellious opinions againſt Government: That if Princes will ever ſet up Epicuriſme, Atheiſme and Infidelity, they ſhall ſet up Rebellion with it, and expoſe their Lives to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that hath but liſt to venture upon a ſecret or an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen aſſault.</p>

            <p>3. Therefore we have no Notion or Name of God which is not in ſome ſort <hi>Borrowed,</hi> or which is formal and adequate to his Eſſence.</p>
            <p>4. Yet nothing inviſible is ſo clearly and certainly intelligible and certain to mans mind, as God, as to the <hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:194351:19"/> 5. The Notions we have of God, though <hi>Borrowed</hi> and <hi>Analogical,</hi> are not uſeleſs nor fallacious, but imperfect and ſuch as lead to perfect knowledge: And he that will not uſe theſe, muſt uſe none.</p>
            <p>6. We have no <hi>immediate</hi> knowledge of any higher nobler eſſence than our <hi>own ſouls,</hi> from which to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row our Notions of God: ſtill ſeparating all that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth imperfection and acknowledging their defectiveneſs.</p>
            <p>7. He that laying by theſe, will from any other lower baſer Nature, form Notions of God, ſhall have lower, baſer Notions of him.</p>
            <p>8. Mans Soul <hi>is a</hi> Spirit, <hi>having</hi> eſſentially <hi>the</hi> Virtue, force, <hi>or</hi> inclined power, <hi>of</hi> Vital-Activity, Intellection and Volition (Three in one): <hi>all which are certainly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by their Acts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. As <hi>Vital-ſelf-moving</hi> is more noble than the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of meer paſſives or inanimates, ſo <hi>Vitality</hi> with <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> and <hi>Free-will,</hi> is more noble than bruitiſh motion without <hi>Intellection</hi> or <hi>Free-will:</hi> elſe worms and Beaſts were nobler natures than men, and ſhould be our Covernours.</p>
            <p>10. Therefore to feign God to be a meer principle of <hi>Vniverſal motion</hi> as the Spring in a Watch, or the poiſe of a Clock, is to debaſe him below the <hi>Vitality</hi> of <hi>Beaſts:</hi> and to feign him to be a meer <hi>ſenſitive principle</hi> of <hi>motion,</hi> is to debaſe him below <hi>humane nature.</hi> And to feign him to be a meer <hi>Vital-Intellectual mover</hi> without <hi>Will, Love</hi> and <hi>Voluntary Goodneſs,</hi> is to think of him in a maimed defective notion, as baſer than man's, whoſe <hi>Will</hi> is one of his nobleſt faculties, without which he hath no <hi>Love</hi> to or <hi>complacency</hi> in himſelf or any other. Even as we think of a man of meer ſpeculative knowledge, who nevertheleſs may be ſtark naught: (And ſo men think of the Devil himſelf).</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:194351:20"/> 11. Gods will is the cauſe and Conſerver and end of all things, and therefore to deny his will is to deny all things.</p>
            <p>12. Gods will hath all that Liberty which belongeth to Perfection, but no liberty or indifferency which imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth imperfection.</p>
            <p>13. The True Idea of Gods Nature then is, That he is a SPIRIT of LIFE, INTELLECTION and WILL, MOST PERFECT.</p>
            <p>14. All the Being, with all the Vitality, Intellect and will, the Power, wiſdom and goodneſs, which is in man or any Creature, being from God, he muſt needs have more than All himſelf, either formally or eminently, for he can give nothing more noble than what he hath and is.</p>
            <p>15. Man having Vitality, Intellection and Free-will, and being a Sociable creature, each one having need of others and diſpoſed to converſe, and placed among others, is a Creature made to be <hi>Governed</hi> according to his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> by <hi>Verities,</hi> and according to his <hi>Free-will</hi> by <hi>propoſed Good;</hi> and not meerly <hi>moved</hi> as a <hi>Stone,</hi> or Engine, nor meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved as Bruits by ſenſe: that is, he is to be ruled by Laws. This one of us hath ſo fully proved in a treatiſe called the Reaſons of the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>part 1. cap. 8.</hi> that it muſt not here be done over again.</p>
            <p>16. If the Nature of man were not to be morally governed by propoſed <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> his <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> were vain; he ſhould not be ruled as a man but as a ſtone or beaſt: ſenſe muſt do all: all humane govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were impoſſible or evil, for want of capable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: no Villany muſt be controlled: folly muſt bear equal ſway with wiſdom: children muſt not obey their Parents, any more than Parents their children. Yea by the Principles of this <hi>Maledictus Spinoſa</hi> and his tribe, the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:194351:20"/> children that can but conquer natural inſtinct, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape humane puniſhment, may as lawfully kill their Parents to get the inheritance, as Love and Honour them: and the Parents may as lawfuly murder all their children, to avoid the trouble of keeping them, as to nouriſh them.</p>
            <p>17. Man being naturally made to be Governed, God muſt needs be his ſupreme governour, as having the chief Right and ſole capacity and aptitude. For 1. there is no other can rule Univerſally, but partially. Kings rule their Kingdoms, but God ruleth the world. 2. Elſe there were no Governour over Soveraigns, and ſo no Blaſphemies, no Murders (even of Millions) no Perjuries <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were unlawful to them, nor were it poſſible for them to ſin. 3. Then no plagues, ſlames, wars or death were divine puniſhments, nor any to be feared here or hereafter, but men might as ſafely defie and blaſpheme God, as Love and Honour him. 4. Elſe there were no Law of Nations obliging many to mutual juſtice, but only intereſt and contract. 5. Elſe no heart actions were morally good or evil, (becauſe not under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men) He that hated God and Goodneſs and all good men, for his luſts ſake, and ſtudied to do all the miſchief he could; he that longs for the murder of his own children, Parents or friends, or of his King, were as good as he that Loved them all: for where there is no Law there is no tranſgreſſion: and ſo all morality is nullified. 6. If God were not the ſupreme Governour, no King or perſon could have <hi>true Right</hi> to govern, for there could be no effect for want of a cauſe. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot give the Ruling Power which they never had (their perſonal Rule being of another kind) and God hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prevented them by his eſtabliſhment of Government in the world, who giveth Parents their Governing Power, which is the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:194351:21"/> 18. Gods actual Laws do prove him to be a Lawgiver: even thoſe of Nature, which all ſuch Atheiſts ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able commonly to obliterate. And the conſent of all mankind ſtill do and will condemn ſuch principles as deny them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>19. A law is the</hi> ſignification of the Rulers will, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting what ſhall be due from and to the ſubject, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Government.</p>
            <p>20. Gods Laws are firſt natural, <hi>and next by</hi> ſpecial Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>21. Gods Law of Nature is all That in the ſtated <hi>natura rerum</hi> in all the world, by which his will is ſignified to us as aforeſaid about our duty.</p>
            <p>22. So that Gods Law univocally and properly is <hi>in genere objectivo,</hi> and in <hi>genere ſigni.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>23. Mans own nature as in order it ſtandeth related and diſpoſed towards God and all things and perſons circumſtant, is the chief part of this objective Law of Nature; from whence his duty reſulteth, and Gods will is notified.</p>
            <p>24. When the Law is ſaid to be written in our Hearts, it is called the Law univocally, antecedently to the Heart reception, and the reception it ſelf is not another Law.</p>
            <p>25. This reception is by the <hi>Intellect, will,</hi> or <hi>executive power:</hi> And 1. to <hi>know a Law,</hi> is <hi>not a Law;</hi> 2. To will or Love a Law is not a Law; 3. To be ready or diſpoſed to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe a Law is not a Law, unleſs equivocally.</p>
            <p>26. They that confound theſe things by the name of a Light or Law within us, and then talk of the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of it, do but deceive when they are deceived.</p>
            <p>27. What can they (with ſenſe) mean by [The Light or Law within us] but, 1. either the Reception of the objective light or Law which containeth, 1. the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:194351:21"/> Act, 2. with its object (as it is become an <hi>Ens Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onale</hi> Eſſential to the Act, as in it ſelf it is <hi>Ens Reale)</hi> or elſe an innate diſpoſition hereunto: 2. Or elſe ſome influx of God (natural or ſupernatural) by which as the chief efficient he exciteth the faculties to receive the Objective Light or Law? And if they meant this ſecond (that all men have ſufficient help from Gods influx) they ſhould ſay ſo, that men might underſtand them. If they mean that all <hi>have ſufficient knowledge, faith, Love</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> even Infants and wilful deſpiſers of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and thoſe that think it ſervice to God, to kill his ſervants, and all the blinded ſinners in the world, why do theſe men pretend to teach them more or blame their errours; and do not forbid all teaching in the world even of Parents or any other? Why did Chriſt and his Prophets and Apoſtles teach men that were born wiſe enough? If they mean that all mens Nature it ſelf is a ſufficient intellectual objective Light and Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any external light or objective Law, that is without ſeeing or hearing or thinking of any creature of God but ourſelves, then they that are born blind and deaf, have all the ſame Light and Law as others. If they mean only that mens faculties are ſufficiently ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and receptive of the effects of Gods objective Law of Nature, what doth the confounding Metaphor of a <hi>Light within us</hi> do to the notifying of their minds? But men that neither underſtand the matter nor themſelves, will trouble the world with teaching them that they need no teaching.</p>
            <p>28. We call thoſe Revelations <hi>natural,</hi> which the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary nature of things in themſelves, and effects, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth to us: and we call thoſe Revelations <hi>ſpecial</hi> and <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> which God exhibiteth to us, by means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, quite out of the way of his common opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:194351:22"/> and ſuch as no natural cauſe uſeth to produce, (as to raiſe the dead, to cauſe the fire not to burn one, to ſend an Apparition, an Angel or a voice from heaven, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> Though we pretend not to know how much of any natural cauſe unknown to us may be uſed by God in any of theſe.</p>
            <p>29. It is impudency in them that pretend to Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian <hi>clarity</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> in all that they will receive, yet to take on them to be ſo well acquainted with God and his operations, and the frame of nature as to tell the world, that <hi>Liberty of will is inconſiſtent with Gods nature, that he never doth a miracle, nor altereth the courſe of the ſmalleſt particle in nature, nor doth nothing in the world which is not the neceſſary effect of natural ſecond cauſes, as well as of his own will, as he put them in a ſet courſe of motion from eternity, or from the creation,</hi> with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſuch dreams, which whatever they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are certainly unknown to them to be ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an unfit medium whence to infer the nullity of all divine Government, Laws and morality.</p>
            <p>30. Both natural and ſupernatural Laws or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations are to make man <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good:</hi> and ſo are ſaid to be <hi>written</hi> and <hi>put</hi> into his heart, when they have theſe effects. But if the effects themſelves were all Gods Law, then, 1. God had as many Laws as perſons in the world; 2. And his Law in the ſame perſon chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as his <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> changed; 3. And thoſe that can but keep themſelves ignorant and bad enough, ſhall therefore not be bad or have no ſin becauſe they have no Law.</p>
            <p>31. There is no <hi>actual knowledge</hi> born in man (unleſs poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly an unexpreſſible conſciouſneſs of our <hi>own being);</hi> but only a <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> in the <hi>Intellective faculty</hi> to know ſome things preſently, and eaſily, and ſome things hardly and by ſlow degrees.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:194351:22"/> 32. What ever the underſtanding can know at laſt with the moſt diligent ſearch, it had naturally ſome power to know from its Original. For nothing doth that which it cannot do (mediately or immediately): therefore the noble nature of the ſoul is better gathered from the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſome, than the baſeneſs of it from the Ignorance of others, that excite not their natural faculties.</p>
            <p>33. Gods Law of Nature bindeth mankind (ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily) to live in Governed ſocieties, and hath not left it free to them to do otherwiſe. Parental Authority is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct with our firſt being, and natural neceſſity obligeth to the reſt.</p>
            <p>34. Civil Eccleſiaſtical and Economical Governours, being inſtituted by God, are his Officers, and receive their power from his Inſtitution and Univerſal Laws, and not from the people, who do but chooſe, or conſent to the perſon that ſhall receive it.</p>
            <p>35. God only is the Univerſal Ruler, and no Pope or mortal man is capable of it: and God only maketh Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Laws (what ever General Councils may pretend to.)</p>
            <p>36. Gods Laws bind Kings as well as ſubjects, and give force to their Laws, and nothing of man's is obligatory to us, which is againſt them; for none can diſpenſe with them.</p>
            <p>37. All <hi>Government</hi> that is <hi>lawful</hi> is <hi>for Gods Glory</hi> and the <hi>Common Good.</hi> And Laws that are certainly and notoriouſly againſt <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>common Good,</hi> have no true obliging power to formal obedience on the ſoul.</p>
            <p>38. Yet ſuch particular Laws diſoblige not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from ſubjection, nor from keeping up the honour of Governours, while they Govern for God and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good in the main.</p>
            <p>39. Though the common deſcription of Tyrants in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians and Lawyers is <hi>(quoad exercitium)</hi> that they are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:194351:23"/> ſuch as <hi>Govern not</hi> for the <hi>common good, but for their own,</hi> yet men muſt take heed, that hence they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer nor either, 1. that we are made judges of the ſecret intentions of our Rulers hearts, or 2. that one or a few Laws or actions may denominate them ſuch, 3. yea though <hi>we knew that</hi> they <hi>preferred themſelves in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,</hi> it is enough to us, if they preſerve the <hi>common good</hi> in their practice. Elſe almoſt all <hi>ungodly Rulers</hi> would be Tyrants, for it is their common vice to be <hi>moſt for themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>40. This Atheiſtical Politician, who alloweth every man to prefer himſelf before all the world, doth make that in Princes, which all men have called Tyranny, to be the very Law of Nature.</p>
            <p>41. One man is leſs worth than multitudes <hi>caeteris paribus;</hi> and every man is a part of the Univerſe, and is not born for himſelf alone: therefore howſoever ſenſe may reach but to the <hi>Individual fleſhly</hi> intereſt; common reaſon tells us that he liveth not like a man, who preferreth himſelf before his Country, and had rather Millions or Kingdoms periſhed than he alone.</p>
            <p>42. Our common Nature telleth us, that mans will was made to <hi>Love Good</hi> as <hi>Good,</hi> and not to <hi>Love our perſonal commodity alone:</hi> and that an excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or thing in another part of the world, is amiable, though never like to be a <hi>commodity</hi> to us: therefore the greateſt Good ſhould be greatlieſt loved, even in our <hi>Neighbours</hi> as well as in <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and our <hi>Country above</hi> our ſelves.</p>
            <p>43. Though a Prince have not Authority to make Laws to the hurt of the Common-wealth as ſuch, or <hi>ſub hac ratione,</hi> yet he hath Authority to judge what is for the good of the Common-wealth as a Ruler, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects muſt acquieſce in his judgement, when cogent evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:194351:23"/> of the contrary doth not forbid them. And when they know that a Law is againſt the common good, and obligeth not to formal obedience, yet becauſe the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Law of Honouring our Rulers ſtill continues, and ſometimes diſobeying may tend more to the common hurt, than the obedience of that hurtful Law may do, where God himſelf forbids it not, <hi>material obedience</hi> in ſuch caſes is a duty.</p>
            <p>44. No private perſonal injury may be revenged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King, nor upon the Common-wealth: no not by words.</p>
            <p>45. The <hi>Soveraign</hi> or the <hi>Body of the Common-wealth</hi> may neither of them ſeek the hurt, much leſs the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of each other; nor do any thing that tendeth thereunto: for their <hi>union</hi> is the Exiſtent Conſtitution, which diſſolution deſtroyeth.</p>
            <p>46. Thoſe that diſpute for a Power in the Body of the Common-wealth to deſtroy the Head, or a Power in the Soveraign to deſtroy the Body, if he pleaſe, do (either as <hi>ignorant</hi> or <hi>cunningly treacherous</hi> enemies of both) ſow the ſeeds of ſuſpicion and enmity betwen them, and ſeek to make them afraid of each other as of <hi>Tygers</hi> or enemies, and by the terrible word of <hi>[A power to deſtroy]</hi> make them apprehend Deſtruction as at the door, and a civil war almoſt begun: and ſuch are the moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and unſufferable Counſellors.</p>
            <p>47. And ſo various and croſs are perſonal intereſts, and ſo weak mens judgements, and ſo many their errours; luſts and paſſions, their temptations and ill Counſellors, that if it be maintained lawful for the <hi>Head or Body</hi> to deſtroy each other, and all the ſafety of each lie meerly in the others will, it will ſcarce be poſſible long to keep up a <hi>mutual confidence,</hi> without which ſocieties are ſick or lifeleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:194351:24"/> 48. Thoſe that perſwade Rulers to Govern only by <hi>a frighting force,</hi> do treacherouſly tempt them to ſeem to the people as their enemies.</p>
            <p>49. God hath not made any one form of Government univerſally neceſſary, Monarchy, Ariſtocracy or Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy; and who hath the higheſt power, and in what degree, and under what limits, is not to be decided by Divines from the word of God alone, but by Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers from the Conſtitutions of the reſpective Common-wealths. And it is uſually of ill conſequence, when Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are too forward to go out of their calling, and to be determiners herein; Eſpecially when few of them uſe to be well ſtudied in the Laws of the Land; at leaſt not comparably to Lawyers, who have made it the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of their lives.</p>
            <p>50. Thoſe who diſſolve the obligation of Oaths and Vows are moſt perfidious enemies to Kings and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths: much more thoſe Infidels, who make every mans perſonal ſenſuality and luſt to be the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Law of Nature, beſides which nothing obligeth him to keep his Covenants or vows, nor to ſpare the lives of Kings, Parents or any neighbours. And though it is true that every man loveth himſelf and feareth him that can hurt him, yet ſo <hi>croſs are mens ſenſual intereſts, ſo blind and various are their opinions, ſo violent their luſts, ſo deſperate their paſſions, ſo cunning their contrivances, ſo many their opportunities and temptations, that the lives of Kings are never ſafe, if all mens conſciences are once diſobliged from the bond of Oaths and divine commands:</hi> which if the Atheiſts themſelves did not perceive, they would not make Religion a neceſſary humane project for keeping Vulgar Wits in obedience: but they will ſhortly find that it was neceſſary from a nobler foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and to a nobler end.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of Gods Government and the perfection of his Laws, and of mens Additions.</head>
            <p>1. THere is one only GOD, who is the Abſolute Univerſal Rector of all mankind.</p>
            <p>2. He and He only hath the power of univerſal Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and judgement, that is, of making Laws obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all mankind, and judging all thereby.</p>
            <p>3. This work of Univerſal Legiſlation he hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and his Laws are extant.</p>
            <p>4. The Law of Nature and the Canon of ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are this Law.</p>
            <p>5. The Law of God and only it, is obligatory by Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, (underived) authority.</p>
            <p>6. Divine Revelation or teſtimony or aſſertion, and it only is abſolutely infallible by the abſolute Infallibility and Veracity of the revealer.</p>
            <p>7. Gods Laws are not only <hi>ſufficient</hi> but <hi>Perfect,</hi> as made by him that hath no imperfection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:194351:26"/> 8. Their ſufficiency and perfection is not to be meaſured by humane preſumptions, or by Carnal wit, that would teach God what to ſpeak, and how: and then accuſe his Law of material or modal imperfections, becauſe it is not ſuch as they think it ſhould be; or elſe affirm that to be <hi>there</hi> which is <hi>not there,</hi> becauſe they judge that it <hi>ought</hi> to be there: But it conſiſteth in their perfect <hi>Aptitude</hi> to their proper <hi>ends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. It is wiſe and valid reaſoning to prove <hi>firſt</hi> that it <hi>is Gods Law,</hi> and thence to infer that <hi>it is ſufficient and perfect:</hi> But it is a fooliſh Reaſoning to being with the more uncertain aſſumptions, and to argue that <hi>It is not perfect, Ergo it is not Gods Laws;</hi> or to dream, that to be <hi>Gods Law,</hi> and to be imperfect are conſiſtent.</p>
            <p>10. When we ſay it is <hi>Perfect,</hi> we mean only as is ſaid, <hi>formaliter and reſpectively</hi> as to the proper end, but not, <hi>1. Materialiter, 2. modaliter, 3. vel finaliter abſolute &amp; ſimpliciter;</hi> As if the Angels in Heaven had not, 1. more perfect work preſcribed them, 2. and by a more perfect mode of Revelation, 3. or to more perfect <hi>immediate</hi> ends: But as the <hi>ſinleſs Saints</hi> in Heaven may be leſs perfect in <hi>poſitive Holineſs</hi> than ſome <hi>Angels,</hi> and yet <hi>as perfectly Innocent</hi> and free from all ſin; even ſo <hi>Gods Law</hi> for the Government of imperfect man on earth, is <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> in the foreſaid reſpects <hi>leſs perfect</hi> than the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Laws;</hi> and yet as <hi>blameleſs</hi> and perfect in its kind as to its proper uſe and ends.</p>
            <p>11. Therefore the <hi>Hiſtorical method</hi> and the <hi>repetitions,</hi> and the <hi>vulgar phraſes,</hi> and the abſence of Philoſophical ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties, is part of the <hi>perfection,</hi> and not of any imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Laws.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>The work of Gods Laws is by</hi> Authoritative In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution <hi>to</hi> determine what ſhall be due from man by way of obedience, and what ſhall be due to man by way of Reward and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:194351:27"/> Puniſhment, <hi>and</hi> ſo to be the Rule, firſt of Duty, and then of judgement.</p>
            <p>13. Only <hi>Gods Laws</hi> can make due <hi>everlaſting</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or Puniſhments.</p>
            <p>14. No man is to <hi>make himſelf</hi> a <hi>publick judge</hi> or <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner</hi> of Gods Laws, without Gods Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>15. Gods Laws are not only Perfect as to <hi>Eſſentials,</hi> but as to <hi>Integral</hi> parts alſo, yea and to all <hi>Accidents</hi> and appurtenances of them.</p>
            <p>16. It belongeth not to Gods <hi>Vniverſal Laws</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in particular all that ever ſhall become a Duty to particular perſons, to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>17. As the particular caſe of Countries, perſons and things do vary, ſo many things may be <hi>one mans</hi> duty that are not <hi>anothers,</hi> and a duty at <hi>one time,</hi> and in <hi>one place,</hi> which are not ſo in <hi>another:</hi> which therefore were not to be particularly determined in an <hi>Vniverſal Law;</hi> but only <hi>General Laws</hi> given for their <hi>future deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18. Gods Laws are as perfect for duties of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> to man, as for duty of Love and <hi>worſhip</hi> to God.</p>
            <p>19. But becauſe the <hi>materials</hi> of <hi>humane juſtice</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficences</hi> are more <hi>mutable</hi> than thoſe of <hi>holy love</hi> and <hi>worſhip,</hi> therefore there is incomparably more left to humane determination in that, than in this.</p>
            <p>20. It belongeth to the ſufficiency and perfection of Gods Laws, to determine of all things <hi>in ſpecie</hi> (or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly) which as moral means are <hi>Vniverſally neceſſary</hi> to the good of all mankind (whether <hi>greater</hi> or leſſer good) in all times or places of the world. And to make all that Duty for men, which ſhall be Univerſally duty to all the world; and to forbid all that evil which ſhall be ſin Univerſally to all. For there is no Univerſal Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour but God and our Redeemer, therefore there is no
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:194351:27"/> univerſal Law but his. It is uſurpation againſt the Right and Laws of God and of Jeſus Chriſt, for any either Perſon or Collective body, Prince, Pope or Council, to claim an Univerſal Soveraignty over all the perſons, Kingdoms or Churches in the world. For as none of them are <hi>naturally capable</hi> of ſuch a truſt, as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, ſo <hi>de facto</hi> God hath not committed ſuch a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and truſt to any perſonal or collective Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent under Chriſt. Therefore they accuſe Gods Laws of Imperfection, who ſay that he hath left out any thing (both in Nature and Scripture) which is of univerſal neceſſity, or which man may make to become a duty by any one Univerſal Law.</p>
            <p>21. Every particular Kingdom and Church, being part of Chriſts Univerſal Kingdom and Church, no man may Uſurp any of Chriſts power, or office, over a part, no more then over the whole (Though the univerſal uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation be far the greateſt ſin againſt him).</p>
            <p>22. Therefore no man may do that which either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth that they have the ſame Power in that Church or Kingdom as Chriſt hath, (but only ſubordinate pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) or that his Laws are defective and imperfect, as to that particular Church or Kingdom.</p>
            <p>23. What Chriſt hath appropriated to himſelf, as the work or matter of his own Law, muſt appear from the peruſal of that Law it ſelf, and by ſeeing what he hath there determined of, and ſo not left for man to do, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as the executioners of his Laws, repeating them by commanding that they be practiſed.)</p>
            <p>24. It is certain that as Chriſt as Mediator is King of the Church, and hath Legiſlative power, and did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it partly by himſelf on earth, ſo he commiſſioned his Apoſtles in general to teach all Nations to obſerve all things whatever he had commanded them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:194351:28"/> them the Holy Ghoſt, as his Agent or Advocate to bring all that he had taught them to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and to inſpire them infallibly and lead them into all truth, ſo that the work of Legiſlation was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt, by the Holy Ghoſt as his Advocate or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the Apoſtles, <hi>Matth, 28. 19, 20. Eph. 1. 21, 22, 23. Eph. 4. 8, 10, 11. Joh. 14. 26. Joh. 16. 7, 8, 13. Mic. 4. 2. Iſa. 2. 3. &amp; 8. 16; 20. &amp; 42. 4. Heb. 7. 12. James 1. 25. &amp; 2. 12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>25. It is viſible and certain that Chriſt by himſelf and his ſpirit in his Apoſtles hath particularly ordained, what Articles of faith ſhall be believed, by Revealing to us ſo compleatly the will of God, that there ſhall no other ſupernatural Revolation be needful of things to be believed as neceſſary to Salvation, or to the right worſhipping of God. <hi>Gal. 1. 7, 8, 9. Eph. 4. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. 2 Tim. 3. 16, 17. Heb. 11. 40. Jam. 1. 25. Col. 4. 12. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>26. The Law of Nature and of Chriſt alſo have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that God ſhall be worſhipped publickly in ſolemn Aſſemblies, in a reverent and holy manner, at certain ſtated times.</p>
            <p>27. Chriſt hath ordained, what perſons they ſhall be, and how qualified, who ſhall be admitted into his Church, as the members of it; and who ſhall be kept out.</p>
            <p>28. Chriſt hath ordained that Baptiſm ſhall be the door into his Church, and deſcribed that Baptiſm, and required that all that will enter do thus Sacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Covenant with God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and dedicate themſelves to him. <hi>Matth. 28. 19.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>29. Chriſt hath ordained that certain perſons qualified for that office, ſhall be ſeparated as his Miniſters to preach his Goſpel, and baptize thoſe that are converted, and gather Churches, and to be Paſtors of the Churches ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and this to continue to the end. <hi>Matth. 28. 20.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:194351:28"/> Act. 14. 22, 23. Tit. 1. 3, 4, 5. 1 Theſſ. 5. 12, 13. Eph. 4. 8, 9, 10, 13, 14.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>30. He hath appointed to theſe Officers, a threefold work in ſubordination to his own Prophetical, Prieſtly and Kingly office, that is, to Teach the Churches, to guide them in publick worſhip as their mouth to God, and to Rule them by ſacred Diſcipline. <hi>Matth. 28. 19, 20. 2 Tim. 2. 2, 24. 1 Cor. 14. 15, 16. &amp;c. Act. 20. 7, 11. Act. 2. 41, 42. Heb. 13. 7, 17, 24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>31. He hath given them in Scripture a compleat body of the doctrine which they muſt preach, as the word of God; and hath ordained that publick prayers, and praiſes of God, and adminiſtration of the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, ſhall be the publick worſhip which they ſhall offer to God; and hath left them inſtructions how to exerciſe Church diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, as to admonitions, excommunications and abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>2. Tim. 3. 16, 17. Act. 2. 41, 42. 1 Cor. 11. 20, 22, 23. 1 Cor. 14. Math. 18. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. 1. Cor. 5. 2 John 10, 11. Tit. 3. 10. 2 Theſ. 3. 6, 14.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>32. Chriſt by his ſpirit in his Apoſtles hath ſeparated the Lords day, the firſt day of the week, to be the weekly ſtated day for the ſacred Aſſemblies for the publick worſhipping of God: As Scripture and Church hiſtory fully prove.</p>
            <p>33. Theſe things ordained by Chriſt himſelf are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gods Worſhip,</hi> in a double reſpect, both as they are Actions done to his immediate honour; and as they are means by himſelf appointed to that uſe, and ſo are his <hi>Worſhip-Ordinances</hi> or <hi>Inſtitutions:</hi> And ſo they are called <hi>Gods worſhip,</hi> in the <hi>Primary</hi> and <hi>eminent</hi> ſenſe.</p>
            <p>34. There are abundance of Actions ſubordinate to theſe, being but the right <hi>modifying</hi> and <hi>circumſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> of them, which may be called <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>ſecundary diminutive</hi> ſenſe (as being uncovered, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>bowing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, kneeling, the words of prayer and praiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> anon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enumerated);
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:194351:29"/> which as to theſe <hi>Worſhip-ordinances</hi> are but Adjuncts or modes; which God hath not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in particulars; but given general Laws for the performance of them, requiring men themſelves to chooſe and uſe them prudently, not as they will themſelves but according to theſe General Laws: And ſuch an act of man is no ſinful addition to the Laws of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>35. Chriſt hath taken down the Judaical Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>36. No man hath any authority to make Laws about Gods worſhip, but what Chriſt hath given him; he being now made the Univerſal King.</p>
            <p>37. When a controverſie ariſeth between Chriſts prerogative and mans, we take it for a caſe to be tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled. We would go as far in acknowledging the Authority of Princes, as will ſtand with our Loyalty and fidelity to Chriſt; But as we muſt be tender of their Rights and honours, ſo we muſt be more tender of his. And nothing can be due to the ſervant which deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from the honour of the Maſter.</p>
            <p>38. Therefore Princes and Paſtors ſhould not unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily bring their ſubjects into ſo great a ſtrait, by needleſs Laws for additions in Religion, where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men fearing God, muſt unavoidably be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and tormented by the difficulty, <hi>viz.</hi> between a fear of Treaſon and diſobedience againſt Chriſt, and of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Prince or Paſtors.</p>
            <p>39. And it is the more unexcuſable to rack and torment and divide the Church by unneceſſary Additions in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, becauſe Chriſt hath commanded us ſo much him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf already, as the carnal heart of man repineth at, and therefore will not be brought to practiſe it; but moſt men flie it as a preciſe and too tedious and ſtrict a courſe. And when we grudge at Chriſts Laws
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:194351:29"/> as too great a burden, and too much ado, we ſhould not condemn our ſelves by adding more.</p>
            <p>40. Chriſt hath declared it to be againſt his mind and Law, that unneceſſary Laws and burdens in Religion ſhould be made for and laid upon the Churches, <hi>Act. 15. 28.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>41. It is againſt the will and Law of Chriſt, that we ſhould uſe things otherwiſe indifferent, ſcandalouſly or temptingly, to the enſnaring and endangering of mens ſouls and the diſhonour of Religion. <hi>Rom. 14. &amp; 15. 1 Cor. 8.</hi> No man therefore ought to make Laws about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which ſhall enjoyn ſuch an evil uſe of ſuch things.</p>
            <p>42. To invent and command new publick worſhip-ordinances (either as in Gods name or their own) which are not the meer <hi>commanded modifying and ordering of Gods own worſhip-ordinances,</hi> but as to the <hi>Nature, uſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſons</hi> of them, are coordinate or of the ſame kind, and which have no peculiar uſefulneſs to our age or people more than to another; nor any new reaſon for them but what was extant at the making of Gods Laws; ſo that though the Impoſition be not univerſal, yet there is none but an univerſal reaſon for that impoſition; this ſeemeth to us to be an accuſation of Chriſts Laws of omiſſion and defectiveneſs, and an Uſurpation of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power.</p>
            <p>43. To add more doctrines or articles of faith, which God hath not revealed in nature or Scripture, and to require belief or profeſſion of belief of them, as to the pleaſing of God, or any religious ends, doth ſeem to us an Uſurpation, and an unjuſt accuſation of Gods word as inſufficient.</p>
            <p>44. To forbid Religious Aſſemblies, or alter their ends and principal uſe, is to uſurp, and to contradict the Laws of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:194351:30"/> 45. To alter the qualifications of Church members, and forbid thoſe that Chriſt requireth us to receive, or receive ſuch as Chriſt forbiddeth us to receive, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his laws, by uſurpation, whether Magiſtrates or Paſtors do it.</p>
            <p>46. To forbid Baptiſm, or to alter it, or make a new Sacrament of admiſſion, or a new conſecrating, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating Symbol for the ſolemnization of our Covenant with God, as ſignifying his grace or the conveiance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and a new Symbol of the Chriſtian Church, or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible badge of Chriſtianity (as if the Knights of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould make a Symbol or badge of their order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that which the King hath made) this doth ſeem to us an uſurpation, and an accuſation of Gods Law as inſufficient. Upon which account (not preſuming Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically to judge of other men) we fear for our ſelves, leſt we ſhould ſin if we uſed the Croſs in Baptiſm in the Engliſh manner. Becauſe it is called a Dedicating ſign, and ſignifieth the Paſſion of Chriſt and the grace procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by it on his part, and alſo our ſolemn dedication to Chriſt, as Baptiſm doth, and ſo ſeemeth to us a kind of Sacrament, and a badge or Symbol of our Religion. And hath no reaſon for its Inſtitution which concerneth not all Chriſtians as well as us, and which was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the Apoſtles time; ſo that if it had been fit to be made a Law, it was as fit then as now, and as fit to be an univerſal Law as a particular: and therefore we dare not ſo accuſe Chriſt of omiſſion. And it is not a meer <hi>decent ordering</hi> of Baptiſm, but a new ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of men, to moſt of the ſame uſes. Yet we deny not but it is left to us, by what ſign we will profeſs our own conſent to the Covenant of Grace (by word, writing, or geſture,) which nature or Cuſtome maketh a ſign of Conſent; But not on that pretence to inſtitute a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:194351:30"/> of our Religion for ſelf-dedication ſignifying the cauſes and Graces of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>47. To forbid preaching, or Prayer or Praiſe, or the Lords Supper, or alter them, and to ordain homogeneal means of our own, ſeems to us uſurpation and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>48. To alter the qualifications of Chriſts Miniſters, or the nature of their Office, and to invent new Co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Officers, or Church polities, ſeemeth to us to be uſurpation. Though as <hi>actions circaſacra,</hi> ſo Officers for <hi>thoſe actions,</hi> may be appointed.</p>
            <p>49. How many Paſtors one Church ſhall have, and how oft and where they ſhall aſſemble, and how far the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors or weaker ſhall be guided by the Abler and Elder, is undetermined particularly.</p>
            <p>50. Though on new occaſions anniverſary days may be appointed for holy worſhip, and may meet for it any day of the week, yet to ſet apart another weekly day for holy worſhip, wholly and ſtatedly, ſeemeth to us uſurpation and an accuſation of Gods Laws.</p>
            <p>51. To overthrow, or prohibite Chriſts Church Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, or to ſet up another (that is not meerly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to it, modally to promote it,) ſeemeth to us an uſurpation.</p>
            <p>52. So is it for Lay-men to uſurp the Power of the Keys given to the Paſtors, or for a New kind of humane Biſhops or Paſtors to uſurp them. Much more to make an Univerſal Paſtor of Paſtors, perſonal or Collective, Pope or General Council.</p>
            <p>53. Gods Univerſal abſolute Laws may not be nulled, abrogated, derogate, relaxed or diſpenſed with by any Creature whatſoever.</p>
            <p>54. It is a great Law of God, about the modes of holy Aſſemblies and worſhip, that all be done, 1. to his Glory,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:194351:31"/> 2. and to Edification: For they are the very <hi>natural Law,</hi> which determineth of the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Inſtituted mediàte</hi> Laws.</p>
            <p>55. The Grand Law of LOVE is the firſt and laſt, the <hi>Summary</hi> and the <hi>final Law</hi> of God; that is, to LOVE GOD firſt, in and for Himſelf, and then to love his Image appearing in his works, eſpecially on the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal creature, according to the meaſures of that Image on them; which is, to Love God as God with all our heart and ſoul and might, and our neighbour as our ſelves.</p>
            <p>56. This Love was mans great duty in Innocency; and in perfection ſhall be our work in Glory.</p>
            <p>57. This was that ſtate of <hi>Holineſs</hi> that man fell from, and which Chriſt came to reconcile and to reſtore him to: And which is peculiarly called GODLINESS or SANCTIFICATION in the New Teſtament, as diſtinct from <hi>Faith,</hi> in its narrower, mediate, official notion.</p>
            <p>58. As the work of Chriſt our Redeemer and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is to bring man back to God the Creator; ſo <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt, and all Evangelical poſitive Inſtitutions, are the <hi>Bellows</hi> and <hi>fewel</hi> of this Love; and <hi>means</hi> to it as the <hi>end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>59. The <hi>expreſſions</hi> of this Love are not of equal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity with the <hi>Love it ſelf;</hi> but ſome of them more mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
            <p>60. <hi>Caeteris paribus</hi> the <hi>expreſſions</hi> of our <hi>Love of God,</hi> are to be preferred before the expreſſions of our <hi>Love to men.</hi> But God hath made ſome <hi>Great Acts</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> to <hi>men,</hi> to be <hi>Greater expreſſions</hi> of our Love to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than ſome ſmaller <hi>Immediate</hi> expreſſions of it to Him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:194351:31"/> 61. Our Love to the whole <hi>world</hi> is a greater duty than our Love to <hi>our Countrey,</hi> and our Love to our <hi>Countrey</hi> is a greater duty than our Love to our <hi>Parents, Magiſtrates,</hi> or <hi>our ſelves;</hi> As the Goodneſs of the Objects is diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifyed.</p>
            <p>62. In ſome caſes God hath laid ſome ſpecial charge on us by his own Law, <hi>which way firſt</hi> to <hi>exerciſe</hi> our Love: But where he hath not ſo done, the <hi>Greateſt Good</hi> in the <hi>exerciſes</hi> of Love is to be preferred to a <hi>leſſer,</hi> and the <hi>leſſer</hi> is <hi>no duty</hi> but <hi>a ſin,</hi> when it would exclude the <hi>greater,</hi> (Comparatively).</p>
            <p>63. If a King or Parent command me to forbear a neceſſary Act of Love (or expreſſion of it) (as to ſave a mans <hi>life,</hi> or <hi>ſoul</hi> as far as I am able when there is great hope of the ſucceſs) unleſs <hi>finis gratiâ,</hi> a <hi>Greater Good</hi> oblige me to forbear it, the Authority of the commander doth not oblige me; as not diſſolving Gods obligations.</p>
            <p>64. The command of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency</hi> in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of publick worſhip in the Aſſemblies, is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral precept of <hi>Natural right:</hi> But it is only <hi>the media,</hi> which (in ſome caſes <hi>propter finem)</hi> do ceaſe; that is, when neceſſity impoſeth ſome <hi>diſorder</hi> and <hi>undecency,</hi> as without which the <hi>end</hi> or thing <hi>ordered</hi> muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken; and ſo they ceaſe to be a <hi>means.</hi> But out of ſuch caſes of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> they are of perpetual obligation.</p>
            <p>65. Though <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency</hi> be neceſſary, and <hi>ſome</hi> particular circumſtances by which it is expreſſed indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely; yet not always the <hi>very ſame</hi> Circumſtance and expreſſion: But <hi>one</hi> may ſerve as well as <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>66. If one man will call theſe mutable Circumſtances, (as genuflexion, putting off the hat, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> by the name of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and ſo ſay that <hi>man may command new-external worſhip;</hi> And another will call them only <hi>Circumſtances of worſhip,</hi> and not worſhip, and then ſay that <hi>man may

            <p>67. I will inſtance in twenty particulars in which we called <hi>Puritans</hi> and <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> do grant that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to the Perfection of Gods word particularly to determine, but only to give <hi>General Laws</hi> for deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            <p>1. What day and hour (beſides the Lords day) the Church ſhall meet. 2. Of what length Readings, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, prayers and meetings ſhall be. 3.

            <p>But becauſe the Conceſſion of all theſe, and all of the ſame nature, will not ſerve turn, how odious is our doctrine of <hi>Scripture perfection</hi> made? and we our ſelves are judged unmeet (notwithſtanding the neceſſities of many hundred thouſand ſouls) to preach the common doctrine of the Goſpel.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of the Power of Kings, and the peoples obedience.</head>
            <p>1. KIngs and all other ſupream Powers are the Officers of God the Creator, and of Chriſt the Redeemer, to whom all power is given by the Father.</p>
            <p>2. All their Power is <hi>derived</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>3. Therefore they can have no <hi>more than</hi> he giveth them.</p>
            <p>4. He is the <hi>End</hi> as well as the Original of their power; and they have none but for him and his ends, which is His <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> and the <hi>publick good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Their <hi>own Honour</hi> is included in both theſe; both as part of the ſplendor or <hi>Glory of God</hi> in the <hi>Image</hi> of his ſoveraingty, and as part of the common good, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being a Conſtitutive part of the ſociety.</p>
            <p>6. Therefore it is lawful for Kings and all Magiſtrates to go much further than private men in preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>rving their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:194351:33"/> 
               <hi>Honour;</hi> (Though even <hi>they</hi> are in very great danger of exceſs, and pride.)</p>
            <p>7. Therefore <hi>no Creature</hi> hath an <hi>Abſolute</hi> or <hi>unlimited power;</hi> becauſe they are all <hi>limited by God</hi> the univerſal Soveraign. They that with fiery indignation have num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered this doctrine with our errors, ſhould have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that how ſmall a matter ſoever it is, to ſay that all the <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>eſtates</hi> of the ſubject, are <hi>unlimitedly</hi> at <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soveraigns will,</hi> yet it is not a ſmall thing for a <hi>Divine</hi> to hold, that a King may make Laws to command men to <hi>curſe God</hi> or <hi>deny him,</hi> or <hi>renounce Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>hope</hi> of ſalvation, or to kill father, or mother without cauſe <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which muſt follow if he be <hi>unlimited by God.</hi> Dr. <hi>Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe</hi> never ſaid ſo.</p>
            <p>8. It is one of the tricks of the <hi>Enemies</hi> of <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> cunningly to maintain that Kings have a <hi>Power</hi> to do all the miſchief in the world, and want nothing but a <hi>will;</hi> that ſo they may put the ſubjects in a <hi>fright</hi> when they hear the deſcription of one that is impowred to do ſo much evil, and may make them ſtill <hi>diſtruſtful,</hi> as thinking that one mans will is inſufficient ſecurity for all their <hi>eſtates and lives and ſouls;</hi> and ſo may turn their Love and truſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hatred and diſtruſt. Therefore ſuch flatterers are hated by wiſe Princes.</p>
            <p>9. The people have not (as many Politicians ill affirm) the <hi>Majeſtas realis,</hi> the ſupream power, either to <hi>give</hi> or to <hi>exerciſe;</hi> no nor any Governing power at all, <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> populus;</hi> but only where the Government being in part or in whole Democratical, the conſtitution giveth it them as Rulers.</p>
            <p>10. It is not every mans natural power over himſelf conjoyned by the voluntary conſent of many, that is the Original of Political power (or Soveraignty) they being ſpecifically diſtinct: nor is it left to the will of men whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there ſhall be Government or not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:194351:33"/> 11. Nor doth the Power of <hi>Kings</hi> ariſe naturally from Paternal Power; nor do they need to prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the <hi>eldeſt houſe,</hi> to prove their <hi>right</hi> to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>12. But God as the <hi>Vniverſal Ruler</hi> hath ſignified his <hi>will</hi> in the nature of <hi>man</hi> and of <hi>things,</hi> than <hi>he will</hi> have the world live in <hi>Political order,</hi> and have <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>obedience;</hi> ſo that it is <hi>Commanded</hi> by him in the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> antecedently to mens voluntary conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (though it may poſſibly fall out that ſome uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Individuals, (as thoſe caſt upon a foreign continent or ſolitude) may be under no ſuch obligation.)</p>
            <p>13. The people therefore give not the King or any other Soveraigns their Power.</p>
            <p>14. Their power reſulteth from Gods Law which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituteth Government, under him, and that <hi>Immediately,</hi> as to any mediate Donor, though not <hi>Immediately</hi> as without any mediate condition <hi>ſine qua non.</hi> For though Originally the peoples conſent was neceſſary to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of the perſon, or in hereditary Government, of the <hi>family,</hi> that ſhould receive the power from God; yet that is no Donation of the Power it ſelf. Even as the Kings Charter immediately giveth the power of a Mayor or Bailiff to a Corporation, though by the ſame Charter the people chooſe that perſon that ſhall receive it. Or as a woman chooſeth the man that ſhall be her Husband, but giveth him not the Government of her, for that is given by Gods inſtitution, to that perſon whom ſhe contracteth with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if ſhe ſhould agree with him that he <hi>ſhould not be her Governour,</hi> it were a nullity.</p>
            <p>15. The chief uſe of Kings and Magiſtrates is, to rule according to Gods Univerſal Laws, and to ſee them put in execution as far as the Ends of Government require in this world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:194351:34"/> 16. To which end they are to make Laws of their own.</p>
            <p>17. Their own Laws argue not the imperfection of Gods Laws, nor ſtand in co-ordination with them as a ſupplement, but are meerly like the by-Laws, or Local Laws of Corporations, ſubordinate to the Univerſal Laws of the King, and made only by a power given by him: Kings themſelves being much more under God, than Juſtices are under them.</p>
            <p>18. The <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> is <hi>unlimited</hi> and <hi>abſolute,</hi> to as any limitation of any <hi>ſuperiour humane Power</hi> (elſe it were not <hi>Soveraign).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. But beſides that <hi>it is ever limited</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> it <hi>may be</hi> alſo limited by <hi>Contract with the people,</hi> called by ſome Fundamental or Conſtitutive Laws, when a people that have a right to their <hi>lives, limbs, liberties and eſtates,</hi> do in the conſtitution of the Common-wealth, ſecure theſe from the <hi>abſolute will</hi> of the Soveraign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reſerve caſes of innocency in which they ſhall not be taken away: which are called the <hi>peoples Liberties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. Abſolute ſlaves have no Liberties or ſecurity for their Lives, limbs or eſtates.</p>
            <p>21. A <hi>Domination</hi> over <hi>ſlaves</hi> is not finally <hi>for their good,</hi> but for the <hi>will</hi> or <hi>benefit</hi> or <hi>ends</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary.</p>
            <p>22. A <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is not a ſociety of ſlaves, but of free ſubjects and of ſuch a Soveraign as is to Rule for the <hi>publick Good</hi> of the ſociety.</p>
            <p>24. He is the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and <hi>happieſt</hi> King, that by his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moſt promoteth the <hi>publick Good;</hi> which alſo is his chiefeſt <hi>Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>23. They are the wiſeſt Counſellours of Kings that moſt inſeparably twiſt their <hi>intereſt</hi> with the <hi>peoples,</hi> and ſo promote them: And they are their moſt pernicious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:194351:34"/> that would <hi>untwiſt</hi> and <hi>ſeparate</hi> their intereſts, and ſet them in jealouſies of one another, and in a ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how to get all from one another to themſelves.</p>
            <p>25. Humane Lawgivers may ſubordinately determine of thoſe things in <hi>particular,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in <hi>general;</hi> when the ends of Government re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Legal determination of them.</p>
            <p>26. As <hi>Gods Laws</hi> bind us by <hi>Primitive power</hi> to a <hi>conſcientious</hi> obedience, ſo the <hi>Kings Laws</hi> bind us by a <hi>Derived power</hi> to <hi>conſcientious</hi> obedience, which ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eptly call <hi>binding Conſcience]:</hi> The meaning is, mens Laws bind the <hi>man,</hi> and therefore primarily the <hi>ſoul</hi> (which they call the Conſcience); And there is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation at all of Laws, which is not primarily on the <hi>ſoul.</hi> And this obligation we muſt be conſcious of: Irons and Cords to bind the body immediately. To deny therefore that mens Laws thus bind the Conſcience is to deny them to be Laws.</p>
            <p>27. But as <hi>Conſcience</hi> is taken Theologically, for the <hi>judgement of a man of himſelf, as he is ſubject to the judgement of God,</hi> ſo it is all one to ſay, [<hi>men rule our Conſciences]</hi> and <hi>[men are God].</hi> It is contradiction, and can be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie. Therefore we verily believe that there is no difference among us in this point, which confounded heads pretend ſo wide a difference in: For it is ſcarce poſſible.</p>
            <p>28. Though men may as aforeſaid <hi>bind Conſciences,</hi> that is, bind the ſoul to conſcionable obedience under God, yet can they not bind us <hi>againſt Conſcience,</hi> that is, againſt the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of our duty to God, when we <hi>do not err;</hi> for that is to bind us to <hi>ſin againſt God</hi> when we <hi>know it</hi> to be ſin.</p>
            <p>29. Whoever diſobyeth Gods known Law, becauſe man commandeth him; preferreth man to God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth Gods diſpleaſure and judgements.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:194351:35"/> 30. Conſcience is not a Law-giver, Governour, or maker of duty, but a diſcerner of duty made by Laws.</p>
            <p>31. It is therefore their error that ſay <hi>Conſcience</hi> maketh it a mans duty to ſin, or maketh it no ſin to do what God forbiddeth: An erring Conſcience <hi>ligat non obligat;</hi> enſnareth in a neceſſity of ſinning till it be rectified, but doth not make ſin to be none.</p>
            <p>32. It is therefore the practice of the muddy-headed troublers of the world, to pretend that the Controverſie betwixt us is, whether the <hi>King or Conſcience</hi> be the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Governour;</hi> whenas we hold that Conſcience is <hi>no Governour</hi> at all unleſs as your <hi>eyes</hi> that read the Law, or your <hi>underſtanding</hi> which <hi>knoweth</hi> it and your duty, may be equivocally called Governours. But the queſtion (if they will make any difference from us) muſt be this, <hi>[whether the Conſcience or apprehenſion of our duty to God, and of his Commands, or of the Kings Commands, ſhould be moſt prevalent with us for obedience?]</hi> Either diſpute this, or go on to rave againſt us in your dreams.</p>
            <p>33. God doth not change his Laws, <hi>becauſe</hi> or <hi>when</hi> men err in their underſtanding of them: But whatever antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently is commanded, he ſtill commandeth though men think he forbiddeth it. And whatever he forbids he ſtill forbiddeth, when men think that he forbiddeth it not or commandeth it.</p>
            <p>34. The <hi>eſſe vel non eſſe</hi> is antecedent to the <hi>ſcire eſſe vel non eſſe:</hi> And when ever men ask, [How ſhall we know? or, who ſhall judge?] every man of brains will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that <hi>[either the thing really is, or it is not; which is to be known and judged of.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>35. The common cheat of the ignorant in all theſe kind of diſputes is, by ſuppreſſing or overlooking the queſtion <hi>do eſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and beginning with the queſtion <hi>de ſcire vel judicare:</hi> and asking firſt, <hi>[who ſhall be the judge?]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:194351:35"/> 36. So ſome ask [what is our duty when one ſaith this is the truth, and another ſaith nay but that is the the truth?] <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is antecedently true, that either <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> or <hi>neither</hi> is the <hi>truth]</hi> And (ſuppoſing it revealed to you) God bindeth you to believe that which <hi>really</hi> is the <hi>truth,</hi> whatever men ſay againſt it.</p>
            <p>37. So ſome ſay, that if the King command one thing, and Conſcience tell me, that God doth command ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, which muſt I obey?] <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, that either God doth command the contrary, or he doth not: If he doth, you are bound to obey him, and not the King. If he do not, you are bound to obey the King. For your <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>ignorance</hi> changeth not Gods Laws.</p>
            <p>38. So it is asked, what ſhall a man do whoſe (Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience telleth him that this or that (commanded perhaps by man) is <hi>duty</hi> or <hi>ſin, commanded</hi> or <hi>forbidden</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> but yet is not <hi>abſolutely certain?] Anſw.</hi> Either (antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently) <hi>it is a duty, or</hi> ſin, or <hi>it is not:</hi> If <hi>it be,</hi> he is bound to do it, or forbear it accordingly; whatever he <hi>think</hi> of it himſelf: His doubts change not Gods Laws.</p>
            <p>39. So the queſtion is, <hi>what a man ſhould do that hath an erring Conſcience? Anſw.</hi> 1. An erring Conſcience is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly called Conſcience; becauſe error is not properly ſcience: But let that paſs. 2. He is under a double obligation: The firſt is to <hi>obey Gods Laws,</hi> about which he erreth: The ſecond is, <hi>to lay by his error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>40. Queſt. <hi>But muſt he in the mean time go againſt his Conſcience? Anſw.</hi> No; nor againſt Gods Law: what God hath conjoyned, none of your queſtions muſt tempt us to put aſunder: He is ſtill under the double obligation of <hi>rectifying Conſcience, and obeying God.</hi> And both muſt be done and not one alone.</p>
            <p>41. Queſt. <hi>But it is ſuppoſed that he cannot change his judgement. What then muſt he do? Anſw.</hi> Were it through
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:194351:36"/> a <hi>natural</hi> inculpable impotency and impoſſibility, the Law would not oblige him, and ſo there would be no Law and no tranſgreſſion: But that which we ſpeak of is a <hi>moral Impotenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> through the vicious blindneſs of the mind, and corruption of the <hi>will;</hi> and God will not change his Laws, becauſe men are ſinfully indiſpoſed to obey them: When you have queſtioned to the utmoſt, the double obligation ſtill remaineth: And ſo you muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
            <p>42. But what order here muſt we obſerve; muſt we not change our judgement before we can obey? Anſw. <hi>The obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to both are both at once; But becauſe an</hi> undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned command cannot <hi>be</hi> obeyed, <hi>the order of</hi> natural ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, <hi>is, that you</hi> firſt rectifie your judgement, <hi>and then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the other commands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>43. <hi>But how ſhall a man rectifie his erring judgement? Anſw.</hi> Gods means are commonly known, though not commonly uſed. Hear, read, meditate, pray, forbear the ſin which grieveth your Guide; caſt out corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, paſſions and luſts, and lay by carnal intereſts that would pervert the judgement.</p>
            <p>44. Queſt. <hi>But what muſt we do till all this can be done? Anſw.</hi> You muſt haſten your cure with all diligence. For till it be done you will certainly live in ſin.</p>
            <p>45. So alſo if the Magiſtrates commands <hi>be lawful</hi> (the <hi>eſſe</hi> ſtill being antecedent to the <hi>ſcire)</hi> and yet the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject think them unlawful, his error will not juſtifie his diſobedience: but he is bound <hi>to judge</hi> better and to obey.</p>
            <p>46. And if the Magiſtrates commands be againſt our duty to God, and the ſubject think them to be lawful, his errors will not make them or his obedience to them to be lawful.</p>
            <p>47. Thoſe perſons who make it the principle of their obedience, that <hi>[we muſt obey the Magiſtrate when we are
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:194351:36"/> uncertain, whether it be ſin which he commandeth or not; becauſe we are certain that obedience is a duty, and the certain part muſt be preferred before the uncertain]</hi> I hope do not err with the flagitious aggravations <hi>(villanie, pious-wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, impudency &amp;c.)</hi> which the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> errors are charged with; But rather only the duſt of worldly buſineſs and contention may have confounded and ſullied Natures tables, or the heat of paſſion may have melted down its tender Characters.</p>
            <p>48. Were this univerſally and formally true, it would follow, that a mans blindneſs, error, ignorance, and ſo his doubtfulneſs, and uncertainty would juſtifie him in any villany againſt God and nature, that man can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: For inſtance, An <hi>Indian</hi> may be certain that it is his duty to obey his King, and yet uncertain whether it be a ſin to murder his parents, to eat his enemies, to be adulterous, perjured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A <hi>Turk</hi> may know that it is his duty to obey his Prince, but be uncertain whether it be a ſin to curſe Jeſus Chriſt and renounce him, and to believe in <hi>Mahomet &amp;c.</hi> A Papiſt may know that it is his duty to obey his King, and yet not know whether it be a ſin to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the bread as God, and to torment thoſe that are called Hereticks, or to worſhip Images, or ſuppreſs the Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all this ſhould be done according to this rule, if Rulers be but bad enough to command it. Nay if the Popes own ſubjects at <hi>Rome</hi> do but doubt whether it be a ſin when he commandeth them, to go and murder a forreign Prince; muſt they do this think you, becauſe of their <hi>uncertainty</hi> of the matter?</p>
            <p>49. If the matter were <hi>unrevealed,</hi> and ſo men were uncertain, becauſe God had not made known his mind, then their Rule of precedency were to be regarded; But if God have ſufficiently <hi>revealed his will,</hi> no <hi>vicious uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of it will make it a duty or lawful, to obey the contrary command of man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:194351:37"/> 50. It is one thing to be ſure that <hi>I muſt obey my Rulers in all things lawful,</hi> another thing to be ſure that <hi>I muſt obey them hic &amp; nunc:</hi> The Rule obtruded on us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth theſe; And ſo is meerly fallacious. For the former is nothing at all to our buſineſs: And of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, I can be no more certain, than I am whether it be a lawful thing which is commanded by them: for as I am ſure in general that I muſt obey them in things lawful, I am as ſure that I muſt not obey them in things forbidden by God. Therefore ſo far as I am uncertain whether the thing be ſinful or not, I muſt be as uncertain whether I muſt or may obey my Rulers in that thing.</p>
            <p>51. And we called <hi>Puritans</hi> (being the more out of love with Confuſion for the effects of it in this age among Divines) do uſe alſo farther to diſtinguiſh, of a <hi>greater evil</hi> and a <hi>leſſer,</hi> (when <hi>neither</hi> of them is to be <hi>choſen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither is <hi>good.)</hi> And we ſay it is an <hi>aggravated Crime</hi> to chooſe a <hi>Greater ſin</hi> before a <hi>leſs,</hi> when a man hath brought himſelf into a preſent moral impotency of avoiding both: we diſtinguiſh alſo between the <hi>Matter,</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>weight</hi> of the things doubted of.</p>
            <p>And ſo we reſolve, that if I be certain that I who am a poor low ſubject, am bound to obey a Juſtice of Peace, in all things lawful (by Gods Laws and the Kings); And a Juſtice commandeth me to do ſome little act, which I know not whether the Law forbid or not, I will obey him: But if he bid me do that, which I am in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and would endanger the <hi>life of the King,</hi> or the <hi>ſafety</hi> of his Kingdoms, though I be <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> yet I will forbear.</p>
            <p>And if a Ruler bid me read a Chapter in the old Teſtament to day, and I be uncertain whether God would not have me read one in the New Teſtament, as fitter to the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:194351:37"/> Auditors, I will obey my Rulers in this caſe, not becauſe I am <hi>certain at all</hi> that <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> it is my duty <hi>formally</hi> to obey them; but becauſe I take the <hi>diſobeying</hi> them, in caſe it <hi>ſhould</hi> now prove a ſin, to be a <hi>Greater ſin</hi> than the <hi>miſchooſing of the Chapter</hi> would be if <hi>that</hi> ſhould prove the ſin; and to chooſe the <hi>greater ſin,</hi> is a greater aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that great ſin.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, if man command me the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or the omiſſions, which if they ſhould prove unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful would prove to be <hi>Perjury,</hi> yea the ſtigmatizing of <hi>Cities and Corporations, Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> in the front with PER, or would prove a <hi>murdering</hi> of <hi>mens ſouls;</hi> and if on the contrary, it ſhould prove lawful to do theſe things, yet the not doing them will have no other evil, than <hi>not obeying the Law;</hi> (in <hi>ſuch uncertainty)</hi> or my own <hi>perſonal ſuffering;</hi> here I would rather <hi>not obey,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>uncertain</hi> of the matter commanded. Not becauſe I <hi>am ſure</hi> which is my duty at all in it ſelf; but that I am ſure that to prefer the <hi>greater evil,</hi> when I <hi>know</hi> not the good, is an <hi>aggravation</hi> of that evil: And <hi>ſo to ſin,</hi> is a double and more dangerous ſin.</p>
            <p>52. Every Rational creature under Heaven hath a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diſcerning, called a <hi>Private judgment,</hi> by which all muſt <hi>try, know</hi> and <hi>guide</hi> their duties to God and man: And to deny them this is to make them Bruits, and Kings to be but Governours of Cattel; and to tell men, that they muſt not know <hi>when</hi> to obey or <hi>whom:</hi> And it is to go againſt the judgment of all the ſober world.</p>
            <p>53. But no ſubject as ſuch, or private man, hath any <hi>Publick deciſive judgment;</hi> nor muſt in caſes Religious or Civil claim the leaſt degree thereof.</p>
            <p>54. Inferior Magiſtrates have all their Power from the King as ſupream.</p>
            <p>55. There is no <hi>external coactive</hi> or <hi>forcing power,</hi> no
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:194351:38"/> not about matters Religious or Eccleſiaſtical, but in the King and Magiſtracie; and therefore none in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or in any ſubjects, unleſs as Magiſtrates under the King. That is, no other hath the power of the ſword, or to touch the Bodies or Eſtates of men.</p>
            <p>56. Power may be called [EXTERNAL] or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal in ſeveral reſpects; 1. In regard of the <hi>Agent:</hi> And ſo the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God hath the <hi>Internal Power,</hi> and Magiſtrates, Parents and Paſtors have <hi>External.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In regard of the <hi>Actions commanded,</hi> Internal or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal: And ſo the Power of Magiſtrates is both <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and <hi>External,</hi> that is, They may command inward fidelitie, honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to God to Parents and to themſelves (though they cannot ſee when it is performed alone;) And they may command <hi>outward</hi> actions; But the <hi>later</hi> is their moſt common work. And Paſtors have both <hi>Internal</hi> and <hi>External</hi> power; And may in Gods name as his Miniſters, command inward Love and Repentance, and outward worſhipping of God, Prayers, Sacraments, Aſſemblies, Confeſſions, learning Catechiſms, obeying the King and Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. In regard of the <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>inſtrument</hi> of Government. And ſo God hath the Internal Power, becauſe he only can by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſpiritual agency</hi> rule the mind: And Kings and Paſtors have the <hi>external</hi> Power, that is, do Govern by <hi>Voice</hi> and <hi>Writings,</hi> which are external ſigns and means.</p>
            <p>4. In regard to the <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>ſubject Governed:</hi> And ſo the Power of Magiſtrates is both <hi>Internal</hi> and <hi>external;</hi> for they Govern both <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>body:</hi> For there is no Ruling of mens <hi>Bodies</hi> by <hi>Laws,</hi> unleſs they firſt rule the <hi>mind:</hi> for Laws force not the Locomotive power immediately. And ſo <hi>Paſtors</hi> have both <hi>External</hi> and <hi>Internal</hi> Power, becauſe by Gods word they Rule firſt the <hi>mind,</hi> and by that the <hi>Body;</hi> as to forbear ſin, to worſhip God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:194351:38"/> 5. In regard of the <hi>Neareſt Ruling Act.</hi> And ſo the King and Magiſtrate hath the <hi>Internal</hi> and <hi>External</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: <hi>Internal;</hi> becauſe he may ſpeak in his <hi>Precepts</hi> to the <hi>Mind</hi> even in Gods name, as well as Miniſters may: <hi>External,</hi> becauſe he may <hi>puniſh the body</hi> immediately. But Paſtors ſo have none of the <hi>External Power,</hi> becauſe they touch not the <hi>outward man,</hi> that is, <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Purſe</hi> immediately, nor <hi>Rule it</hi> but only <hi>mediately</hi> by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Mind: ſo that if you will ambiguouſly apply the name of <hi>External Power,</hi> only to <hi>Coercive</hi> or <hi>Coactive</hi> Power by <hi>Outward force,</hi> no ſubject, no Paſtors have any ſuch, but only the King and Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>57. O that Kings would once all agree to make the Church and world ſo happy, as to keep all this <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal forcing power</hi> to themſelves: and not to truſt it in the hands of Clergymen, nor lend their ſwords to angry Prieſts to revenge their quarrels on one another; nor yet be themſelves the <hi>meer Executioners</hi> of the ſentences of the Presbyters or Prelats; but if they will needs quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, leave them to do it with their proper weapons, while the Magiſtrate himſelf doth repreſs their inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and keep the peace. The worſt Magiſtrates almoſt were like to uſe the ſword more harmleſly, than the Secular Clergy hath hitherto done, through moſt of all the Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>58. Though Kings have no <hi>Authority againſt God,</hi> they have a Power which it is too poſſible to abuſe to ſin, againſt many of Gods Laws, and yet not forfeit their office or true Authority thereby.</p>
            <p>59. In caſe of <hi>ſome abuſe</hi> of Power, the ſubject may be bound to obey him that abuſeth it in that <hi>very act or thing.</hi> That is, when it is a thing that God forbiddeth the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to <hi>command,</hi> but doth not forbid the ſubject to <hi>do,</hi> it may become a duty on ſeveral accounts to do that thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:194351:39"/> 60. The reaſon is, becauſe it is <hi>Gods Law to ſubjects,</hi> and not Gods Law <hi>to Kings,</hi> which ſubjects muſt be ruled by, and their actions judged by.</p>
            <p>61. And modeſt ſubjects muſt rather ſtudy what Laws God hath made <hi>for themſelves,</hi> than what Laws he hath made for <hi>Kings:</hi> and what is their <hi>own duty</hi> than what is the <hi>Kings:</hi> (Though of this they are not bound to be ignorant.)</p>
            <p>62. When ſubjects may <hi>not obey,</hi> yet may they not by <hi>arms reſiſt</hi> authority.</p>
            <p>63. To pretend Religion for Rebellion or ſedition (which is the greateſt enemy to it in the world) is to aggravate the ſin, by intimated blaſphemy againſt the Author of Religion.</p>
            <p>64. When ſubjects ſuffer from Kings for obeying God, they muſt not take occaſion by it to <hi>diſhonour</hi> Kings by aggravating the injury: Becauſe the Kings honour is more neceſſary to the publick peace and welfare, than the righting of a ſubjects injured reputation is.</p>
            <p>65. Therefore we muſt nor make too great a noiſe in complaining of ſuch ſufferings, nor make them ſeem greater than they are; but rather (ſecretly rejoycing in Gods juſtification of the innocent) openly take as much of the blame to our ſelves as we can in truth, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>benefits</hi> which <hi>we</hi> have by <hi>ſuffering,</hi> and the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> by <hi>Magiſtracie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>66. It is not lawful for any Paſtors to publiſh <hi>excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications</hi> againſt Kings, (no nor againſt <hi>Parents,</hi> or any <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> on whoſe <hi>Honour</hi> the publick good dependeth.) The reaſon is, becauſe that the <hi>Natural Law</hi>

            </p>
            <p>67. But if a Pope or Prelate or Presbytery, to whom Kings never committed the care of their ſouls, ſhall by uſurpation pretend to a power over Kings, which they have not, and ſo excommunicate them to their publick diſhonour, this is a more hainous crime; being treaſonable in ſubjects, and hoſtility in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners.</p>
            <p>68. Yet thoſe Paſtors whom Princes have choſen to that ſpecial truſt, muſt be very faithful in acquainting them with their ſins and duty to God, and not for fear or flattery betray their ſouls and the publick good.</p>
            <p>69. And ſo great is the ſin of Tyranny and oppreſſion and perſecution, and ſo grand an impediment to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and mens ſalvation among <hi>Turks, Tartarians, Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Perſians,</hi> and the far greateſt part of all the world, that all wiſe and good Princes will take thoſe for their moſt pernicious enemies, that would by flattery tempt them to ſo great a ſin, (though on pretence of honouring them)</p>

            <p>THat miſtake, deſign or malice may not make a charge of diſloyalty, or ſeditious principles and minds, to paſs for a pretence of our reſtraint from the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, which we were devoted to in our Ordination, three things ſeem needful for us to make known. I. What are the principles of policie, which we hold. II. Our profeſſion, reſolution and promiſe as to our practice. III. what diſloyal, Traiterous and ſeditious opinions and practices we renounce.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <p>I. About the firſt our ſtraight is great: If we make not known our principles, we ſhall be ſuſpected for conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; And any miſtake which any one of us was guilty of, even in our unexperienced youth, though cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and rejected, will be charged ſtill on him, and on others that never owned it; And ſhameleſs falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers will defame us, as holding that which never came into our thoughts. And if we publiſh our judgements, how eaſily and certainly will ignorance and ill-will take occaſion to calumniate, and draw blood from the trueſt ſoundeſt words? But we will do what we judge to be our duty, and leave it to God to ſtop the mouth of all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:194351:40"/> iniquity, and will ſtay till malice and falſehood be ſilenced by the Father of lights.</p>
               <p>1. We hold that though it be very uſeful to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel to ſtudy Politicks, yet is to not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that they be able to decide political controverſies; much leſs that they equall Lawyers in the knowledge of the Laws; and therefore that they ſhould not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neceſſity, be forward to meddle in ſuch matters, much leſs to take on them to condemn the moſt of the Lawyers of the world, as if we were wiſer in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their profeſſion than they: And leaſt of all ſhould we <hi>ſwear againſt</hi> their common ſentiments, or that they are all deceived, and that we are wiſer than all they. Though yet we ſhould know ſo much, as is requiſite to our due underſtanding of the matter of our duty and our doctrine, which we muſt teach.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>By</hi> [Authority] <hi>here we mean</hi> [A Right <hi>and</hi> Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to Govern particular ſocieties <hi>by</hi> Legiſlation (or precept) and Judgement, for the Common good, in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to God, the only ſupream univerſal Governour, and his univerſal Laws <hi>and</hi> final judgement.]</p>
               <p>3. GOD is the fountain or firſt <hi>efficient chief Ruler,</hi> and <hi>ultimate</hi> end, of all true <hi>Authority</hi> (or Right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment): For of him, and through him, and to him are all things.</p>
               <p>4. God hath made no Univerſal Vicarious meer humane Governour under himſelf, Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, Perſonal or Collective, (Pope or Council): nor ordained any Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Teacher or Apoſtle; Though he ſent forth many into all the world Indefinitely to Teach as many as they could. For no mortal man, or Collective body is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally capable of it.</p>
               <p>5. Therefore he that claimeth ſuch an Apoſtolick and Eccleſiaſtical Power as <hi>Vicarious</hi> with Obligation to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:194351:41"/> it, condemneth himſelf for betraying the moſt of mankind, for he doth not exerciſe it at the Antipodes, or to the fifth part of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. No more doth Chriſt who yet is the Vniverſal Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. Anſw.</hi> Chriſt is the Light of the world, and all things are committed into his hand: And though he ſend not preachers of the Goſpel eventually to all, he ſendeth them all that commoner Light, means and mercies which call them to Repentance, and to ſeek to a pardoning graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God; ſo that his Teaching and Rule is univerſal, though not equally.</p>
               <p>6. The Pope claimeth an Univerſal Power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, over all Chriſtian Princes and States, yea over all the world: And the Papiſt Doctors aſſert it in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; ſome in things <hi>ſpiritual;</hi> ſome in <hi>things ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>temporal,</hi> and ſome in <hi>things ſpiritual</hi> and in <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals</hi> in <hi>order to ſpirituals.</hi> Accordingly in their Councils they make Decrees which ſhall be obligatory to Kings and Kingdoms, and have declared themſelves empower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet up Princes and pull them down, to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate and depoſe them, and force them to Oaths and obedience, or elſe to give their Dominions to others that will obey: yea if they will not burn or exterminate all as Hereticks who hold the Chriſtian Doctrine which we call Proteſtant, yea that will not in the matter of Tranſubſtantiation, deny belief to all mens ſenſes. By which claim of Government over all Kings, and Laws for ſuch execution, we ſuppoſe that the <hi>Roman</hi> Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth himſelf to be <hi>Hoſtis publicus</hi> to all Chriſtian Princes and States who do not voluntarily make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves his ſubjects, and alloweth them to judge and uſe him accordingly.</p>
               <p>7. God hath given Power to none againſt himſelf, or his Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:194351:41"/> 8. God hath given power to none to deſtroy the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good;</hi> except ſuch Kingdoms as the <hi>Canaanites, &amp;c.</hi> that by revelation were judged to deſtruction, or ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Countries as by unjuſt enmity to their neighbours may by the Law of Nature and Nations be deſtroyed for the neceſſary preſervation of the reſt.</p>
               <p>9. Therefore all Laws and Mandates that are notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly againſt God or his Laws, or the common ſafety (that is, deſtructive to the Common-wealth and welfare) are <hi>ipſo facto null,</hi> or not obligatory, no more than a Juſtices precepts againſt the King.</p>
               <p>10. <hi>Submiſſion</hi> yet may be a duty, and <hi>reſiſtance</hi> a ſin, where <hi>obedience</hi> is not due; of which more anon in due place.</p>
               <p>11. The people are not the fountain of <hi>power,</hi> nor the donors of it; nor, as ſuch, have they any right to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, either to <hi>uſe</hi> themſelves or to <hi>give</hi> to <hi>others;</hi> Though they or part of them may have ſome in Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracies by the ſpecies of the Government, or in mixt Governments; but otherwiſe they have none by Nature. The Government of Republicks is not by an arbitrary Collation of each mans perſonal power to ſome one: But God hath prevented them, and made it neceſſary by the Law of Nature and Scripture, that there be Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours as his Officers under him, to whom the people ſhall ſubmit, in all caſes where ſuch can be had; and hath given them univerſal Laws according to which they muſt Rule.</p>
               <p>12. But becauſe <hi>Nature</hi> hath given no one perſon or family a Right more than others, to Rule Kingdoms antecedently to the peoples conſent, therefore the people had at the forming of ſuch ſocieties the choice of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or families that ſhould govern, and without their conſent none were capable recipients of that power: ſo
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:194351:42"/> that as the Kings Charter immediately giveth the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Mayor, or Bailiff to the perſon whom the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens ſhall chooſe, which choice giveth him no power but only maketh him capable to receive it from the Kings Charter; even ſo Gods Law and Charter obligeth the people to chooſe or conſent to that family or perſon that ſhall Rule them, and giveth Authority (with obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to uſe it) to thoſe whom the ſaid conſent hath made the capable due recipients.</p>
               <p>13. Therefore Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> maxime is falſe as to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Power, that [the King is <hi>ſingulis major,</hi> but <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſis minor:]</hi> and ſo is his aſſertion that all power of Legiſlation is <hi>naturally</hi> in the <hi>whole body</hi> (what it may be by the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> or <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the Government, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that queſtion), and his talk of the Soveraigns <hi>dependence</hi> on, yea and <hi>ſubjection to the body,</hi> and his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that when the line is extinct [the <hi>power cometh by eſcheate to the people]</hi> and many ſuch like; In all which he miſtaketh Power of <hi>chooſing Governours, who ſhall receive power from God only,</hi> for the power it ſelf of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning,</hi> which the people as ſuch have not at all. The King is not <hi>Vniverſis melior indeed,</hi> but the <hi>Bonum publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> is the end of his Government, and the good of all the Kingdom is better than his own, and more his end; but yet even there his <hi>own Honour</hi> and <hi>welfare,</hi> is part of the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good</hi> and <hi>End.</hi> But whoever hath the <hi>whole ſupream power</hi> in any Kingdom or other Republick, is <hi>univerſis major.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. <hi>Propriety</hi> is <hi>naturally antecedent</hi> to <hi>Government,</hi> which doth not <hi>Give it,</hi> but <hi>regulate it</hi> to the <hi>Common good:</hi> Every man is born with a propriety in his <hi>own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> and nature giveth him a propriety in <hi>his Children,</hi> and his <hi>food</hi> and other juſt <hi>acquiſitions</hi> of his induſtry. Therefore no Ruler can juſtly deprive men of their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:194351:42"/> unleſs it be by ſome <hi>Law of God</hi> (as in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Juſtice on ſuch as forfeit it) or by their <hi>own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> by <hi>themſelves</hi> or their <hi>Delegates</hi> or <hi>Progenitors;</hi> And mens <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> are the chief parts of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. That is the peoples juſt <hi>reſerved Property,</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> which neither <hi>God taketh from them,</hi> by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which his own Laws give the Rulers, nor is <hi>given away</hi> by their <hi>

               <p>15. Uſurpers have no true Power (or <hi>Jus regendi);</hi> nor do their commands (whether they be <hi>Civil or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical</hi> Uſurpers) bind any one in Conſcience to formal obedience; nor may they be ſet up and defended againſt the Lawful Governour. But <hi>materially</hi> many good and lawful things may be done which they command when the <hi>Common good</hi> and <hi>perſonal ſafety</hi> require it, without owning their <hi>authority</hi> as <hi>true,</hi> which is <hi>none,</hi> and without <hi>formal obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>16. Thoſe are Uſurpers, Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, who have not authority given them by God, immediately nor mediately: <hi>Inferior</hi> Magiſtrates have authority from God, in that they have it from the King, or other ſupreme Rulers, whom God empowereth to make inferior Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, as their officers.</p>
               <p>17. A Perſon utterly uncapable receiveth no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from God.</p>
               <p>18. Thoſe are Uſurpers (Civil or Eccleſiaſtical) who by force or fraud depoſe the Lawful Governour and take his place: And thoſe that <hi>ſede vacante</hi> ſeize on the place without any conſent of the people; either on pretence of meer conqueſt, or (as <hi>Mahomet)</hi> on falſe pretence of Divine revelation or Commiſſion, or on pretence of their greater worthineſs: ſaving that the ſupream Power may impoſe on the people his inferior officers, and they are bound to obey them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:194351:43"/> 19. They that are made Rulers only of one kind or from of a Republick, and ſhall without authority from God or the peoples conſent change that kind or form of Government into another, and aſſme that other, are Uſurpers as to that new uſurped form, though not as to the former.</p>
               <p>20. Government is the conjunct exerciſe of <hi>Power, wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> for the right ordering of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth for the preſent and future happineſs of the people and the Governours.</p>
               <p>21. God is Love and ruleth us as <hi>our Father;</hi> and his works of Love are his moſt Lovely repreſentation; And that is the beſt Governour who is likeſt unto God: when Love is the predominant principle in Government, and Prince and people dearly love each other; that Kingdom is likeſt unto heaven! Yet muſt Rulers be a terrour to the wicked.</p>
               <p>22. Subjects are bound to take their Rulers, not as their <hi>own creatures,</hi> to ſet up and take down as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Souldiers did: (For then to obey a Ruler would be but radically to obey themſelves, or to obey their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants): But as the Officers of God, who communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth authority to them, and ſo to honour and obey God in them, as we do the King in his inferiour Magiſtrates: And ſo to obey for Conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p>23. Subjects are bound not only to fear their Rulers, but to <hi>Love them:</hi> and to ſhun that fear which tendeth to hatred.</p>
               <p>24. God muſt be firſt obeyed, and no man againſt him, by breaking any of his Laws, particular or general.</p>
               <p>25. But if Governours command us to ſin againſt God, though Subjects muſt not obey them, yet muſt they pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſuffer wrong and not reſiſt them by rebellion: Much leſs may they uſe arms without their conſent, to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:194351:43"/> reform others, or to bring in any novelty, yea or the true Religion by ſuch unauthorized violence.</p>
               <p>26. The inferior Magiſtrates are the ſubjects of the King, as well as the meaneſt men, and therefore have no power to depoſe him, or to take up arms againſt him any more than other ſubjects.</p>
               <p>27. Subjects muſt not only forbear all Treaſon, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or rebellion by arms, but muſt preferr the Kings life before each of their own, and muſt hazard their lives when called to it, to preſerve him; and muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt all conſpiracies againſt him.</p>
               <p>28. If we are wronged by unjuſt defamations or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion or perſecution, as long as Rulers <hi>deſtroy not the Common-wealth,</hi> particular Subjects muſt not vindicate their own right ſo much as by <hi>diſhonouring</hi> their Soveraign; becauſe his honour is more neceſſary than our Rights to the common good.</p>
               <p>29. The Union of the King and people is the life of the Kingdom; and dividing is deſtroying: Therefore an <hi>Vniting</hi> of their <hi>Intereſts</hi> is a chief point in policie; and ſetting their Intereſts as divided in oppoſition or ſupici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of each other is pernicious.</p>
               <p>30. Therefore it is againſt the Conſtitution of the Common-wealth, for the King to raiſe war againſt his Kingdom as their enemy, or for the Kingdom to raiſe war againſt the King: King <hi>James</hi> aſſerts the firſt, and the Reaſon of Government proveth both.</p>
               <p>31. The command of a Prince, (whether ſober or in drink, or paſſion) to any ſubject, to deſtroy the Prince himſelf (as <hi>Saul</hi> did command one) or to deſtroy the Common-wealth, or to break the Laws of God, or the fixed Laws of the Land, will not juſtifie the ſubject that obeyeth that command, nor doth give him right to impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:194351:44"/> before God, or in the Courts of Juſtice, except in ſuch caſes as the Law it ſelf excepth.</p>
               <p>32. The Time, Place and other circumſtances of duty are not always to be the ſame; And the Rulers command to alter ſuch unfixed circumſtances, when it deſtroyeth not the ſubſtance, is to be obeyed; though the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>duty it ſelf</hi> (Praying, preaching, hearing, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, alms) is not to be obeyed, becauſe Gods au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is the higheſt.</p>
               <p>33. Though no mans command can warrant us to ſin againſt God, yet ſome things which are antecedently ſinful but by a <hi>ſmaller Accident</hi> (as that it offendeth one of my neighbours) may become a duty by the Law of the King, that Law and the conſequents of the action, being more preponderating circumſtances to oblige us to do it, than the other is againſt it.</p>
               <p>34. Though Princes are under the obligation of <hi>Gods Laws</hi> and their <hi>own contracts,</hi> as well as others; yet as <hi>Laws</hi> are the Inſtruments of Government, no one is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Law as ſuch that is not under Government. And therefore no Soveraign is under his own Laws as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Laws; though he may by the bonds of <hi>fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and juſtice</hi> and for the <hi>Common good</hi> be obliged to Govern the ſubjects by them, and to be exemplary in what concerneth himſelf, and be under thoſe contracts which are called <hi>Fundamental</hi> or <hi>Conſtitutive Laws,</hi> made by common conſent to ſecure the ſubjects rights: which I ſuppoſe is <hi>R. Hookers</hi> meaning when he ſaith that <hi>Lex facit Regem,</hi> and that the King hath ſo much power as the Law giveth him.</p>
               <p>35. Though Politicks and Lawyers tell us that <hi>Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power</hi> is the firſt part of the <hi>ſupreme power,</hi> and who ever hath part in the Legiſlative power hath part in the ſupream power, yet that is not meant of ſuch a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:194351:44"/> derived power as Corporations may have by Charter, to make only Local by-Laws for themſelves, which bind not the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>36. As to the caſes which Politicks, Lawyers, and Divines, Papiſts and Proteſtants, inſtance in (ſuch as <hi>Barclay, Grotius, Bilſon,</hi> &amp;c.) in which ſubjects may reſiſt Kings by arms, we leave them to thoſe that are ſitter Judges; concluding only that, 1. No humane power can abrogate the Law of Nature; 2. that God hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited all humane power; 3. that their own contracts limit them; 4. That ſubjects ſhould not be tempted to odious thoughts of Kings, by the ſavage deſcription of them, as being authorized to burn, rob, kill the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent at their pleaſure, if they will not renounce God, Chriſt or humanity, and to deſtroy all the people. Such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions are made by the enemies of Government. 5. That commiſſioned ſubjects or Souldiers are not Kings, but ſubjects ſtill, and under Law. 6. That if we ſhould ſee a Commiſſion under the broad Seal, to ſeize on the Kings guards, forts, treaſure, navy, or hurt the King, or deſtroy Monarchy, or deliver the Kingdom to foreigners, or to deſtroy the Kingdom, Laws, Property, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, City cauſeleſly, we are bound to judge that the treachery of the keeper of the Seal or ſome other and not the King was the author of ſuch a Commiſſion. 7. All men ſhould love their Country and the common good better than their lives.</p>

I do (with due reverence to the perſons) reject the opinion of many Authors of Politicks, and great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, who ſay that the <hi>Majeſtas realis is in the people,</hi> and the <hi>Majeſtas Perſonalis in the King,</hi> and that <hi>Governing Power is but the Collation of each mans ſingular power over his own perſon</hi> and <hi>eſtate,</hi> and <hi>the committing it to one for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſafety.</hi> And that the people give the power, and may queſtion the Prince, and reſume it when there is cauſe. And ſo we reject the doctrine of Mr. <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> in his <hi>Eccl. Polit.</hi> lib. 1. and 8. (with due reſpect to his judiciouſneſs) and all other Epiſcopal Divines of his mind, who ſaith that [<q>By the natural Law whereto God hath made all ſubject, the lawful power of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laws to command whole ſocieties of men, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo properly to the ſame entire ſocieties, that for ANY Prince or Potentate, of WHAT KINDSOE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VER upon earth, to exerciſe the ſame of himſelf, and not either by expreſs Commiſſion immediately and perſonally received from God, or elſe by Authority derived at firſt from their conſent upon whoſe perſons they impoſe Laws, it is no better than meer Tyranny: Laws they are not which publick approbation hath not made ſo.</q>] He maketh the peoples [giving Authority] neceſſary, where their Conſent to the family or perſon that ſhall receive it from God is enough: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

By Dependency we mean ſubordination and ſubjection: A manifeſt token of which dependency may be this; As there is no more certain argument that lands are held under any as Lords, than if we ſee that ſuch lands in defect of heirs fall unto them by eſcheat; In like manner it doth follow rightly, that ſeeing Dominion when there is none to inherite it, returneth to the body, therefore they which before were inheritors of it did hold it in dependence on the body; ſo by comparing the body with the head, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power it ſeemeth <hi>always</hi> to reſide in both, Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally and Radically in one; in the other deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively: In one the Habit, in the other the Act of Power <hi>(vid. caet. paſſim)</hi>—When all which the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

               <p>IV. We reject (as is aforeſaid) their opinion who hold that it is Lawful to take up Arms againſt the King, his <hi>perſon, authority, dignity</hi> or <hi>right</hi>

               <p>V. We reject the Papal Uſurpation of a Government over Princes, by claim of an Univerſal Vicarſhip under Chriſt: And becauſe the Decrees of their General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils approved by the Pope, are their very <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>e. g.</hi> the Lateran Council <hi>ſub Innoc. 3.</hi> decreeth that thoſe that hold not Tranſubſtantiation be exterminated as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and that the ſecular powers ſhall ſwear to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate them; and if any Temporal Lords do it not, the Pope may excommunicate them, and abſolve their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their Allegiance, and give their dominions to others that will do it; we therefore are conſtrained to reject ſuch parts of the very Religion of the Papiſts as a Rebellious Religion, and the Pope as a declared enemy to Chriſtian Kings and Kingdoms, which are not his Voluntary Subjects.</p>
               <p>VI. Seeing that by the ſaid <hi>Papal Religion</hi> or <hi>Laws,</hi> all Proteſtants and others that are not Papiſts, are <hi>Dead men in Law</hi> where thoſe Laws are received, and muſt be <hi>burnt as Hereticks</hi> or <hi>exterminated,</hi> and the Princes
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:194351:49"/> or other ſecular Powers that will not ſwear it and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, are themſelves to be excommunicate and depoſed; we do therefore deteſt as treacherous to Princes, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all ſuch as would perſwade <hi>any Prince</hi> or <hi>Ruler of a Proteſtant, Greek</hi> or other <hi>Countrey</hi> not <hi>yet Papiſts,</hi> to <hi>become a Papiſt:</hi> and thereby to expoſe himſelf to the <hi>Popes depoſing of him,</hi> or to <hi>deſtroy his own kingdom,</hi> &amp; to caſt before his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects a temptation to diſpute ſuch queſtions, as <hi>[whether any Prince have Power from God to burn</hi> or <hi>exterminate his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</hi> &amp; <hi>how far they</hi> ſhould own him which by his very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is obliged ſo to do on pains of excommunication, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and damnation. But where the Kingdom are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Papiſts, it is only the ſin againſt God in the deſtruction of <hi>ſome innocents</hi> or the Princes depoſition, and not the Kingdoms deſtruction that is in the way.</p>
               <p>VII. We reject the opinion whether of the Papiſts or of any Proteſtants (if there be ſuch) who hold that Kings or other Rulers on whom the Government and welfare of the Kingdom or other Republick lyeth, may be excommunicated to their publick diſhonour: Becauſe Gods moral Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which bids Honour our Father and Mother and our King, doth bind before Laws of meer Rites and order, And the moſt publick good is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: And the Honour of the King is neceſſary to his ſucceſsful Government, and ſo the publick good and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Chriſt taught us even in caſes of ſuch nature to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that <hi>God will have mercy</hi> and not <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> And order is for the preſervation and not for the deſtruction of the ſociety ordered: Therefore though Baptiſm and the Lords Supper and Abſolution may be denyed to a King that is utterly uncapable of them, yet is he not to be diſhonoured by an open excommunication (which is purpoſely to ſhame offenders) much leſs by any of his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:194351:49"/> Subjects that never were called by him to be his Guides; And leaſt of all by a foreign Uſurper.</p>
               <p>VIII. We reject their doctrine who ſubject Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes and States to the Power of foreigners under the name of <hi>General Councils:</hi> As if Chriſt had given a power of Univerſal Legiſlation and Judgement, though not to a <hi>Perſonal</hi> yet to a <hi>Collective body;</hi> whoſe Laws all the Chriſtian world is bound to obey: when indeed there never was, will be, or can be any true General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of all the Churches in the world, nor did ever Chriſt inſtitute ſuch a thing. The firſt controverſie between us and the Papiſts is not, <hi>Who it is that is the Univerſal Governour of</hi> the Chriſtian world (or Church) <hi>under Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the ſecond part of <hi>Baxters Key</hi> for <hi>Catholicks</hi> where it is fully proved that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils never were or can be or ought to be.</note> 
                  <hi>whether Pope or Council:</hi> But whether there be any ſuch Univerſal Governour at all? which we utterly deny; were there any at all, we would ſooner yield that it is the Pope (who is in being) than that it is a true Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council which never was in being: And if any cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Proteſtants would betray King and Kingdom into Subjection to a foreign Power under the falſe name of a General Council, we waſh our hands from ſuch diſloyalty; as knowing well by the Map of the Roman Empire, and the <hi>Notitiae Epiſcopatuum,</hi> and by the names of the ſubſcribing Biſhops, and by the power of the Emperours that called them, and other notices of hiſtory, that even the four firſt great approved Councils were but ſome part of the Biſhops of the Empire, (unleſs ſome borderer accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtept in) and not at all of the reſt of the Chriſtian world: And if <hi>England</hi> were ſometime ſubject to that Empire, yet is it not ſo now. The Clergy of one Prince have no power of Government over all other Princes and their Clergy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:194351:50"/> IX. We reject their doctrine who teach that the King or other Rulers are bound to puniſh men by the ſword, meerly becauſe being excommunicate they repent not and reconcile not themſelves to the Clergy; As if Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were the Lictors or executioners of the Clergy, or were bound to burn, baniſh, impriſon or fine their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, becauſe the Clergy (Pope, Prelates or <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries)</hi> do excommunicate them, and require it of them; be the ſentence right or wrong: And we much deſire that Princes would not ſo nearly annex their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments to the Clergies cenſures, as may ſeem to countenance ſuch injurious and diſhonourable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of the Clergy, or as may countenance them that ſcorn Church diſcipline as a leaden ſword or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, unleſs the ſword of the Magiſtrates enforce it.</p>
               <p>X. We like not the dangerous Concluſion of <hi>[No Biſhop No King],</hi> though we judge not ſuch a word when by a ſound expoſition the danger is avoided.</p>
               <p>XI. We reject their doctrine who hold that the Clergy is exempt from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the King,<note place="margin">The Papiſts.</note> as if they were not his <hi>Subjects,</hi> and he might not puniſh them for common enemies, yea and for groſs <hi>male-adminiſtration</hi> and <hi>unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> in the Miniſtry, as he may puniſh Phyſicians, or Lawyers for the like in their profeſſions.</p>
               <p>XII.

               <p>XIII. We deteſt their doctrine who ſay that not Kings, but only the Clergy are Judges in matters of faith, or Religion, or of Hereſie: whenas every man is to judge where he is to Govern and execute. And as every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject hath a <hi>Diſcerning judgement</hi> to know what is his own Duty and what is ſin; and the Paſtors of the Church have that publick Ecceſiaſtical Judgement, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

               <p>XIV. Though there be ſome reverend perſons that hold that Miniſters only hold their power from Chriſt as Redeemer, and Magiſtrates not ſo, but only from God the Creator as ruling by common providence, and not by Chriſt, we greatly diſſent from this conceit, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God who after the fall ſet up a Law or Covenant of Grace to all mankind, in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> doth govern none on earth, either by ſuch providence as he govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth bruits without Law; nor yet by the firſt Law of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency or perfection alone (making Innocency the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Life, to them that are already guilty) but all are under a Law of grace: And all perſons and things are delivered to Chriſt, and put into his hands and power, and he is made Head over all things to the Church, even the Lord of dead and living, and the general adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, even among them that hear not of his name: All judgement is committed to him, <hi>(Joh. 5. 22.

And they that ſay that the world hath ſo good a thing as Magiſtracy without Chriſts procurement, may next feign many more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to be given to the miſerable without Chriſt, and ſo that God could pardon ſin without him, and next that we be ſaved and come to heaven without him, and his grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:194351:51"/> XV.

               <p>XVI.

               <p>XVIII. We deteſt the treachery of ſuch as would <hi>divide</hi> the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of <hi>the King and his Kingdom</hi> further than they are unavoidably differenced by Nature; and that would perſwade Kings that the <hi>Common Good</hi> is not the <hi>end of Government,</hi> but that it is their Intereſt to take down the welfare of the people, and get them as low as to liberties and wealth as they can: For the Uniting of the <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> of King and Kingdom, is the ſumm of the true Art of Governing, next to the pleaſing of God.</p>
               <p>XIX. Much more do we abhorr their treachery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Kings, who would both expoſe them to Gods Juſtice, and the peoples hard thoughts, by ſetting them either above God or in competition with him, or build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Kingdoms in the air and not on God; we mean ſpecially ſuch as deny all Monarchs to be <hi>Limited by God,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:194351:52"/> and to be ſubject to his Laws: And were they Abſolute and not limited by God, they might command all the Subjects to curſe God, to renounce Chriſt and their Salvation, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Devil, and to violate all the Laws of Nature; which would ſubvert their own foundation.</p>
               <p>XX. Accordingly we reject their treachery, that would make it the peoples duty to be of the Kings Religion, be it what it will be, and ſo among <hi>Turks,</hi> and Papiſts and Pagans, to be <hi>Mahometans,</hi> Papiſts or Heathens; and to obey the King againſt God; Nothing more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring Kings than when they are ſet up as in Gods place or as againſt him.</p>

               <p>XXII. We renounce the treachery of ſuch as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Monarchs odious to the very nature of their Subjects, (who are ruled by intereſt), by terrible deſcriptions of their Power, as <hi>abſolute;</hi> and as ſuch as may when they pleaſe ſeize on all mens eſtates, deſtroy the Innocent, Commiſſion their ſervants to kill Parliaments, burn Cities, ſell all as ſlaves to others, and the inſtruments may not be reſiſted: when it is known that terrible deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons breed ſuch fears as tend to hatred; And hatred is virtual rebellion: And when all people ſee that their lives, liberties and eſtates have no ſecurity but the will of one mutable man, it maketh them like men among
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:194351:53"/> enemies, in continual ſuſpicion; when <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Truſt</hi> are the chief affections of true <hi>Subjects</hi> to which <hi>fear</hi> muſt be but ſubſervient: How can treacherous men more undermine a Prince, than by ſuch terrible deſcriptions, and by perſwading him to rule by <hi>Fear</hi> rather than <hi>Love,</hi> to render him hated by his Subjects that ſhould love him and defend him?</p>
               <p>XXIII. We take it for a traiterous opinion that, <hi>It is not lawful to take Arms againſt any that have a Commiſſion with the Kings Name under his Great or Little Seal,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception: For then the keepers of his Majeſties Seals may depoſe the King, by Sealing Commiſſions as in his name, to traytours, to ſeize on his guards, forts, navies, Magazines, treaſures, ſervants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and no loyal ſubjects might reſiſt them, no not they who by Law or former Commiſſion were obliged to it.</p>
               <p>XXIV. We renounce their treachery who would weaken the Kings Intereſt by dividing his Subjects, and building up unneceſſary walls of partition between them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to keep them in ſuch diviſions, and would thereby che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh hatred, contention and mutinies among them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand: And it is unſafe and uncomfortable to a Prince to rule a divided mutinous people, and ſweet and ſafe to rule them that are united in mutual Love: Therefore we deteſt their way that would lay the peoples Concord upon uncapable terms, and bring the Kings intereſt in his peoples Love and willing obedience and ready defence of him, into too

               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:194351:53"/> XXV. It is treachery againſt Princes to tell them that they are not bound by their Oaths, Vows, and Promiſes; that thereby their Subjects may be brought into utter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtfulneſs of them. And how can there be due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and adhering to Rulers where there is no Truſt?</p>
               <p>XXVI. They are great enemies to Princes who tempt them to notorious viciouſneſs of life, againſt God's Laws: ſeeing all that believe a God will honour him, and his Laws and intereſt, and will judge of men as they keep or break them; and will think worſe of the evil than the good: And God hath ſaid, Thoſe that honour me I will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And even Princes muſt contemn a vile perſon, and honour thoſe that fear the Lord, <hi>Pſal. 15.</hi> Even among Heathens, how great was the peoples Love and Honour to an <hi>Antonine</hi> (even to deiſie him) to a <hi>Titus,</hi> a <hi>Trajan,</hi> an <hi>Alexander Severus;</hi> &amp;c. and what excellent names have they left behind them! And how contrary was it with a <hi>Nero,</hi> a <hi>Caligula,</hi> a <hi>Commodus,</hi> a <hi>Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus, &amp;c.</hi> He is the great enemy of Princes that would render them bad, moſt unlike to God, and the examples of iniquity, and enemies of the good.</p>
               <p>XXVII. We deteſt their opinion who think that a ſtrong and proſperous Uſurper may be deſended againſt the King, or that the King is not to be defended againſt him, to the hazard of our eſtates and lives.</p>
               <p>XXVIII. We renounce their opinion who think that it is Lawful for the Kings Subjects meerly to propagate Religion or Reformation in the Kingdom, by entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Leagues, Covenants and Arms againſt him (of which before) and without his conſent and Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:194351:54"/> XXIX. We diſown their opinion that think that though the inferior Subjects may not do this, yet the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Magiſtrates may; and have power to queſtion and judge the King; (of <hi>which alſo before.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XXX. We reject them that ſay, that</hi> The Perſon of the King <hi>is</hi> not inviolable, which no Subjects may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault or invade, <hi>much leſs take away his life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXI. We deteſt the doctrine of thoſe Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors (at large cited in terms by <hi>Henry Fowlis</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln)</hi> who teach that when the Pope hath excommunicated and depoſed a King, he is no King, and may be killed, at leaſt by the Popes command, and that to kill him is not to kill a King: And we deteſt ſuch Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as were executed on <hi>Henry 3.</hi> and <hi>H. 4.</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and on our late King.</p>
               <p>XXXII. We deteſt that opinion, that none are bound to the King, nor bound to forbear treaſon or to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, unleſs they have taken ſome Oath of fidelity to him or made ſome promiſe; As if a Papiſt or any other that cometh from beyond Sea and hath avoided ſuch Oaths and promiſes might lawfully do that which elſe were treaſon: As if our Anceſtors Covenants, and our living under the Laws and protection of a Soveraign did not oblige us.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. We diſclaim the treacherous opinion of ſuch as would have Kings build their titles on no better ground than an Uſurper may plead, that ſo it may fall by the ſandineſs of that foundation; that is, either on <hi>meer Conqueſt,</hi> (and then a ſtronger may conquer them)
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:194351:54"/> or on pretence of their <hi>ſpecial fitneſs, by wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (and ſo if any were <hi>wiſer or better,</hi> he would have more right), or as <hi>Mahomet</hi> on pretended revelation from heaven (as aforeſaid.)</p>
               <p>XXXIV. We renounce their opinion who hold that they may break their Oaths of Allegiance; or that the Pope or any other can diſpenſe with ſuch Oaths, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the aforeſaid <hi>Laterane</hi> General Council.</p>
               <p>XXXV. We diſown their diſloyalty, who would have ſuch Oaths put upon Subjects, whoſe matter is contrary to the common judgement of Philoſophers Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Chriſtian, and Politicians, and Lawyers, and Hiſtorians, and Divines of all ſides, of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; that ſo they may ingage the <hi>Common judgment of mankind</hi> againſt their Princes, under pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting them to more power than all or any of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do allow of.</p>
               <p>XXXVI. We are the more unwilling our ſelves to make Vows and Oaths raſhly, or to renounce any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful part of ſuch as were (though unlawfully) made: and that Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould really or ſeemingly be branded with the mark of PERJURY, or that any Cities or Corporations or Kingdoms in the world ſhould be ſo branded, leſt it ſhould weaken and looſen the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick bonds of Oaths with the Subjects, by which the lives of Princes are ſecured from Treaſons and Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; And we think that when Oaths are deſpiſed and made as a ſport, it is an act of treachery againſt Princes lives: Beſides that the Guilty may expect Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; And if Perjury be revenged with Plagues, and flames and poverty, and a famin of the word, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:194351:55"/> reſtrained from the guiltieſt places, it is no wonder; at leaſt, till they as openly REPENT, as they have ſinned.</p>
               <p>XXXVII. In General (becauſe all particulars can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be remembred) we renounce all Principles and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of diſloyalty, ſedition, faction, Schiſm, treaſons, Conſpiracies and rebellion, againſt Kings or any rightful Governours.</p>
               <p>WE have thus faithfuly given the world an account of our judgements, of the Power of Kings, the obedience of Subjects, and the miſchiefs of diſloyalty and rebellion: If we live in ſuch a <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> where all this is not enough to excuſe us from being ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of <hi>poyſoning men with ſeditious and rebellious doctrines;</hi> Yea if this very profeſſion, extorted from us by many publiſhed accuſations and reproaches, after ſo many years ſufferings and ſilence, ſhall be made the matter of our farther accuſation, reproach or ſuffering, we appeal to the final judgement of the moſt righteous God which we are near; and leave this for the information of poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and forreigners when we are dead. We know no man that can write ſo as that no word might not be wiſelier or better ſaid, or with which malice cannot pick a quarrel. If this be yet our lot, we muſt bear it.</p>
               <p>We add this caution, That though <hi>ex ſuper abundanti</hi> we that concur in the foregoing Profeſſion, do to ſtop the mouth of calumnie, mention our conſent to all that General Councils, the Confeſſions of the Churches, the writings of Philoſophers, Politicians, Lawyers and Divines do ſay for the Power of Kings and the obedience of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, we do think it unreaſonable and dangerous, that ſuch redundancies ſhould be commonly impoſed on others, as a teſt of their fidelity.</p>

            <head type="sub">The Conformity of our Doctrine of obedience to the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Kingdom, the Doctrine and Canons of the Church, and the judgement of the moſt Learned and Loyal Prelates.</head>
            <p>§. 1. IF I own that political doctrine which is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by theſe three: I. The conſtitution of this Monarchy, II. The Articles of Religion and Canons of the Church, III. And the judgment of thoſe Prelates who have been accounted the moſt Loyal and Learned of their order, and the moſt hot and ſtrong defenders of it, I ſuppoſe ſuch doctrine will be vindicated from the charge of Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</p>
            <p>§. 2. But I find that the firſt is a point not agreed on by all, <hi>viz.</hi> what the conſtitution of the Kingdom is; while Parliaments have claimed that as their Power and priviledge which the King hath denyed to be theirs; and the King hath claimed that as his power and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which Parliaments have denyed to be ſuch. Therefore I (that am very unfit to judge between them) muſt take up with that which is on both hands agreed on. And that I will take only as in the Kings own words, in his anſwers to the Parliament 1641 in ſeveral of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations.</p>
            <p>§. 3. In his Majeſties anſwer to the 19. Propoſitions he thus deſcribeth the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <q>There being three kinds of Government amongſt men, <hi>Abſolute Monarchy, Ariſtocracy</hi> and <hi>Democracy,</hi> and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:194351:56"/> all theſe having their particular conveniencies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies; the experience and wiſdom of your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors hath ſo molded this out of a Mixture of theſe, as to give to this Kingdom (as far as humane prudence can provide) the conveniencies of all three without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of any one, as long as the ballance hangs even between the three Eſtates, and they run joyntly on in their proper Channel (begetting Verdure and fertility in the meadows on both ſides) and the over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>lowing of either on either ſide raiſe no deluge or inundation. The ill of Abſolute Monarchy is Tyranny: The ill of Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy is faction and diviſion: The ills of Democracy are tumults, violence and licentiouſneſs. The good of Monarchy is the Uniting of a Nation under one head to reſiſt invaſion from abroad, and inſurrection at home: The good of Ariſtocracy is the conjunction of Council of the ableſt perſons of a State for the publick benefit. The good of Democracy is Liberty, and the Courage and Induſtry which Liberty begets.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In this Kingdom the Laws are joyntly made by a King, by a houſe of Peers, and by a houſe of Commons choſen by the people, all having free Votes and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular priviledges: The Government according to theſe Laws is truſted to the King; power of Treaties of war and peace; of making Peers, of chooſing Officers and Counſellors for State, Judges for Law, Commanders for Forts and Caſtles, giving Commiſſions for raiſing men to make war abroad, or to prevent or provide againſt invaſions or inſurrections at home, benefit of confiſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, power of pardoning, and ſome more of the like kind, are placed in the King: And this kind of regulated Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, having this power to preſerve that authority, without which it would be diſabled to preſerve the Laws in their force, and the Subjects in their Liberties and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:194351:56"/> proprieties, is intended to draw to him ſuch a reſpect and relation from the great ones, as may hinder the ills of diviſion and faction, and ſuch a fear and reverence from the people as may hinder tumults, violence and licentiouſneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Again, that the Prince may not make uſe of this high and perpetual Power to the hurt of thoſe for WHOSE GOOD HE HATH IT, and make uſe of the name of Publick neceſſity for the gain of his Private favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and followers to the detriment of his people, the houſe of Commons (an excellent conſerver of Liberty, but never intended for any ſhare in Government, or the chooſing of them that ſhould govern) is ſolely intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the firſt Propoſitions concerning the Levies of moneys (which is the ſinews as well of peace as war) and the impeaching of thoſe who for their own ends though countenanced by any SURREPTITIOUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY GOTTEN COMMAND of the KING, have violated the Law which HE IS BOUND (when he knows it) to protect, and to the protection of which they were bound to adviſe him; at leaſt not to ſerve him in the contrary.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And the Lords being truſted with a Judicatory pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are an excellent Skreen and bank between the Prince and people, to aſſiſt each againſt any incroachments of the other, and by juſt judgments to preſerve that Law, which ought to be the Rule of every one of the three.</q>

               <q>For the better enabling them in this, beyond the examples of any of our anceſtors, we were willingly contented to oblige our ſelf, both to call a Parliament every three years, and not to diſſolve it in fifty daies.]</q>

            <p>§. 9. How far our preſent King hath declared himſelf for the ſame principles, it is needleſs to recite, while his frequent Profeſſions of them, and his Declarations for juſt Liberty of Conſcience, and his Gracious Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, and his profeſſed reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to draw the Biſhops to meet us and make neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abatements for concord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in our remembrance or before our eyes.</p>

            <p>The words of <hi>Barclay</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> the two moſt eminent defenders of Monarchy (as I ſaid before) I will not recite in their words (how far and when Kings may be reſiſted, ſpecially by thoſe that have part in the Legiſlative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which is part in the ſupremacy) leſt I be miſtaken as approving all that they ſay: It may be ſeen at large in <hi>Grot. de Jure Belli &amp; Pacis li.</hi> 1. c. 4. pag. 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91.

Eccleſiaſtical Laws muſt be charitable and eaſie, and when they are not, they oblige not. <hi>P. 316.</hi> When the Eccleſiaſtical Law is indicted by the ſpiritual power, the Civil power only conſenting and eſtabliſhing the Canon, that Corroboration adds no other band to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, than that it be obeyed according to the intention of the ſpiritual power; only ſo it becomes a Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but it is a Law only as the Church can intend a Law, or deſire it to be impoſed; that is, what the Church might reaſonably perſwade, and fitly enjoyn, ſo much
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:194351:65"/> and no more, in that manner and no other, the Civil power doth corroborate it—It muſt be ſuch as is fit to be perſwaded: ſuch which men can be WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LING to, and eaſie under, and of which they ſhall have no cauſe to complain: For the Church in theſe things hath no Power but to exhort and perſwade, and therefore can enjoyn nothing, but what can be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably perſwaded; ſhe muſt not by the aid of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power enjoyn thoſe things which are cruel and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and ſuch to which no argument but FEAR can make the ſubject willing<note n="*" place="margin">The ſumm is, The Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only Volunteers by conſent procured by Reaſon and Love.</note>— When ſhe makes judgments, ſhe med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles not with blood—and when ſhe is admitted to a Legiſlative, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns an eaſie and gentle yoke, And when ſhe does not, the Subject is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to avoid the temporal evil threatened by the Civil power, but not to give obedience to the intolerable Law of the Church as in that capacity. For unleſs the Law of the Church be ſuch that good men may <hi>willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> obey it, it cannot be injoyned by the Church; and the Church ought not to deſire the Civil power to do it for her. For ſince ſhe hath no power to command in ſuch things where the Divine authority doth not intervene, all the reſt is but PERSWASION; and he that hath power ONLY TO PERSWADE cannot be ſuppoſed to perſwade <hi>againſt our wills:</hi> and therefore matters of intolerable burden are not the matter of Eccleſiaſtical Laws, becauſe they are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>againſt the will</hi> of all men, who can ſerve God and go to heaven without them.</q>

               <q>§. 28. Rule 20. <hi>p. 323.</hi> Eccleſiaſtical Laws muſt ever promote the ſervice of God and the good of ſouls, but muſt never put a Snare or Stumbling-block to Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:194351:65"/> —The authority which the Lord hath given is for edification and not for deſtruction, <hi>2 Cor. 10. 8.</hi> and 13. 10. And this is not only ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that if the Church makes Laws which are not for edification, ſhe <hi>does amiſs;</hi> but that ſhe OBLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GETH NOT, HER LAWS ARE NULL, and do not bind in Conſcience—When the Church does any thing beyond her Commiſſion, ſhe does no way oblige in Conſcience, neither actively nor paſſively— All this is greatly to be obſerved in all caſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence about Eccleſiaſtical Laws. If we can underſtand where the ſpiritual power can command, and where ſhe can exhort and ought to prevail, we have found out all the meaſures of our obedience: But if ſhe goes beyond her Commiſſion, ſhe hurts none but her ſelf: for ſhe hath nothing to do with our bodies, and our ſouls are in ſafe hands. And the caſe is much alike if the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Law be bound by the <hi>Civil power:</hi> For the King when he makes Laws of Religion, is tyed up to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical meaſures; and if he prevaritates, he does indeed tye us to a paſſive obedience, but the Conſcience is no otherwiſe bound: and he is to govern Chriſts Church by the ſame meaſures with which the Apoſtles did, and the Biſhops their ſucceſſors did and ought to do before the Civil power was Chriſtian: For he hath no more power over Conſciences than <hi>they had,</hi> and ought not by the afflictions of the body to invade the ſoul. But if he does, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he hath only power over bodies, but no authority over the Conſcience.]</q>

               <q>§. 29. <hi>P. 325.</hi> I inſtance in the inſtitution of <hi>ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Ceremonies,</hi> that is, ſuch which are not matters of order and decency, but meerly for ſignification and the repreſentment of ſome truth or myſtery—
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:194351:66"/> (as pictures in the Greek and Lutheran Churches)— Becauſe theſe can and do often degenerate into abuſe and invade religion, to make a Law of theſe is not ſafe; and when that Law does prevail to any evil that is not eaſily by other means cured, it does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon the Conſcience: And indeed to <hi>make</hi> a <hi>Law for the uſe of them, is not directly within</hi> the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical power.]</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But there is more in it than thus. For though <hi>ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Ceremonies can be</hi> for edification to the Church in ſome degree, and in ſome perſons, yet it's to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered whether the introducing of ſuch things doth not DESTROY THE CHURCH, not only in her Chriſtian Liberty, but in the ſimplicity and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſpirituality of her religion, by inſenſible chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into a Ceremonial and external ſervice. To the Ceremonial Law of the <hi>Jews,</hi> nothing was to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. —And in Chriſtianity we have leſs reaſon to add any thing of Ceremony, except the circumſtances and advantages of the very Miniſtry, as time and place, and Veſſels and Ornaments and neceſſary appendages. When we ſpeak of Rituals or Ceremonies, that is, exterior actions or things beſides the inſtitutions and commands of Chriſt, either we intend them as part of the Divine ſervice, and then they are unlawful and intolerable; or if only for <hi>ſignification,</hi> that is ſo little a thing, and of ſo inconſiderable uſe in the fulneſs and clarity of the revelation Evangelical, that beſides that it keeps Chriſtians ſtill in the ſtate of infancies and minority, —it ought not to ſtand againſt any danger or offence that can by them be brought to ANY WISE and GOOD CHRISTIANS.</q>

            <p>
               <q>In ſome ages—and Churchs they gave perſons to be baptized, milk and hony, to ſignifie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As this
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:194351:66"/> was not uſual to give Hieroglyphicks where they had plain precepts—it was of ſo very little uſe, that all Churches that I know of have laid it aſide—And indeed if the Church might add things or rituals of ſignification, then the walls might be covered with the figures of Doves, Lambs, Serpents, Birds, and the Communion Table with Bread, Wine, Herbs, Tapers, Pigeons, Hony, milk or whatever the wit of man—might invent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To prepare the figure of the Crucifix and to buy an Image to deſcribe the Sacrifice of the Croſs— are things to no purpoſe, not only for the levity and theatrical gaieties and repreſentments unbefitting the gravity and purity and ſpirituality of the Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but alſo the manner of teaching theſe truths by ſymbolical things and actions, is too low, too ſuſpicious, too dangerous to be mingled with the Divine Liturgies —A Symbolical rite of humane invention to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie what it does not effect, and then introduced into the ſolemn worſhip of God, is ſo like thoſe vains imaginations and repreſentments forbidden in the ſecond Commandment, that the very ſuſpicion is more againſt edification, than their uſe can pretend to.—</q>

               <q>§. 31. <hi>P. 356. &amp;c.</hi> Rule 23. Subſcription to Articles and forms of Confeſſion in any particular Church, is wholly of Political conſideration.—Subſcription ought to be ſo intended, that he who hath ſubſcribed may not perceive himſelf taken in a ſnare: but yet he that ſubſcribes muſt do it to thoſe purpoſes, and in that ſence and ſignification of things, which the ſupreme power intends in commanding it; that is, at leaſt, that he that ſubſcribes do actually approve the Articles over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written: that he does at that time believe them to be ſuch as it's ſaid they are; <hi>i. e. true,</hi> if they only ſay they are <hi>true; uſeful,</hi> if they pretend to <hi>uſefulneſs; neceſſary,</hi> if it be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that they are neceſſary. For if the ſubſcriber be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not this, he by hypocriſie ſerves the ends of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace and his own preferment.</q>

               <q>When Articles are eſtabliſhed without neceſſity, ſubſcription muſt be required without Tyranny and imperiouſneſs. That is, it muſt be left to the liberty of the ſubject to profeſs or not profeſs that doctrine— To bring evil on men that do not believe the Article and dare not profeſs to believe what they do not, is injuſtice and oppreſſion; it is a law of iniquity, and therefore it is not obligatory to Conſcience, and no humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

               <q>§. 32. <hi>P. 358, 359.</hi> At leaſt let the Articles be made with as great latitude of ſence as they can, and ſo that ſubſcriptions be made to the form of words, let the ſubſcribers underſtand them in what ſence they pleaſe, which the truth of God will ſuffer and the words can be capable of. This is the laſt remedy; but it is the worſt: It hath in it ſomething of Craft, but
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:194351:68"/> very little of ingenuity; and if it can ſerve the ends of peace, or of external Charity, or of Phantaſtick concord, yet it cannot ſerve the ends of truth and holineſs, and Chriſtian ſimplicity.</q>

               <p>36. Becauſe Gods right is only his Power, therefore the right of man is only his power to exiſt and act; For the natural power of every thing, by which it exiſteth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:194351:72"/> and operateth, is nothing but Gods own power (which is God.)</p>
               <p>37. By the Law of nature then I mean the very Laws of nature, or Rules according to which all things are done, that is, Natures power. Right extendeth as far as Power: and whatever any man doth by his nature, he doth by the higheſt Right of Nature.</p>
               <p>38. And becauſe man is not only rational, but men are more led by blind luſt than by reaſon; therefore their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural right is to be defined, not by reaſon, but by any appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite which determineth them to act. <hi>p. 271.</hi> No difference is to be made though ſome appetites be unreaſonable; For both are the effects of nature. Whatever a man is, he is a part of nature; (or God) and natures power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth him to all that he doth.</p>
               <p>39. A ſound mind is no more in our power than a ſound body: And Divines remove not this difficulty by taking of the corruption of nature and original ſin; or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Devil.</p>
               <p>40. The Right and Law of Nature is againſt nothing but that which no man deſireth, and no man can do; it forbids not contentions, hatred, wrath, deceits, nor abſolutely any thing which the appetite deſireth. <hi>p. 273.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>41. For whatever <hi>we call</hi> Ridiculous, abſurd, evil, is becauſe we ſee but part, and would have all ordered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Reaſon; But it is not evil as to the order and Law of univerſal nature.</p>
               <p>42. One is under anothers Law, while he is under his Power: and is free or <hi>ſui juris</hi> ſo far as he hath power to reſiſt force, and lives as he liſt. <hi>p. 274.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>43. We are no longer under anothers Law, than fear or hope perſwade us to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:194351:72"/> 44. Fidelity promiſed to another, is ſo long only in force <hi>(rata)</hi> till the promiſer change his will: when he ſeeth that keeping his word will hurt him, the Law of nature diſobligeth him. <hi>p. 274.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>45. Men are by nature enemies, in danger of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and each one being not ſufficient to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, hence comes Polities.</p>
               <p>46. There is no ſin in a ſtate of nature (unleſs againſt our ſelves.) He that followeth ignorance and luſt doth keep natures order, and do what nature binds him to, as well as he that followeth reaſon. <hi>p. 276.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>47. There is no ſin therefore but againſt common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Empire, where every one hath given up his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate right to the publick: So Juſtice and injuſtice are only as they reſpect humane Empire.</p>
               <p>48. Every Citizen muſt obey all the Cities commands, and hath no right to diſcern what is juſt or unjuſt, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or impious; but becauſe the will of the City is to be every ones will, whatever the City judgeth juſt and good, the Citizen that judgeth it evil, muſt nevertheleſs do.</p>
               <p>49. Our knowledge and Love of God and man, are out of Rulers power: And outward acts of worſhip do nothing help or hinder our knowledge and Love of God; and therefore are not to be ſo far regarded, as to break for them the publick peace and concord: every man may any where worſhip God inwardly. <hi>p. 282. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>50. Two Cities are naturally enemies, as are two men: And it is lawful for one to try by war to ſubdue the other. It is enough to make a war lawful, to have a will to it: But to peace, both muſt accord. <hi>p. 284.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>51. Covenants bind as long as the cauſe continueth, fear of dammage or hope of gain, and no longer: nor ought the breach to be called deceit or perfidiouſneſs, <hi>p. 284.</hi>

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:194351:73"/> 52. The contracts or Laws by which the Multitude give up their Right to one Council, or one man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly may be violated as ſoon as it is the intereſt of common ſafety to violate them. <hi>p. 288.</hi>

               <p>I wonder that <hi>Hobbs de cive</hi> ſhould be magnified by ſuch Frenchmen as <hi>Gaſſendus, Sorberius</hi> and <hi>Merſennus:</hi> But it ſeems ſome French Philoſophers (and Prelates too) are looſer in their principles of policie and Loyalty than we are.</p>
               <p>His principles are, 1. <q>That Nature giveth a man Right to all things: that is, Before men bind themſelves
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:194351:77"/> by Covenants to one another, it it lawful for every one to do whatever they liſt and to whomſoever, and to poſſeſs, uſe and enjoy whatever they will and can. <hi>pag. 12.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>2. For it is the firſt foundation of natural right that every man may defend his life and members as much as he is able: And having right to that as the end, it were in vain unleſs he had right to the means, that is, to uſe all means, and do any action without which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preſerve himſelf. <hi>p. 11.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>3. The natural ſtate of men before mutual Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, is a ſtate of War, becauſe what every man hath right to, another hath right to, and may reſiſt his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, whence ariſe perpetual ſuſpicions, enmities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that all men are at war with all men. <hi>p. 14, 15.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>6. No man is bound by any Covenants whatſoever not to reſiſt him that would kill him, wound him, or do him any other bodily hurt: every mans natural fear reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hurt; by ſlight or fighting: And no man is bound to impoſſibility: Only fidelity bindeth Covenanters; Therefore we bind malefactors that go to puniſhment with Cords, becauſe they may reſiſt if they can: To Covenant [If I do this, kill me] is one thing: But to ſay <hi>[If you kill me I will not reſiſt]</hi> is another. Laws bind not the puniſhed from reſiſting, but others from defending them. <hi>p. 31, 32, 33.</hi>

It's ſeditious to ſay that we muſt not obey Kings when they command things evil and unjuſt; for antecedent to mans Empire nothing is juſt or unjuſt, but all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are indifferent: This was Gods oldeſt Law, Thou ſhalt not eat of the tree of Knowledge of good and evil, that is, not make thy ſelf a diſcerning judge of it: and the oldeſt temptation was, you ſhall be as Gods knowing good and evil. <hi>pag. 191.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>He thought that Chriſts Kingdom was to begin on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Reſurrection</q> (which I ſuppoſe not believing any, he ſpeaketh in contempt): He was a ware that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rom</hi> had his power only in one Empire; and that Atheiſts are not of the Kingdom of God. But I paſs by the reſt, it being moſtly the ſame with <hi>Spinoſa's.</hi> And briefly, contrary to his maſs of Brutiſm, Atheiſm, Infidelity and ſelf-contradiction, I oppoſe, beſides what is aforeſaid:</p>
               <p>1. Mans natural ſtate is a ſtate of due ſubjection to God as univerſal King:</p>
               <p>2. Our thoughts, words and actions are not indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but are duty or ſin as they are conform or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to his Law.</p>
               <p>3. Mans Laws could make no duty or ſin but as em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by Gods Law.</p>
               <p>4. The world being Gods Kingdom, all are his Subjects as to obligation, hypocrites by meer profeſſion, and the faithful by true conſent.</p>
               <p>5. God binding all men to Love him above all and our
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:194351:78"/> neighbours as our ſelves, we are ſo far from being born to a Common war, that nature uncorrupt and repaired is a ſtate of Love, and nature corrupt reprived and under Common grace, is ſociable, and hath ſome natural Love to others, yea to mankind; and as beaſts love the company of their like, ſo do men; and all good men love the good. And all are obliged by the Laws of Love, to love others, and do all the good they can.</p>
               <p>6. It's true that corruption making bad men like brutes by ſenſuality and ſelfiſhneſs, ſets them in a ſtate of war; which common and ſpecial grace heal in their ſeveral meaſures.</p>
               <p>7. God bindeth all as his Subjects to obey, firſt their parents, and then to chooſe officers whom he ſhall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power under him to rule according to his univerſal Laws, and officiate as his Miniſters; and all that can muſt live in ſuch order.</p>
               <p>8. The ends of this order are firſt the fulfilling of the will of God as univerſal King, and next the common good, and next our own of ſoul and body, and not only our own corporal peace and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>9. No man hath naturally a right to another mans, nor to any more than God giveth him by nature or juſt acquiſition; and to rob, kill, ſlander, fornicate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a ſin, whether we are under contracts or mens Laws or not.</p>
               <p>10. Societies are for Common good, more than for my own.</p>
               <p>11. They are not made by arbitrary giving up our power; for God firſt inſtituted them, and deſcribed the parts univerſally neceſſary, and our power to govern or diſpoſe of our own lives was none, but as under him; and publick power is quite of another <hi>ſpecies.</hi> We have power to obey God and ſuch as he ſhall by due conſent of man ſet over us and authorize.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:194351:79"/> 12. Life muſt not be defended when juſtice ſentenceth us to death.</p>
               <p>13. It's Gods will and power in Rulers that we muſt obey, and not only the peoples united in them.</p>
               <p>14. All muſt diſcern Good and evil, as it's Duty and ſin; not in their own conceits and wills firſt, but as in Gods Laws determined.</p>
               <p>15. It is wickedneſs to obey man againſt Gods Law, more than to obey a Juſtice againſt the King.</p>
               <p>16. If Kings only make duty and ſin, Kings only muſt protect, reward and puniſh men.</p>
               <p>17. To make the power of Kings independent on Gods Laws, is to ſubvert their foundation.</p>
               <p>18. It's not ſeditious but neceſſary to tell men of Gods future judgement, againſt thoſe that obey men againſt God.</p>
               <p>But the reſt is before confuted, which perhaps I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready too oft repeated.</p>
               <p>I once thought to have added ſeveral other Columns, that other mens judgements, and the Nonconformiſts might be compared by ſuch as would judge in the light, and not in darkneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> I.

               <p>II. The judgement of the moſt applauded writers of Politicks: both Papiſts, ſuch as <hi>Beſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <p>III. And the judgement of the moſt famous Lawyers; eſpecially ſuch as were the moſt ſtrenuous defenders of Monarchy; of whom <hi>Goldaſtus</hi> notifieth divers that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:194351:79"/> the German Emperors: But <hi>Barclay</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> are of all the moſt eminent.</p>
               <p>IV. And in another Column the judgement of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Engliſh Biſhops, Doctors and Hiſtorians.</p>
               <p>But the plain truth is, that I fear ſhould I recite their words they would be misinterpreted and do hurt: He that would ſee what the firſt ſort of old Greek and Latine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſay, may find much in their ſentences collected by <hi>Alſtedius</hi> in his Encyclop.

                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſeſt Greek and Latine Philoſophers, Hiſtorians and Orators, were ſo much for Liberty and ſpake ſo dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Tyrants, and praiſed the Killing of them, and had ſo mean or bad thoughts of Kings that were not eminently good, that it is enough that their books are in the hands of Scholars.</p>
               <p>II. And the Authors of Politicks and Laws, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Suarez de Legibus</hi> and <hi>Azorius)</hi> I find are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read by Lawyers: And indeed I cannot ſee how any man can underſtand his Countreys Laws, who doth not underſtand the doctrine of Government and Laws in <hi>genere,</hi> which is the doctrine of Politicks.

            <head type="sub">Our Doctrine about the Church, Church Government, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Communion.</head>
            <p>WE know nothing elſe that ſuſpicions do call us more to give the world an account of our Doctrine of, than the nature, Government and Communion of the Church and the manner of Gods worſhip in it: which yet having ſome of us already publiſhed more largely, and alſo in 1660. when allowed by his Majeſty, given in our deſires thereabout (in offering Arch-Biſhop <hi>Vſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> from of Primitive Government and a ſpecimen of a Reformed Liturgy) we ſuppoſe no more than theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Propoſitions will be needful to be here added.</p>
            <p>1. The CHURCH is a word of many ſignifications, of which the principal is The UNIVERSALITY OF CHRISTIANS HEADED BY CHRIST.</p>
            <p>2. In a narrower ſenſe it ſignifyeth theſe Chriſtians as Chriſts Body or Kingdom contradiſtinct from Chriſt the Head; As the word [Kingdom] ſometimes includeth the King, and ſometimes ſignifieth the people as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct from him.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The bond of Union between</hi> Chriſt the <hi>Head and his</hi> Subjects <hi>or members is,</hi> 1. Faith and <hi>the</hi> Holy Spirit internally, 2. <hi>The</hi> Covenant of Baptiſm external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>or</hi> Heart Covenanting <hi>and</hi> Outward Covenanting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:194351:82"/> 4. Accordingly thoſe that <hi>Covenant ſincerely with the Heart</hi> and are <hi>true Believers,</hi> are <hi>Juſtified</hi> and <hi>Adopted</hi> heirs <hi>of Heaven:</hi> and as they Covenant with the <hi>mouth</hi> or the <hi>Outward</hi> reception of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> they are <hi>outwardly</hi> or by Sacramental Profeſſion, members or Chriſtians. With reſpect to each, the Church is uſually called <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,</hi> and <hi>viſible,</hi> or the <hi>ſincere Regenerate Church,</hi> and the <hi>Profeſſing Church.</hi> But <hi>Heart conſent</hi> and <hi>Outward</hi> Profeſſion conjoyned make <hi>one Church,</hi> as <hi>Soul and Body</hi> make <hi>one man:</hi> And the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> that Covenant with the Lips alone are but <hi>members ſecundum quid,</hi> and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Outward Society.</hi> 5. It is by the <hi>Outward Covenanting</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> that we muſt judge of the <hi>Heart covenanting</hi> and <hi>Sincerity:</hi> and all are to be taken for viſible Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians or members of the <hi>Vniverſal Church,</hi> who are <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and have not by <hi>contrary Profeſſion</hi> or <hi>practice Apoſtatized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. The <hi>Vniverſal Church</hi> as <hi>Believing</hi> or as <hi>Profeſſing (myſtical</hi> or <hi>viſible)</hi> hath <hi>no univerſal Head but Chriſt:</hi> who is an <hi>Inviſible Head</hi> as he is <hi>unſeen</hi> to us in <hi>Heaven,</hi> but <hi>Viſible</hi> as he is <hi>there now ſeen</hi> (as the King by his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers) and as he <hi>was ſeen on earth,</hi> and <hi>will be ſhortly ſeen</hi> of all the world. But as for the Pope or any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended head, 1. No man giveth us any proof that ever Chriſt appointed and authorized any ſuch Head: and it's Treaſon againſt him to uſurp ſuch a power.</p>
            <p>2. No mortal man hath <hi>Natural capacity</hi> of ſuch an office. An <hi>Vniverſal Head</hi> muſt relate to the Church in all parts of the world, not only as <hi>it is now</hi> extended, but as it <hi>ſhall</hi> be at any time: and no man is able to do the work of a <hi>real Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi> and <hi>Guide</hi> at the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and in all Nations of the earth, even in the Kingdoms where Princes by wars or Infidelity deny acceſs to foreigners, and ſubjects of their enemies: and where caſes that require a ſpeedy deciſion
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:194351:82"/> may wait half an age till the parties are dead, before it can be diſpatcht at <hi>Rome,</hi> and witneſſes cannot go ſo far: And when Church Government extends no farther, than to judge who ſhall be in the Miniſtry and in Church Communion, and to decide particular caſes of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> in order to this end, Princes and People are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy men, if they muſt be without Teachers or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or without a certain Faith in <hi>Abaſſia, Armenia,</hi> at the <hi>Antipodes</hi> and in all the world, till they receive a juſt determination from <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if his univerſal Government be but to commit the Government of ſeveral Kingdoms of the world to ſeveral Generals under him, Princes and People that are at hand do better know how to chooſe meet men to Teach them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of thoſe that are of their own language, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the place, than a ſtranger at <hi>Rome</hi> can do, to whom at the death of every <hi>General</hi> ſome Countries may be many years in ſending and receiving back a <hi>General,</hi> who it's two to one will not come alive to them, or it's three to one, will be one unfit for them: and in ſome Kingdoms cannot come at all, becauſe of the interjacent countries of enemies: no nor meſſages paſs, about the buſineſs. What work the Prelates of <hi>England</hi> (which is near) have formerly made by running to <hi>Rome,</hi> and waiting for deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is known by current hiſtory. None on earth will pretend to a ſufficiency to govern all the world in things ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, any more than in Temporals, except it be a <hi>Proud Fool</hi> or a <hi>Proud deceiver,</hi> both which are the moſt unfit to be rulers of all the world.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Rome</hi> never pretended to a Government of all the world, but only to a <hi>Primacy</hi> in <hi>one Empire,</hi> for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Chriſt, Proved, 1. Becauſe only the Prince of one Empire did frequently chooſe and ever rule them, who had no power over any other Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:194351:83"/> 2. Becauſe the four other Patriarchs, whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have a Primacy among, had no power out of the Empire, at leaſt not over all the world: and the Pope never then pretended to a Primacy of any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extent than the four Patriarchats.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe the General Councils where he preſided, or pretended to preſide were General at the utmoſt but as to one Empire: as the Church Hiſtory, and the names of the ſubſcribers ſhew to every impartial ſearcher. None out of the Empire came thither, unleſs now and then an odd perſon of ſome neighbour countrey that was glad to be ſtrengthened by the Roman Vicinity, or ſome that had been before of the Empire, and were conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Infidels or Hereticks and kept their former Cuſtome. And thoſe Councils that were moſt General were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by Emperors, who had nothing to do in the reſt of the world.</p>
            <p>4. No Hiſtory mentioneth that the Pope then pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to or exerciſed any government in the Empire of <hi>Abaſſia</hi> (of which ſee <hi>Godignus)</hi> nor in <hi>Perſia, India,</hi> or <hi>Britain</hi> till <hi>Auſtines</hi> times: but when the Romans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded any poor neighbours Countrey to the ſaith of Chriſt, thoſe Countries were willing after to be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Romans, eſpecially being ambitious of the honour and protection of the Imperial ſavour. <hi>Reinrius</hi> ſaith <hi>[Armeniorum Eccleſiae &amp; Aethiopian &amp; Indorum &amp; caeterae quas Apoſtoli converterunt, non ſubſunt Eccleſiae Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manae]</hi> Biblioth.

            <p>6. As for <hi>General Councils</hi> I have elſewhere proved at large, 1. That there never was ſuch a thing in the world (unleſs the Apoſtles may be called ſuch): but that thoſe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:194351:84"/> called <hi>General Councils,</hi> were but General Councils of <hi>one Empire,</hi> and now and then two or three neighbours, or ſuch as were lately cut off from the Empire as aforeſaid. 2. That a true General Council is morally impoſſible, 3. And ſo unlawful, as to be a pernicious form of Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the Church: becauſe ſome Biſhops muſt be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years coming, and will likely die before they come and return, and have not a language which the reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; nor can there be any equality of members, while thoſe of <hi>Mexico, Abaſſia, Armenia</hi> and the <hi>Antipodes</hi> ſend but few, and the nearer parts a multitude; and ſo (as at <hi>Trent)</hi> it will be but an <hi>Italian Council:</hi> And it will be ſinful to rob the Churches of them, and to caſt away the lives of old weak worthy men in ſuch Voyages and Travels of many years. And interpoſing enemies will not let them paſs through their countries, with many ſuch reaſons. So that a General Council is a <hi>non Ens,</hi> and a <hi>name</hi> made for a <hi>Papal cheat.</hi> 3. And ſhould it be the <hi>conſtitutive head</hi> of the whole Church, how <hi>little a while</hi> hath there been <hi>any Church</hi> on earth ſince Chriſt? For when a <hi>conſtitutive eſſential part</hi> ceaſeth, the <hi>eſſence ceaſeth;</hi> and ſo Chriſt hath had <hi>no Church</hi> on earth ſince the mockery of <hi>Trent;</hi> where in the beginning there were 42 Biſhops with counterfeits and all, and 4 Arch-Biſhops, if you will take the counterfeits <hi>Wancop</hi> of <hi>Armagh</hi> and <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> for two; but indeed by the ſeventh Seſſion there were 52 Biſhops counterfeits and all, and in Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion 8. 29 beſides 6 Arch-Biſhops, ſuch as they were, whenas the Provincial Synods in <hi>Africk</hi> were wont to have many hundred Biſhops; but how many thouſand muſt a Synod of the whole world have in proportion to the <hi>Italian</hi> number at <hi>Trent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. God hath provided much better means than a Pope for the concord of Chriſtians in the world (which is

            <p>13. About Ruling Elders we are not all of a mind among our ſelves: ſome of us think that the Elderſhip or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is but <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame Office,</hi> and that all of them ſhould be <hi>ordained</hi> and have power of <hi>word, Sacraments</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> but that one in a Church (or two) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſually the ableſt ſpeakers, the reſt <hi>quoad exercitium</hi> may be uſually imployed in private Vigilance and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and ſome aſſiſtance in other parts of worſhip, except when neceſſity calls them to Preach. Others think that Elders without power of word and Sacraments, is an Office of Divine Inſtitution: but this maketh no diviſion between us, becauſe we force not each other to ſubſcribe to the ſame opinions, but can unite in one practice upon different principles.</p>
            <p>14. It is the Paſtors office to hold Church Aſſemblies for the aforeſaid worſhip: Eſpecially on the Lords Days, which the ſpirit of God hath ſeparated to ſuch holy exerciſes.</p>
            <p>15. <hi>Gods worſhip muſt be performed</hi> rationally, holily, <hi>according to</hi> Gods word <hi>in</hi> all things there determined, <hi>and</hi> decently, orderly, <hi>and to</hi> edification <hi>in</hi> all the undetermined cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
            <p>16. Whether Sermons and Prayers ſhall be by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Forms of words, or from the Habits of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and affection preſently uttered; whether read out of Notes or Books, or ſpoken without, is left to the prudent
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:194351:86"/> determination of the Paſtor, whoſe Office it is to word his own conceptions, according to mens various qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: in which none ſhould contemn or judge another, nor avoid the Communion of thoſe that do not as they do.</p>
            <p>17. We muſt not give Divine worſhip or Honour to any Creature.</p>
            <p>18. When Paſtors do uſurp Power over one another to command all about them to ſpeak to men from God or to God for men, in no other words but what the uſurpers ſhall write them down, and ſo make Miniſters but <hi>Cryers</hi> to read <hi>their preſcripts</hi> or <hi>Proclamations,</hi> and alſo do preſcribe to others the <hi>neceſſary uſe</hi> of <hi>unneceſſary things,</hi> according to the <hi>Vſurpers will,</hi> this is and hath been the <hi>Grand Engine of Church Diviſions,</hi> by which the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es have been torn in pieces for above a thouſand years. And becauſe every age doth bring forth men <hi>Proud enough</hi> to <hi>uſurp,</hi> and few <hi>wiſe enough</hi> to learn by the Churches many hundred years experience, thereby the miſchief proceedeth unremedied.</p>
            <p>19. But if any find it beſt to uſe the <hi>ſame words,</hi> or <hi>many Churches,</hi> to avoid inconveniences, ſhall ſee cauſe to agree to uſe the <hi>ſame words</hi> in <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> in <hi>Pſalms,</hi> in <hi>Prayers</hi> or Sacraments without <hi>uſurpation</hi> over others, we are no oppoſers of ſuch <hi>agreements.</hi> And if our <hi>lawful Governours</hi> do preſcribe, <hi>e. g.

               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:194351:86"/> 20. The <hi>Office</hi> of the Sacred Miniſtry being <hi>Inſtituted</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1. from <hi>Gods gifts</hi> (of <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>grace)</hi> we have our <hi>Diſpoſitive Aptitude,</hi> without which the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> is not <hi>receptive</hi> of the Power. 2.

And <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>defence</hi> and <hi>incouragement</hi> are from the <hi>Magiſtrate;</hi> 7. And <hi>Opportunity</hi> is from Gods <hi>Providence,</hi> the peoples preſent willingneſs, and uſually from the Magiſtrates leave. Thus do theſe ſeverals ſeverally concur to the Miniſteral Office, and to its exerciſe reſpectively.</p>
            <p>21. Two cauſes fill the Churches with bad Paſtors: The one is when the Honours and Riches of the Office are ſo great as to be a ſtrong bait to Pride and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (under the name of encouragements to Learning) for then moſt certainly the moſt Proud and Covetous (that is the worſt) will be the eagereſt ſeekers, and moſt probably they that ſeek ſhall find. The other is when bad Rulers, Patrons or people are the chooſers.</p>
            <p>22. Wicked, Covetous, carnal, proud men admitted into Biſhopricks and Miniſtry have been the woful plague of the Church, eſpecially for thirteen hundred years: For <hi>bad men</hi> will <hi>ſo teach</hi> and <hi>ſo live,</hi> that the <hi>Beſt</hi> of the flock will <hi>moſt diſlike them,</hi> and then they will turn enemies to the <hi>Beſt for diſliking them,</hi> and <hi>will Preach againſt them</hi> and make them as <hi>odious</hi> as they can: and this will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce the prophane part of the flock which naturally hate holineſs: and ſo the <hi>wicked Paſtor,</hi> and <hi>wicked People</hi> will become a <hi>Party</hi> againſt the <hi>Beſt,</hi> and keep them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reproach and perſecution: Whereupon the ſufferers will be tempted not only to greater diſlike, but to undue
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:194351:87"/> paſſions and ſeparations; and if the Magiſtrates take part with the wicked party, they alſo will partake of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; and ſo wicked Paſtors are the floodgates of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and happy are thoſe Rulers that curb them, and help the Churches to faithful men.</p>

            <p>24. No Biſhops or Paſtors have any <hi>ſecular coactive Power</hi> (unleſs the King make them <hi>his Officers):</hi> and therefore of themſelves can Rule none but <hi>Volunteers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>25. Whether the Apoſtles or Evangeliſts have any ſucceſſors in the ordinary work of taking care of many Churches, without being fixed to any one, and whether Magiſtrates may appoint any Paſtors to be <hi>General Viſitors</hi> of the Churches in their Dominions, are queſtions which we would not be too bold in determining, nor will we about them be troublers of the Church. But we believe that God hath not made ſuch an inequality of Churches whether <hi>Rome, Alexandria,</hi> or any as Metropoles, as to make one Church a Governor of other neighbour Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. And we wonder at them that know that Civil Rulers did ſet up the Patriarchs and Metropolitans in the Roman Empire, in conformity to their Civil Policy, and know that <hi>this Empire</hi> is <hi>now diſſolved,</hi> and the reaſon of the thing (had it been lawful) ceaſed; and yet talk of forming General Councils by the five <hi>Imperial Patriarchs,</hi> and of ſubjecting themſelves to the Pope as to one of the five.</p>
            <p>26. Councils or Synods and that ſtated as to <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> are very uſeful among good Paſtors, for concord, Counſel and correſpondence: but the major part are not the Governors of the minor, nor of their abſent brethren: nor are ſtated Synods abſolutely neceſſary; nor conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent when, 1. they are degenerating into the Church Tyranny of a major Vote, 2. or are diſpleaſing to Rulers and inconſiſtent with liberty or peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:194351:88"/> 27. Therefore we take not a National Church to be a Body Politick of Divine Inſtitution, either headed by one Biſhop, or by a National Aſſembly, as a proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive Governing part. But we hold that the King is the Governor of all the Churches in his Kingdoms, as far as they muſt be governed by the Sword: and that National Synods and others inferior to them are fit means for the ſaid Council and concord among the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Paſtors.</p>
            <p>28. Whether one in each Synod ſhall be Moderator, and that <hi>pro tempore</hi> or <hi>durante vitâ</hi> as oft as there are Synods? and whether <hi>one</hi> ſhall be truſted to ſummon ſuch Synods, and how he ſhall preſide to preſerve peace and order, are matters prudently to be determined, as the edification of the Church requireth, ſo that Church Tyranny be not introduced.</p>
            <p>29. As Paſtors of ſeveral Churches have not a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power over other Biſhops and Paſtors, but only by Synods are to give counſel and keep concord; ſo none of them in the world can excommunicate other Biſhops or Paſtors, as Governours of them: but only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim Communion with ſuch publick Hereticks and Incendiaries as deſerve it, and counſel others to do the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

But if moreover they will do as the Pope doth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate people and Paſtors of other Churches and countreys, and Kings themſelves as if they were their Governors, and alſo ſtir up others to draw the Sword againſt them, and ſeek to force Kings to kill or baniſh or puniſh thoſe that they have excommunicated, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſuch, we take ſuch to be profeſſed Incendiaries in the world.</p>
            <p>30. No proper part of the Paſtoral Office, whether it be by Teaching, Adminiſtring Sacraments, or the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:194351:88"/> and uſe of the Eccleſiaſtical keys, belong to any Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whether Chancellors or others.</p>
            <p>31. All coactive Church Government belongeth to the King and Magiſtrates who are the Keepers of the Churches peace, and need not a Church-Office of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to do their work, and take the honour of it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>32. The foreſaid Uſurpations of Proud Paſtors over the Conſciences of others, out of their own Churches, with their turning the ancient practical Chriſtianity into contentions for ſpeculations and notions of their own, proceeding at laſt to a Tyranny over Kings and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates themſelves, yea even to impoſe Oaths on men to obey them, and never to reform them, or endeavour any alteration of theſe evils, hath been the corruption, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and calamity of the Chriſtian world, which too many Princes of the world have endured, and ſome in blind devotion and ſome for ſelfiſh ends promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>33. The weakneſs of the people, even the zealous ſort, ſometimes taking up ſome little unjuſtifiable conceits and ſingularities, and ſometimes too paſſionately renouncing bad Paſtors, and ſometimes falling into ſcandalous actions or ſhameful diviſions among themſelves, hath been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Papal Kingdom, and the great and prevailings pretence for Church Tyranny: And ſome otherwiſe ſober men have been tempted to think that the peoples giddineſs and unrulineſs is ſuch, that there is no other way to peace.</p>
            <p>34. And the very fountain and foundation of almoſt all this calamity hath been the forſaking of the <hi>Primitive, neceſſary, ſure</hi> and <hi>ſimple Teſt</hi> and <hi>Symbol</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Profeſſion</hi> and <hi>Terms of Church Vnion</hi> and <hi>Communion;</hi>

            <head type="sub">Of the true and only termes of Church Concord in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and of the Cauſes of Schiſme: and of Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</head>
            <p>1. EVery mans own welfare and peace is his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>2. Therefore every man is for his own peace.</p>
            <p>3. The Common peace of the State and of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, is the intereſt of all that intend not as Rebels and Hereticks to ſet up themſelves againſt them both, or either of them.</p>
            <p>4. Peace therefore hath the good word of almoſt all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe few dare own their <hi>Rebellious</hi> or Heretical inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>5. Unity and peace are betrayed as Chriſt, with the <hi>Judas</hi> kiſs of Covetous hirelings: And none do more to kill it, than ſome that have moſt cried it up.</p>
            <p>6. As every Hypocrite will be very Religious, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſubjecting the true Common Religion to his own intereſt and luſts; ſo every enemy of Peace would have nothing elſe but Peace; But it is only by making his <hi>Own Peace</hi> the rule of the <hi>Common</hi> Peace, and bringing all men to Center in his intereſts, and to take their Peace upon his terms, from him.</p>
            <p>7. The greateſt pretenders to unity and Peace in the world, have been the Roman Clergy; and next them thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> And none in the world have been
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:194351:90"/> greater Church dividers, by making impoſſible Terms of unity and peace.</p>
            <p>8. The chiefeſt impediments to unity and Peace in the world are, 1. A wicked ſelfiſh heart, and 2. Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Terms; and under both the Church ſtill bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>9. As the Terms of Gods firſt ſentence did put an everlaſting enmity between the <hi>Womans</hi> and the <hi>Serpents ſeed,</hi> ſo it was ſhewed in the two firſt Brothers that ever were born into the world; who had the ſame Parents and education, and were of the ſame Religion, and yet the elder ſlew the younger for offering to God a more <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>acceptable Sacrifice,</hi> and for a better manner of ſerving God in the ſame religion: Even becauſe his own works were bad, and his brothers good. <hi>Gen. 4. 4, 8. Heb. 11. 4. 1 Joh. 3. 12. Jud. 11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. And it is not inconſiderable that Chriſt himſelf calleth the <hi>Devil</hi> the <hi>father</hi> of malignant enemies of the truth and of liars, and ſaith, they do <hi>their fathers work, Joh. 8. 44.</hi> And that, <hi>1 Joh. 3. 8, 10.</hi> it is ſaid that he that <hi>commits ſin is of the Devil;</hi> And that there the difference between the faithful and the wicked, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, The <hi>difference between</hi> the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>God and of the Devil:</hi> And that the <hi>Devil</hi> is ſaid to <hi>lead Captive</hi> the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of the truth, <hi>2 Tim. 2. 26.</hi> and to <hi>ſteal the word out of mens hearts, Luk. 8. 12.</hi> And that envious wiſdom is called <hi>Deviliſh, Jam. 3. 15.</hi> And that the <hi>Devil</hi> is ſaid to <hi>enter</hi> into <hi>Judas, Joh. 13. 2.</hi> Yea Chriſt ſaith, that he <hi>was a Devil, Joh. 6. 70.</hi> And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the wicked muſt go into the everlaſting fire which is prepared for the Devil and his Angels, <hi>Mat. 25. 41.</hi> All which ſheweth that it is no wonder if ſuch are partly meant by the <hi>Serpents ſeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:194351:90"/> 11. And the Holy Ghoſt telleth us alſo from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaak,</hi> that as he that was born of the fleſh, did perſecute him that was born after the ſpirit, even ſo it is now, <hi>Gal. 4. 29.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. And the univerſal hiſtory and experience of all the world, from <hi>Cain</hi> till now, doth ſo fully confirm this truth, as tends much to confirm our belief of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>13. This enmity proceedeth from the Carnal vicious inclination and intereſt of wicked men, and the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enmity of the word and way of God to ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and intereſt, and the devoted reſolution of all true Chriſtians, to ſtick to Chriſt and take his part, and to fight againſt the fleſh, the world and the Devil to the death.</p>
            <p>14. The Godly muſt not, dare not, will not forſake their maſter and rule, and come over for peace to the way of the ungodly; becauſe it will be too dear a peace, that is bought with the loſs of God and heaven.</p>
            <p>15. The wicked <hi>may</hi> change and come over to the Godly (and muſt, or be undone for ever) The enmity therefore is long of them.</p>
            <p>16. It is not meer Learning, or civility, or a paſtoral office, or knowledge and utterance for the Miniſterial work, which will remove this <hi>enmity,</hi> from a Cainites heart; but it muſt be done by the true ſanctification of the ſpirit, <hi>Joh: 3. 5, 6. Rom. 8, 6, 7, 8, 9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. Abundance of particular occaſions and differences may lye in ſight, but underground this is the radical difference, which cauſeth moſt of the calamities of the Churches.</p>
            <p>18. Eſpecially if Cainites get into the Paſtoral Chair, they have great advantage to fight againſt Chriſt in his own name, and ſcatter his flocks, and make Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:194351:91"/> of ſouls as by his own authority, and lay the blame of all on others; Till Chriſt ſhall come and gather his ſcattered ones and plead his own cauſe (which <hi>Rome</hi> is like to ſee with ſorrow.)</p>
            <p>19. Yet even among the beſt the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>cauſes</hi> of diviſions are proportionable to the remnant of their ſins, and the family of Chriſt hath ever been troubled with the peeviſh quarrellings of his children.</p>
            <p>20. The beſt way then for univerſal peace, is to make all men <hi>Holy,</hi> and the <hi>beſt more holy:</hi> And then they will have all, one Center, one end, one Rule, one intereſt, one Nature, and one ſpirit and fervent Love to one another, as to themſelves; with all the peaceable graces, humility, lowlineſs, meekneſs, patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is a way rather to be deſired and hoped for in heaven, than hoped for among ſuch a world of ſinners here.</p>
            <p>21. The next way therefore, that muſt do our work, if ever it be done, is while we are endeavouring to make men better, to find out and uſe the fitteſt terms of their peace and concord as they are. It is JUST TERMS that muſt heal the Church on earth; and which all the ſons of peace muſt ſeek after.</p>
            <p>22. Theſe terms muſt be ſuch as oppoſe not <hi>Holineſs,</hi> but <hi>ſubſerve</hi> it and promote it. The wiſedom from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove is <hi>firſt pure, then peaceable, &amp;c. Jam. 3. 11.</hi> And <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>holineſs</hi> muſt not be ſeparated, <hi>Heb. 12. 14.</hi> Though if poſſible, as much as in us lieth, we muſt live peaceably with all men, <hi>Rom. 12. 18.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>23. Theſe terms muſt be ſuch as take in all that Chriſt taketh in, and would have us take in: that is, All that are fit for Church Communion.</p>
            <p>24. They ſhould be ſuch terms as all true Chriſtians fit for ſuch Church Communion if impoſed would have
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:194351:91"/> united in, in all ages and places of the Church ſince the days of Chriſt till now. For thoſe terms that would have divided the Church, are not the fit means to unite it.</p>
            <p>25. And they ſhould be ſuch terms as the Church hath been at leaſt in ſome age, if not in all, <hi>united actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in.</hi> For why ſhould we think that the Church ſhould <hi>now</hi> unite upon ſuch terms, as it never united in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?</p>
            <p>26. Chriſt himſelf who is the Center of the Churches Union, and the great Lawgiver, and Maſter of our faith, hath certainly in his Laws, preſcribed to his Church, the <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> terms of <hi>Vniverſal concord</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; and of the <hi>Concord</hi> of <hi>particular Churches,</hi> at leaſt in <hi>general Laws.</hi> If he have left out the neceſſary terms of Union, what are his Laws for? how is he our Head? How ſhall his Church be one, and what ſhall cement and unite the members? ſure this is none of the things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</p>
            <p>27. The <hi>terms</hi> that Chriſt hath appointed for Church Union is the Baptiſmal Covenant, <hi>Matth. 28. 19, 20.</hi>
[Whoever believeth in the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, as his reconciled God and father, his ſaviour and ſanctifier, and giveth up himſelf faithfully to him in Covenant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, ſhall be ſaved and taken into heaven, if he ſo continues:] And whoſoever doth this <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> by the open Vow and profeſſion of baptiſm, was by Chriſts appointment to be taken into the Church. Therefore he <hi>then</hi> wanted nothing neceſſary to admittance and Church Communion.</p>
            <p>28. Since the proud <hi>Diotrephes</hi>'s on one ſide, as Lords of Gods heritage <hi>(1 Pet. 5. 3.)</hi> have violated this fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental ſacred rule; and ſelf-conceited ſtrictneſs and ſuperſtitious rigor hath violated it on the other hand (by calling for other kind of Titles, and diſcoveries of mens
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:194351:92"/> ſincerity, and by impoſing new Laws (as various as mens ſtrictneſſes and opinions) on the Church, the Chriſtian world hath had little concord, or quiet peace.</p>
            <p>29. Becauſe men muſt do what they do underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, in matters of ſuch moment, the Churches in the Apoſtles times and by their conſent, did explain theſe three Articles of the Baptiſmal Covenant to the baptized, and required an underſtanding profeſſion of their <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Conſent</hi> to it, as thus expained: which explication is now called the Apoſtles Creed; Becauſe though the Churches might not tye themſelves to every one of the ſame words as now they ſtand (as the <hi>Formula's</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Tertullian</hi> and others ſhew, and thoſe collected by <hi>Vſher</hi> and <hi>Voſſius)</hi> yet as it cannot be imagined that they took the three words of the Covenant without any explication, ſo neither can it ſeem credible that they allowed any ſuch variation of terms, as might hazard a variation or corruption of the ſence: Beſides what Church Hiſtory telleth us of the antiquity of the Creed.</p>
            <p>30. As the Apoſtles in their times uſed no ſtricter or larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er teſts or terms of Church admittance, ſo neither did the Churches after them for a long time: But the Catechiſts expounded the Creed to the Catechumens, and uſed it as a ſufficient teſt. Nay <hi>Syneſius</hi> was made a Biſhop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he well believed the article of the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>31. Chriſt who made the Covenant of Baptiſm the teſt and ſtanding terms of entrance, did yet ſet up Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors over his Churches, to be the Guides of the flock, and preſervers of its unity: not to make new and ſtricter terms and Laws; but to preſerve concord on the terms that he had founded it; and to ſee that men lived in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and piety according to the terms of the Covenant which they had entered. This therefore is the Paſtors work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:194351:92"/> 32. Though the <hi>Keys</hi> be put into the Paſtors hands yet ſo is not the Legiſlation to make new terms of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Unity; but to make ſuch particular determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the circumſtances of <hi>order</hi> and <hi>decency</hi> as are agree able to Chriſts general Laws; And when they have as <hi>Miniſters not Lords,</hi> received men on Chriſts own terms, they are not to excommunicate and turn them out again, for want of more, but for violating theſe; nor <hi>arbitrarily</hi> to rule the Churches, but to teach them all things that Chriſt commanded, <hi>Matth. 28. 20.</hi> And to caſt out only the impenitent violators of his Covenant.</p>
            <p>33. If therefore the Paſtors ſhall contrary to the decree of the Holy Ghoſt by the Apoſtles, <hi>Act. 15.</hi> impoſe unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things on the Church, not only under the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of duty, but as a neceſſary condition of Church communion; they will tyrannize over Gods heritage, and uſurp a power never given them, and contradict one end of Chriſts own Sacraments, and the ancient Creed.</p>
            <p>34. The long and ſad, experience of all the Chriſtian Churches, which have been divided by neceſſary humane impoſitions, and the voice of all wiſe peace-makers in all times (who have ſtill called for <hi>[Vnity in things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Liberty in things unneceſſary,</hi> and <hi>Charity in both]</hi> do leave thoſe that yet will not be perſwaded to theſe terms, as unexcuſeable perſons, as almoſt any in all the world; worſe than Phyſicians that would uſe all thoſe things as the only remedies, which have killed all that ever uſed them for 1500 years.</p>
            <p>35. A Paſtor ſhould love his own flock as well as the people of a forreign land: Therefore they that confeſs that for the communion of all the Churches, there are no terms like theſe which we now mention, ſhould not be more cruel to their own at home, nor turn them out of their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:194351:93"/> fathers houſe for every ceremonial difference, nor make them any work which ſhould prove their ſnare.</p>
            <p>36. Yet we know that every Paſtor is to guide his own Church in needful circumſtances, as the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> of worſhip, the method, the verſions, the tunes, the utenſils and other things formentioned: And no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould be peeviſhly froward, and diſobedient againſt ſuch determinations. But as none that are <hi>needleſs</hi> ſhould be impoſed (for the determination one way or other muſt be neceſſary, though this or that way be not comparatively neceſſary), ſo they are not to be made more <hi>neceſſary</hi> by mens wills than they are in their uſe; At leaſt not made the matter of excommunication. But if the Paſtor neceſſarily appoint one <hi>time,</hi> one <hi>place,</hi> one <hi>tune,</hi> one tranſlation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and any of the people there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fly away and cauſleſly a void the Church, it is they then that caſt out themſelves by departing: But if he needleſly ſay, You ſhall <hi>ſay this,</hi> or <hi>ſubſcribe,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to many needleſs burdens,</hi> or elſe <hi>have no communion here,</hi> the act of excluſion then is his.</p>
            <p>37. True Love would end our greateſt difference: Let men Love their neighbours without diſſembling as themſelves, and do but as they would be done by, and we will not fear them.</p>
            <p>38. Yea if many of the children of the Church were injudiciouſly ſcrupulous, when fear of ſin and hell was the cauſe, a tender Paſtor would abate them a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in ſuch a caſe, when his abating it hath no ſuch danger.</p>
            <p>39. Unmerciful Paſtors cauſe the people to queſtion whether they be ſent of God, becauſe they are made the fathers of the flock to rule them only by <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> and have no power of the ſword: And their rod it ſelf and excommunication, is only by application of Chriſts law. And what they cannot do by <hi>Reaſon, Scripture</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:194351:93"/> and <hi>Love,</hi> they cannot do at all as Paſtors: <hi>Hurt</hi> they may do otherwiſe, but <hi>no good.</hi> And the people judge of Paſtors as <hi>Solomon</hi> of the true mother of the child; that the <hi>merciful and Loving</hi> is the <hi>true Paſtor,</hi> and the <hi>hurtful</hi> is the <hi>uſurper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>40. And the main Controverſie that troubleth the Chriſtian Churches is but, when the nurſes offer ſuch morſels to the children which they cannot ſwallow, whether the bits ſhall be cut leſs (which will hurt no body) or the childrens throats ſhall be cut wider.</p>
            <p>41. We are ſo far from thinking that Paſtors ſhould not guide the people by Love and by their <hi>own conſent,</hi> and from thinking with Doctor <hi>Heylin,</hi> (ſpeaking of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> in the Life of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud)</hi> that it's <hi>doubtful whether the Church have a greater plague than a popular Prelate],</hi> that on the contrary we think that all Paſtoral power and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is only inſtructive, Perſwaſive and Directive, or <hi>ſuch precept</hi> as worketh only upon the <hi>Conſcientious</hi> and <hi>Conſenters,</hi> and can work on no man any further than he <hi>conſenteth,</hi> or as it operateth on his <hi>judgement,</hi> will or <hi>affection.</hi> For they have no inſtrument but <hi>Gods word</hi> to govern by. Yet are they (as a father) <hi>Perſwaders Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized</hi> and in <hi>Office,</hi> and not only ſuch as <hi>perſwade</hi> men meerly out of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>occaſionally</hi> as private men.</p>
            <p>42. The Univerſal Church hath long had <hi>Vnity</hi> upon the terms of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Creed</hi> and <hi>Scriptures,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other <hi>ſubſcriptions, Oaths</hi> or other Profeſſions made neceſſary to communion. But it never had Union upon ſuch additional terms, of new <hi>profeſſions, ſubſcriptions</hi> and <hi>Oaths,</hi> as moſt Churches now impoſe and require. When they departed from the ancient <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> and the primitive <hi>terms,</hi> they departed from Unity and concord, and ſo continue divided to this day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:194351:94"/> 43. As for the indifferent <hi>modes and circumſtances</hi> of worſhip, ſome moſt of the Churches voluntarily agreed in; ſome they differed in; ſome the particular Biſhops made to be the <hi>Order</hi> of their own particuar Churches, (which were for 200 or 300 years no more populous than our Pariſhes), and this not againſt the peoples will; But none of them were impoſed by any Biſhops upon other Churches, nor made neceſſary to Communion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wills and conſciences of the Presbyters and people, nor Miniſters ſilenced nor people excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for refuſing them; But they were uſed as things In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different with mutual charity, till the <hi>decay</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> and the entrance of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Church Tyranny</hi> turned <hi>things indifferent</hi> into thoſe engines of <hi>diviſions,</hi> which have wracked, and diſmembred and torn in pieces the Churches through the world unto this day.</p>
            <p>44. A diverſity of ſuch circumſtances and indifferent modes in divers Churches or Pariſhes, and ſometimes in the ſame Church, is no ſuch dreadful miſchief as ſome frightful Paſtors would make themſelves or others believe: much leſs to be compared with the conſequents of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary impoſitions. What harm is it if one Pariſh or Paſtor uſe one Liturgick form or ceremony, and another uſe another, (ſo that neither of them be evil) any more than that now one Miniſter in the Pulpit uſeth one prayer, one Sermon, one method, and another uſeth another: Our Cathedrals and our Pariſh Churches have great difference of ſuch modes, without any ſuch miſchiefs: And now one Pariſh Miniſter prayeth in the Pulpit, and another only <hi>biddeth Prayer</hi> (and pleadeth for it as the principal way): And one that prayeth in the Pulpit uſeth his own words, and another doth it in the words of the Liturgy: One uſeth a form (the ſame ordinarily) and another varieth according to the matter of his Sermon
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:194351:94"/> and the occaſion: One Miniſter preacheth Arminianiſm, (in the points of free-will, effectual grace prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, Redemption, and perſeverance); And another preacheth zealouſly againſt it, as a dangerous ſort of error: One is for the morality of the fourth commandement, and another againſt it. One thinketh that the Lords day is of Eccleſiaſtical inſtitution (and perhaps mutable) and another that it is of Divine inſtitution. Biſhop <hi>Tailor</hi> writeth againſt Original ſin, and Biſhop <hi>Warner,</hi> for it. Doctor <hi>Gunning</hi> writeth for the Religious obſervation of <hi>Lent,</hi> and Doctor <hi>More</hi> for the Civil only. One ſitteth at the ſinging of a Pſalm, and another ſtandeth and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kneeleth (and ſo at Sermon): One boweth only at the name of Jeſus; another boweth alſo at the name
[Chriſt] and [God] <hi>&amp;c.</hi> One ſtandeth up at the <hi>Reading</hi> of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and not at the ſinging of the ſame Pſalms; another ſitteth at both, and a third ſtandeth up at both: One thinketh Epiſcopacy to be of Divine inſtitution; and another thinketh that it is but of humane, and God hath inſtituted no form of Church Government (as Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Reignolds</hi> and others think). The Canons of 1640. which ſet up Altars and Rails, and bowing towards the Altar, leave it indifferent, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing diſſenters not to deſpiſe or cenſure one another: One receiveth the Lord ſupper (the elements) kneeling, and then ſtandeth or ſitteth to eat or drink it (ſuppoſing that the obligation to <hi>receive</hi> it kneeling, extendeth not to the <hi>eating</hi> or <hi>drinking</hi> of it kneeling): Another doth both receive and <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> it kneeling. One uſeth the names of <hi>Altar, Sacrifice, Prieſt, &amp;c.</hi> and another is afraid leſt they will introduce the Maſs.

            <p>45. One of the greateſt dividers and troubles of the Church through the world is the Lordly, proud, impatient
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:194351:95"/> ſpirit of the Paſtors; who when they ſhould be as Nurſes to the children of God, and ſhould bear with their cryings and frowardneſs and foulneſs while they are breeding them up to a more mature and ſolid and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able temper, do treat with infants as with equals, and ſnuffe at all the quarrels and complaints which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, and look that before and without their education, they all be as wiſe and ſtaied as themſelves, and are ready to bring their actionat Law againſt every child that cryeth or complaineth, and to turn them out of the family of God: And are ſo quite contrary to that tender and gracious ſpirit and example of Chriſt, that when they themſelves ſhould be as little children, and the ſervants of all, they are ſo proud and Lordly, that they cannot bear any contradiction, diſſent or diſobedience to their Laws and dictates; But ſet up a cry, as if the Church were all on a fire, and the enemy were at the gates, and all were undone, as ſoon as their imperious and impoſing wills are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in a ceremony or an indifferent thing. God give his children tender Nurſes.</p>
            <p>46. I my ſelf have found by experience, that Chriſtians may be kept in Unity and peace, without any hereſies, factions or diviſions, by means of Scripture, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Love, by their own conſent, without compulſion.</p>
            <p>47. many of us have found, that in caſe of the peeviſh ſelf-conceitedneſs of any of our people, that fall into heretical diſpoſitions, noiſe and violence are the bel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lows of their zeal, and the chief increaſers of their folly and fury: And <hi>neglect</hi> extinguiſheth it: ſo be it that they be but ſolidly confuted to the more judicious, and the reſt kept in Unity and peace; The very neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Orthodox that are unanimous and concordant, doth quickly drain the heretical conventicles, and make the erroneous aſhamed of themſelves, and a weary of their impetuouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:194351:96"/> 48. They that can bear with ſuch in their conſtant congregations and Communion, who underſtand not the eſſentials of Chriſtianity, or whoſe underſtanding they are utterly unacquainted with; and alſo with drunkards, tiplers, ſwearers, curſers, railers, prayerleſs families, forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, gluttons, ſenſual riotous perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet will rather caſt Kingdoms into confuſion than they will bear with an honeſt godly Chriſtian, that differeth from their way of worſhip in no greater matter than a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, have ſomething more amiſs within than a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony.</p>
            <p>49. We ſuppoſe that <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>faults</hi> of ſubjects muſt be diſtinguiſhed of by Magiſtrates and Paſtors; ſome are <hi>Tolerable,</hi> and thoſe muſt be <hi>Tolerated:</hi> ſome are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,</hi> and muſt not be <hi>tolerated:</hi> we are not therefore for an univerſal unlimited toleration. And we think that thoſe, who cry out <hi>[One and All, why not one as well as another]</hi> have much themſelves of <hi>deſign</hi> or <hi>neceſſity</hi> to be tolerated, or elſe very little of underſtanding: And they may as well ſay, [If an idle talker may be endured in the Commonwealth, why not a Traytor? If there be no Law againſt Lying, why ſhould there be any againſt murder or Rebellion? If a foot muſt be cut off for a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gren, why not for a Corn?] Wo to the world when it is ruled by ſuch wits.</p>
            <p>50. Nay we ſuppoſe that no fault even in publick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion is therefore to be left incorrigible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Magiſtrate wanteth <hi>power</hi> to meddle with it (though <hi>Heart-ſins</hi> and <hi>unproved ſins</hi> are out of his cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance): we doubt not but the Magiſtrate may puniſh <hi>evil doers</hi> where God or nature make no exception, or diſable him not, <hi>Rom. 13. 4, 5, 6.</hi> He muſt take more care of <hi>Gods</hi> intereſt than his own; and of our <hi>ſouls</hi> than of our <hi>bodies,</hi> and of <hi>Religion</hi> than of Commerce: But the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:194351:96"/> queſtion is only what he <hi>can</hi> do effectually and what not: and what means <hi>prudence</hi> requireth him to uſe.</p>
            <p>51. We would not have the Magiſtrate forbear to <hi>cure</hi> the <hi>ſmalleſt fault</hi> or <hi>error,</hi> of what kind ſoever which he can really cure: But what he <hi>cannot cure muſt</hi> be <hi>tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi> He <hi>cannot</hi> make his Subjects <hi>perfect.</hi> And we would not have him <hi>kill</hi> under pretence of <hi>curing,</hi> nor ſet the houſe on fire to kill the rats and mice, nor cure a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie headed child by cutting off his head, nor cure his cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by cutting his throat; Nor to <hi>divide</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> the Church by <hi>ordering</hi> it, nor for a needleſs ſubſcription or a ceremony, to forbid the preaching of the Goſpel of Chriſt, when it is neceſſary to the ſaving of ſouls.</p>
            <p>52. He that knoweth not himſelf to be a <hi>man</hi> and a <hi>ſinner,</hi> is not ſit to be a <hi>Paſtor:</hi> And he that <hi>doth,</hi> and is penitently conſcious, what abundance of greater ſins he hath than the Conſcientious forbearance of a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or needleſs Oath or ſubſcription, will be very tender in his uſage of others.</p>
            <p>53. A <hi>fear of ſinning</hi> is neceſſary in all that will be <hi>obedient to God,</hi> and will be <hi>ſaved:</hi> It is that fear of God, which is the beginning of wiſdom: It is therefore to be loved and cheriſhed, even when ſcrupulouſneſs miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>matter;</hi> And not to be reproached, diſcouraged, or perſecuted out of the world.</p>
            <p>54. By a <hi>tender Conſcience</hi> we mean the ſame that God in his promiſe doth by a <hi>heart of fleſh</hi> in oppoſition to a <hi>ſtony heart:</hi> We ſuppoſe Holineſs to conſiſt in the ſanctity of the three natural faculties, <hi>Active power, underſtanding</hi> and <hi>will;</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>55. The impoſing of unneceſſary <hi>ſubſcriptions, profeſſions</hi> or <hi>Oaths,</hi> is the way to fill the Church with men that are not troubled with tender Conſciences, and that have no fear of God or ſin: For if there be a thouſand Atheiſts, <hi>Infidels</hi> or impious debauched perſons, that either <hi>believe</hi> not, or regard not the life to come, and make no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of any ſin at all, what ſhould hinder all or any of theſe, from <hi>ſaying, ſubſcribing</hi> or <hi>ſwearing any</hi> thing, that their profit or honour or eaſe or ſafety doth require? And ſeeing undoubtedly <hi>it is ſo, Quaere,</hi> whether he that believeth that ever he ſhall be judged by the great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor of the flock, ſhould not be as much at leaſt afraid, of letting in ſuch Presbyters as theſe into the Churches of his Dioceſs, as of enduring holy faithful men, that fear a <hi>lie</hi> or <hi>Oath</hi> or <hi>ſuperſtition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>56. All are for Toleration (uſually) that need it: And ſo would they be that now deny it.</p>
            <p>57. He that knoweth the <hi>frailties</hi> of all <hi>mankind</hi> and the <hi>weakneſs of</hi> moſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> yea and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> doth know that all <hi>mankind, all Chriſtians,</hi> and all <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi> have great need of ſome (yea of <hi>much) tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> not to <hi>cheriſh</hi> their ſin, but to endure the ſmell and trouble of their Ulcers, till they can be cured. And as <hi>Seneca</hi> thinketh that he ſpeaketh againſt <hi>mankind,</hi> that reproacheth a man with faults that are <hi>common</hi> to <hi>mankind;</hi> ſo we do more ſoundly judge, that he that maketh a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to ſilence or excommuniate or caſt out men, for a fault common to all <hi>preachers, Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> doth make a Canon to ſilence or caſt out all <hi>Preachers, Paſtors or men.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:194351:97"/> 58. If we deſerve to be caſt out of Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in this caſe of nonconformity to the preſent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, it is becauſe we are either <hi>weak</hi> or <hi>Ignorant</hi> or <hi>wicked</hi> (for nature hath no other fault.) And on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Dioceſans will effectually provide, that none <hi>more weak, more ignorant,</hi> or <hi>more wicked</hi> ſhall be tolerated in Church and Kingdom when we are gone, and no detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment befall his Majeſties dominions by the diminution of his Subjects, we here profeſs to the world, our joyful conſent to be ſilenced and baniſhed. And I am ſo far from ſpeaking this in overvaluing of my ſelf, that I profeſs that it is my <hi>brethren</hi> that I now intend: (Though he is a fool that taketh himſelf to be no wiſer than a ſtark fool; And it's like they that deride our ſelf-abaſing conſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, will not expect that we ſhould belie ourſelves, or equal the up right with the hypocrite). And I tell <hi>poſterity,</hi> if this age will not hear, that though I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted one of the greateſt bewailers and reprovers of the ſins of the Nonconformiſts, Miniſters and people, and no flatterer of either of them, that I do verily believe [that <hi>under all the Heavens of God, there is no one party, of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> and <hi>people, more able, holy, wiſe</hi> and <hi>faithful, than thoſe that are now ſilenced and reproached as Puritans in his Majeſties Dominions; And that they are the glory of the Churches,</hi> and <hi>of the King and his Kingdoms;</hi> and <hi>ſuch as no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince in all the world is equally bleſt with.]</hi> Let malice and ignorance and intereſt ſay its worſt, I have nothing that I know of to make me partial to them, but have born as many contradictions from them as moſt men living; yet this is my unfeigned teſtimony upon my long acquaintance with them, which I leave to poſterity as a dying man.</p>

               </hi> and <hi>notoriouſly needful,</hi> to the inſtructing, edifying and ſaving of many thouſand (or hundred thouſand) ſouls, we do ſolemnly as before God and man profeſs, that we will not only ceaſe our Miniſtration, but quietly live in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate communion with the Churches, and take it for the joyfulleſt day, that ever did ſhine upon us ſince we were born. But alas, what frivolous talk is this!</p>
            <p>60. Though we ought not to be void of compaſſion to thoſe faithful and pious Miniſters, and private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who have ſuffered long impriſonments; nor of their caſe who want their daily bread, for themſelves and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, who might have lived as plentifully as their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, if they had not been conſecrated to the ſacred Miniſtry, but betaken themſelves to a ſecular life; yet ſo ſmall a matter is the hunger, or impriſonment of Miniſters, in compariſon of the miſeries of the ſouls of men, that for my part I would never mention it, nor meddle in an apology or ſuch diſpleaſing writings for them, if their own greateſt corporal ſufferings were the worſt; and the puniſhing the ſouls of the ignorant and ungodly, called not louder for pity and relief.</p>
            <p>61. And thoſe of us that (through Gods mercy) want not neceſſaries, find ſmall temptation from the <hi>world</hi> and <hi>fleſh,</hi> to deſire ever to exerciſe our Miniſtry more. For my own part, if I had not other ways had more than ever I received any way for my miniſterial work &amp; office, I muſt have lived in it (to others, though not to my ſelf) at far lower rates than I did: And we are few of us ſuch dullards I think, but by Law, Phyſick, trading or other ſecular means, we might live in more plenty and leſs obloquy than we do. When I gave men Medicines for their bodies,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:194351:98"/> they thankt me for it, and none roſe up againſt me for it with diſpleaſure, as many have done for miniſterial ſidelity: we have fleſh and blood as well as others, and know what belongeth to our eaſe and fleſhly intereſt: How glad would our <hi>fleſhly part</hi> be to be eaſed of this unthankful work, which brings the revilings and threats of men (and more) about our ears? He that hath ſuch liſt to talk, that he is contented to ſuffer all this, that he may but hear himſelf ſpeak, or be heard and applauded by ſuch as do applaud us, verily he hath a poor reward, and I account him worthy of all his ſufferings.</p>
            <p>62. They that by thruſting out the <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>ſober</hi> Miniſters and private Chriſtians <hi>equally</hi> with the <hi>hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and <hi>intolerable,</hi> will tell them when they deſire to be reſtored, that it's <hi>they</hi> that would bring in an <hi>Vniverſal Toleration</hi> of all the <hi>intolerable,</hi> do play ſo naked a game, that it's eaſily underſtood, though it muſt be ſilently and patiently endured: And if the Dioceſans cannot tolerate our <hi>Preaching,</hi> we will quietly tolerate their <hi>Per</hi>—</p>
            <p>63. We thought that Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> went <hi>too far</hi> in his Book for Liberty of <hi>Propheſying,</hi> but <hi>tempor a mutantur,</hi> and Conformiſts can change: we think it fit that the Magiſtrate go further in <hi>Reſtraining</hi> than in <hi>Conſtraining:</hi> And that he ſhould hinder hereticks and blaſphemers from reproaching the truth, and ſeducing ſouls; Yea hinder any ſin in the world; as far as he can do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out greater hurt than the <hi>good</hi> will compenſate. And as the Church muſt not ſuffer the <hi>doctrine of the Nicola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itans which Chriſt hateth, nor the woman Jeſabel to teach</hi> and <hi>ſeduce</hi> the people to filthineſs, Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors muſt <hi>ſtop ſuch mouths</hi> with ſacred argument, and ſhame them by the convincing light of truth; ſo <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates</hi> in their places muſt hinder them ſo far, as that by pulling up the Tares, they be ſure that they pull not up the wheat alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:194351:99"/> 64. Leaving the Civil peace to the care of Magiſtrates, we muſt ſay of <hi>Church Vnity and peace,</hi> that it will hardly long be kept up by <hi>bad Paſtors;</hi> (till they can make the people bad enough to be <hi>willing</hi> of them, <hi>Iſa 5.</hi> laſt) And then it is a conſpiracy againſt Chriſt, and not true peace.</p>
            <p>65. For <hi>Good people</hi> will never be well contented with <hi>bad Miniſters,</hi> nor <hi>bad Miniſters</hi> ever well like or comply with the deſires and ways of <hi>pious people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>66. Great Temptations cauſe <hi>bad intereſts,</hi> and <hi>bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts</hi> make <hi>bad Miniſters</hi> worſe.</p>
            <p>67. Great Preferments, power, wealth and fulneſs are Great Temptations.</p>
            <p>68. They that <hi>Love theſe beſt,</hi> are the <hi>worſt men,</hi> and unfitteſt for the Miniſtry, as having leaſt the Love of God and holineſs and heaven and ſouls. <hi>1 John 2. 15, 16. Phil. 3. 18.</hi>

            <p>70. Therefore whileſt the Miniſtry is in a ſtate of great worldly wealth and honour and power and fulneſs, and ſo of Temptation, the worſt men are likeſt to be the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church, except where Princes of <hi>rare piety</hi> do prevent it.</p>

He that ſaid, <hi>If the Pope were a good man, what a deal of good might he do, to all the Chriſtian world;</hi> did never live to ſee that good done.</p>

            <p>74.

            <p>76. They that ſay that the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak there of <hi>things indifferent after they are impoſed by authority,</hi> ſay very true; Becauſe he there taketh away that very ſubject, and preventeth all ſuch caſes, while he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth

            <p>2. If he direct this command to all the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> even the Authorized Paſtors as well as the people, then he extendeth it to the <hi>Authorized Rulers</hi> of the Church. But the Antecedent is evident in the firſt and laſt Chapters of the Epiſtle—<hi>Ergo.</hi>—</p>
            <p>3. If he himſelf being a Paſtor or Ruler of that Church, as fully authorized as any that ſhould ſucceed, do declare his reſolution even on moral reaſons, to uſe that Church with the deſcribed toleration himſelf, then he thereby declareth that he would have other Rulers to do the like. But the antecedent is undeniable. <hi>Ergo</hi> ſo is the conſequent.</p>
            <p>4. If this Scripture (as others) be written for a ſtanding Rule, for future ages as well as for that in which <hi>Paul</hi> lived, then it is obligatory to future Rulers— But—<hi>Ergo</hi>—.</p>
            <p>78. They that ſay it ſpeaketh not of rejecting from and receiving to <hi>Church Communion,</hi> neither directly nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially, do deny to underſtand or believe plain words, and are contradicted not only by their own Annotator Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> but by ſo many more Expoſitors as ſhould make them more modeſt in their conceits.</p>
            <p>79. Yet we our ſelves confeſs (which many late Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors note) that this doth not decide the caſe of the <hi>peoples Church Communion</hi> when Authority ſhall impoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:194351:100"/> things, nor doth it allow any private Chriſtian to <hi>take liberty</hi> to uſe or not to uſe them, when Authority <hi>taketh away</hi> that liberty: For though the Apoſtle doth both forbid ſuch impoſitions to the Rulers, as ſhall take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the liberty there expreſſed, and doth alſo forbid all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtians, to <hi>cenſure, deſpiſe,</hi> or to deny to <hi>receive</hi> each other on any ſuch accounts; yet if the Rulers <hi>ſhall break</hi> this Law of the ſpirit of God, and ſhall make ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of things indifferent as are here forbidden them, 1. Subjects muſt obey them, and take them as no longer <hi>indifferent to them,</hi> but a neceſſary duty, becauſe their governours have taken away their liberty; 2. And if the Paſtors unjuſtly caſt out men on ſuch ſmall accounts, from the publick Communion of the Church, it is not in the power of the people to reſtore them, as being not intruſted with the Keys of Government.</p>
            <p>Object. But how can any man take away the liberty that God hath given us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though he cannot do it <hi>without ſin,</hi> he may do it ſo far as that <hi>you ſhall be obliged to obedience:</hi> A judge cannot againſt right adjudge any part of your poſſeſſions to another, <hi>without ſin:</hi> But if he <hi>do it,</hi> though <hi>ſinfully,</hi> you muſt not break order, nor reaſſume your own.</p>
            <p>And it is to be noted that your <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Liberty</hi> is the conſequent of the <hi>Rulers duty,</hi> who is here required to uſe you with this tenderneſs: And if he <hi>performeth not</hi> that duty, there wanteth the hand that ſhould reach out this gift unto you, ſo that you had a diſtant <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> but no <hi>jus in re.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But is not a Rulers act null, which is done againſt the command of God: <hi>and</hi> conſequently without authority?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He hath a General Authority in his Office it ſelf to Rule you; though this text forbid him this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular act: And his ſinning againſt this one command of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:194351:101"/> God, doth not nullifie the authority of his office: And as a ſubject you are bound to obey him in all lawful things, belonging to his general office: So that if it be <hi>lawful for you antecedently, it is your duty conſequently</hi> to obey, though he ſin in commanding: And every miſtake of a Ruler will not diſoblige the Subject from obeying.</p>
            <p>But remember that all this is ſpoken only of things indifferent, and not of things forbidden by God.</p>
            <p>80. The preſent full conformity now required will never be the terms of the full deſirable unity and concord of the Chriſtian Proteſtants in his Majeſties dominion: They are <hi>Impoſſible means</hi> of ſuch an end, and therefore will make ſuch a Unity and concord to be <hi>impoſſible,</hi> Proved.</p>
            <p>If it be both impoſſible to bring all good Chriſtians judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to hold all this conformity to be lawful, and impoſſible to bring them all to conform to that which they judge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; Then is it impoſſible to agree or unite them on theſe terms—But the antecedent is true—<hi>Ergo</hi> ſo is the conſequent.</p>
            <p>Remember that by <hi>Impoſſible,</hi> we mean not that which <hi>God cannot do,</hi> to whoſe omnipotency all things are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; But that which is <hi>Morally impoſſible,</hi> and never to be <hi>done,</hi> or <hi>expected</hi> by man.</p>
            <p>1. That it is <hi>Morally impoſſible</hi> ſo far to alter their judgements, is evident, 1. In the <hi>numbers</hi> that muſt be changed, 2. In the <hi>natural operation</hi> of the intellect, which is not <hi>free,</hi> nor ſubject to the Laws or the will of man, nor fully or directly to the will of the perſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but receiveth things as they are repreſented by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, neceſſarily <hi>&amp; per modum naturae,</hi> further than as the will in part overruleth the Cogitations. 3. In the great variety of natural temperatures, and degrees of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibility and apprehenſiveneſs and ingenuity. 4. In the great
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:194351:101"/> diverſity of Parents minds and their education of their children. 5. In the different converſe of perſons, with men that have ſeveral judgements, and all of them advantage to inſtill their principles into others. 6. In the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous variety of circumſtances that men ſtand in, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the diverſity of light, repreſentations and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of things, as men and their affairs and intereſts ſtand in different poſtures. 7. In the difficulty of the controverſies which muſt be ſo generally decided: were they not difficult, ſo many, ſo wiſe, ſo learned, ſo god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impartial men would not have diſagreed ſo long about them. 8. In the reverence which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and will retain, of the worth and judgements of ſuch perſons as <hi>Ameſius, Hilderſham, &amp;c. Calvin, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> and multitudes more that have gone before them, whoſe honour no power on earth is able to deſtroy. 9. In the paucity, and diſtance of thoſe conformable Miniſters from moſt of the people, who muſt change their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; And the unaptneſs of moſt of them for ſuch a work; eſpecially when they come to plead againſt ſuch as <hi>Blondel, Salmaſius, Chamier, &amp;c.</hi> 10. In the marvellous ſuſpicion and ſcrupulouſneſs that moſt tender conſcienced Chriſtians have againſt ſeeming additions, detractions and corruptions of Gods inſtit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d worſhip: And their fear of ſinning in what they do, eſpecially deliberately. 11. From the frightfulneſs and horridneſs of the evil which they fear in conformity; which is no leſs than deliberate ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perjury, yea the juſtifying of perjury in thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and the publick renouncing their duty of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring reformation, and many other grievous ſins. I am not ſaying, that all theſe or any of them are ſuch as they fear them to be (that is to be ſpoken to by it ſelf) but only that they <hi>fear them</hi> to be ſuch. And men will never be <hi>all bold</hi> among ſuch dangers as theſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:194351:102"/> ſeem. 12. From the nature of <hi>mans</hi> underſtanding, and of God <hi>Grace,</hi> and of his <hi>promiſe,</hi> which will never <hi>ſuffer all</hi> his children to agree in ſuch things as we think ſome of theſe in controverſie to be. 13. And expereince of the <hi>continuance</hi> of theſe differences ſheweth, what may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected for the time to come. One that hath not commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Doctor of Divinity, nor is <hi>eminent</hi> for <hi>Reaſon,</hi> may eaſily know, 1. that <hi>All</hi> the Kings Subjects in three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and <hi>America,</hi> are not like to attain to more Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wiſdom or honeſty for the juſt deciſion of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, than Doctor <hi>Ames,</hi> Doctor <hi>Reignolds,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Humphrey, &amp;c.</hi> or than at preſent Doctor <hi>Tuckney,</hi> Doctor <hi>Seaman,</hi> and many other ſuch men have. 2. And (unleſs they prove much wiſer and more learned than they have done of late) it is almoſt as eaſie to prognoſticate, that conformity will not be better juſtified by them that muſt change the judgements of ſo many, than it hath been already by <hi>Downame, Morton, Burges, Covel, Bridge, Bilſon, Hooker,</hi> and the moſt judicious Doctor <hi>Field:</hi> Much leſs that our Dioceſans are like to exceed them ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far in ability and ſucceſs, as the maintaining of the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> conformity exceedeth in difficulty the maintaining of the old. (For I do verily think that if Doctor <hi>Burges,</hi> Doctor <hi>Field,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Downame, &amp;c.</hi> were now alive, they would all be Nonconformiſts; And their <hi>own wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> put us paſt doubt, that <hi>Hooker</hi> and <hi>Bilſon</hi> would be Nonconformiſts, unleſs they would forſake their publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed judgement: yea and more than Nonconformiſts.)</p>
            <p>2. And now I come to the ſecond branch of my Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent; As it is not <hi>morally</hi> poſſible, for to change the judgements of ſo many in this point, and to keep them in that mind from age to age; ſo it is as impoſſible to bring <hi>them all to conform</hi> againſt <hi>their judgements by any force that can be offered.</hi> I need not prove this to any that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:194351:102"/> that there is a God and a life to come, and believeth that any others do believe it: And thoſe that believe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe, ſhould be no Biſhops if I could help it. 1. From the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>faith and holineſs: Every</hi> one that unfeignedly believeth that there is a God and a life to come (with a true practical belief) will rather die than deliberately and continuedly do that which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth doth diſpleaſe God, and forfeit everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. 2. Gods <hi>promiſe</hi> is to ſtrengthen his ſervants againſt ſuch wilful impenitent ſinning, and to keep them by his power through faith unto ſalvation: If Chriſt ſhould ſuffer all his members to be deliberately and impenitently guilty of that, which they verily think is aggravated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, Miniſterial Lying, renouncing reformation, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the ſins of thouſands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then ſhould the gates of hell prevail, and his Church be no Church (becauſe not holy), and conſequently Chriſt be no Head of a true Church, that is, no Chriſt. He that hath commanded, <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do; but fear him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke 12. 4.</hi> will give grace to his ſervants to obey his commands; for he hath promiſed to write his Laws in their hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. And the Martyrdom undergone in ſo many ages doth aſſure us, that men will rather <hi>die,</hi> than deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do that which they judge to be ſo great a ſin. 4. And the ſufferings of <hi>theſe times</hi> do tell you what men will <hi>further</hi> undergo, if you follow it on to the utmoſt: Some have died in priſon already; And ſome have died of the diſeaſes there taken; And many families live in very great neceſſities, that in the days of Uſurpation had food and raiment. Lately I ſaw a credible letter craving relief for a godly Miniſter in <hi>Kent,</hi> who (when his infirmities lately contracted will permit him) doth ſpin at the wheel to get ſome bread for his family: And many others have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:194351:103"/> more. It is therefore evident that <hi>Violence</hi> will never make them forſake that which they judge of ſo great truth and neceſſity to their own and others mens Salvation.</p>
            <p>81. He that thinketh that <hi>all other men</hi> will do that which they think is ſin againſt God, and will damn their ſouls, to eſcape any penalties of humane Laws, doth thereby tell the world, either that he thinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more honeſt than all ſuch others, or elſe that he would do theſame himſelf, which he expecteth from them, if it were his own caſe; And ſo, that he would ſell his ſoul to ſave his fleſh. A Biſhop therefore ſhould eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be againſt ſuch violence leſt he diſgrace himſelf, and tell the world what he is, and what he would do, by tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them what he thinks others will do.</p>
            <p>82. My own acquaintance in <hi>England</hi> perſwadeth me confidently to believe, that (however very many would venture their ſouls to ſave their bodies, yet) if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops could get Laws to hang all Nonconformiſts, or burn them as the Proteſtants in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> days, there would many hundred Miniſters, and many thouſand of private Chriſtians, rather be burnt than do the things now queſtioned againſt their Conſciences.</p>
            <p>83. He that <hi>truſteth</hi> to <hi>puniſhments</hi> to procure <hi>Church concord,</hi> muſt in reaſon look to the <hi>end</hi> of ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not delude himſelf and his ſuperiors, by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they will do what he would have them do. When <hi>leſſer puniſhments</hi> are tryed, either he will proceed to <hi>greater,</hi> or <hi>not.</hi> If not, he hath but confirmed thoſe whom he thought to change, and made the matter worſe than before: If <hi>yea;</hi> then he muſt reſolve <hi>how far</hi> to go. If he come ſhort of <hi>baniſhment or death,</hi> the perſons are ſtill left alive, uncured and more ſtiffned. If he would have our Rulers proceed to <hi>baniſhment</hi> or <hi>death,</hi> either it muſt be of <hi>ſome,</hi> or of <hi>all</hi> Nonconformiſts. If but
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:194351:103"/> 
               <hi>ſome,</hi> the reſt will ſurvive to be a differing party, and will increaſe their company by the advantage of their brethrens ſufferings. Would any man have thought that when Queen <hi>Marys</hi> flames had conſumed ſo many, the remnant ſhould change Religion ſo ſoon? Or when the French Maſſacre had murdered forty thouſand (as <hi>D'a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vila</hi> computeth, or thirty thouſand as credible <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>anus)</hi> that the remnant (even when the Leaders were cut off) ſhould be thereby ſo increaſed, exaſperated and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, as to do that which was ſhortly after done, till their Head was King? Or when the Iriſh had ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murdered two hundred thouſand, that the ſurvivers ſhould ſo quickly uſe them more ſeverely than ever they had been uſed before?</p>
            <p>But if you would have <hi>All cut</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> or baniſhed, 1. It will be a greater loſs to the King and to the Conformiſts left behind, than ten more Oaths or Ceremonies will countervail. 2. It will but ſend many beyond Sea to defame you by their ſufferings. 3. All foreign nations that favour their cauſe, will the more abhorr you. 4. As <hi>Tertullian</hi> faith, <hi>dum ſolitudinem faciunt, pacem vocant;</hi> you will but make deſolation and ſolitude, though you may call it <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>peace:</hi> you <hi>cannot</hi> indeed do what you think to do: For thouſands that will ſtretch their Conſciences to conform, will hate you and your ways the more, and will be but ſuch as were formerly called <hi>Conformable Puritans;</hi> and will have the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to ſupplant you, by ſtanding ſo much <hi>nearer</hi> to you. You know what a <hi>Conformable Epiſcopal Parliament</hi> did; and you know what an <hi>Aſſembly of Conformable Divines</hi> did, not long ago. 5. And if you <hi>could</hi> cut them all off, you cannot prevent the reſurrection of them in their poſterity. If ever blood would have extirpated diſſenters, the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes</hi> had been rooted
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:194351:104"/> out; when Hiſtorians tell us of ſo many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand killed, as is almoſt incredible. 6. The hiſtories of cruelties are one of the greateſt encreaſers of the party for the time to come, in other lands and Generations. 7. And laſtly, it is ſuch kind of fame that it leaveth upon the agents, that few men that care for their ſurviving names, if they know it, can be willing of. It is no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>Pilate</hi> to have his name in the Creed; nor to <hi>Herod</hi> to have his name in the Goſpel; nor to <hi>Nero</hi> to have killed <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul, &amp;c.</hi> No nor to thoſe great Princes who killed ſuch perſons of their own Religion as <hi>Seneca, Lucan, Cicero, Demoſthenes, Cato, &amp;c.</hi> or that baniſhed <hi>Juvenal,</hi> and many ſuch more: Nor to the ſtate or people that killed <hi>Socrates, &amp;c.</hi> nor to the <hi>Athenian</hi> Tyrant from whom <hi>Solon</hi> and ſuch others fled; no nor to the Roman Clergy that killed <hi>Sovonarola,</hi> and tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Campanella,</hi> and impriſoned <hi>Galilaeus</hi> and many the like: ſeeing, as Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> noteth (though not to his own eſcape) that Learning it ſelf (and if joyned with great piety, <hi>much more)</hi> doth leave ſo great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on the minds of men, that though the owners of them prove to be faulty, yet poſterity uſe to have diſhonouring thoughts of thoſe by whom they ſuffer.</p>
            <p>It remaineth therefore that we muſt either <hi>deſpair of ever having</hi> Unity and Church concord, or elſe we muſt have it on other terms, than the maſters of Prelacy contrive and endeavour it. One of the two muſt needs be choſen.</p>
            <p>84. To have no <hi>Church concord,</hi> will bring as many evils as they themſelves foretel when they write againſt Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The more to be blamed is that man whoever he be that will cut out mens tongues, and then write for the great neceſſity of ſpeech, or that will put Colloquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida into the pottage, and then write of the danger of <hi>purging</hi> and <hi>looſneſs!</hi> If <hi>offence,</hi> and <hi>diviſion</hi> muſt needs
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:194351:104"/> come; yet wo to the Church becauſe of <hi>offences,</hi> and wo to the Paſtors by whom they come.</p>
            <p>85. The greateſt plague of our continued Diviſions, will be (and is) the deſtruction of <hi>Chriſtian Love,</hi> which is the eſſential mark of Chriſts diſciples, and of abſolute neceſſity to Salvation. If it were poſſible for ſuch fiery and bloody books to be written againſt brethen as by ſome now are, or ſuch ſcornful books as <hi>Martyn Marprelate</hi> and <hi>Martyn Marprieſt</hi> wrote, without any <hi>abatement of Love in themſelves,</hi> can they believe that they will do nothing to deſtroy it in <hi>others:</hi> can all of their <hi>own</hi> ſide read words that are written to make men odious, and not hate them: Or all of the other ſide, hear themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled without the leaſt temptation to uncharitableneſs? Is it more natural to water to quench fire, than for ſuch books, and other effects of diſcord, to quench brotherly love? (Allowing the difference between a natural agent and a Voluntary). Nay the authors themſelves do plainly profeſs that they do it to draw men to hate thoſe that they write and ſpeak againſt: and will ſcarce call them <hi>Brethren</hi> themſelves, unleſs in a fit of ſpecial hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</p>
            <p>And if really they can poſſibly believe themſelves, that they have loſt none of their charity (if they ever had it) I ſuppoſe they ſcarce look that any one elſe ſhould believe them; whilſt, as <hi>Perſius</hi> faith,
<q>
                  <l>Scintillant oculi, diciſque ſaciſque quod ipſe</l>
                  <l>Non ſani eſſe hominis, non ſanus juret Oreſtes.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>86. And it is no ſmall miſchief, that the King (and his Magiſtrates) ſhould be ſo greatly wronged in his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; to be put to Govern a <hi>divided</hi> people, when they might eaſily have an <hi>united people</hi> to govern. Beſides the <hi>comfort, eaſe</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> of Ruling an <hi>Vnited</hi> people, and the <hi>ſadneſs, difficulty</hi> and reflections on the contrary,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:194351:105"/> Who can be ſure, or imagine that we ſhall never have a foreign enemy, or that the King will never have any uſe for the Union and concord of his Subjects, for their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and ſurer defence of him and of themſelves? And who knoweth not how uſually divided Cities and Kingdoms have been a prey to common enemies?</p>
            <p>87. And if Biſhops above all men, who think that <hi>Vnity</hi> is the very reaſon of their order and Office, ſhould have leſs wit for, or care of the Kingdom of Chriſt, than the Devil himſelf hath of his own, who knoweth that if <hi>it be divided it cannot ſtand, Mat. 12.</hi> what friends to Unity can ſuch men be?</p>
            <p>88. All the arguments for <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> which are made uſe of againſt Toleration by the Prelatiſts, and all the miſchiefs of Diviſion which they aggravate, if it prove that <hi>they</hi> are the greateſt cauſes of Diviſion, and hinderers of Church concord, do principally fall upon themſelves. It is an eaſie ſong for any man to ſing <hi>[O the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold miſchiefs of Diviſion];</hi> And a ready ſtaff to ſtrike any diſſenter with, for him that can but get the handle. The Romaniſts uſe it with as much vehemency and Spleen againſt the Proteſtants. But all the queſtion is, <hi>who is the true cauſe?</hi> and <hi>what is the true cure?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>89. Either theſe writers and talkers think <hi>ſomething</hi> or <hi>nothing</hi> to be ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> themſelves: and either the impoſition of what <hi>they think unlawful</hi> would make them Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, or it would not: If it would not, they are fitter Miniſters for <hi>Machiavel,</hi> or <hi>Vaninus</hi> (nay <hi>Vaninus</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Atheiſm) than for Chriſt. But if it would (as I will believe) were it not as eaſie then when they conformed not themſelves, to write Volumes of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of diviſion and Schiſm, and diſobedience to Laws, and of judging when we ſhould obey, and of ſects and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, as it is for them to do it againſt us?</p>

            <p>92. <hi>Vnity with Vniformity</hi> is never to be had (univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, really and durably) ſave only by placing <hi>Vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> in the <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>primitive ſimplicity,</hi> even in a <hi>few things</hi> ſo needful, or ſo lawful, that no ſober, judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtians can queſtion them; yea ſuch as the <hi>weak</hi> may be generally and eaſily ſatisfied in.</p>
            <p>93. <hi>Vnity without Vniformity</hi> (of ſeveral Churches) muſt be by <hi>Toleration</hi> in the points of <hi>Vniformity</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things indifferent, leaving each Church to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per liberty; but making thoſe things <hi>neceſſary to all,</hi> which are <hi>neceſſary</hi> indeed to the <hi>Vnity of all;</hi> which is the <hi>Eſſentials,</hi> or <hi>plain great points</hi> of Chriſtianity, in which we are all one in Chriſt, the center of our Unity.</p>
            <p>94. The beſt way is, 1. to <hi>Vnite in things neceſſary to all,</hi> by neceſſary impoſition (on ſuch as are capable,) and 2 in things of <hi>unqueſtionable conveniency,</hi> by a prudent reduction of them to the primitive ſimplicity, and this not by neceſſitating Laws, which urge by great ſeverity, but by ſuch gentle corrections, as conveniencies, order and decency ſhould be urged with: And, 3. if any will go further (as to Organs, Ornaments, Croſſing <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> to let them do it as a matter of liberty, (as the Cathedrals and Pariſh Churches now differ, and many Pariſh Churches each from other) without repining or breach of Charity; thus joyning all together according to the nature of the things.</p>

And he that will Unite <hi>all Proteſtants</hi> (or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants) muſt do it in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which <hi>all Proteſtants</hi> (or <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants)</hi> are agreed in.

            <p>96. <hi>All men</hi> are agreed in <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and in the Love of <hi>Nature</hi> (for ſo far as men have put off <hi>Nature,</hi> they have put off <hi>humanity):</hi> Therefore the Laws of <hi>Nature</hi> and Rules of equity which Reaſon dictates, are the true <hi>Jus gentium,</hi> which is the ground of Commerce in the world, without which men live as <hi>ſtrangers</hi> or as foes.</p>
            <p>97. That which all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are agreed in, is <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> that is, in their <hi>one Baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and in that one <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>Creed</hi> which is there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and in the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> and <hi>Decalogue</hi> as the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maries of things to be <hi>Willed</hi> and to be <hi>Done;</hi> In theſe I ſay, explicitely or particularly, and in the <hi>holy Scriptures generally,</hi> as far as they can underſtand them. Greeks, Papiſts and Proteſtants are agreed in all this; that is, 1. In the Sacramental Covenant, 2. In the three ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maries of the <hi>Credenda, Appetenda, Agenda,</hi> 3. And in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the holy Scriptures in General, that is, in ſo many books as they are convinced are the true Canon, and in ſo much of the ſence as they can underſtand. And who can Unite them upon other and narrower terms than theſe?</p>
            <p>98. All <hi>(Engliſh)</hi> Proteſtants are agreed, 1. In all the three forementioned formula's of Chriſtianity (the <hi>Sacramental Covenant,</hi> the <hi>three ſummaries</hi> and the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)</hi> 2. And in the <hi>ſufficiency of</hi> this <hi>Scripture,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:194351:106" rendition="simple:additions"/> all things neceſſary to ſalvation (though ſome may queſtion ſome particular books) 3. And that <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi> are appointed to Govern the Church, one by the <hi>ſword</hi> and the other by the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>Keys,</hi> according to this holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>99. He that will make a Law that <hi>all mankind</hi> ſhall <hi>Vnite</hi> in <hi>Vniformity</hi> of language, habit, temperament, dyet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would ſet them more together by the ears. And he that would make a Law (as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath done) that all Chriſtian Churches ſhall Unite in an Oath of obedience to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or in any of their ſuperadded doctrines or Traditions, would but ſet the Churches in a greater ſlame: Before ſuch divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Councils as the <hi>Lateran, Roman, Florentine, Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, &amp;c.</hi> there was ſome hope of a reſtored concord; But now till the renunciation of their pretended Infallibility ſhall make way for their Repentance, it will be <hi>impoſſible</hi> to the end of the world; any otherwiſe than to confeſs that they grant the <hi>truth</hi> (though not the <hi>ſufficiency)</hi> of <hi>our Religion,</hi> and that we approve of <hi>ſo much of theirs;</hi> and therefore reſolve to live together without the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of <hi>uncharitableneſs</hi> and <hi>cruelties.</hi> And this much, no queſtion ſhould be done.</p>
            <p>100. Accordingly thoſe Paſtors who will make Canons, that all Engliſh Proteſtants ſhall agree in ſubſcriptions, profeſſions, Oaths, forms, and Ceremonies which they <hi>are not</hi> agreed in, nor ever will be, do but ſay, we will break them more into pieces, and ſet them farther from each other than before.</p>
            <p>101. If Socinians, Fanaticks or any Hereticks or Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, will ſubſcribe the ſaid ſummaries of Religion and the Scriptures, equivocally, while they falſely interpret them, the way is not preſently to deviſe a new form of Articles for them to ſubſcribe to; but maintaining the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:194351:107"/> Scriptures ſufficiency, for the Rulers Civil and ſpiritual, to call them to account whenever they prove that they utter or teach a doctrine contrary to the Scriptures which they ſubſcribe, and to puniſh them according to the offence, or judge them to be o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Elſe (as <hi>Hilary</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of Creeds) there will be no end of new Articles and forms of ſubſcription, if we muſt have new ones as oft as deceivers will juggle and equivocate with the Old. 2. And it will do no good, for they will equivocate ſtill. If Scripture be not large and plain enough, neither will your Articles be ſo. 3.

            <p>4. Let there be Articles, or a Catalogue written of ſuch <hi>great</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>conſiderable points</hi> in Religion, which are not ſit to be <hi>contradicted;</hi> and becauſe Paſtors muſt know <hi>more,</hi> neceſſarily, than the people, and muſt not corrupt the ſacred doctrine under pretence of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, Let every Paſtor before his Ordination be examined of his <hi>underſtanding</hi> of thoſe articles; and let there be a Law that no one ſhall <hi>preach againſt any</hi> of them.

We can conſcionably forbear <hi>preaching againſt</hi> many points, which we cannot conſcionably ſubſcribe Aſſent or conſent to in themſelves.</p>
            <p>5. Let men be puniſhed according to the quality of their offence, who preach againſt the Government Civil or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and againſt the Laws and eſtabliſhed order of the Churches; or that rail and revile their brethern, and turn the preaching of the Goſpel into the preaching down of mutual Love. After the firſt and ſecond admonition, let the heretical and turbulent be avoided by the Church; and let the Magiſtrate reſtrain them at his diſcretion as is meet.</p>
            <p>6. Let Homilies or forms of preaching and Liturgies or forms of Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be impoſed (at leaſt ordinarily) on none but the leſs ſufficient that need them; and let able Paſtors have liberty, ſometime to uſe more, and ſometime leſs according to the time, occaſion and auditory.

            <p>1. OUr judgement is, that the ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>e name of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and outward forms and words and ceremonies, without true <hi>faith,</hi> and Love and <hi>Obedience,</hi> a ſpiritual and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Heart and life,</hi> will ſave no man, (that hath the uſe of reaſon): But that wicked nominal Chriſtians are in that more miſerable than the Infidel Indians, that they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:194351:109"/> are greater abuſers of mercy, and greater Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>2. Spiritual knowledge is not born with the children of Chriſtians, but it muſt coſt as much labour in us to teach, and in them to learn, the doctrine of the Goſpel, and the nature and work and hopes of Chriſtianity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as if they were the children of ſome heathens. Their <hi>birth</hi> priviledge without our labour will not make them wiſe and faithful and obedient Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>3. The moſt among us are ſo dull of underſtanding, and ſo averſe to ſpiritual and heavenly things, and ſo drowned in ſin, and taken up with the fleſh and the world, that the cure of their ſouls is a very great and difficult work, and muſt by us and them be carried on at leiſure, by great diligence and uſually by ſlow degrees.</p>
            <p>4. True Grace and virtue will not (uſually) ſupply the want of learning or Urbanity, and of an Academick or ingenuous education; nor will make men of Ruſtick wits and breeding, to have compt, polite and elegant ſpeech: Though yet it may ſuffice to ſave their ſouls.</p>
            <p>5. Thoſe that have ſuch Academical education, and polite wits, and expreſſion, and can congruouſly diſcourſe of Civil and Religious things, and have not the foreſaid lively <hi>faith, Love</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to God, nor a heavenly mind and liſe are miſerable perſons, and cannot be ſaved in that condition, however they be eſteemed in the world.</p>
            <p>6. Where both inward holineſs and learning and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance concur, it maketh men moſt ſerviceable to God and the Church, and an honour to their Religion.</p>
            <p>7. For want of clear parts and good expreſſion, many Chriſtians excellent in Grace, (that is, in <hi>faith, Love and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience)</hi> do diſhonour the holy things which they diſcourſe of, and to captious proud Wits do make themſelves oft ridiculous and contemptible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:194351:109"/> 8. He that hath ſpent ten or twenty or thirty years in ſtudies, and among books and learned men, and is pufft up becauſe he can ſpeak more congruouſly than an honeſt plowman, that never learnt more than to write and read, nor perhaps ſo much, or becauſe he can talk more pertinently and compoſedly, than ordinary good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that could never ſpeak or write true Engliſh, may next be proud that he is not an infant. And he that on ſuch accounts deſpiſeth the honeſt vulgar Chriſtians, that perhaps have much more <hi>faith, Love</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> than himſelf, is more fooliſh than the <hi>Eaſt-Indians</hi> that made a laughing-ſtock of the moſt learned <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that had but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to learn their language, becauſe they ſpake it bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenly in their preaching to them.</p>
            <p>9. We encourage none in the leaſt of their weakneſſes; but do our beſt to encreaſe their underſtanding and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive faculty: But we labour firſt and much more about the greateſt needfulleſt things; to make them holy, and ſave their ſouls.</p>
            <p>10. He that ever made conſcience of labouring faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſouls, cannot chooſe but know, how very hard a work it is to bring the vulgar to a true underſtanding of their Baptiſm, the Creed, the Lords Prayer and the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, (yea the very ſervants of our own families). And as Arch-Biſhop <hi>Vſher</hi> told King <hi>James</hi> in his Sermon on <hi>Eph. 4. 3.</hi> Let the beſt and learnedſt of them try it when they will, they ſhall find what skill (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry) is neceſſary to teach the people theſe principles that we all agree in: And to reproach them and us, for <hi>incongruities of ſpeech,</hi> long before theſe neceſſary things can be learned, is to reproach the boys of the loweſt form, and the <hi>Maſter</hi> with them, becauſe they are not accurate Graecians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:194351:110"/> 11. It is in moſt places but the far ſmaller part of the people, that we can ever bring to ſo much as aforeſaid; And the greater part in moſt places are ſtill ignorant and unwilling to learn, or meer worldlings and ſervants to the fleſh, and great neglecters of all that is higher than their belly and their eye-ſight.</p>
            <p>12. If the Great and Rich be bred up to better utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they are very happy perſons among them, that are not more worldly, ſenſual and prophane; yea and more <hi>ignorant</hi> too of the <hi>matters</hi> of ſalvation, how knowing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever as to <hi>words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. That Paſtor who preferreth this ungodly ſort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the faithful now deſcribed, and that gathereth together all the weak expreſſions of the later, to make them ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the former; or (if with no ſuch intent) doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them perſons of a <hi>fooliſh Religion,</hi> becauſe they cannot talk ſo wiſely as they ought about religion, and this at a time and in a manner, as is likeſt to harden the ſenſual in the opinion that their caſe is the better, and that learning and labouring to be ſeriouſly religious, is but a fooliſh fanciful thing; I ſay, that Paſtor is— Let his conſcience hereafter tell him what.</p>
            <p>14. When there is no known way, (but by the <hi>Schools,</hi> or by a <hi>Miracle)</hi> for the world of the vulgar to come to the <hi>higher</hi> form of wiſdom but by the <hi>lover;</hi> nor to come to <hi>Heaven</hi> but by ſuch <hi>weak beginnings;</hi> And when Grace as well as Nature beginneth with infant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable deſires and groans, <hi>Rom. 8. 26.</hi> and with an <hi>Abba</hi> father, <hi>Gal. 4. 6.</hi> (which our heart-ſearching fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtandeth, <hi>Rom. 8. 27.)</hi> And when all Chriſts Diſciples muſt enter firſt as little children into the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt form <hi>(Matth. 18. 3. &amp; 28. 19, 20.)</hi> And when the Apoſtles own followers were <hi>dull of hearing,</hi> and after long teaching (which ſhould have made them fit to be Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers)
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:194351:110"/> had need ſtill to learn the principles, and to be fed with childrens milk, <hi>Heb. 5. 11, 12, &amp;c.</hi> And few ever get above the lower rank, which all firſt enter; I ſay whenas all this is ſo, and certainly ſo, to make theſe lower Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians a ſcorn, as being of a <hi>fooliſh religion,</hi> and to diſcourage them, and diſgrace their rank unneceſſarily, is to endeavour to drive all ſerious Religion out of the world, and to keep men from ſalvation, and to brandiſh their flaming ſwords at the entrance of Paradiſe, to keep men from the tree of life—But for the Schoolmaſter himſelf to deride the lower form which with patience and condeſcenſion he is obliged by office and ſalary to teach; This is beyond a ſtrangers crime.</p>
            <p>15. We tell them of their weakneſſes and faults as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly as Reproachers do, though we do it in way of Love and not of wrath and diſcouraging words; which even fathers are forbidden to uſe to their children, <hi>Eph. 6. 4.</hi> See <hi>Baxters Directions to weak Chriſtians,</hi> and his <hi>Character of a ſound Chriſtian:</hi> and his <hi>Life of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. If any of them grow <hi>Proud</hi> with their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> we deal more ſharply and ſeverely with them, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the odious nature and tendency of that ſin.</p>
            <p>17. We take not men to be good becauſe they are not conformable; nor do we diſown any of the people for their conformity to your worſhip, Ceremonies and diſcipline, as if they were not the members of Chriſt; or were to be <hi>deſpiſed</hi> or <hi>cenſured</hi> by others. But inſtead of ſpeaking perverſe things to draw away diſciples after us (as ſeducers do, <hi>Act. 20. 30.)</hi> we labour to ſpeak the words of truth and ſoberneſs, and keep to the form of ſound and ancient doctrine, (even that which <hi>ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ubique &amp; ab omnibus recepta eſt,</hi> as <hi>Lirinenſis</hi> Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizeth Catholick verity) and to avoid novelties and vain janglings and inflaming the hearers againſt Biſhops,

            <p>18. Our Doctrine is publiſhed to the world ſo fully that no ſober man can queſtion us as a Party for it; but if any individual err, he muſt be named, and proved faulty. For our very Religion is nothing but the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> and the <hi>holy ſcriptures</hi> (which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to the Papiſts that would have more, and to all the world:) And we ſubſcribe the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Articles, as our Explication of the ſence of Scripture in thoſe points: Though <hi>Gods word</hi> only be our <hi>Religion</hi> in the <hi>Rule,</hi> and we profeſs to diſclam all <hi>addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> or <hi>diminutions,</hi> yet not all <hi>explications</hi> of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the meaning of it; And therefore are ſtill ready to give ſuch explicatory Profeſſions to any that ſuſpect or accuſe us of error.

            <p>20. We are ſo far from believing our ſelves, that the <hi>ſoundneſs</hi> of a <hi>mans</hi> judgement or excellency of his parts in <hi>other</hi> matters, hath any neceſſary connexion to his <hi>Conformity</hi> or <hi>Nonconformity,</hi> that we can hardly believe that any of the moſt fiery of our Reproachers that is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, doth himſelf believe it, when the world hath ſo large a proof in the effects, of very great Learning, judiciouſneſs and worth in many of both parts.</p>
            <p>21. And ſo far are we from thinking that no Miniſters that conform not are defective, weak or imprudent in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, or injudicious in ſome Controverſies of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that we are paſt all doubt, that the far greateſt part of the Clergy in the world are ſo; and alas, much worſe than ſo! And that it is the great numbers of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, weak, injudicious, or proud, ſelf-ſeeking, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Covetous Paſtors, that is the great plague and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of the Chriſtian Church through all the earth:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:194351:112"/> The great cauſe of the ignorance and ungodlineſs and unprofitableneſs of the people, and the dominion of ſenſuality, and the increaſe of Atheiſm, Infidelity and Hereſie, and of the great diviſions and confuſions among Chriſtians in Eaſt and Weſt, is a Clergy that is either ſo <hi>ignorant</hi> as to be <hi>unable,</hi> or ſo <hi>ungodly</hi> as to be <hi>unwilling,</hi> or ſloathful about their maſters work; or ſo <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>malignant,</hi> as to ſet up their own Domination, wealth and will, as the Rule of order and unity, and to account their ſleſhly intereſt to be the intereſt of Chriſt, and to hate and perſecute all thoſe as ſchiſmaticks and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that will not ſerve ſuch ſinful ends.</p>
            <p>22. Therefore in the midſt of ſuch a Clergy that is the <hi>worlds Calamity,</hi> as we bleſs God for the worth both of the <hi>Conformable</hi> and <hi>Nonconformable</hi> in theſe three Kingdoms, and in many other of the Reformed Churches; ſo we think it to be the <hi>wiſdom, duty</hi> and <hi>intereſt</hi> of the <hi>worthy</hi> of <hi>each opinion</hi> (in theſe points) to unite and ſtrengthen one another, and on both ſides to diſown the <hi>inſufficient</hi> and <hi>ungodly</hi> ones, rather than to ſeek to ſtrengthen themſelves by numbers of the vile and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable (that will be their ſhame and weakening at laſt), or to weaken their brethren as Adverſaries, either by <hi>cenſuring, reproaching, ſilencing</hi> or <hi>ſuppreſſing</hi> them.</p>
            <p>23. And in ſuch a world, we take it for a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that is done to the Nonconformiſts in this land, when we read ſuch accuſations, as of an <hi>incongruous expreſſion,</hi> and an <hi>invalid argument</hi> about a Ceremony, or ſuch like; And that ſuch as by their writings tell the world, that they want not will to open the worſt, do charge them with no worſe crimes than they do; And alſo that they are not ſilenced at this time, for Treaſon, or rebellion, or drunkenneſs, or ſwearing, or incontinency, or railing, or for inſufficiency or idleneſs, or for ſeldom preaching, or for
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:194351:112"/> plurality of benefices, or nonreſidency, or any ſuch immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities as theſe; but becauſe they dare not deliberately give it under their hands, that no perſon in three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms is obliged to endeavour the alteration of the preſent Prelatical Dioceſan Government, that vowed to God, in his place and calling to endeavour it, by a certain Oath illegally impoſed on the people, And becauſe they dare not Miniſterially in the Congregation declare that they Aſſent and Conſent to all things contained in and preſcribed by three books; and becauſe ſome dare not be reordained in words, that make them firſt Deacons that were ordained Presbyters, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>24. The moſt credible way to ſhew which party is the <hi>fooliſher</hi> and the <hi>ungodlier,</hi> is to make ſtrict Laws againſt an <hi>Ignorant, inſufficient, vicious, ſenſual, ſcandalous</hi> and <hi>negligent</hi> Miniſtry; and whoever is proved guilty, of which ſide ſoever, let them be caſt out: This we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not; this we would earneſtly beg upon our knees.</p>
            <p>25. We are ſo far from deſiring the diſgrace even of vicious or worldly Paſtors, that have laudable parts, that we thank God that the learning even of ſuch hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, is made any way ſerviceable to the Church; And we would promote and not cloud their due reputation. But we had far <hi>rather</hi> have <hi>experienced,</hi> truly <hi>Godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,</hi> to watch over the peoples ſouls, as in many and great reſpects to be preferred.</p>
            <p>26. And he that writeth this profeſſeth for himſelf, that when the people cry out <hi>[We cannot in Conſcience hear an ignorant man, a ſilly empty ſayer of a Sermon, nor a Miniſtry that openly juſtifieth Perjury, or renounceth a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reformation,</hi> &amp;c.] if he had not a far larger cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to ſtop ſuch perſons mouths with, and to hide or excuſe greater faults, than ſuch as ſome now aggravate,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:194351:113"/> he muſt be oftener ſilent, and a greater Separatiſt, than now he is. I confeſs I would have them to uſe ſome <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Charity,</hi> who have <hi>need of much;</hi> And til they have better waſht off the accuſation of a leproſie, I would not have them too loud in the defamation of him that hath a boile. I juſtifie not the Accuſers clamour, but ſtill rebuke them: but I as little juſtifie the ingenuity of ſuch, as have skill to aggravate a weakneſs, and not to avoid a crime.</p>
            <p>27. And he further ſincerely profeſſeth, that (being almoſt a conſtant hearer of their Miniſters,)<note place="margin">This was written when I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of <hi>London.</hi>
               </note> if of many and many that he hath heard and been under in certain years or months paſt, he could have had the happineſs to have lived under one that were but near as judicious, and able to manage holy things, for matter, method and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as many of thoſe plowmen and poor ſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers be, that are now called, <hi>Our Nonconformable followers,</hi> he ſhould have greatly rejoyced in the peoples felicity and his own. And for the homely ſtile ſo much complained of I never heard one Presbyterian uſe ſuch homely words and ſimilies as good Biſhop <hi>Latimer</hi> in his Sermons uſeth.</p>
            <p>28. Yet we are ſo far ſtill from thinking that the <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have not many faults, that it is one of the greateſt and moſt continual ſorrows of our hearts, to think how too little they excel the <hi>better part</hi> of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,</hi> and how great and common failings are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and how much their faults do diſhonour their bleſſed Maſter and holy profeſſion: and what a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance this is to the converſion of the Infidel and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then world: and what a malignant influence it hath upon the Church by corrupting, troubling and dividing it; and upon the peace of Kingdoms many times, and always on their own peace and true felicity: Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the common ſin of <hi>being overconfident of their own opinions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:194351:113"/> 29. But we perceive that their faults are but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts of that which is common to the world, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in the unſanctified: If any of them err about Church Communion or diſcipline or infant baptiſm, we would gladly heal their error; but we account it not ſo mortal, as the common practical error of the ungodly, who think a ſenſual worldly life to be better for them than a holy life, and value earth above heaven, and the body above the ſoul, and the creature above the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and the pleaſures of <hi>time,</hi> before thoſe of eternity. And the very ſin of <hi>ſelf-conceitedneſs</hi> we find ſo natural and common to <hi>mankind,</hi> that in all Civil or worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it is hard to meet with thoſe that in their miſtakes are not ſtill confident of the rightneſs of their own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions: And in matters of <hi>Religion</hi> even old igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſinner, that know not the Creed, do uſually think themſelves too wiſe to be taught, and are as ſtiffe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in their moſt erroneous conceits as the groſſeſt ſectaries.</p>
            <p>30. Therefore as the very Papiſts difference <hi>mortal</hi> ſin from <hi>Venial,</hi> and we approve of the diſtinction as it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the ſin <hi>which is inconſiſtent with ſpiritual life</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>ſo an evidence of a ſtate of death, and that which is conſiſtent,</hi> and <hi>therefore pardoned]</hi> And as God himſelf who more hateth ſin than any of us, doth yet love and pardon and ſave thoſe who have no other ſin, but what conſiſteth with a predominance of <hi>faith, Love</hi> and <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and doth not equal ſuch with the <hi>fleſhly worldly</hi> and <hi>ungodly;</hi> even ſo muſt we his Miniſters in imitation of our heavenly father.</p>
            <p>31. And we the leſs wonder that there are more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences among the zealouſer ſort in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than among the ungodly who really have <hi>no</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but are indifferent to all, which letteth them
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:194351:114"/> quietly enjoy their ſin: For men that highlieſt value any thing, are likeſt to be tempted to ſtrive about it. If you caſt gold and jewels in the ſtreet, <hi>men</hi> are liker to fight and quarrel for them, than dogs or ſwine. We are glad they <hi>ſeriouſly value</hi> truth, though we are ſorry that they cannot more clearly and concordantly underſtand it.</p>
            <p>32. If we thought that meer <hi>Civil good neighbourhood, and the common ſtate and life of men in their unrenewed naturals,</hi> were better, or as good as the ſtate and life of <hi>imperfect believers, with all their troubleſome miſtakes and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> we would next become humble Petitioners to Authority, that they would put down both Prelates and Presbyters, and take their lands and Tythes into their own lands, and employ them to ſome better uſe; and that they would ſhut up the Church doors, and baniſh the Clergy as the plague and troublers of the land, that do but vex the world with fables, and will not let men live in peace. For experience aſſureth us that <hi>Perfection</hi> is not the ſtate of Chriſtans in this life.</p>
            <p>33. Nor can we think that it is any real diſgrace to Chriſtianity, Religiouſneſs or the Scriptures, that men are ſo faulty and of ſo many minds, any more than it is a diſgrace to <hi>Health</hi> that men are <hi>ſick,</hi> or to <hi>food</hi> that ſome are <hi>weak,</hi> or to <hi>wiſdom</hi> that moſt have little of it; or to a <hi>Schoolmaſter,</hi> that his Scholars have defects, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious degrees of knowledge and apprehenſion. And if we would concur with them that hence argue againſt the common uſe of Scripture and Religion, becauſe men <hi>abuſe</hi> them, or <hi>imperfectly</hi> receive them, we muſt much more condemn <hi>humane Reaſon</hi> it ſelf, and wiſh that all the world were beaſts; becauſe there is nothing ſo troubleth the peace of Church and State, nothing ſo much cauſeth rebellions, treaſons, contentions, injuſtice, and all the villany of the world, as <hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>abuſed Reaſon.</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:194351:114"/> But we know that nothing in all the world is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Rebellion, Pride, Contention, and all ſin, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>holy Scriptures:</hi> and that if men be <hi>bad,</hi> it is not becauſe they have <hi>too much Religion</hi> or holineſs, but becauſe they have <hi>name,</hi> or elſe <hi>too little;</hi> And that it is <hi>more</hi> and not <hi>leſs</hi> that muſt cure them, if ever they be cured.</p>
            <p>34. We take it therefore to be the duty of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, freely to confeſs their ſins, and to take their faults to themſelves; and for Miniſters to lay them plainly on the perſons that are guilty, leſt they ſhould be thought to be the product of the Chriſtian Religion: And that the partiality of thoſe that juſtifie all or any of the crimes or faults of Chriſtians, doth intimate blaſphemy againſt Chriſt, as if he taught, or juſtified ſuch things. And therefore the holy Scriptures do ſo plainly open the ſins even of good men, to teach us to take our ſhame unto our ſelves, and not to caſt it on Chriſt and Religion, which moſt condemn all ſorts of ſin.</p>
            <p>35. And ſin is ſo far from being ever the better, for being found in a <hi>Noah,</hi> a <hi>David,</hi> or a <hi>Peter,</hi> that it hath manifold aggravations in ſuch, which it hath not in other ſorts of men. And it is no leſs abhorred of God, who is not reconcileable to the ſins of any: However we ſtill know that the failings of a froward and careleſs child or friend, are not ſo mortal as the contempt of a deſpiſer, or the malignity of an enemy.</p>
            <p>36. We do alſo with lamentation confeſs, that beſides the multitude of common hypocrites which are in all the Chriſtian Churches, who by open ſenſuality and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs do ſhew that they diſſemble in profeſſing Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, there are alſo many <hi>Hypocrites</hi> who profeſs a <hi>greater zeal</hi> and forwardneſs in Religion, who at the heart are Lovers of this preſent world, and ſlaves to the fleſh, and uſe Religious ſhews and forms, but to quiet their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:194351:115"/> with a deceitful hope, that they may have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a reſerve, when they can keep the world no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And theſe are the men that moſt diſhonour religion by pride and Rebellions and ſcandals and hereſies, who indeed are numbred by the ſearcher of hearts amongſt the enemies of religion.</p>
            <p>37. Accordingly we do believe there are many among the Conformiſts and Nonconformiſts, of both the fore-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed ſorts, <hi>(faulty true Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>hypocrites):</hi> And that many of the real faults and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>38. As Chriſt was crucified between two thieves, ſo hath the Church from the beginning ſuffered between <hi>Malignant worldly proud <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>39. Theſe two ſorts of enemies have ſtill uſed by their <hi>extreams,</hi> to increaſe their ſeveral ſins by their fierce oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to each other: The Sectary juſtifieth all his <hi>diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

[Theſe rebellious, factious, diſobedient people, are enemies to peace and order, and commit all inſolent villanies
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:194351:115"/> againſt their Paſtors, while they account themſelves the only Saints.] And ſo while neither ſide obſerveth that which is good in the other, but both ſides aggravate the evil (with which they are both too much corrupted) they keep up wars and contentions in the Church, and make one another <hi>mad</hi> and <hi>miſerable,</hi> the one ſort <hi>cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> and the other <hi>deſpiſing,</hi> as they in <hi>Rom. 14. 1, 2, 3.</hi> And in their rage the ſober ſtanders by are reviled and falſly accuſed by both, as the intereſt of each party dictates to their ſpleen; And muſt patiently ſuffer the reproaches of their fury.</p>
            <p>40. It is needful that the King be the Peace-keeper impartially between them both, and that he reſtrain the inſolencies and furies of both; For both are troublers of the common peace. And though neither ſide be ſo bad as the other maketh them, yet neither of them are fit for unlimited liberty; Much leſs to be armed with the ſword, to exerciſe their fury on diſſenters.</p>
            <p>41. And when diſcontents grow among the Secular ſubjects, and Civil diſtempers in the State, each of theſe parties are fit for the Great ones that head the ſeveral Factions to make uſe of: And by their railing at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they become Bellows of the common flames.</p>
            <p>42. And it is one of the Devils policies to urge States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to draw the Clergy into their Factions, that which ſide ſoever gets the better, one part of the Miniſtry may not only be ſilenced and uſeleſs, but be made a reproach to their Profeſſion, as the Incendariies and ſeditious troublers of the State.</p>
            <p>43. It is a great injury to Chriſtanity and the ſouls of men, when diſagreeing States men will not ſuffer the Clergy to live quietly by them, but will conſtrain or tempt them to intereſs themſelves in any of their Factions,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:194351:116"/> (except in the neceſſary diſcharge of their Allegiance and Fidelity to their King and Countrey) And will force them that are unſtudied in humane Laws, to decide thoſe State controverſies, even by aſſertive Oaths, which Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and Parliaments cannot agree about: And it is a

            </p>
            <p>44. The difference between the aforeſaid <hi>Extreams</hi> (the formal and malignant perſecutors, and the cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Fanatick Sectaries) is more in the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>way</hi> of Exerciſe, than in their <hi>Principles</hi> themſelves. For they are both agreed in the main, againſt the true <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>principles</hi> of Chriſtian <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Concord.</hi> They both think others more <hi>odious</hi> and <hi>leſs amiable</hi> than they are: And they both are poſſeſſed with an envious zeal (which S. <hi>James</hi> ſaith is <hi>earthly, ſenſual,</hi> and <hi>Deviliſh, James 3. 15.</hi> introducing <hi>confuſion and every evil work);</hi> a <hi>zeal,</hi> I ſay, to make each other ſeem <hi>odious</hi> alſo to all others: And though they underſtood not the ſenſe or tranſcript of their own dungeon hearts, yet the children of light can eaſily underſtand that the Epitome or Contents of the Doctrine of their learned writings and diſcourſe is but this <hi>[My adverſaries are not amiable, but odious]</hi> And the ſum of the application is <hi>[Therefore we exhort you not to love them, but to hate them].</hi> But here now they part, and the ſide that is uppermoſt uſeth, as the more particular application <hi>[Ergo, we pray you, ſilence, impriſon, baniſh, hang</hi> or <hi>burn them,</hi> and <hi>curſe</hi> and <hi>excommunicate,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe temporal Lords that will not do it,</hi> as Concil. Later. ſub Innoc. <hi>3. Can. 2, 3.]</hi> The other ſide ſay <hi>[Avoid all Church Communion with them as wicked perſecutors;</hi> and <hi>hold no communion with any of their ſide or way].</hi> So that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:194351:116"/> the difference between theſe <hi>Love-killers</hi> and <hi>peace-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is</hi> but <hi>in the top</hi> branches <hi>[Hate</hi> and <hi>deſtroy them]</hi> ſaith the one ſide, <hi>[Hate</hi> and <hi>avoid them]</hi> ſaith the other ſide.</p>
            <p>45. The true ſervants of Chriſt do differ from them both, not in approving either of their furies, nor in falling in as parties with either of the factions; but in living in <hi>Love</hi> as the ſervants of the God of <hi>Love,</hi> and making <hi>Love</hi> their <hi>end</hi> and <hi>work,</hi> and addicting themſelves to promote it in the world; by obſerving all that is good in all others, and not ſearching needleſly after their faults, nor cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly enviouſly or malignantly aggravating them, but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the beſt till the worſt be proved, and bearing with the infirmities of the weak, remembring that we alſo may be tempted, <hi>Gal. 6. 1, 2.</hi> And if poſſible as much as in them lieth, living peaceably with all men, <hi>Rom. 12. 18.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>46. If one ſide (that are all for the dead image of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and are not able to endure the <hi>ſerious practice</hi> of their own profeſſion) would ceaſe their Hypocriſie, and either <hi>be</hi> what they <hi>profeſs,</hi> or <hi>profeſs</hi> to be what they are, and would <hi>value</hi> the <hi>ſoul</hi> as well as the adorned <hi>Corps;</hi> And if the other ſide would lay by their <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ignorance,</hi> and know how little indeed they know, and remember that in this Corporeal world, Religion muſt have a <hi>Body</hi> as well as a <hi>ſoul,</hi> the Church would the better eſcape them both.</p>
            <p>47. <hi>Serious heartineſs</hi> in prayer is more acceptable to God, than formall babling in the moſt decent words; And God will bear with the rude expreſſions of his children, that have ſincere deſires. But yet before others our words alſo muſt be well ordered, that we be not a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to them, and a ſhame to the work which we have in hand.</p>
            <p>48. And in preaching, as affected <hi>jangling,</hi> and ſtarched
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:194351:117"/> words, that ſavour not of reverent ſeriouſneſs, are loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and uſually loſt labour; ſo careleſs, ignorant, ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and over familiar and ruſtick expreſſions, muſt be avoided, which ſhew that we are too bold with holy things.</p>
            <p>49. The frothy empty wits are apteſt to nauſeate and ſcorn an incongruous expreſſion, in the moſt ſerious uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sermon which they hear; And their temptation muſt not be cheriſhed by our negligence of ſpeech. But yet God uſually bleſſeth the labours of <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>hearty ſerious preachers,</hi> though they ſpeak not every word in Print. And godly ſerious humble Auditors have not ſuch quea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſtomachs as to make a great matter of a word or ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or ſound and tone, when they perceive that the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is <hi>ſound</hi> and <hi>wholeſome,</hi> and the <hi>manner</hi> plain and <hi>cloſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>50. That <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>emptineſs</hi> of ſolid matter, which maketh men loath ſuch wholeſome teaching, for want of a neatneſs in phraſe and ſtile, doth often lead them at laſt to quarrel with the ſtile and phraſe of Scripture, and to be Infidels in heart, while for profit and honour they ſeem to keep up a trade of Clergy-Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>51. When great ſecular and perſonal intereſts ſtand up in any Nation againſt ſerious Chriſtianity, or againſt the moſt devoted ſerious preachers of it, Arguments and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency then ſignifie nothing: Intereſt hath neither eyes nor ears; The faithful muſt patiently wait in ſuffering, till the righteous God ſhall plead their cauſe, <hi>Pſal. 12.</hi>
