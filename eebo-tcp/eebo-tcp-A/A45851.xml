            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>SIR RICHARD BLAGVES</hi> Speech Chaireman to the Aſſembly of the Confederate Catholicks at <hi>Killkenny,</hi> made to his Excellence the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, upon ſigning of the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Peace.</hi>

            <p>I Am Commanded by the Prelacie, Nobility, and Gentrie of the Roman Catholiques of <hi>Ireland,</hi> now aſſembled in this Citty of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> to preſent unto your Excellencie theire ardent zeale (naturally engrafted in theire hearts) to theire ſacred Soveraigne King <hi>Charles</hi> his ſervice, unto whom they ever have bin, are, and will be, moſt faythfull, &amp; loyall ſubjects; and in the next place, theire great affection to your Excellencie, and the never dying memory they entertaine, and will retayne of your moſt noble and ſuccesfull Endeavours in the joynting, &amp; ſetting together of the much diſordered frame of this Kingdome. Former Ceſſations, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations, and Capitulations did but skin over the deepe, &amp; wide wounds that were, and are in the body of it. They received no life or perfection, they abortively periſhed in the <hi>Embryo,</hi> and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed into the ayre: But the Peace (that by the great mercy of God, by the influence of His Majeſtye's graces, and by the Miniſtery, and cooperation of your Excellencie, is now to be Eſtabliſhed) will prove, (as with joy &amp; confidence wee expect) a firme, ſtable, and laſting Peace, a Peace that will cure theſe bleeding wounds, ſearch to the very roote, and plucke out all the ſplinters that remaine of them: A Peace that will (as wee hope, and is the height of our deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, as it ſhall be of our endeavours) reinveſt His Majeſtie in his juſt, due, and Royall Rights, and Prerogatives, and will reſtore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98461:5"/>
this Nation to its former luſter, plenty, and tranquillity: ſuch a Peace as allready ends all our doubts, feares, and Jealouſies in a mutuall confidence &amp; rejoycing, and will make all the Members of this Generall Aſſembly (an Aſſembly, unto which the preſent and future ages will juſtly give the glorious name of the <hi>Peace-making</hi> Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) after their many diſtractions, and long continued ſufferings, to returne unto theire ſeverall reſpective Countryes, and dwellings, with olive branches (the Emblems of Peace) in theire hands, and the words in theire mouthes that were ſaid of our ſaviour, when upon his entrance into the Citty of <hi>Naim,</hi> he mett with the funeralls of a dead young man, the onely ſonne of his following weeping Mother, whom (gratiouſly compaſſionating her teares) he reſtored from death to life, the words were, and not unaptly to be applyed to our preſent Condition, <hi>Ecce Propheta magnus ſurrexit in nobis, &amp; quiae Deus viſitavit plebem ſuam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt Excellent Lord, (whom God allmighty hath preſerved, and lead, as it were, by the hand, through a ſea of troubles &amp; dangers, to be the happie, &amp; eſſentiall Inſtrument, to mediate, actuate, and now conſummate this great worke, and to make <hi>Ireland</hi> (like the heavenly <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>) to be a Citty at unity with in it ſelfe, I cannot ſufficiently expreſſe the ſence, and joyous exultancie of theſe moſt venerable Prelats, moſt honorable Lords, moſt juditious, and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Gentry, the repreſentative body of the <hi>Roman Catholiques</hi> of this Kingdome, nor with what fervor and ardor they expect to reape the bleſſed fruites (which they have ſo long ſighed for, and did ſowe in theire blood &amp; teares) of this Peace, and of your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie's Goverment of this Kingdome, unto which, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from His Majeſtie (who is the ſpring from which theſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and favours flowe upon them) they will humbly and heartely pay all due obedience. Your Excellencie's faſt, and tryed fidelity to his Majeſtie, your owne great intereſt in the Kingdome, and the many great parts and talents that God and nature have plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endowed you with, giving them aſſurance, that your Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will produce effects ſutable to theire expectation, and that will anſwer theire deſires.</p>
            <p>It much tranſcends my weake abilityes to repreſent them, theire affections, apprehenſions, and hopes, in theire right and lively colours, and therefore I humbly begg, that your Excellencie will vouchſafe to give a benigne and favourable interpretation to what, by theire Commands, I have endeavoured humbly to offer unto your grave judgement, and conſideration, and that your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98461:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will be pleaſed to ſigne this Inſtrument, the Everlaſting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and Monument of this bleſſed Peace, as by their Commands (it having bin ſolemnly and unanimouſly by them ſo voted) I have had the honour, (a greater honour then my lowe, &amp; humble thoughts ever aſpired to) in their chaire to ſigne this Counterpart thereof, and, in all their names, moſt humbly to preſent it to your Excellencie.</p>

            <p>I Shall not ſpeake to thoſe expreſſions of duty and Loyalty, ſo eloquently digeſted into a Diſcourſe, by the Gentleman appointed by you to deliver your ſenſe, you will preſently have in your hands greater and more ſolid Arguments of His Majeſtyes gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious acceptance of them, then I can enumerate, or then perhaps, you your ſelves diſcerne, for, beſides the proviſion made againſt your remoteſt feares of the ſeverity of certaine Lawes, and beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des many other freedomes, and bountyes conveighed to you, and your poſterity, by theſe Articles. There is a doore, and that a large one, not left, but ſett open to give you entrance, by your future meritts, to whatſoever of honour, or other advantage, you can reſonably wiſh, ſo that you have in preſent fruition what may abundantly ſatisfye, and yet there are no bounds ſet to your hopes, but you are rather invited, or, (according to a new Phraſe, but to an old &amp; better purpoſe) You ſeeme to <hi>have a Call from Heaven,</hi> to excerciſe your Armes and uttermoſt fortitude, in the nobleſt, and juſteſt Cauſe the world hath knowen; for let all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98461:6"/>
incident to a great &amp; good Cauſe of warr, be examined, and they will be found Comprehended in that which you are now called warrantably to defende, <hi>Religion</hi>; not in the narrow circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed definition of it, by this, or that late found out meanes, but Chriſtian Religion, is our Quarrell, which certainly is as much, as fatally ſtruck at (I may ſay more) by the blaſphemous Lycence of this Age, then ever it was by the rudeſt Incurſions of the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and moſt avowed Enemyes to Chriſtianity. The venerable Lawes, and fundamentall Conſtitutions are trodden under impious, and, for the moſt, Mechanique feete. The ſacred perſon of the King (the life of thoſe Lawes) under an ignominious impriſonment, and his life threatned to be taken away by the Sacrilegious hands of the baſeſt of the People that owe Him obedience; And, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deare the Quarrell to you, the fountaine of all the benefitts you have but now acknowledged, and of what you may further hope for by this Peace, &amp; your owne meritts, is now in danger to be obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the execrable murther of the worthjeſt Prince that ever ruld theſe Iſlands. In ſhort, Hell can adde nothing to the deſperate Miſcheife now openly projected.</p>
            <p>And now judge, if a greater, a more glorious feild was ever ſett open to action; and then prepare yourſelves to enter into it, And receive theſe few Advices from one throughly embarqued with you in the Adventure.</p>
            <p>Firſt. Lett me recommend unto you, that to this, as to all other holy Actions, you would prepare yourſelves with perfect Charity, a Charity that may obliterate whatſoever of Rancours a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Civill warr may have contracted in you agamiſt any that ſhall now cooperate with you in ſo bleſſed a worke, and lett his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with you, (who ever he is) be, as it ought to be, a Bond of unity, of Love, of Concord, ſtronger then the neareſt tye of nature.</p>
            <p>In the next place, marke, and beware of thoſe that ſhall goe about to renew, or create Jealouſies in you, under what preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſoever, and accompt ſuch as infernall Miniſters, imployed to promote the black Deſigne on foote, to ſubvert Monarchy, and to make us all ſlaves to thoſe that are ſo to theire owne avaritious Luſts.</p>
            <p>A way aſſoone, and as much as poſſibly may be, with thoſe diſtinctions of Nations, and of Partyes, which are the feilds where in the ſeeds of thoſe Ranker weeds are ſowen by the great Enemy of our Peace</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, Lett us all diveſt ourſelves of that prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98461:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that ridicilous Ambition, and ſelfe Intereſt, which rather leads to our threatned generall Ruine, then to the enjoyment of Advantages unſeaſonably deſired.</p>
            <p>And if at any time you ſhall thinke yourſelves pincht too neare the bone by thoſe Taxes, and Leavyes that may be impoſed for your defenſe, Conſider then, how vaine, how fooliſh a thing it will be, to ſtarve a Righteous Cauſe for want of neceſſary ſupport; to preſerve yourſelves fatt and guilded ſacrifices to the rapine of a mercileſſe Enemy.</p>
            <p>And if wee come thus well prepared to a Contention, ſo juſt, on our part, God will bleſſe our Endeavours with ſucceſſe and victory, and will Crowne our ſufferings with honour, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; for what honour will it not be, (if God have ſo determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of us) to periſh with a long glorious <hi>Monarchy?</hi> And who can wante patience to ſuffer with oppreſt <hi>Princes?</hi> But as our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, ſo lett our prayer be, vigorous, that they may be delivered from a more unnaturall Rebellion then is mentioned by any now raiſed to the higheſt pitch of ſucceſſe againſt them.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now ſay ſome thing to you for my ſelfe, in returne to the advantagious mention made of me, &amp; my Endeavours to bring this ſettlement to paſſe: but I confeſſe my thoughts were wholy taken up with thoſe much greater Concernements; Let it ſuffice, that as I wiſh to be continued in your good eſteeme and affection, ſo I ſhall freely adventure upon any hazard, and eſteeme no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a difficulty too great to encounter, if I may manifeſt my zeale to this Cauſe, and diſcharge ſome part of the obligations that are upon me to ſerve this Kingdome.</p>
