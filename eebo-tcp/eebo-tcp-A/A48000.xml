            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER from a Gentleman in the Country to his Correſpondent in the City, concerning the <hi>Coronation Medal,</hi> diſtributed <hi>April</hi> 11. 1689.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have obliged me very much by the account you gave me of the Coronation: But I have had ſome Remarques from another hand, concerning the Truth of which I ſuſpend my Judgment till you inform me better.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give you the Relation in the very words, as I received it.—There was one thing which much afflicted all true <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> becauſe it is believed it never hapened ſince <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror's time; which was, that a King and Queen of <hi>England</hi> ſhould make their Proceſſion at the Coronation through a treble Rank of Armed Horſe and Foot all Foreigners. It grieved us all to ſee, that for want of ſome Interpreters betwixt them and the Multitude, which uſually preſs upon ſuch Occaſions, an infinite of the poor <hi>Engliſh,</hi> even well wiſhers to the new King and Queen, were not only rudely treated with ſterne Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and <hi>Dutch</hi> Curſes, but continually puſhed back with the Eut-ends of the Soldiers Musquets, or the Serjeans Halbards, and ſometimes received broken Heads, or as dangerous Bruiſes if they did but endeavour to get nearer. I ſaw my ſelf many Perſons knocked and puſhed upon the Breaſt with the Troopers Piſtols, and pricked with their Swords for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to couch under the Horſes heads; and when any one offered to get nearer through the Ranks of Horſemen, where they found Protection at former Coronations by their own Country-men; theſe rude Strangers were ſure to check their Horſes and make them Curvete or turn round, which could not be without the hazard of breaking their Legs, or Bruiſing thoſe that were in the way. I need not mention the Toſſing and Puſhing Men and Women from Place to Place, and Draging them through the Kennels, more like Slaves, nay Doggs, then Chriſtians, which made many Spectators Sigh and pitty the Condition of ſeveral Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds whom they ſaw ſo uſed: Whilſt others were not afraid to ſay, what moſt I believe thought, that this was but the beginning, and a light matter in compariſon of what the whole Body of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation (who are not now it ſeems to be Confided in) muſt ſuffer under theſe new <hi>Lord-Danes</hi> before the King can be ſo ſettled in his Throne that he may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſmiſs his Foreign Force; nay ſome they ſay had their Skulls broken and dy'd in the Crowd, though this is endeavoured to be ſtifled.—Neither do you mention the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Qualm my Correſpondent tells me the King had; nor the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s fall from his Horſe, when he Uſhered in the Champion, which were ſomething Ominous.</p>
            <p>The Gold Medal you ſent me, the true meaning of which you deſire me to explain, gave me and ſome Friends of mine no ſmall Diverſion. And to deal plainly with you, I think the Contriver of it hath done their Majeſties little Service.</p>
            <p>I need not tell you that the cuſtom of Stamping Medals (upon whoſe Reverſes the Inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Victories, or great Acheivements of Princes or Generals, were repreſented either expreſly or by ſome Emblem) is as old as the firſt Coynage of Money by the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> Nor that in the laſt Century and this they have been Improved, and many Ingenious Devices invented ſuitable to the Noble Enterpriſes which were by thoſe means to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated; and are to be found in the Repoſitories of Princes, or publiſhed by <hi>Luchins</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on that ſubject. Inſomuch, that we find even <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> after he had gotten entire poſſeſſion of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and filled it with his Crew of <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> notwithſtanding his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sanctity and Mortification, Coyned ſeveral Medals, which were indeed very Ominous to him; for this <hi>Muſhrum</hi> King, ſprung from <hi>Holland,</hi> continued not above ſix Months, before he was hung up in an Iron-Cage, with ſome of his Complices, upon the top of a Tower in <hi>Munſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might give you various Inſtances of Auſpicious and Inaugural Medals, but that I intend this only as a Letter. Therefore I ſhall proceed to the preſent Medal, which, of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it will be, time alone muſt ſhew; yet I foreſee it will give great occaſion to the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of our new Crowned King and Queen to paſs their malicious Cenſures on it.</p>
            <p>One of my Friends viewing the two Faces of the King and Queen, ſaid, That ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions in <hi>Medals,</hi> had oftentimes proved Unfortunate; for he had, not long ſince, by him the <hi>Medal</hi> made for the two <hi>Dewitts,</hi> which much reſembled this, if the Head Attire had not been different, whoſe inhuman Buchery by the Mobilee of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> gave the very firſt
<pb facs="tcp:65727:2"/>
riſe to the then blooming Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Greatneſs: And all the World (ſays he) knows that King <hi>Phillip</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and King <hi>Henry</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe Faces and Names were joyned in their Coyns and <hi>Medals,</hi> were not very Fortunate. But I told him, ſince the Parliament had joyned them in the Sovereignty, they could not be diſ-joyned in their Coyn, and I doubted not but their Fortunes would be alike, good or bad.</p>
            <p>When I received the Reverſe, I was heated into an Indignation that any perſon ſhould be ſo indiſcreet, as to chooſe an <hi>Emblem</hi> upon ſuch an occaſion, ſo ſubject to miſ-interpretation as this would be. For as <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> ſaid to his Wife <hi>Calphurnia, That it was not enough that ſhe ſhould be Innocent, but that ſhe ought to be ſo cautious in all her actions, that ſhe ſhould be free even from Suſpicion;</hi> ſo ought it to be with <hi>Emblems</hi> and <hi>Medals;</hi> they ought to ſignifie and expreſs ſo clearly, the Worth and Greatneſs of thoſe Princes Actions which they Repreſent, that no ſiniſter Interpretations might be made of them. And this Indignation was increaſed by the Reflection which a Gentleman made, who firſt look'd upon the Reverſe with me.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman ſeeing a Chariot, but not underſtanding the <hi>Latine</hi> Inſcription, and having heard the Town talk of <hi>Tullia,</hi> who inſtigated her Husband <hi>Tarquinius</hi> to kill her Father <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Tullius,</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that he might ſucceed him in the Throne, and, as <hi>Livy</hi> ſays, <hi>Cauſed her Chariot to be driven over his mangled Body;</hi> cried out, <hi>Is this</hi> Tullia<hi>'s Chariot?</hi> This I ſay ſhock'd me, and rais'd my anger againſt the Contriver, who had choſen ſo ill an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem,</hi> which upon ſo ſuperficial a view, brought ſuch an odious Hiſtory into Mens minds.</p>
            <p>Another by-ſtander ſeeing the <hi>Figure</hi> repreſented <hi>Phaeton,</hi> whom the Poets feign to have obtained leave of his Father <hi>Phoebus</hi> to guide his Chariot for one day, and who by his want of skill to govern the Fiery Horſes, had like to have ſet the World on Fire, had not <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſtruck him dead with a Thunder-bolt; Exclaimed againſt the <hi>Emblem</hi> as full of ill Omens, and ſaid, <hi>That the People knowing that this King and Queen had, not by Permiſſion, but by Violence, Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their Fathers Throne, would look upon this as his Chariot which they drive,</hi> and interpreted <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>'s Thunder-bolt <hi>as a Sign of ſome Judgment of God impending over our Gracious Prince, for this,</hi> which he called, <hi>An unnatural <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This made my Cheeks and Ears to burn, and I told them, they were both extreamly wide of the Inventors meaning. For by <hi>Phaeton</hi> he meant King <hi>James,</hi> who by Miſ-government had endangered the Deſtruction of this Kingdom, and that God having Compaſſion on his Church and People, had ſtruck Him from His Regal Seat.</p>
            <p>But another Gentleman then preſent ſaid, That although he verily believed that was the Contrivers meaning, yet there were ſo many Exceptions to the congruity of that Fable with the Cicumſtances of King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, that he might as well have offered the War of the <hi>Gyants</hi> againſt <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as this, to repreſent the Inaugural Glory of our King and Queen, which ought to have been the only Subject to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>He ſaid, that <hi>Phaeton</hi> could never repreſent King <hi>James;</hi> ſince the Throne or Chariot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed ſolely to Him, as Hereditary Lawful King; neither could it be ſaid that He had asked any ones leave to Guide it. But that all Men knew an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> was the <hi>Moral</hi> of <hi>Phaeton</hi> in the Fable, and an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> in his Fathers Reign.</p>
            <p>Moreover (ſaid he) If King JAMES muſt be <hi>Phaeton,</hi> then King <hi>William</hi> muſt be <hi>Jupiter</hi> that ſtruck Him out of His Chariot, or <hi>Phoebus</hi> that re-aſſumed it after he had been Thunder-ſtruck; and how diſagreeable this was to the whole Scope of the Fable, was obvious to every School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy that read <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Metamorphoſis.</hi> Nay, he further affirmed; That this <hi>Emblem</hi> ſeems to Preſage King JAMES's Returning to His Throne again, and if ſo, it would be congruous in almoſt all its Curcumſtances.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs Sir, I could not heartily contradict this Gentleman; but wiſh'd the Author had either conſulted Books or Men, for a more ſignificant and unexceptionable <hi>Emblem.</hi> But ſince he has been ſo Unfortunate, if not Malicious, if you know the Perſon, adviſe him to get himſelf included in the <hi>Act of Indempnity;</hi> it being a Crime, equal to the Counterfeiting the King's Coyn, to contrive a <hi>Coronation Emblem</hi> that gives ſuch occaſion of Cenſure and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection to the <hi>Male-contents,</hi> and <hi>Maligners</hi> of King <hi>William,</hi> our preſent <hi>Phoebus,</hi> from whom we expect a <hi>Wonderful Deliverance.</hi>
