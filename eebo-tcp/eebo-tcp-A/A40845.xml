            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For the Election of POPE

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N obedience to your Lordſhips commands, I have
undertaken to render you a Succinct Relation of the
Proceedings of the Conclave in their Election of Pope
<hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth. In the beginning whereof I muſt
ingeniouſly confeſs my ſelf perplexed with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and fear, when I conſider the brevity of man's life, and how
often we find Joy and Tears to be each others ſucceſſors; ſeeing
that in the little ſpace of 18 months we have ſeen five Popes,
<hi>Sextus, Urbanus, Gregorius, Innocentius,</hi> and <hi>Clement:</hi> which acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
it is poſſible, never yet did happen: and they do the more
affright me, as being the ſcourges of a Celeſtial Power upon us, to
admoniſh us of our deceits and grievous ſins. And if ever there were
a Conclave full of turbulency, contentions, danger and difficulty,
fit to beget a Schiſm amongſt us, certainly this was the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and dangerous; in which every thing had gone topſie turvy,
had not the Divine Providence interpoſed his right hand, and
made uſe of his Omnipotency in the compoſure of all diſcords, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58865:5"/>
uniting in a happy Concord thoſe diſpoſitions that were before at
variance: not alone to the amazement of thoſe that ſaw it, and
were active in it; but to them alſo that have heard, or ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
hear of it. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Ninth, a man of innocent life,
and eminent virtue, having attained the Popedom at the age of 73
years, did ſurrender his ſoul unto the Sovereign Creator, within
the ſpace of two months, to the great grief of all <hi>Rome,</hi> being
deprived of that great hope ſhe had conceived of his equity and
prudence, of which virtues (to the alacreous comfort of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Rome)</hi> he had begun an happy demonſtration; inſomuch
that it ſeemed unto them that God had only ſhewed, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
him upon them. From hence there being a neceſſity to
Elect a Succeſſor unto him, the Cardinals were all repleat with
various thoughts, and perplexed with diſturbant cares; not only
becauſe there was not in the world a more important buſineſs,
but alſo becauſe they were extaſied with diſtractions amongſt
themſelves, Every one intending to procure an Election according
to his own Inclination and Intereſt. But it was a rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
thing, that amongſt ſo many diviſions, they ſhould all,
or the moſt part, aim at the Election of the ableſt and moſt
honeſt perſon: As an evidence that all Contrarieties muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to honeſty and virtue. And if at that time we have ſeen
one that was the moſt worthy of the Popedom (as we may ſay)
and yet to ſee him eclips'd, we cannot but diſcern ſome occult
and Divine Providence, to which we muſt ſubmit our beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.</p>
            <p>The Cardinals were divided into three Factions: the firſt was
of <hi>Spain</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Madruzzo,</hi> with whom alſo
did ſide divers others that were either that Kings Subjects, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,
Kinſmen, or Dependents. The intent of the King (as
his Miniſters did avouch) was very good, who was onely deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of a Pope that was honeſt and zealous for the glory of
God: As alſo (it ſeemed) that all other Princes did deſire
it. But in truth, to examine their Proceedings more narrowly,
the ſcope of every ones intent was to deſire one to whom he
himſelf had the neareſt relation. In which deceit the Royal
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58865:5"/>
Miniſters, reſolving to approve themſelves ſolicitous and expert
in managing their Maſters affairs, concluded that no other ſhould
be Pope than one of theſe, that is, <hi>Columna, Como, Palioto, Santa
Savarina,</hi> and <hi>Madruzzo.</hi> And although outwardly they did
moſt appear for <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> yet it was eaſily diſcernable,
that they were inwardly more inclinable to <hi>Madruzzo;</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
him the man that they had more truſt in, hiding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
with great ſubtilty this their ſecret intention: But that
you may the better underſtand how things were at that time,
you ſhall know, that the Cardinals of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faction (were
it either diffidency, or jealouſie, or any other paſſion) were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
divided amongſt themſelves, one ſtanding for one Pope,
and a ſecond for another; in which diviſion there were ſome that
did not only refuſe all the prenominated perſons, but would have
introduced others in whom the King could not confide; as is
apparent by examination of the effects, without any further ſearch
into the particulars at the preſent. There were ſome that were of
an opinion, that that faction had at that time another misfortune
and impediment, which is, that <hi>Madruzzo</hi> being the Pilot of
that Ship, and aſpiring to the Popedom, it may be more by the
perſwaſion of others than any inclination of his own, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
his thoughts with a great deal of ſubtilty; and did not
indeavour the promotion of others, but did rather craftily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them, that thereby the way of exaltation may be the more
facile and open unto him; although others ſay, that theſe were
but falſe rumours and ſuſpitions.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Faction was that of <hi>Montalto,</hi> chief of the Creatures
of <hi>Sextus</hi> the fifth, joyned with the <hi>Spaniards, Venetians,</hi> and <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi>
with a reſolute mind to make <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> Pope, which
was his Reſolution at the former Conclave, (as it is manifeſtly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent)
for, at which time there was a talk of the Adoration of <hi>Santi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatro,</hi>
he then asking <hi>Mendoza,</hi> who was then the head of the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, <hi>Which would be more acceptable to the King, of</hi>
Santiquatro <hi>or</hi> Santa Savarina? <hi>Mendoza</hi> wittily anſwered him, <hi>That
they were both fair in respect of the King.</hi> And <hi>Montalto</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
again, <hi>Which of the two would be more willingly received by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58865:6"/>
the King? Mendoza</hi> immediately anſwered him, <hi>That they ſtood
both equal in the Kings eſtimation:</hi> Inſomuch that all Scruple being
removed from <hi>Montalto,</hi> he went and did unanimouſly concur
with the reſt in the Adoration of <hi>Santiquatro.</hi> Here many will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at the Alteration of <hi>Montalto,</hi> who was in a poſſibility of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Santa Savarina</hi> Pope, when <hi>Gregory</hi> the fourteenth was elected,
and have engaged <hi>Spain, Tuſcany,</hi> and divers other Creatures
unto him, yet would never apply himſelf to his Favour, ſhewing
that he did abhor his Nature and Severity, and fear that his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation
would be his Depreſſion, and that the ſame thing ſhould
diſpleaſe him now, which before was ſo plauſible to him; and that
he would now ſo much confide in him, whom he had ſo much diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
before. But Miracles muſt be Paſſive, where the Hand of God
is Active, who is the ſole Director of all humane Affairs, and his
Works above the Search or Apprehenſion of Mans Capacity: Yet
there have not been wanting acute and ſubtile Wits to ſearch out the
Cauſe of this Mutation in <hi>Montalto;</hi> ſome are of opinion, that
this alteration in <hi>Montalto</hi> did proceed from this, that he was now
better informed of the good D<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſpoſition of <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> than he
was before; others attribute it to the great Inſtance of the great
Duke, who deſired no other to be Pope than <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him, that he being once inveſted in the Papacy, would
aſſume him as much into his Favour and good Eſteem, as ever he
was in the opinion of <hi>Sextus.</hi> Others report, that he did it to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
himſelf with <hi>Spain,</hi> who deſired likewiſe that he ſhould be
Pope, <hi>Mentalto</hi> being reſolved altogether to depend upon the
Protection of that Crown, having conſidered that he could not
make choice of a more ſecure Protection than this for himſelf and
Family. Others did conceive it did proceed from the Fear that
<hi>Montalto</hi> did alwaies ſtand in of <hi>Paliotto,</hi> doubting that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
would ſet him up again, and pitch upon him or elſe upon
<hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> or upon <hi>Madruzzo</hi> or <hi>Come,</hi> all which he did
equally loath, as a ſick Man doth bitter things. There have been
ſome beſides that eſteemed this Practice of his to be a Stratagem,
that he might by that bait of <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> invite the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
to confide in him, and to induce them to accept him for one of their
Creatures, in caſe that he ſhould not make any of the other afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58865:6"/>
to be Pope; <hi>Montalto</hi> intending with that Art to couzen
the Art of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſeeing that the Report went, that they
would joyn with him, with Intention to make uſe of his favourable
Indeavours; but that he ſhould not do the like of theirs unleſs it
were by Conſtraint; and to make themſelves ſecure by that Union, of
thoſe Subjects that were abſolutely excluded by them <hi>Salviati,
Verona,</hi> and <hi>Mondovi,</hi> that none of them might by chance be made
Pope againſt their will. But leaving off theſe Conſiderations unto
them who are deſirous to examine them, we ſhall ſee that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of <hi>Montalto</hi> is really to make <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> Pope; and
in caſe he could not accompliſh that, then to ſettle it upon ſome
Creature of his own, aiming chiefly at <hi>Aldobrandino,</hi> as the more
probable man by reaſon of his good Nature and excellent Virtues;
as alſo becauſe of the prompt Inclination of the whole Colledge
expreſſed to him in former Conclaves, and for the exceſſive Love
he alwaies bare unto him, having alwaies reputed him as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
although with a great Prudence he did ſtrive to conceal
that Affection, fearing to give offence unto the reſt of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>The third Faction was that of <hi>Sforza</hi> the chief of the <hi>Gregorians,</hi>
amongſt whom there were excellent Men; but unfortunately they
were oppoſed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> not through any deſerts of their
own, but becauſe of their particular intereſt, and reaſons of State:
from whence <hi>Sforza</hi> conſidering all theſe things, and obſerving
the great difficulties that oppoſed him, he conceived it altogether
impoſſible to promote any of his Faction to the Papacy; wanting
for that preſent, the favour and aſſiſtance of <hi>Montalto,</hi> with the
help whereof he had obtained all his former Victories; he ſaw
that at that time he had not one of his Eaction that had the
countenance of <hi>Spain</hi> for his ſupport, as formerly he had: as
<hi>Santo Marcello</hi> who was after <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VII. <hi>Cremona</hi> who was
<hi>Gregory</hi> XIV. and <hi>Santo Quatro</hi> who was <hi>Innocentius</hi> VIII.
elected one after another with the help of the Nomination and
Favour of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of <hi>Montalto:</hi> He perceived that at that time
the only aim of <hi>Spain</hi> was to exclude the chief of his Faction; he
did conſider that in all reaſon the Colledge ſhould make ſome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58865:7"/>
equal Dividend of their Favours amongſt the other Factions. But
the thing that did only diſguſt him was, that <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> a
man by him extremely diſaffected, was in all probability likely to
be preferred, Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> being then dead. <hi>Montalto, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druzzo,
Gaietano, Monti</hi> and many others, together with <hi>Ceſſa</hi>
Catholick Embaſſador began to practiſe openly in behalf of <hi>Santa
Savarina,</hi> with ſuch a Fervor, that they publickly ſaid, <hi>They had
the Papacy in their hands:</hi> either it was that they did verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, becauſe of their powerful Faction; or elſe it was to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
their Adverſaries from attempting to exclude him: which
way was more hurtful to the Cauſe of <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> ſeeing it
proved an Irritation and Spur to thruſt his Adverſaries into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
and ſo excite them by all poſſible means to hinder him:
from whence it is a thing in this place remarkable that it is more
ſecure to make his way by plauſible and ſmooth Actions, than
by violent and thundring, and rather to eſteem of his Enemies,
than to contenmn them. Therefore <hi>Sforza, Altempos, Arragona,
Colunna, Alexandrino, Sfondrato,</hi> and others of their Adherents,
being incenſed not only to ſee ſo much Favour for <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi>
but alſo that they would make him Pope in ſpite of them, made
an Union and a League amongſt themſelves to oppoſe his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
giving Aſſurance to each other by Oath, to reſiſt him to
their utmoſt power, and not to decline that Union upon any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
whatſoever. And certainly it is a miraculous thing, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that they ſhould engage themſelves in Oppoſition to an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of ſuch Difficulty that it was almoſt impoſſible for them to
overcome. Nevertheleſs guided by the Holy Ghoſt they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to attempt it, applying themſelves with all Induſtry againſt
<hi>Santa Savarina;</hi> and to deſtroy his Practices they did propound
to the Cardinals his extreme Severity, with the Damage and
Ruine that muſt accrew both to the publick and the private, if he
were made Pope. After that, they did endeavour to put a diffidence
between him and <hi>Montalto,</hi> and the Faction of <hi>Spain</hi> and the
<hi>Florentine,</hi> under divers Colours and Arguments: And to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
and take off <hi>Montalto</hi> from him, they attempted him with
Glory and Intereſt, and to advance one of his Creatures to the
Papacy: they did invite <hi>Madruzzo</hi> likewiſe with the ſame Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58865:7"/>
and Promiſes; as alſo not being wanting to inſinuate into
the Minds of all his Competitors the Facility they might find in
procuring the Papacy for themſelves, wherein they would be aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
unto them: which Suggeſtions were very powerful and
would have been greedily ſwallowed by any who had not a more
divine Illumination to conclude, the Intention of theſe combined
men was to excite on all ſides Confuſions, Diviſions, and Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
to divert and break in ſome part the Plots and Practices
of <hi>Santa Savarina.</hi> Theſe Contentions were pleaſing unto thoſe
who out of a ſelf-conceitedneſs did believe out of theſe Revolutions to
work a way to their own ends: and if any had reaſon to hope,
<hi>Madruzzo</hi> was not to be debarr'd his ſhare of Expectation; for if
<hi>Santa Savarina</hi> ſhould be once excluded, <hi>Montalto</hi> (in reſpect
of the King's Favour) would in all probability caſt a favourable
Aſpect towards him: Nevertheleſs the Practices of <hi>Santa Savarina</hi>
went on with ſuch a heat, as can hardly be imagined, becauſe
<hi>Montalto</hi> was every day more ſolicitous in it; the great Duke had
Intention to no body but to him; the Count of <hi>Olivarez</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Embaſſador, before he went to be Vice-roy in <hi>Sicily,</hi> planted a
great Foundation for him both in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> A wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thing that two Princes that were of different Spirits ſhould
concur with ſuch earneſtneſs in the ſame Subject, that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
impoſſible to diſcern which was the moſt forward in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
towards him: Neither were theſe Favours ſecret but open,
neither was it a new thing, but continued a long time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the greateſt deſires of theſe Princes, and the greateſt
Endeavours of their Miniſters. The Cardinals which did exclude
<hi>Santa Savarina</hi> were few, but they were united, they were ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
in all, <hi>viz. Arragona, Colonna, Paleotto, Cemo, Altemps,
Canano, Mondovi, Lancidotto, Aſcoli, Sforza, Sfondrato, Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicino,
Boromeo, Aequaviva,</hi> and <hi>Platta.</hi> On the contrary ſide
he had many Supporters, that you might have ſeen Kindred at
diſagreement; <hi>Ruſticuccio</hi> was favourable unto him, <hi>Alexandrino</hi>
Opponent, the Young <hi>Colonna</hi> did adhere unto him, the Old did
abhor him. There were alſo ſome of the Factions that were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
from their Heads; <hi>Farnezi</hi> a Creature of <hi>Sfondrato</hi> voted
for him, and <hi>Sfondrato</hi> his Chief excluded him; on the other ſide,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58865:8"/>
               <hi>Aſcoli</hi> and <hi>Baremeo</hi> Creatures of <hi>Montalto</hi> did diſagree from the
ſame <hi>Montalto.</hi> It is ſaid that <hi>Aſcoli</hi> did it to pleaſe <hi>Alexandrino,</hi>
who was Author of his Greatneſs, and <hi>Boromeo</hi> to pleaſe <hi>Altempos,</hi>
who was his Kinſman and Benefactor. It is ſaid that <hi>Sfondrato</hi>
made himſelf one of the Heads of the Excluſion for many Cauſes,
but chiefly to hinder the Increaſe of <hi>Gaiatano</hi>'s Fortune, knowing
how much he was in Favour with <hi>Santa Savarina.</hi> The while
theſe Practices were managing in this manner with ſo many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
and Helps that there was a general Voice in <hi>Rome,</hi> that
without doubt he ſhould be Pope; ſome intimate Friends of <hi>Sfon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drato</hi>
ſpake to him in this manner.</p>
            <p>My Lord, Out of the Services which we have devoted unto you,
and for the Honour and Happineſs of your ſelf and Family, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you to hearken with an impartial Ear to what we ſhall ſay unto you.
In making your ſelf the Head of the Excluſion of <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi>
you expoſe your ſelf to an app<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rent Danger of Ruine. The Excluſion
of it ſelf is moſt odious and difficult. Do you not hear the publick
Voice of <hi>Rome,</hi> That <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> is Pope? Who can reſiſt againſt
ſo many Aſſiſtants, as he hath, from <hi>Spain,</hi> from <hi>Montalto,</hi> from the
<hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Venetians?</hi> Do not you ſee that you oppoſe that King, on
whom he and the Duke his Brother chiefly depend? Do not you ſee that
you displeaſe the greateſt part of the Sacred Colledge that deſires him?
Do you not ſee that this is againſt the holy Will of God, who hath
decreed him to be Pope, for ſome great Myſtery and ſome remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Benefit of his Holy Church? All the reſt that are combined in
this Excluſion are engaged by their Intereſt, Emulation, Contention,
or Hatred, all which may be in ſome degree excuſable; but you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
none of theſe Motives, the greater will be his Offence he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from you, that if by chance your Lordſhip have received any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>information
againſt him, be not too credulous; for many times there are
Spirits that under the colour of Zeal do ſow Seditious Tares to raiſe
Diſcords amongſt the good, and to hinder all worthy perſons of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
they do deſerve. To conclude, if you be pleaſed to conſider the
troubles that may enſue that Action, imagine that <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> be
Pope already: what diſpleaſure and grudge will he have in his heart for
oppoſing him? And conſider that in your adverſity and affliction you ſhall
find very few that will be any way aſſiſtant unto you. Do you not know
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58865:8"/>
that a wiſe man doth not conſider the beginning but the end of things?
Conſider that it is now in your power to make him Pope, and altogether to
ſave the honour of thoſe that exclude him, and to make unto your ſelf
and the reſt of the Excludents an immortal Friend of <hi>Santa Savarina.</hi>
If the greatneſs and fortitude of your Soul, my Lord, ſhall accuſe us
of puſillanimity or fear, at laſt you will not deny that in things of a high
concernment, it is requiſite to have a faithful counſel, and mature advice.
Therefore we wiſh you to take your recourſe unto God, that he may direct
you in a better courſe, and to accept of our advertiſements, with as
benigne a conſtruction as our hearts did dictate to our Tongues in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sfondrato</hi> ſtood attentively to hear them, and then gave them this
anſwer: <hi>In truth you could not give me a greater or more pregnant te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of your love unto me, than to diſcover the care you have of
my proceedings both in honour and ſafety. Thus have you expreſt your
ſelves as faithful and loving friends, which I will keep always dear in
my memory, and ſhall endeavour to merit this your favour with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of my Reſpect, and the aſſiſtance of my ableſt Fortunes. But be
certain that in this buſineſs of the Election of a Pope, neither Hatred,
nor Reſpect, nor Suſpicion, nor Prayers ſhall withdraw me from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
and Oath which I have made to God and his Holy Church, to
prefer always his Service before all Intereſt, and all humane Reaſons.
And let any man ſay what he pleaſe, if the Holy Ghoſt doth inſpire me
to give my Vote to</hi> Santa Savarina, <hi>I will give it him readily: And ſo
do you pray to God for me, to direct me what is beſt, and diſmiſs all fear
from you; for where it ſhall pleaſe the Holy Ghoſt to lead, there is no
danger to follow.</hi> The days appointed for the Funerals being expired,
and the Maſs of the Holy Ghoſt having been Celebrated in St. <hi>Peters</hi>
Church, and the Oration <hi>de ſummo Pontifice eligendo</hi> having been
made by the Biſhop of <hi>Traſie;</hi> upon the 10th. of <hi>January,</hi> 1592.
the Cardinals went in a Proceſſion from St. <hi>Peters</hi> to the Conclave,
with the Singing men before them, ſinging <hi>Veni Creator Spiritus:</hi> the
Cardinals were all in number 52, the which being entred the <hi>Paulina,</hi>
they made firſt devout Prayers, and the Singing men being gone, they
did remain in the Conclave in their little Cells: others went to their
Palace to Dinner. That day was laborious and tedious, becauſe of
the great multitudes of people that did come to viſit their Lordſhips.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58865:9"/>
And amongſt others, <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> was very much ſtreightned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the publick Voice and Fame that was diſperſed, that the
next morning he ſhould be made Pope; it being an antient cuſtom,
that in the times of proſperity every one ſheweth himſelf a moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Friend. The Ambaſſadours of Princes did alſo ſweat in their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits
and Solicitations of their Maſters ſeveral intentions. The Duke of
<hi>Ceſſa</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain</hi> did ſtay there till eight of the Clock,
which long ſtaying did adminiſter cauſe of divers ſuſpicions; ſome
verily believed it was to confirm his Solicitation in favour of <hi>Santa Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varina;</hi>
others did more diſcreetly conjecture that it was only done to
paſsover that night without doing any thing; removing with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying
of time the thought, and the intention that <hi>Mantalto</hi> and his
party had that night to carry him unto the Adoration; it being the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the moſt Judicious, that in that firſt ardour or heat, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and confuſion, they would without doubt have made him Pope:
from whence it came, that by the long ſtaying of the Catholick Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
the party of <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> miſſed the opportunity of ſo fair
an occaſion: at laſt the Ambaſſadour being gone, <hi>Montalto</hi> being
weary of that inconvenience, and deſirous to lead <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> to
the Adoration, was very earneſt and importunate to have <hi>Madruzzo</hi>
with the ſame promptitude to go with him to put it in execution.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that <hi>Madruzzo</hi> and <hi>Spinola,</hi> who did govern the Faction
of <hi>Spain,</hi> did give counſel to <hi>Montalto,</hi> that it was not fit to attempt
the Adoration, unleſs they were afreſh aſſured of the Votes, the will
of man being mutable in the revolution of one hour, ſaying, That it
was much better to defer it till the morning, and rather go ſecurely,
than in precipitating of the buſineſs in ſo ſhort a time, which was
againſt the honour of the promoted and the promotors: but the event
proved, that this Counſel was prejudicious, and that it is not proper
to retard execution after a mature deliberation: as it was done in this
caſe. <hi>Montalto</hi> being unwilling to diſapprove of the Counſel of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druzzo,</hi>
did protract it till the next morning, and in the mean time
was not idle, but intentive to continue his ſolicitation; reviewing and
comforting his party, and others that had promiſed him: he went to
reſt, but great thoughts being active with him, made him ariſe
before it were day, and proſecute his ſolicitation to the reſt. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druzzo</hi>
being unwilling to ſeem backward in the buſineſs, did call to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58865:9"/>
all the Cardinals of the Faction of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> and
went with them to the Chamber of <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> who at that time
was in Prayer: the Cardinals, amongſt which was <hi>Aſcanio Colonna</hi>
did ſalute him, and honour him as Pope, and took him from his
Chamber, conducting him to the Chappel of <hi>Paulina</hi> to worſhip him;
being encountred by <hi>Montalto</hi> with a great deal of joy, as one that did
hope every hour to accompliſh what he deſired to bring to paſs. It was
a pretty thing to obſerve how thoſe that did follow, did buſtle to get
before him to be taken notice of, and to expreſs their alacrity to ſee his
Exaltation.</p>
            <p>Being come into the Chappel, it was remembred that they ſhould
ſend for <hi>Gieſualdo</hi> the Dean of the Cardinals, to give the greater coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and authority to his Adoration; who though a little late came
with a face full of Joy, thinking that <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> with the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of his Adherents would have overcome all oppoſition. Now
as careful and laborious as theſe parties were to promote the Adoration,
no leſs active were the Excludents to hinder it. And although they
knew they were not a competent number to make good the excluſion,
yet they were not daunted continually to cry <hi>Dominus providebit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having no time to make a Congregation as they did deſign,
doubting that while they were making of it, and conſulting what they
ſhould do, the contrary Faction ſhould eſtabliſh him Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their face. Nevertheleſs in that ſhortneſs of time they did give
ſuch orders as they thought beſt for to reſiſt their firſt attempt, which
to be ſhort were theſe, that none of them ſhould enter into the <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
for fear he ſhould be unadviſedly conſtrained to do what he would
not willingly have done, but that they ſhould all keep themſelves in
the Chappel of <hi>Sextus,</hi> or in the Hall; that as they were divided from
the others in will, they ſhould be alſo ſeparated in place: after that
every one of them ſhould do his uttermoſt endeavour with his Friends
and Kindred, to withdraw or ſeduce one at the leaſt from the other
Party, ſeeing that one could either give or take the Papacy: And if
they could not procure one Vote, they ſhould at leaſt impetrate that
they could not give it that morning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arragona, Colonna,</hi> and <hi>Altempos</hi> being ſick of the Gout, cauſed
themſelves to be carried into the Hall, hoping thereby their preſence
and authority to retract ſome one from giving their Vote. <hi>Sforza,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58865:10"/>
Sfondrato, Boromeo,</hi> and <hi>Aquaviva,</hi> valorous and generous Cardinals
were attentive with zeal to the ſolicitation; one interceding with one,
and the ſecond conjuring another: Inſomuch that amongſt the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
of both Factions, there were many contrary conflicts, every one
ſeeking to draw another to his ſide. <hi>Alexandrino</hi> was invited to enter
into the <hi>Paulina,</hi> who did not refuſe, but did firſt deſire to ſay his
Office and Prayers. <hi>Ruſticuccio</hi> was prayed by the Excludents to come
into the Chappel of <hi>Sextus,</hi> where ſome of his good Friends were
attending to ſpeak with him; but he anſwered that he could not ſtay
becauſe the reſt were already gone to make the Pope in the <hi>Paulina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Altempos</hi> was ſitting in the Hall, with a countenance ſo rigid and
ſevere, that it ſeemed to thoſe that came in, do not make <hi>Santa Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina</hi>
Pope. The Cardinal <hi>Del Monti</hi> hoping to mitigate him, went
at his turn with a chearful countenance towards him, and told him,
<hi>My Lord, you ſee that we are all here together to worſhip</hi> Santa Savarina
<hi>for the Pope, and that work, being guided by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
his concurrence to it, and that all the honour and merit of ſo
great an action ſhould be attributed to himſelf alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Altempos</hi> who could not hear a harſher note than this, turned unto
him with a diſtaſteful aſpect, and with a voice ſo ſharp and loud, that
it made every man there to take eſpecial notice of it: and ſaid unto
him, <hi>I have no need at all of your counſel, Cardinal</hi> Del Monti, <hi>go
you if you liſt, and worſhip the Pope of the Devil.</hi> Which words
coming forth of his mouth with ſuch fury, did ſtrike them all with
fear and ſcandal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> having been conducted into the Chappel, and all
the Cardinals in a due preparation to worſhip him, <hi>Sforza, Sfondra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
Boremeo,</hi> and <hi>Aquaviva</hi> ſtood before the door to ſee and obſerve
what they were doing within, as alſo to diſtract and diſturb their
minds: neither were they fruſtrated in their expectation, becauſe there
aroſe no ſmall fluctuation and confuſion amongſt them, ariſing from
the diverſity of their interlocution, and there going to and fro in a
perpetual motion: which confuſion being obſerved by the ſupporters
of <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> to be prejudicial to their proceedings, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to appeaſe thoſe confuſions, ſaying, <hi>That this was no time of
Diſputation and Diſcuſſion, but of Adoration, ſeeing they were all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
to make ſo ſanctified an Election.</hi> Then <hi>Gieſualdo</hi> as Dean,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58865:10"/>
with a great deal of zeal roſe up and ſaid unto <hi>Santa Savarina, That
it was convenient for him to take notice, that in all Conclaves it was uſual
to have Emulations, and Contentions; becauſe humanity was ambitious
of honour and priority: therefore that there might be a placid progreſs in
every reſpect, he both requeſted and exhorted him to forgive his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents.</hi>
To which the other courteouſly replyed, <hi>That notwithſtanding
the oppoſition of others he was not moved in himſelf: Therefore he did
forgive them all; promiſing that he would be always reſpect<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto them. La Rovere</hi> being not yet come into the Chappel, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talto</hi>
and <hi>Mattei</hi> went to his Chamber to fetch him, where they
found <hi>Sfondrato</hi> and <hi>Boromeo,</hi> who were diſſwading him to ſide with
<hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> repreſenting unto him his own honour and greatneſs.
And that if he did give his Vote to another, he deprived himſelf of
his own fortune, and his friends of the opportunity and deſire they
had to make him Pope: which occaſion being once omitted, would
never be revokable: Exhorting him not to deſpiſe their counſel, nor
his good fortune, remembring that Charity begins at home, and that
<hi>Montalto</hi> did him a great deal of wrong, propoſing <hi>Santa Savarina</hi>
unto him who was a creature of another Faction, he being created
Cardinal by <hi>La Rovere</hi> his Uncle Pope <hi>Sextus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide <hi>Montalto</hi> was earneſtly ſolicitous with him to be
faithful to his promiſe, and to ſhew himſelf courteous in continuing
the reſpects of ſo many eminent Cardinals. To conclude, not to ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
his own fortune, in refuſing thoſe offers that <hi>Montalto</hi> had made
unto him, to render him gracious in the ſight of <hi>Santa Savarina;</hi>
This good Lord being diſtracted by the diverſity of theſe Opinions
and Counſels, reſolved at laſt as an affable and generous man, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the advice and requeſt of <hi>Montalto</hi> to his own honour and fortune:
And therefore with the aſſiſtance of the other two Cardinals, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on his Robes; he went to paſs his Vote for <hi>Santa Savarina;</hi> and
paſſing through the Hall where <hi>Altempos</hi> was ſtill ſitting in his Chair,
<hi>Altempos</hi> looking with a rigid countenance upon him and the other
two Cardinals, one each hand of him, could not forbear virulent lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
againſt the reverend old man. Theſe being all come into the
Chappel, the ſupporters of <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> began afreſh to proſecute
his Adoration: on the other ſide <hi>Sforza</hi> and <hi>Aquaviva</hi> began with a
loud voice, and a great deal of atrogance to cry out, that they neither

ought, nor could proceed any farther, without calling the Votes unto
a number, ſaying, That they were certain that there was not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
number to complete the Adoration: And if they did proceed
in the Election contrary to the accuſtomed manner, they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
the nullity and invalidity of the ſame: which proteſtations did
produce a greater murmur and confuſion in the Chappel; ſome ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there was no notice to be taken of ſuch proteſtations, they
not being valuable, and only done to prevent the Adoration: and ſo
much the rather, becauſe it was not uſual to reckon the Vote, but only
after the Adoration. Others did affirm it to be requiſite to reckon all
the Votes, whereby all objections and oppoſitions might be taken off.
In that ambiguity and irreſolution the Dean ſaid, That things may be
done Canonically, and with the Holy Peace of God, and to remove
all ſcruples that might be objected againſt the Election, it would be a
thing worthy and neceſſary to take the number of the Votes. And
himſelf at that inſtant went about to take an account of them, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with thoſe that were next unto him; ſhewing by the hand, and
nominating with the voice, My Lord ſuch a one, one; my Lord ſuch
a one, two; my Lord ſuch a one, three; and my Lord ſuch a one,
four. And upon that number of four, ſtaying, and looking back,
he complained of the great noiſe that was in the Chappel, ſeeing that
not only the Cardinals were not ſitting, but going to and fro confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dly:
and after a little while he began to reckon them afreſh, ſaying,
one, two, three, four; and being interrupted again, upon the ſame
number he ſtood, complaining, and intreating the Cardinals to keep
their places, and be ſilent, ſaying, it was impoſſible to reckon them in
ſuch a confuſion. To conclude, it was a miraculous thing, that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to number them over and over, he could not get beyond the
the number of four.</p>
            <p>The ſupporters of <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> did proteſt and aſſure the Dean
that they were a perfect and competent number; and in the mean time
ſome of them did offer to go to the Adoration. The Dean ſaid, <hi>Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
my Lords, let us do our things well and Canonically, it belongs to me to
be the firſt, and I do wiſh it as zealouſly as any man; but it is requiſite
that all things ſhould be done according to Cuſtom.</hi> Thoſe within ſeeing
that ſuch impediments and confuſions did proceed from the Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
who were at the Chappel door, perturbating their Affairs,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58865:11"/>
ſaid, that it was therefore neceſſary that the door ſhould be ſhut. But
<hi>Sforza</hi> and <hi>Aquaviva</hi> oppoſed themſelves againſt it, ſaying, That the
Chappel door ought to ſtand open, that every one might have free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
and egreſs at his pleaſure, which was ſpoken by them as knowing
which of them were reſolved to come out. Thoſe within did reply
that no body was held by force in the Chappel, that every one that was
there was free in his Election, and therefore adviſed every one that
was without to enter joyfully, and ſo unanimouſly concur to Elect a
Pope; proteſting that other ways they would make him themſelves:
Adding, that if they thought by their objections to propagate a
Schiſm, they were extreamly miſtaken, becauſe God Almighty would
not permit it; and they were of themſelves a competent number to
make an Election and Adoration. Thoſe without anſwered, Make a
Pope according to your own humour, and we will come and Worſhip
him in St. <hi>Peters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this confuſion there was order given to the Secretaries of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and to the Maſters of the Ceremonies, to write out the names of
all the Cardinals; which going round about, and nominating, and
writing faithfully, were nevertheleſs miſtaken amongſt themſelves.
And it was obſerved for a ſtrange thing, that Cardinal <hi>Cuzano,</hi> a man
of a noble preſence, of a great body, and greater virtue and goodneſs,
was for all that overſeen by them; or if he were ſeen, was left out at
already written; of which error, taking at laſt notice, to rectifie that
error, they began with a loud voice to call my Lord <hi>Cuzano,</hi> who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering,
ſaid, Here I am, who enquires for me? Some Cardinals did
alſo endeavour to take the number of their names, and the buſineſs
was the more confounded, one reckoning on the one ſide, and one on
the other; one finding more, and the other leſs; ſo that it became
the more intricate, by the reaſon that it paſſed through ſo many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
hands; others with a quicker eye had reckoned them, and found
them to be a juſt number, but did not publiſh it, leaving the care of
it to thoſe whom it did concern. It is certain that in the <hi>Paulina</hi> there
were 36 Votes, and of two and fifty Cardinals which were in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave,
there was not only two parts of three, which is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
but one Vote more; which the Excludents perceiving, and that
they were not ſufficient to maintain the excluſion, not knowing which
way to turn themſelves, and to procure any remedy, they found
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58865:12"/>
themſelves in a grand perplexity; being conſtrained to adhere to or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
<hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> both which were prejudicial to their former
deſign: ſome of them being of opinion that there was both more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and ſafety, by the concurrence of their Votes with the reſt for
<hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> thereby the more to oblige him, than by oppoſition
to loſe on all ſides. It is reported that <hi>Sforza</hi> and <hi>Sfondrato,</hi> being
as it were deprived of all hopes, called for their Rochets to go into the
Chappel, to follow there the will of God, and to have the honour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to have made a Pope. But <hi>Aquaviva,</hi> being a man of an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and indefatigable ſpirit in all occaſions, ſent the Auditor his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claviſta
into the <hi>Paulina,</hi> to bring him the juſt number of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
that were there; who returned with this anſwer, that there were
but four and thirty: but the Cardinal thinking they were more, and
that he had miſtaken himſelf, he ſent him back again, to tell them
over again, which he did with the utmoſt of his care, aud brought
him word that they were no more than 34; although in truth they
were 36: yet this did not proceed either from malice or deceit, but
from miſtake. And upon this new relation he did animate <hi>Sforza,</hi>
and <hi>Sfondrato,</hi> aſſuring them that the Includents of <hi>Santa Savarina</hi>
were but 34. Adding, that although they had been 35, they could
not complete the Adoration, becauſe <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> could not adore
himſelf. Then the Excludents went with new acclamations to the
Chappel door, calling with a loud voice the Dean; who not hearing, or
not willing to hear, they were very attentive, and did with wonderful
dexterity endeavour to procraſtinate the buſineſs. They did intreat
the Cardinals that were next them to call the Dean, who told them
that they might come themſelves into the Chappel, and ſpeak with
him; thinking by that bait to have drawn them into the Chappel,
which would have been held as an argument of their concurrence in
the Election, But they perceiving their ſubtilty, would not come in,
but called for <hi>Farnezi,</hi> who at the laſt came to demand what they
would have? Then they aſſaulted him with violent importunities
that he would retire with them, but all was in vain; he anſwering
them like a diſcreet and prudent Cardinal, That in ſuch an action
he was reſolved to follow the Divine Inſpiration, knowing that with
it there could be no digreſſion. And having ſaid thus, he returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Chappel without expecting any reply.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58865:12"/>
The old <hi>Colonna</hi> being extreamly afraid that <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> ſhould
be Pope, did ſend oftentimes <hi>Gerlinzoni</hi> his Conclaviſta to tell <hi>Aſcanio
Collonna</hi> that he ſhould come out of the Chappel, and that he ſhould
not ſtay there to ſee his own ruine: But ſeeing that the other would
not ſtir, and his fear ſtill increaſing, he ſent him at length a note under
his own hand, intimating unto him his promiſe, that at any time
when he could inveſt him in, or deprive him of the Papacy, he would
decline his Vote from <hi>Santa Savarina;</hi> as now he had an opportunity:
And that he would not at the requeſt or perſwaſion of any other be the
Confuſion of himſelf, his whole Family, and many others of his beſt
Friends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſcanio</hi> having received the Note, and having meditated a long
time on it, whether he ſhould declare himſelf for <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> or
not, finding reaſons and contrarieties on all ſides; at laſt diſcerning
that it lay in his power to make or not to make him Pope, did reſolve
(as he ſaid) being inſpired of God, to retire himſelf: And in the
going out of the Chappel, received a double violence, becauſe thoſe
within held him back, and thoſe without pull'd him forwards. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that his Rochet was torn: And not being content to go out
only, did alſo ſay that <hi>Aſcanio Colonna</hi> would not have <hi>Santa Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina</hi>
to be Pope, becauſe he was not appointed of God. When the old
<hi>Colonna</hi> ſaw him out of the Chappel, and near unto him, he kiſſed
him on the forehead, ſaying, <hi>O my dear Son, O thou honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Family of the</hi> Collona<hi>'s, be thou bleſſed for ever.</hi> All the
reſt of the Excludents did imbrace him, and collaud him for ſo brave
an action; thinking themſelves at that time quite exempt from all fear
or jealouſies. If the retreat of <hi>Colonna</hi> was ſo acceptable to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludents,
certainly it was to the Includents as diſagreeable: By reaſon
that by the privation of that Vote, they were incapable to make the
Adoration. And knowing that this diſaſter did happen becauſe the
Chappel door being open, the Excludents took advantage to interrupt
their proceedings. And that the example of <hi>Colonna</hi> his exition might not
be prevalent with any other, the door was preſently ſhut, which raiſed
new fears in the Excludents; doubting that remaining in the <hi>Paulina</hi>
with 35, they might with a publick <hi>Scrutinium</hi> proceed to the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of him, whom they had ſo much aimed at; who although by
way of Adoration he could not adore himſelf, yet by way of Election
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58865:13"/>
he might Elect himſelf: and therefore ſtood all amazed and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>Altempos</hi> being without fear, and full of courage, turned himſelf
to the young Cardinals, and ſaid, <hi>Be not afraid my Lords, knock,
bounce, break the door in pieces.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Sforza, Aquaviva, Sfon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drato,</hi>
and <hi>Boromeo</hi> began to ſtorm, and make ſuch a noiſe and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
that to prevent ſuch an inconvenience they opened the door
again. Then <hi>Sforza</hi> and <hi>Aquaviva</hi> began afreſh to proteſt the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and invalidity of their proceedings, if the door were not left open;
ſince that by ſhutting the door they kept by violence thoſe Cardinals
that were within. Here I cannot pretermit the rare example of <hi>Santa
Savarina,</hi> his great humility and conſtancy; who, ſeeing in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
action ſo many great and dangerous ſtorms ariſing, ſaid openly, <hi>If
for my ſake ſuch perturbations and rumours do happen, I pray your
Lord<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hips let the door be opened, that I may be gone, and ſo theſe diſcords
and ſtorms may be appeaſed:</hi> which was an evident teſtimony that there
was in him no ſpirit of Ambition. His ſupporters were ſtill very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
to proceed to the Election. And the Dean began to ſay,
<hi>Let <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

before any further progreſs be made therein to make a Reconciliation
with the Excludents, and to invite them to come willingly to the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
hoping that God would move them to it. And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he nominated <hi>Madruzzo,</hi> offering himſelf to go along with
him, which motion was approved: they went and inſtantly intreated
their Adverſaries from henceforth to put off all diſcontent in a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſo high a conſequence as the Election of the Vicar of Jeſus
Chriſt: and that they would come chearfully, becauſe <hi>Santa Savarina</hi>
had forgiven whatſoever was paſt, and would prove a Father and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor
unto them all: and that they ſhould make a Pope who
would be a prop and honour unto the Catholick Church; Certifying
them that they had proceeded ſo far in it, that without their aſſiſtance
they had made him Pope: and that they would rather reſolve to come
voluntarily than by violence. The Excludents did anſwer, <hi>That
knowing the moſt holy mind of the ſacred Colledge, they were certain that
their Lordſhips would not wonder that not one of them would change his
mind, becauſe it was not any hate that they did bear unto</hi> Santa Savarina,
<hi>but that they did nothing but by holy Inſpiration; confiding that they
ſhould be not only excuſable, but commendable for it; ſeeing chiefly that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58865:13"/>
there were many others in the ſacred Colledge, for the Election of whom
they would voluntarily concur.</hi> It is ſaid, that <hi>Sfondrato</hi> did enlarge
himſelf ſo far to <hi>Madruzzo,</hi> as to tell him, <hi>That although he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the Election of</hi> Santa Savarina <hi>who was nominated by the King;
nevertheleſs he was confident that his Majeſty as a good and Catholick
Prince would not take it ill, and would not eſteem him the leſs his Servant
for all that: and that</hi> Madruzzo <hi>as a good and diſcreet Nobleman did not
contradict him.</hi> There wanted not opinions that the ſending this
Embaſſage was prudently done, but that there was a miſtake in the
Election of the Embaſſadours, they being perſons to be ſuſpected that
they were not well inclined to the Exaltation of <hi>Santa Savarina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Embaſſage of <hi>Gieſualdo</hi> and <hi>Madruzzo</hi> proving fruitleſs, and
returning back into the Chappel, they began to conſult what they
ſhould do to proceed to the Election: ſome did ſay that they could
not make the Adoration, becauſe they were not in all above 35, and
that <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> being not capable of adoring himſelf, the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
would prove imperfect: Others ſaid that there was no better or
ſecurer way of proceeding than by the Scrutinium, by which <hi>Santa
Savarina</hi> might Elect himſelf, and ſo the Election be made valid
and perfect, ſeeing that out of 52, 35 was a complete number. That
opinion was accepted generally; and therefore it was ordained that
Maſs ſhould be celebrated, and that the Cardinals ſhould receive
the Communion according to cuſtom. The Dean, to whom it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
that morning to perform thoſe Holy Myſteries, did withdraw
himſelf, and went to his hours of Prayer, and Confeſſion: all which
things did take a great deal of time. In the mean time order was given
to the Excludents, that they ſhould come to Maſs, and to receive the
Communion, and that they ſhould be aſſiſtant to the general Scruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,
according to the antient cuſtom; who did anſwer, <hi>That they
did wonder that thoſe Holy Rites were not performed before, as by the Bull
it is commanded: Therefore they were alſo reſolved to hear Maſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Communion in the Chappel of</hi> Sextus, <hi>as they did by the hand of</hi>
Sfondrato, <hi>refuſing in any manner to joyn with the reſt, ſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aring that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly
they might fall into ſome act which might be prejudicial unto
them.</hi> At length the Dean having ſaid Maſs, and celebrated the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in the <hi>Paulina,</hi> himſelf, <hi>Sans,</hi> and <hi>Montalto</hi> as chief of the
Orders went to fetch the Votes of the Excludents, who to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58865:14"/>
of any ſuſpicion and ſtratagem; as alſo to hear how things went
and to reſiſt them if need were, They ſent <hi>Sforza</hi> and <hi>Aquaviva</hi> to be
preſent at the Scrutinium: before whoſe coming the Dean ſaid unto
<hi>Santa Savarina, That out of his great zeal and piety he ſhould do well
to forgive all them that had been opponent againſt his Exaltation:</hi> who
anſwered, <hi>That the firſt thing he learned in his infancy, in the Rules of
Chriſtianity, was to forgive injuries, and therefore he did again with all
his heart forgive all, and would at any time give them all poſſible ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
Verona</hi> being a good and zealous Cardinal, did beſeech him
beſides that he would not take exceptions againſt <hi>Boromeo</hi> for any thing
he had done in this buſineſs, becauſe it did not proceed from any ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
but only to comply with <hi>Altempos. Santa Savarina</hi> did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
and ſay, <hi>That he always loved him, and that he would love him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
as his own Son, becauſe he did ſo neerly reſemble that great Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi>
Boromeo, <hi>who was the greateſt Light, and rareſt preſident of Piety
that was in the Church of God for many years.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Verona</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overcome with this mildneſs, asked what name his Holineſs would
be pleaſed to aſſume? who anſwered, <hi>Clement.</hi> And <hi>Verona</hi> ſaid that
the aſſumpſion of that name was very proportionable to the benignity
and clemency of his mind.</p>
            <p>It was reported that <hi>Gaetano</hi> went to the Chamber of <hi>Canano,</hi> where
he lay ſick of the Gout; intreating him to give his conſent for <hi>Santa
Savarina,</hi> wherein he ſhould perform as meritorious and heroical an
action as could be imagined. <hi>Canano</hi> excuſed himſelf, ſaying, <hi>He was
not able to go out of his Cell, being tormented with extremity of pain in
his feet, Gaetano</hi> ſaid, <hi>That that ſhould be ſupplyed by carrying him in
a Chair. Canano</hi> anſwered, <hi>That the pain lay in one of his toes, which
he could not ſtir without a violent diſturbance.</hi> But <hi>Gaetano</hi> perceived
that <hi>Canano</hi> his Diſeaſe lay more in his head than in his heel, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied,
took his leave and left him. <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> his Conclaviſta
although not proſperous, deſerves to be remarkable for his cunning
herein, who perceiving a great probability of <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pope, went to the Chamber of <hi>Canano,</hi> telling him that he was
Elected Pope, and deſired to ſee him: but this craft of his was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the ſubtilty of <hi>Canano,</hi> who craftily anſwered him, <hi>That
he would take ſeme convenient time to conſider of it,</hi> yet for all that did
not ſtir. It was certainly a miraculous thing, and an evident teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58865:14"/>
that <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> was not deſtined to be Pope; ſeeing that
amongſt ſo many applauſes and gratulations, and having that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been carried from his Chamber by the two chief heads <hi>Madruzzo</hi>
and <hi>Montalto,</hi> with thirty and odd Cardinals, and conducted into
the <hi>Paulina</hi> to be adored: And having been ſo long a time ſaluted and
eſteemed as Pope, and Cardinal <hi>del Monti</hi> having gone out of the
Chappel to give notice to all the ſeveral Conclaviſta's to break open the
doors and walls of the Conclave, becauſe <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> was made
Pope; yet for all theſe tokens and advices, not one of the Conclaviſta's
would ſtir, or pack up any Cloaths, as is uſually done in ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to prevent the plundering of the Souldiers in the Chambers of the
Cardinals, when they come into the Conclave after the Election of the
Pope.</p>
            <p>The death of <hi>Gonzaga</hi> and <hi>Mendoza</hi> are apparent evidences that
he was not like to be Pope, they both being his chief ſupporters; the
former dying few days before the vacancy, the other at the time of their
going into the Conclave: and beſides the not coming of the Cardinal
of <hi>Auſtria</hi> from <hi>Germany,</hi> as was daily expected; for by the aſſiſtance
of any one of them he would have been Pope. Moreover to obſerve the
incredible conſtancy and unity of the excludents, and the murmuring
they made; proteſting that they had rather be expoſed to any torment
than go to his Adoration.</p>
            <p>The Cardinals were yet ſitting in the <hi>Paulina</hi> every one in his place,
the Faction of <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> did urge and propound that the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinium
might be made publickly, becauſe already every Cardinal had
publiſhed his Vote, and given his conſent, having raiſed him out of
his Cell, ſaluting him Pope, and bringing him into the <hi>Paulina</hi> to
worſhip him: and that none could retract, neither did the retreat of
<hi>Colonna</hi> any way invalidate his former conſent which he had given for
ſo many hours, and by ſo many ſigns. <hi>Sforza</hi> and <hi>Aquaviva</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that this was the direct and certain way to make him Pope, ſeeing
that none of them durſt have denyed their Vote in a publick Scrutini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
for fear of proving ingrateful and unfaithful in his promiſes,
with all poſſible ardour did oppoſe themſelves againſt it, calling that
a new and unknown way contradicting all antient and accuſtomed
proceedings, contrary to the Liberties of Cardinals, who in giving
their Votes are not to comply with any man, but only to ſatisfie their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58865:15"/>
own Conſciences: therefore that the Scrutinium ought to be made
ſecretly, otherwiſe they proteſted the nullity of the Election, calling
the maſters of the Ceremony as publick perſons to take notice of their
proteſtations.</p>
            <p>In theſe new contradictions it was a marvellous thing that 34 Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
that were in the <hi>Paulina</hi> on the behalf of <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by too much confidence of themſelves, or rather by a Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
ſhould ſubſcribe unto two Cardinals in a deliberation wherein
did conſiſt the loſs or victory of each party: and ſo much the more,
there being no Bull that did prohibit to make the Scrutinium pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
in ſuch a caſe.</p>
            <p>The opinion of making the Scrutinium ſecretly being prevalent, all
fortune preſently departed from <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> notwithſtanding his
proteſtation which he made in theſe words, <hi>Sine tamen praejudicio pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
is meae Electionis.</hi> The Votes that were given on his behalf were 28,
with that of <hi>Montalto</hi> and <hi>Pinello</hi> 30: inſomuch that he wanted 4
Votes, which with his own after would have made 35, which would
have been a complete and perfect number to have made his Election in
a publick Scrutinium.</p>
            <p>His ſupportors did remain all in confuſion, and replete with ſhame
to have been ſo groſly deluded, and durſt neither ſpeak nor lift up
their heads; attributing to themſelves the fault that the Scrutinium
ſhould be made ſecretly. On the other ſide the Excludents were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with joy for having obtained ſuch a victory, they having been 8
hours in contention about it. Then the Cardinals being weary went to
their ſeveral Cells to their dinner. Now to give Virtue her due praiſe,
we muſt not omit that <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> in that large field of favours
and diſ-favours ſhewed always ſuch a compoſition and moderation of
mind, and a ſpirit ſo undaunted, magnanimous, and generous, that
as he was not puſſ'd up with any good, ſo was he not dejected with
any adverſe fortune; accepting every thing as beſt for his Salvation.
And whereas he went before to the Chappel attended with a great
number of Cardinals to be worſhipped as Pope, now he returns unto
his Cell alone; and that too he found plundered by the ſervants of the
Conclave, who had left him not a bit of bread for his Dinner: Then
conſidering the ſtate that he was in before in the <hi>Paulina,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
he was now in in his naked Cell; it is reported that as being a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58865:15"/>
man he could not chooſe at one point of time both to admire and laugh
at the infallibility of Fortune: yet it did not eſcape him without ſome
tears. Every one ſtood amazed how it was poſſible that <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi>
who went in the morning into the <hi>Paulina,</hi> Pope, ſhould in a few
hours after return a ſingle Cardinal. The opinions amongſt them were
divers, as alſo the faults that were alledged; ſome did attribute it to
the errors that were made in the reckoning of the Votes, others to the
defect of Zeal or Induſtry of his ſupportors, in protracting the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and giving ear and time to the Excludents: For had they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
directly to the Adoration, all impediments had been removed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
by which means the Excludents had received no incouragement, nor
young <hi>Colonna</hi> deſerted: Others did impute it to the imperfection of
thoſe who failed to give their Votes, in the ſecret Scrutinium; others
to the too great confidence of thoſe who conſented that it ſhould be
made ſecret: But howſoever it were we cannot erre in ſaying it was
not the pleaſure of God, who ruleth and diſpoſeth all, and to whoſe
bleſſed will all humane diſcourſes ought to ſubmit in all humility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For all this</hi> Montalto, <hi>who of all the reſt was the moſt unſatisfied,
did not leave off his Robes, but rather with a greater fervour took the
practice again in hand, and with the advice of his Friends did Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate
his Faction into the</hi> Paulina; <hi>intreating them for the love of
God, for their own reputations ſake, and for the affection they did
bear unto him, that they would remain conſtant in unity of mind for
the Election of</hi> Santa Savarina <hi>to be Pope; becauſe by their conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
they would overcome the obſtinacy of their enemies: and going
about to examine every ones opinion, when it came unto</hi> La Rovere <hi>his
turn, he ſaid unto</hi> Montalto, That as he was, and perpetually would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
his true and obliged ſervant, ſo he conceived it to be his duty freely
to declare his opinion in this occurrence; the ſum of which was, That,
they having already done for <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> all what was poſſible to be
done, if he ſhould proceed any further on the behalf of that only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
it might very well be concluded from thence, that he eſteemed none
of his Creatures beſides to be worthy of the Papacy, there being amongſt
them many deſerving and worthy men: upon any of which Creatures of
his he was willing to afford his concurring Vote; but in caſe none of them
ſhould ſtand, that then he might be left at liberty, to diſpoſe his voice upon
any other to whom his Conſcience ſhould direct him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:58865:16"/>
               <hi>Madruzzo</hi> and <hi>Montalto</hi> being now more inflamed than ever to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Election of <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> did reſolve with all ſolidity
to uſe their endeavours for his advancement, hoping to overcome the
oppoſition, partly by the coming of the Cardinal of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who
was every hour expected; and partly by the confidence they had to
procure ſome of the Excludents to be on their party: as <hi>Montalto</hi> did
endeavour with all manner of ſubtilty with <hi>Paleotto,</hi> and <hi>Aſcoll,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
unto <hi>Paleotto</hi> the zeal of <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> and his goodneſs:
That he had taken him already to himſelf without any invitation from
him the ſaid <hi>Montalto;</hi> and that now his Lordſhip declining the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> either by his compliance with others, or
for his own advancement, he would thereby detract from his own
worth, and hazard the repute he had obtained in the eſtimation of
divers of the other Cardinals. And to <hi>Aſcoll</hi> he ſaid, that there was
nothing more deteſtable in a man, nor inconformable to a Chriſtian,
than ingratitude; intimating unto him the obſequious reſpect he ought
to bear to the ſacred memory of <hi>Sextus</hi> the fifth; and conſequently to
<hi>Montalto</hi> himſelf, who was the original occaſion of his being created
Cardinal. Theſe arguments although powerful, were (as is is reported)
by them refuted by many ſtrong arguments: and certainly it was very
miraculous to all men, that theſe two ſhould ſo ſtrongly oppoſe theſe
attempts of <hi>Montalto;</hi> but it was more to be admired, that in that
morning, in which the heavens did look ſo favourably on <hi>Santa Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi>
that for more than ſeven hours together he was Pope, if his own
party had taken notice thereof: that neither they, nor any of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludents
for any manner of reſpect did depart from what they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken.
After that came into the Conclave the Cardinal of <hi>Joyeux,</hi>
a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who preſently was aſſaulted and inticed both by one
and the other Faction; the Includents hoping to get the victory by his
Vote, and the Excludents the confirmation of their Excluſion: But
he reſolved to declare himſelf for neither ſide. And it is ſaid that it
was the advice of <hi>Altempos:</hi> upon which irreſolution the buſineſs was
left in the Conclave, upon the ſame terms as they were before.</p>
            <p>While the Includents were ſo earneſt about concluding the buſineſs
for <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> and did their uttermoſt endeavours on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
it was a wonderful thing to obſerve the indefatigable vigilance
and induſtry that <hi>Sforza, Sfondrato, Boromeo,</hi> and <hi>Aquaviva</hi> did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58865:16"/>
in oppoſition of them; having an eye not only on the power of
the adverſe party, and to all thoſe great attempts which they made,
but alſo to the danger they were in, and the great doubt they amongſt
themſelves had, that if any one of them ſhould be ſeduced either by
the rediouſneſs in their proceedings, or by hope, or by fear, they
ſhould then be all involved in one confuſion and ſhame: Therefore to
prevent all dangers, they did confirm amongſt themſelves their former
faithful Union, diſpoſing with admirable order and prudence, the
watches that every one of them was to obſerve both day and night:
and to take continual notice of all the Practices, Combinations, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Diſcourſes, and all Deſigns of every Cardinal and Conclaviſta. It
was a ſtrange thing to ſee how diligently they did attend the actions of
the Conclave all day and all night, alſo with Tapers in their hands;
extolling beyond moderation as well the Porters of the adverſe party,
as they did thoſe of their own: endeavouring to diſcover by them,
what Cardinals were to be there, and what ſtratagems they had in
hand; ſo great a danger requiring no leſs diligence. It is ſaid that
thoſe young Cardinals at that time tempting <hi>Platta,</hi> told him, My
Lord, it is ſaid that <hi>Madruzzo</hi> and <hi>Montalto</hi> are boaſting themſelves
to be ſecure of your Vote on their behalf; we cannot in truth give
credit unto it: and he wiſely anſwering, ſaid, It neither is, nor ever
ſhall be true; I am real, and my life ſhall fail before my word ſhall
be infringed; and the obligation in which I am bound to my Lord
<hi>Sfondrato:</hi> whereupon they with an open arm embraced him, and
kiſſed him. A little while after the Cardinal <hi>La Rovere</hi> dyed, a man in
truth of great qualities, and upon whom many had fixed their reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
But the Divine Providence was pleaſed to provide a better Crown
for him. <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> was preſent at his death, who as being the chief
Penitentiary, and as one that loved him as tenderly as his own Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
did perform all kind of pious Offices for him, in putting him
in mind of the welfare of his ſoul, and of his ſalvation; which
death as it was dear unto him, ſo was it a Memorandum to all the
other Cardinals to be prepared for death, eſpecially conſidering how
they were involved in an abundance of troubles and perturbations even
in the Conclave it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Excludents perceiving that the deſign of <hi>Santa Savarina</hi> was
ſtill on foot, and proſecuted with a great deal of ardency, were ſtill
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58865:17"/>
dubious, fearing every moment the coming of the Cardinal of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi>
and that at the end every thing ſhould fall out contrary to their
deſires or wiſhes: whereupon to acquit themſelves from that inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
they became daily ſolicitors to <hi>Montalto</hi> to alter his reſolutions;
deſiring him to pitch upon any other of his Creatures, and they
would unanimouſly ſerve him in the Election. On the other ſide they
attempted <hi>Madruzzo</hi> with perſwaſions for him likewiſe to decline
that buſineſs, ſeeing that this Enterpriſe was deſperate; and the more
cunningly to invite him, they did promiſe him their ſeveral Votes to
Elect him Pope: But he did exhort them to content themſelves with
<hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> being a ſubject of ſo much deſert and vertue, and
being deſired by ſo many Princes. And they anſwered him, that to
conſider any more of that, were to prolong the time, to waſte away
the Cardinals, and to ruinate the people and the City, who had ſpent
ſo much time in Expectation: therefore they did intreat him, that he
would conform himſelf with the Divine Will, and accept of the
Grace of God ſent unto him, as it was offered by them in a ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
and free will, to imploy all their endeavours for his Lordſhips
greater advancement. Whereupon <hi>Madruzzo</hi> being aſſaulted by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
rational inſtances, knowing that it was not fit to hold ſo long in
ſuſpenſion the Conclave, and all Chriſtendom, upon the only expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of <hi>Santa Savarina.</hi> And did acquaint <hi>Montalto</hi> and the reſt,
that if within 3 days they could not bring their practice to effect,
they would then conſider of ſome other ſubject. In that time every
one did their uttermoſt towards it, and the term being expired with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſeeing any effect produced in the behalf of <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi> but
rather that their party began to decline, thoſe that deſired to have <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druzzo</hi>
Pope, thinking to have a great advantage, conſidering that
the Excludents would afford them their Votes, and that they thought
to have alſo thoſe of <hi>Montalto,</hi> as well for the promiſe he made to the
Duke of <hi>Ceſſa,</hi> to concur to it at any time that the occaſion ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer:
as alſo for the good intention that they had found by diſcourſe
with his Creatures towards <hi>Madruzzo:</hi> That he was always in the
good opinion of <hi>Montalto,</hi> and that they would not fail to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Thereupon <hi>Spinola</hi> acquainted <hi>Montalto</hi> that then was the
time to advance <hi>Madruzzo,</hi> ſeeing that it only lay in him to make
him Pope: intimating unto him the goodneſs and affability of that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58865:17"/>
Lord; The promiſe that he had made and confirmed many times to
the Catholick Ambaſſadour to help him. The great confidence that in
all reaſon he ought to repoſe in that Lord, who by all expres;s;ions would
acknowledge, what favour he ſhould receive from him. <hi>Montalto</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
this motion unexpectedly, neither truſted nor miſtruſted <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola,</hi>
but cunningly gave him good words, and took time to anſwer,
that he might conſult with his Creatures, excuſing himſelf that he
could not alone compaſs ſo great an Enterprize; his Creatures upon
the motion being made, for the moſt part ſhewed themſelves averſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. And ſome of them, as <hi>Morozino, Giuſtiniano, Camerino, Monte,
Fiorenza</hi> and others did chearfully undertake his Excluſion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
going back a little while after to give his anſwer to <hi>Spinola, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talto</hi>
told him, that for his part he would be always ready to be an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant
to <hi>Madruzzo,</hi> but that he could not prevail with his Creatures
to condeſcend unto it, ſaying, that they would forſake their relation
to him. This anſwer and ſome other impediments did quite overthrow
<hi>Madruzzo</hi>'s hopes, who nevertheleſs was ſo wiſe and ſo phlegmatick,
that diſſembling his diſpleaſure he did appear to have been fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with <hi>Montalto,</hi> paſſing it outwardly very joyfully, and making
ſhew as if he did not aim at all at the Papacy; although many did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
him to break with <hi>Montalto,</hi> but he wiſely would not do it, firſt
to prevent any occaſion that the world might take to think him to be
ambitious of the Popedom. And ſecondly, ſeeing that this thing
might prove prejudicial to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his affairs, in giving oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to <hi>Montalto</hi> to make a Pope in thoſe troubleſome times that the
King could not confide in, and becauſe he would not in any caſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
from his Majeſties Inſtructions, which were ſtill to preſerve uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with <hi>Montalto:</hi> And that they ſhould not conſult of any ſubject
without the advice one of the other, and that they ſhould proceed
with all poſſible ſpeed to the Election of a Pope.</p>
            <p>After that they nominated <hi>Como</hi> and <hi>Paleotto,</hi> being both men
commended by the King, and both worthy and deſerving men; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they were both unfortunate, through the vain ſuſpicions of
the world; from whence it happened that their competition was but
of a ſmall continuance; ſome ſparkles of grudging that <hi>Montalto</hi> and
others had kindled againſt them in ſome former Conclaves for their
particular intereſts and fears were not yet quite extinct, but both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58865:18"/>
nevertheleſs great praiſe, becauſe they did voluntarily ſubmit
themſelves to the will of God. Many attempts were made after that
for the old <hi>Colonna,</hi> ſome believing that the thing might be happily
compaſſed, ſuppoſing that they had three firm and ſolid aſſiſtants: The
firſt was that of the Excludents, by reaſon of the obligement between
<hi>Colonna</hi> and them for their adherence. The ſecond was that of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druzzo</hi>
with the Votes of <hi>Spain, Colonna</hi> being one nominated by
that King. The third was that of <hi>Montalto,</hi> becauſe of the affinity
that was between the houſes of <hi>Colonna</hi> and <hi>Peretta;</hi> becauſe <hi>Colonna</hi>
was a man full of maturity of years, piety in condition, and ſolidity
in judgment: but when the time came that his aſſiſtants ſhould be
put to the teſt, he found that there was ſuch a profundity of conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amongſt them, that he conceived it better to retreat with honour,
than to charge on to deſtruction. <hi>Montalto</hi> did not ſhew himſelf any
way backward in it, but was rather zealous in good offices to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
it, complaining yet of ſome of his own Creatures and others
that would not adhere unto him: Therefore it is a general rule, that
whoſoever puts himſelf upon imaginary hopes, and not on real aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
moſt commonly deceiveth himſelf. It was furthermore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
both within and without the Conclave, that in theſe confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>Ruſticuccio</hi> might have been advanced unto it, being acceptable to
<hi>Montalto, Spain</hi> and other Princes, beloved of the ſacred Colledge, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
in the Affairs of the Papacy, and carrying with him an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency
of a ſhort life. But that diſcourſe held not long, their aims
being of more eminency.</p>
            <p>The Excludents ſeeing that <hi>Madruzzo</hi> could not proceed becauſe of
the Creatures of <hi>Montalto,</hi> of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the <hi>Tuſcanes,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
him, and that after <hi>Paleotto</hi> and <hi>Como</hi> were rejected by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talto,</hi>
and that <hi>Colonna</hi> with ſo many encouragements could not attain
it; and conſidering by the ſame reaſons that there was no room for
<hi>Salviati,</hi> nor for <hi>Verona,</hi> nor for <hi>Mondovi,</hi> they conclude that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
it muſt be given to one of <hi>Montalto</hi>'s Creatures: and whether
<hi>Madruzzo</hi> will or nor, he will be conſtrained to condeſcend unto it:
therefore being then deſirous to put an end to the Conclave, and to
free themſelves of the fear continually they were in of <hi>Santa Savarina,</hi>
they ſent word to <hi>Montalto</hi> that he would defer it no longer, but
would nominate one of his own Creatures, promiſing him faithfully
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58865:18"/>
all their Votes. Therefore <hi>Montalto</hi> now perceiving that he had the
Crown of glory in his hand, at which he had ſo long time aimed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was never known that his intention was to make <hi>Aldobran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dino</hi>
Pope, did accept with a great deal of alacrity both their advice
and aſſiſtance which they offered unto him; telling them openly, that
amongſt his Creatures <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> ſeemed the moſt competent man
for it, for his moſt worthy qualities, and for the eſtimation that the
ſacred Colledge held ever of him for his perſon and virtue. All of
them did unanimouſly congratulate that Election, and with great
promptitude imbrace it, ſaying, that they were content with it; and
gave order that with all induſtry the deſign ſhould be ſo managed, that
it might be carried without the oppoſition of any of the reſt of the
Cardinals. <hi>Montalto</hi> did communicate this Election of his with ſome
of his Creatures, who unanimouſly alſo did preſently agree with all
their poſſible endeavours to confirm it, which gave him the animation
thereunto: After that he ſpake to <hi>Madruzzo,</hi> telling him that ſeeing
there were ſo many diviſions in the Conclave concerning the ſubjects
that had been before Elected, it was in all probability the way to defer
the Election for a long time to the ruine of the people, the ſcandal of the
good, and the hazard of more Cardinals lives. And that therefore if
his Lordſhip would be pleaſed to concur upon one of his Creatures,
he hoped that there would be a ſhort period to ſo long a labour. And
having ſaid thus unto him, propounded <hi>Aldobrandino,</hi> a perſon juſt,
and fearing God; who although he were not of that number that
were nominated by his King, yet he would be his friend, and would
always be graciouſly protectant of his Majeſty, and of all his Eſtates,
knowing him to be the only defenſor and ſupportor of the Catholick
Religion: and that being conſcious of his integrity and ſincere incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the Kings Service, he himſelf would be his ſecurity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madruzzo</hi> was nothing troubled with this propoſition, but rather
ſeemed willingly to approve it; anſwering that being not able of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to give a final reſolution, he demanded ſome time to communicate
it with his friends, to underſtand their opinion in it: And then recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
himſelf, he began to conſider the circumſtances, alleadging for
it, or concluding againſt it: for his refuſal he had theſe Motives;
That it was derogatory to the honour of the King his Maſter, for him
to concur in the Election of one that was not nominated by him.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58865:19"/>
That it would conclude him very much to blame to give his Vote to
the Election of one to be Pope, who had not only not given any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of Fidelity to his Maſters Service, but might rather be
ſuſpected not to be in a condition of neutrality. Beſides that, he knew
not ſo diſtinctly what was the private reſolution of <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the world, towards the dependency of Princes, towards his
own kindred; whether he were not ambitious to raiſe them, how he
ſtood inclined: Beſides that, being conſcious of his former excluding
him, and depriving him of the Papacy in the Conclave of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi>
VII. when the greateſt part of the Cardinals did concur in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Aldobrandino,</hi> and when he was in his Chamber for two
hours ſpace ready to be adored as Pope. Contrariwiſe he had theſe
Motives to accept him, he did conſider that the intention of the King
was ſo holy, that although he nominated only ſome few, yet he did
not by that exclude any of the reſt that might be conceived fit for it:
but only theſe who for their intereſt, or their dependence, or for ſome
other lawful cauſe might be ſuſpected by him: and the Honour and
Service of God being the Honour and Service of the King; and that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobrandino</hi>
had indeed never been oppoſite, but rather aſſiſtant to the
Kings deſigns, as he ſhewed manifeſtly in <hi>Polonia,</hi> when he went Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
thither; procuring with all his endeavours the liberty of Duke
<hi>Maximilian.</hi> He conſidered further, that by the relation of very faithful
men as far as he could penetrate, his diſpoſition was altogether affable
and meek; neither proud, nor very much addicted to
ſtudy, devotion, and good works, that he had never in publick or in
private preferred <hi>France</hi> before <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> before <hi>France:</hi> but as
an Eccleſiaſtick man, and a true Column of the Holy Church, had
ever cheriſhed the publick good of Chriſtendom in general, the
publick peace and quietneſs, a King in <hi>France,</hi> moſt Chriſtian in effect
as in Title, the extirpation of Hereticks and all Rebels againſt the
Catholick Religion, the exaltation of the Holy Sea, his Dignity and
Authority, having never been intereſſed or ſubjected to any Prince or
Cardinal: his Converſation having been always with ſpiritual, grave,
and learned men, having baniſhed from his company all men that were
deceitful, factious, adulators, murmurators, and the whole croud of
vain and ignorant perſons, having always in peace and gravity govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his own houſe, having neither admitted in his Family any ſeditious
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58865:19"/>
humour or quarrelling that were blemiſhed in reputation, nor having
ever permitted any of his Servants to domineer in his houſe, but kept
them always attentive to the glory of God, and the ſervice of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
as if his Family had been a Monaſtery; beſides that, although he
was known to have two Nephews, one from his Brother, the other from
his Siſter; nevertheleſs they were bred to ſo much humility and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that both within the City and abroad they were held as an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto him. It did pleaſe <hi>Madruzzo</hi> alſo, that <hi>Ald<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>brandino</hi> had
never ſhewed any hatred or ſpleen againſt any of them that had exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him before, but rather all reſpect and favour. From all which
motives <hi>Madruzzo</hi> drew this concluſion, that from ſo good a tree, bad
fruit could not proceed; and that he that can well govern his own houſe,
is fit to bear rule in the Church of God. Beſides all theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Madruzzo</hi> began to be weary, having ſeen all the hopes or means
that could be made either for himſelf or thoſe that were nominated by
the King to be deluded. He ſaw that to prolong the Conclave any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
was to irritate and break off with <hi>Montalto,</hi> and to fall from
one evil to a worſe. He ſaw that amongſt the Creatures of <hi>Montalto</hi>
none was like to prove ſo well as this. He ſaw that in ſatisfying <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talto</hi>
in this particular, he obliged him much unto himſelf. He ſaw
that proceeding in the Election of <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> chearfully and with
alacrity, would prove a duplicite ingagement upon him. He ſaw that
the King would approve of ſo good and zealous a Paſtor. Finally,
knowing that this Election was given miraculouſly from God, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to give his conſent to it: And having imparted the ſame unto
his friend <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>he found them as chearful and alacreous as he could wiſh.
Beſides that <hi>Aleſſandrino</hi> and <hi>Razivil</hi> a <hi>Polonian,</hi> did concur to it
with a wonderful chearfulneſs; the firſt in conſideration that <hi>Aldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandino</hi>
was the Author of his preferment; the other by reaſon of
that League of Amity wherein he was linked with <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> at
the time of his being Legate in <hi>Polonia.</hi> This proceeding did continue
ſome two days, by reaſon there were ſome of opinion that it would
not be attained, he being none of thoſe that had been nominated by
the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> and partly as others ſaid, becauſe <hi>Madruzzo</hi> would
firſt give an account thereof to the Duke of <hi>Ceſſa</hi> to have his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who though it was believed that he was of himſelf prompt
enough therein, yet it was thought that Father <hi>Toledo</hi> was a principal
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58865:20"/>
Inſtrument about him to adviſe him to it; aſſuring him that <hi>Aldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandino</hi>
would prove a very good Pope, and a true Friend to the King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the defence and increaſe of the Catholick Religion. And
it was ſaid alſo that although <hi>Montalto</hi> with his Votes, the Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and a part of the <hi>Gregorians</hi> could procure him
the Papacy without the aſſiſtance of <hi>Madruzzo;</hi> yet out of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the King he would not do it without the conſent of the Duke
of <hi>Ceſſa.</hi> It was indeed a thing remarkable, that amongſt ſo many
evident appearances of his preferment, <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> did nevertheleſs
as much as in him lay, exclude himſelf, the heavens being at that time
propitious to that ſanctified advance, upon the 30. of <hi>January</hi> 1592.
about one of the Clock <hi>Montalto</hi> did publiſh in the Conclave <hi>Aldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandino</hi>
to be Pope; whereupon <hi>Madruzzo,</hi> the Excludents,
<hi>Montalto</hi> his Friends, and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> went unanimouſly to his
Cell, to advertiſe and congratulate his Holy Election, who neither in
face, word, nor geſture gave the leaſt ſymptome of alteration, which
was an evident teſtimony of his moderation, and that he had no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
aim at the Papacy. Now we may obſerve for a further Example
of aſtoniſhment, that it was rather a ſtupefaction than a rejoycement
that he had impoſed on him the ſupremeſt honour with the greateſt
burthen in Chriſtendom, which was apparent after his Election; for
the Maſters of the Ceremonies going to demand by what appellation
he would be intituled, and (according to cuſtom) to know if he had

was not at all attentive to the Maſters of the Ceremony; whereupon
the Cardinals that were neareſt unto him anſwered, <hi>I, I, he is willing
to accept of it.</hi> And the Maſters of the Ceremony replying that it
was not judicially ſatisfactory, unleſs proceeding from his Holineſs own
mouth. Then his Holineſs deploring with exceſs of humility ſaid thus,
<hi>Thou O Lord God, who ſeeſt the hearts of all men, and to whom all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
are revealed, if the Election that hath been made of me thy moſt
unworthy Vicar, be not to thy Glory and Service, and the ſalvation of
all the faithful: I beſeech thee that my tongue</hi> adhaereat faucibus meis.
<hi>If alſo thou ſeeſt that it is advantageous to thy Holy Name, and to thy
Holy Church, I upon the confidence of thy aſſiſtance expoſe my ſelf to
thy bleſſed will.</hi> His Holineſs having in that manner given his conſent,

he was arrayed in his Pontificalibus; and being ſat upon the ſeat, was
adored by all the Cardinals with a general acclamation. Afterwards,
the Ceremonies being ended, he was demanded, What appellation he
would aſſume? <hi>Clement,</hi> he anſwered. Then was he carried to St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and was met in the Portal by the Canons and Prelates ſaluting
him with theſe Holy words, <hi>Ecce Sacerdos Magnus,</hi> the <hi>Te Deum
Laudamus</hi> following him. As ſoon as he came into the Church, he
performed his Orizons at the Altar of the moſt Holy Sacrament: and
afterwards his Holineſs was carried <hi>ad limina Apoſtolorum;</hi> where
having made his Orizons, he was again ſet upon his ſeat, and adored
by the Cardinals. In the interim, his Election was divulged all over
<hi>Rome,</hi> whereupon every one came to ſee him, bleſſing and praiſing
God for ſo Holy a Paſtor, who being replete with Charity and Alacrity,
gave them a general Benediction: and by his Countenance aſſuring
them, that he would afford them Juſtice, and procure Plenty unto
their Bodies, and Salvation unto their Souls. His Holineſs being at
laſt conducted to the Vatican, confeſſed himſelf to Father <hi>Gio Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordine
della Valicella</hi> his Confeſſor, and then ſaid Maſs, (as he uſually
did) with great Devotion. It is not to be omitted to declare the
words his Holineſs ſpake unto his Confeſſor, which were, <hi>That he
deſired him to pray unto God, that if ſuch fruits ſhould not proceed from
his Papacy as might be advantageable to his Holy Church, that he would
be pleaſed the ſooner to deprive him of his life:</hi> demonſtrating openly,
<hi>That his deſire and aim was not to rule, but to ſerve his God, and to feed
his Flock.</hi> This Conclave then which was begun with ſo many divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
wills, contentions, fury and ſtrife, that it was feared it would
have proved a Schiſm, was at laſt, by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt,
concluded and terminated into a moſt holy Peace, and Union; of
which always the praiſe, honour, and glory be aſcribed to the Divine
Majeſty, the giver of all good things.</p>
