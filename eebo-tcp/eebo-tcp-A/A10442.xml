         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which neuer can be honestlie maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;

to take the present tyme of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
euen as there hath ben tyme of

<pb facs="tcp:3078:3"/>
by reasonable and faithfull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:
to proue that M. Iuell may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
by a meane scholar in diuinitie,
that he neede not to prouoke the best
of the Catholykes, which at this daye
are anywhere lyuinge: to shewe that
all thowgh, we be kept downe and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
yet we perish not for all that,
nor be vtterlie confounded: I send that
furth now, after fower yeres, which so
long before was made by me, and I
make that now commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to frindes and
to foes, which at the first I prepared
for one frind alone, to auoyde feare of
foes. He that lyketh this, let hym tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
God, and helpe me with his praiers.
He that findeth fault, lett hym shame
the dyuele, and tell me of it hardelie.
If any iust one shall be founde, (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
of me and others) I trowe, it will
be omission in leauing of some thinges
vnanswered. Yet doe I answer euerie
<pb facs="tcp:3078:3"/>
matter, concerninge the whole some of
it, marie I was not so diligent, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
euerie witnesse. And whether
I am bound so to doe, I am not yet ful
perswaded, but euer I thowght, that
it was free, to wryte and fight, after
my fasshion. Especiallie where the
number ys great, and euerie one readie
with his weapon, so that the enemie
be beaten downe, the captaine aloweth
their labors. Yet all they dyd not stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
one waye, but as they should see
their aduantage, so would they vse or
downe right blowes, or foynes, or some
other inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions. Some writers of these
our dayes, men of great contynuance
and studie, doe late full lode owt of
scriptures and councells, iust vpon the
pates, and backes of owr common ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,

folowe a sensible fasshion, of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
<pb facs="tcp:3078:4"/>
withowt boke, against them.
Againe, some will persequute, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
so narowlie: that sentence by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
thei examyn his trueth and fide<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litie.
but some againe, doe so thinke
vpon the cheife poynt of the question:
that, for hast sake, thei let much esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,
which perchaunse, was well worth
the noting. Lett one example stand
for all. M. Iuell here in his sermon, to
proue that the people dyd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate
and receiue togeather with the preist,
all the first six hundred yeres after
Christ: beginneth with owr Saluyor,
and cummeth to the blessed Apostle,
goinge downe by S. Clement, Denyse,
Iustine, and other fathers, vntill he
stayeth at S. Gregorie, whom yet he
rekoneth for a wittnesse. But to what
purpose and conclusion? to proue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soth,
that sole receiuinge, ys not to be
suffered, emong Christians, bycawse he
<pb facs="tcp:3078:4"/>
findeth, by so manie testimonies, that,
of old tyme, there were made commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
VVell then, goe ye to, if this
be all the matter, it ys not hard or cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berouse,
to geue M. Iuell an answer.
Yet trulie, he shall not be answered, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
one manner by all men, but lyke as
leisure, zeale, and lerninge, abundeth
or lacketh in any one, for the purpose:
so, more or lesse, will be browght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
hym, and he that saieth lest of
all, will yet be good inough for hym.
For the lest is this,<note place="margin">The first maner of answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe.</note> to grawnt his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,
and onlie to denie his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

be vsed in a thowsand chappells, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandinge

which was then, or may be now; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narilie

might be charged to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
when the people on other daies are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

wise occupied, the preist, might
right well doe his office, if none but
the parishe clerke, were present to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
hym.<note place="margin">A second manner.</note> But some other Catholike, is
not fullie satisfyed, by ending this mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter,
so quicklie, and therefore he goeth
further, in tryinge M. Iuells places,
which serue yet vnto no purpose, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
thei were truelie alleaged.
And he obiecteth agaynst Iuell (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
to call hym Maister) that the
Apostle vnto the Corinthians, meaneth
not literallie, so, as Iuell taketh hym.

harken to old customes? and the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Councell of Nice, which
was but of men, shall that be our touche
stone? O Sir, when you haue caused all
Sacramentes, in a manner, and all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
thinges to be taken away: when,
of so many externall signes and tokens,
which represented the misteries of our
saluation, so few are left: when yow haue
taken away the very orders of them,
<pb facs="tcp:3078:10"/>
which liued after the perfectest way of
Christ hys religion, do yow now speake
of old customes? This doth so well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com
you to speake, as a Saduce to proue
the resurrection. as an Arrian to be ruled
by tradition. as a woman to weare a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.
Yow would laugh or wondre at a
catholike, or (as you terme him) a papist,
if he should sett furth his work with this
title, that nothing is to be beleued,
which is not expressely in Scripture: and
shall Protestantes escape the like iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when they speake sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, for old
customes and vsages? But what meane
yow by this sentence: <hi>Let old customes
preuail?</hi> what is that, which is against
them, that the victory neadeth to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to them, by the arbitrement of the
noble Councell of Nice? except ther be
some battell, ther can be no victory. ther
is no preuailing, where there is no resis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
and there must, at the lest, be two
partes, when one singularly is preferred.
I remembre well,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>M.</hi> Iuel mis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taketh the wordes of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of Nice.</note> that these wordes: <hi>Let
old customes preuaile,</hi> are in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the sixt Canon of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3078:10"/>
Nice, where it is writen, as concerning
the iurisdiction of the Bishopp of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria
and Antioch, that the old cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
which euer before was vsed, should
continu. But in that sense, it can not
serue for a sentence, to be placed before
M. Iuell his Sermon, that, bicause the old
custome shall stand, which hath ben ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
about the Bishopprickes of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria
and Antioch, therfore absolutely
old customes should preuail. Wherfore
vnderstanding by these wordes, <hi>Let old
customes preuail,</hi> such a generall sense, as
M. Iuell would pretend, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Nice might vse those wordes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally:
I aske then now, what is this,
which the Councell speaketh of, <hi>Let old
customes preuaile?</hi> what might the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
be, of that sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? did it meane, that
old customes must be preferred before
new? this is not alwaies trew. Wheras
the circumstances of time, person, age,
and such like, may cause the old custome
not to be refused absolutely as nawght,
but to yeld for iust causes vnto the new.
Example wherof we haue, in washing of
<pb facs="tcp:3078:11"/>
feete,<note place="margin">Io. 13. Act. 15.</note> and abstaining from the eating of
bloud, which was a custome of old, but
in these daies, the newer, and diuers from
that, is preferred and folowed. VVell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> did the Councell meane that olde custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
must ouercome new bokes and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges?
Surely then M. Iuell, from Luther
hitherto, at one foyne, vnaduisedlie, you
haue pricked so many authors of new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,

But yf none of these senses please
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> you, did the Councell signifye, that olde
customes must preuaile, against the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensed
alleaging of the very Scripture it

            <p>Arrius was a proud new fangled man,
a disobedient person vnto his Bishopp,
which made much of him at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
before he toke harte of singularite
vpon him, and promoted him to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
rome of a priest in Alexandria.
Wel may I vse the worde, honorable,
for at those dayes, priesthood was so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
among all Christians. Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der then
which was Bishopp of Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dria a very

his priest Arrius to busie him selfe with
new inuentions, first gently and fatherly,
he warned him: and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Arrius proude
harte and gloriouse, would be nothing
the better for sweete wordes and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions:
the wise and blessed Bishopp ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
a Synode of his clergie iustly did
excommunicate, that singular and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
heretik. But for all the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
of the heretik, both he and
his heresy had a great sort of euill par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
with them: so far forth, that it was
necessary, to call a generall Councell, to
<pb facs="tcp:3078:12"/>
the determining of the Catholike faith,
and condemning of new found learning.
In which Councell the holy fathers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the new termes of Arrius, did prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipally
alleage, the traditions of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and customes, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners, and lawes
of the holy writers before their daies.</p>
            <p>And although they had Scriptures for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
against Arrius, yet the chefest stay of
their cause, was grounded vpon the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
receaued faith. For herein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the vnrulines of Arrius, that expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to his owne fancy, he would not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
by the interpretation of old fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and submit his faith vnto their iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes.
Which yf he would haue done,

the inuentors of new decrees, and as to which

great madnes, furor of vaine glory, wisedom
of the deuill, which mightely hath inuaded their

not be perswaded at all. If by Scriptures

killeth the heretikes hartes (and therfore
they will not be iudged but by expresse

defendeth the Catholike Christians, and
therfore gladly doe they folow the waies

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>And why so? <hi>which worde</hi> (saieth he) <hi>is
not writen in all the Scripture.</hi> Loe here is
his greatest reason, and such in deed as
becometh heretikes most of all. Let vs
goe yet forward, and seke whether any

where shall you more plainly find this
matter, then where the very pack of
them is gathered together. In a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession
of a faith, which was made at Sirmium,
Consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius him selfe being present, with
to many Arrian Bishoppes, after other
<pb facs="tcp:3078:15"/>
thinges, this decree foloweth.</p>
            <p>As for the worde (substance:) bicause,<note place="margin">Trip. hist. lib. 5. c. 20</note> being
simply put furth by the fathers, it is not knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the common people, and it maketh a scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
and offence: and bicause, neither the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
haue this worde in them: it pleaseth vs, it
should be abrogated, and hereafter no mention

the Scriptures diuine, do in no place make men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the father and the sonne.
<hi>You may see what great price they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of this argument</hi> (it is no Scripture, ergo
no matter of faith.) <hi>bicause that in so few
lines, they doe twise repete the selfe same
reason. Which vndoutedly was then, and
is now, the very principall (but not most
surest) stay, of all vnconstant mindes. As
in the same boke againe, see what a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

VVe (say they) which are gathered together in

which was the fifth before the Kal. of Octobre,
geuen all diligence, according to the Emperor

purpose, that it is propre to the hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
to appeale to the scriptures onely,
bicause they are quickly condemned by
tradition, custome, and manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude therfor this place, Arrius
being so proud, as we haue said, hauing
many textes of Scripture for him: as he
vnderstood them which toke him selfe
to be best learned, the Councell of Nice
defining the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>substantiality of God the
Sonne with the Father: bicause they had
so receaued it from the Apostells by their
successors, the same Councell being all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
reproued of heretikes, for that it
defined that matter as an article of faith,
which was not in Scripture: I aske now,
what it is like that the Councell did me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane,
when it should say, <hi>Let old customes

otherwise, (if the wordes be

this being proued, to be the very mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that worthy sentence, what hath

there, to be laughed at, or to be folowed

If to be folowed: why are the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes

doe we all this while, contend with the

which is of common places, hath the
question of Scripture and traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moued
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3078:17"/>
therin, which nedeth no more to be any
question, you being so well acquainted
(M. Iuell) with the Protestantes, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
so great credit among them, as they
lightly can geue to such a person. For at
one worde you shall end the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
perswading them, that old customes
and fashions must preuaile, which in my
minde I thinke to be impossible, (but
nothing is hard perchaunce, to you,) for
this is clere euen in sight, the last and
third communion is preferred before the
second, the second better estemed then
the first, and if a new one come furth,
you shall (I warrant you) see it plainly
proued, that, quite against your will, and
against the Councell of Nice, the old fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions
shall not be preferred. And this
much hitherto I haue saied, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning
old customes, supposing and graunting,
that the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of Nice might vse that

one especiall matter, about the

But we shall meet again with M.
Iuell, vpon this point, before the end, I

If you take the paines leisurly to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

here in the wordes which I haue reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
maketh mention of an ordre geuen
by God, and of ordre broken, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
of the same by retorn to the first

this, the ordre geuen by God? I beleue
verely, that what soeuer S. Paule appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the same did come from God, as the

<pb facs="tcp:3078:19"/>
owne handes, without further question,
to sett and remoue, plant and pull vp, as
they shal see it profitable for the present
state of the churche. Wherfore although
the blessed Apostle did neuer make such
ordres vpon his own head, as did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

(properly to speak) an ordre geuen by

With which singularitie of the riche men
S. Paule was iustly offended, and saied,
<hi>VVhen you com together in one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> 
               <hi>this is not
it, to eate our Lord his supper. For euery
one of you doth take his owne supper before,
and eate.</hi> In which wordes, <hi>our Lord his
supper,</hi> is vnderstood (as Theophilactus
writeth) that meeting and eating toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theirs, which was instituted and
receaued, as in folowing of that reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
and worshipfull supper of our Lord
in deed. Here vpon now, S. Paule study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the redresse of this ordre, among
other argumentes (by which he would
persuade them quietly, and without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
or murmur to sitt together as they
were wont to doe) he bringeth in for
one principall argument, the doinges
of our Sauior in his last supper, saying,
<hi>I haue receaued of our Lord, that which I
haue deliuered vnto you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> and so forth.</p>
            <p>As if he should haue saied more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
my frindes, you doe vse in your mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges
together, to kepe separate tables
and to put away the poore from you,
throwgh a certaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt, perchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3078:20"/>
or disdaine of them. Which you are
much to blame to doe. For seing our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior
in his last supper geuing his owne
body to be eaten, did not make partes
thereof, and vnequall diuision, that som
should haue al, and other should goe wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout:
and wheras you also do receaue;
at these present suppers of your owne
that very body of his: it is to absurd that
towardes your neighbours, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
you should vse this straingenes, as
though they were not worthy to eate of
your bocherly fleshly meate with you,
or com nigh vnto your tables: which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

made partakers with you of the body of
our Sauior, and of the heauenly table.</p>
            <p>Thus then you may see, how the wordes
of S. Paule depend orderly one vpon an
other, and what the ordre was with the
breakinge of whiche he was offended.
And wher vpon then doe these wordes
of M. Iuell folow <hi>I haue receaued of the
Lord? &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11</note> But let vs now yet debate
this matter more plentifully. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre

Well this ordre is broken. But why
did you break it, o ye Corinthians? why
did ye lett either enuie, disdaine, pride,
glotome, or any other vncleane thought,
so to entre into your hartes, and so to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke

maintenaunce of charitie, your tables in

discomforting of the simple and poore,

the reforming of a custome which
is broken, and I aske you, how you will
amend this separate manner of eating
and drinking, which the Corinthians doe
vse in the churche? I know that Christ
did take bread, did breake it, did geue it.
But answer me, how the good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were wont to meet together, and
how they did vse to sitt and eate, wheras
the Apostle doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind fault with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians
for their disordre of eating in
the churche: not eating onely of our
Lord his body, (which if they did mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
then the wordes which you allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
of the institution of Christ, would
serue well for that purpose) but eating of
their owne supper, which they brought
to churche with them. When you spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3078:22"/>
of reducing thinges to their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
and when it is clere, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians
in their meetinges together,
did not kepe the old custome and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
I looked to heare of you, not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of Christ, what that was, but
the old fasshions which the Corinthians
should kepe, as for those wordes of the
institution of Christ, which S. Paule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herseth,
they are writen of him, not, as
the originall patern of the reforming the
Corinthians disordre: but in way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
(as Theophilactus saieth) to
proue his principall purpose, that bicause
Christ, did not spare to geue his owne
body vnto his disciples and folowers: ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
the riche Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s should not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
to admitt the poorer sort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
their brethern vnto their table. for
therin was the blessed Apostle occuped, to
correct the stoutnes <hi>&amp;</hi> singularitie which
the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vsed then, otherwise then
it was receaued emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
S. Paule being mindful of his inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>&amp;</hi>
principal matter, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with these wordes: <hi>therfor my brothers</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3078:23"/>
(saith he) <hi>when ye com together to eate:
tary and looke one for another. If any one
be hungry: let him eate at home.</hi> Shortly
therfore to conclude this matter, truth
it is, that when any disordre is com into
the churche: the first ordre, from which
the fall was made, should be reduced. The
disordre amonge the Corinthians, was,
that they did not charitably co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate
together in their suppers. let this be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.
the Apostle doth it properly,

the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s from their disordre vnto
the first originall <hi>&amp;</hi> institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ,

And then, Geneua being destroied, and

Bicause they wil trust none but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

the ordinance of Christ, the mystery of our

From this place forward, many leafes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

               </gap>ardie but in one,
he must be gilty in all, bicause he allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
all with like faith and integritie,
and willeth him selfe to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he is,
if he be found ouercom, but in one thing
onely. First then, as concerning those,
which did baptise the dead, they ar well
reproued in the third Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
the sixt canon. But here by the way,
I note one great vnreasonablenes in tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
men, which at their pleasure, to serue
their turne, doe alleage Councells, and
will not yet obey the canons of the same
Councells. The 17. canon of this very
Councell of Carthage, forbeddeth that
no strange women, (that is to say) none,
but either mother, grandmother. Aunt by
the father or mothers side, sisters, and
brothers or sisters doughters, either such
as wer of household, before they toke or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres,
but besides these, none should dwell
together with the cleargie. And now,
priestes doe take not onely strangers to
their household serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, but also to their
chambre and bed felowes. The .27. Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3078:45"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth water and wine both to be
vsed in the sacrifice. The .36. forbeddeth
vtterly, that any priest shold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrat holy
oyle, for that was reserued to the Bishop
only, with whose leaue the priest might
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrat virgins. But in these quarters of
the world, nother water in sacrifice, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
oyle, nother virginitie with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
therof, is alowed of the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes.
Reason truly it is, to take a mans whole
tale, and not to mangle an auncient Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cell.
Which Councel, if they do not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditt,
why then doe they bring the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of that Councell for profe of their
purpose, against which, they bere false
witnesse that it is not to be folowed?</p>
            <p>But to let this matter to passe: A great
abuse is attributed vnto Tertullian, and
Sainct Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his tyme, a thousand foure
hundred yeres agoe, that the Christians
toke the Sacrament home with them.</p>
            <p>This was (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aieth M. Iuell) an abuse, and
therfore it was broken. But who did break
it tell vs? It was broken saieth he. and
how doe ye proue this to be an abuse? it
was an abuse saieth he. And I say, it was
<pb facs="tcp:3078:46"/>
not. and why not my nay, as good in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
as your yea. For although the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation
of some person hath made you
a Bishopp, And, by order of the church,
I am a simple priest: yet as good the leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of a larke, as the body of a kyte. If we
goe to craking (in dede it is not good,
but this yet they would constraine many
to do) I wil yeld nomore vnto his aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
then reason will require. Yet I may
iustly crake, not in my selfe, but vnder the
churches auctoritie, and in the name of
S. Cyprian and Tertullian. Was that, say
you an abuse, to carye the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
at those dayes, and receaue it before
other meates? I vnderstand what gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
you in this example, of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
churche. For it proueth plainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you, that euen in so nigh daies
vnto Christ, ther was no necessitie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
the Sacrament vnder both kindes.
And wheras the persequutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and hatred
of Christians, was then so great, that they
could not frely meete together in any
common and open place, and so quietly
serue God, and receaue his benefices, as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3078:46"/>
they desired: can ye blame them, yf the
clergie were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent, to let the Christians
cary home with them, that present com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of their soule, (which is the body of
Ihesus Christ) to haue it alwaies in redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and to strengthen their weaknes
therwithall, if sodenly they were called

writing of a certain fact of a woman,

church. But it is to be noted, that this
Marcus went about to winne vnto him
selfe an estimation aboue all other prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,
which could not but folow, when
that at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrating, the people should
see the wyne turned as it were in to bloud,
and that the like did not appeare, when
other Priestes did consecrat. And note,
that except the faith of the church in tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
dayes, had ben, that the very bloud of
Christ, was in the mysteries of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
he could neuer haue made any to
reuerence hym the more, for that practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
but rather to haue brought him, before
the officers of the church, and examined
him, saying: We doe beleue, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
Christ onely by faith, which faith
goeth vp to heauen, and eateth him as he
sitteth at the right hand of his father: but
this man sheweth vs, very plaine bloud in
the chalice, which is against our belefe.
And wheras this Necromanser, did tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
his craft to the pleasing of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3078:47"/>
and so made bloud to appeare in the
chalice: it foloweth, that the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the church, did reioyce in the
bloud of Christ, which thei beleued to
be in the mysteries, and so he craftely
serued their faith an deuotion, that he
might winne their praise and fauor, and
that he might be pointed vnto, with, loe,
there goeth a good priest, and a blessed
man. But will yow heare more abuses?
<hi>Som take the Sacrament for a purgation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iuell.</note> 
               <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
slaunder: som hang it before their
brestes for a protection. S. Benet</hi> (sayeth
he) <hi>ministred the communion vnto a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that was dead.</hi> Ergo what doth fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low?
Ergo the sacrament may be abused.
I graunt it may be, as when wicked and
false coniures doe make it a meane to
binde the diuell, or when heretikes or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidells
tread it vnder foote, or cast it in
the fire, or pricke it with kniues to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue,
whether God his worde be trew, that
this is his body, which was deliuered for
vs. But none of your premisses almost
doth inferre rightly that conclusion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3078:48"/>
For wherby shew you, that S. Benet did
abuse the Sacrament in ministring it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a woman that was dead? All your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is this, Christ did not appoint,
that the Sacrament shold be hanged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ones necke, or put in chest, or gea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to dead women: ergo these be great
abuses. Is this in deed good reason? that
what soeuer Christ hath not expressely
willed,<note place="margin">A n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of authoritie negatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</note> that may not be vsed? Sir, Christ
did not bid vs, that if ther were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
three at the least, which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue,
ther should be therfore no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
that daye. Christ did not bid vs
knele downe, and say, Lorde we doe not
presume to com to this thy table trusting
in our owne merites, Christ did not bid
vs, when one chalice is supped vp, to fill
it again out of the whole potle or quart
potte. Christ did not bid vs, cary home
with vs the pieces of bread, or cantells
therof, and doe what we would with it.
Ergo these be great abuses in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
boke. no Sir no, the truth must be
tryed by other argumentes, then these
rhetoricall repetitions and negatiues of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3078:48"/>
Christ did not appoint this, ergo it is an
abuse. especially, whereas to many doe
thinke, that Christ will be content with
no other thinges, but such onely as are
writen: as though the holy ghost, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of truth, were idle in the church all
this while. how dare you to iudge of S.
Benet his fact, the like vnto which, S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
doth alleage for a miracle, and for
a notable matter. S. Austen so wise and
blessed a man, wheras he disputeth in his
boke <hi>De Ciuitate Dei,</hi> of deathes which
som haue vsed towardes them selues, and
wheras he well remembred, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of God was,<note place="margin">Exod. xx.</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt not kill, &amp;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
remembred that the church doth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
for martyrs certain, which did runne
into the waters, and to kepe their virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
lost their liues, in this so doubtfull
a case, wherin the church seamed to stand
against God, and the precept of God, to
be contraried by the holye daye of the
church, he dared not rashely to conclud,
but stoode herein, that the precept of
God must haue his force, and with what
conscience and prayse, those virgins
<pb facs="tcp:3078:49"/>
drowned them selues, that must be left
vnto the working of God the holy ghost,
and not curiously serched of men. for
what if they did so (sayeth he) not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued

               </gap>rring therin,
but obeying? As of Sampson, it is not
lawfull for vs, to thinke any other thing.
And we therfore (sayeth he afterwardes)
come to the conscience by hearing, but
of secret thinges, we take not vpon vs
the Iudgement.<note place="margin">The doin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the church and of good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtlie to be iudged.</note> Thus, Sir, it did becom
you to doe, for asmuch as you confesse
Sainct Benet for a Sainct, and wheras by
many miracles, that hath ben well kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
vnto the church, not hastely to iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
of the spirite of God, with whom you
are not so well acquainted, as Sainct Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
was, but humbly and reuerently, to
heare the miracles of God in his sainctes,
and to confesse that M. Iuell doth not
know all thinges. Wher you haue it, that
Sainct Benet did geue the communion,
vnto a dead woman, I know not verely,
but Sainct Gregorye reporteth a lyke
thing of hym.<note place="margin">2. lib. Dial. cap. 24.</note> that a ladd of Sainct Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3078:49"/>
his monasterye, departing vnto his
parentes without the blessing of Sainct
Benet, and before his returne departing
also the world, after he was committed
to the earth, the next day he was cast
vp again. Wher vpon Sainct Benet, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
mone made vnto him) sent the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and willed it to be putt vpon
the brest of the lad. After which do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e,
ther was no more troble. which thing
being so sadly writen by Sainct Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
we may not well lawgh at it, and the
same finding no fault with the matter,
lett not vs murmur against the workes
and inspirations of God. In deed, it is
not for euery man so to doe, but when
so singular vertuous men, are moued
therunto, and when a great effect doth
folow, we must iudge, that God was the
author therof, and that the partie did it
not vpon his owne opinion and boldnes.
The which answer serueth also,<note place="margin">In oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne funebri de obitu fratris sui Satyri.</note> that we
be not to bold in condemning any one
his deuotion and faith, which vseth the
sacrament for his defence in any kind of
cause. For S. Ambrose praiseth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:3078:50"/>
Satyrus, which minding to goe ouer
the seas, did take of the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which
were in the shippe with him, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and hanged it about his necke.</p>
            <p>wherevpon afterwardes, when a tempest
did rise, and breake the shippe, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him self, to the defence of Christ
in hys Sacrament, and so miraculouslye
escaped drowning. And lyke as Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
takyng comfort and strength of the
presence of Christ,<note place="margin">Matth. 14.</note> sayed, <hi>Lord if thou be
he, bid me com vnto the, vpon the waters,</hi>
and did walke vpon them, as vpon firme
land: so the Catholikes, which certainly
beleue, that this is he him selfe, whome
they see couered vnder forme of bread,
(although he be alwayes present) yet
they are more out of feare, when they
haue him within their handes, and reach.
And throwgh the grace which cometh
from him, they walke securely and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably.
As contrarie wyse vnto other,
which doubte of Christ his wordes, and
make such a sence of them, as they be
able without difficultie to attaine vnto,
saying that he is present by a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3078:50"/>
thowght of ours, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
onely: I wondre not, if it seme
foly vnto such, to make any store of the
Sacrament, or to reserue it for a stay of
their wauering fayth in ieoperdies. For
what is bread but bread, and what can it
doe more then comfort the body? But
now againe, bycause in S. Benet his time,
more besides him (as M. Iuell collecteth)
did geue the Sacrament euen vnto dead
persons: ergo they certainly did confesse
a more liuely, reall, mighty, and blessed
thing therin to be, then our protestantes
will admitt. So that putting a side the
question, whether they did well therin or
no? yet this appeareth, that they toke
the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be as Christ hath saied,
his verye owne body, and that faith was
in the church within the fiue or six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeres after Christ, which M. Iuell
receaueth for incorrupt.<q> 
                  <hi>But alas, what if
they,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iuell.</note> 
                  <hi>which most of all defend the masse,
them selues, find fault with the masse? as
Albertus Pigghius by name, the greatest
piller of that parte.</hi>
               </q> First I answer, that the
church doth not take him for the greatest
<pb facs="tcp:3078:51"/>
piller (in so much that in three or fowre
poyntes she noteth hym to haue had his
errors) <hi>&amp;</hi> a Catholike faith is not bownd
vnto any priuate mans opinion. But you
be accustomed to this kinde. Then I say
further, that it appeareth hereby, of what
good conscience Pigghius was, who did
not write for fauor of his side, or hatred
of the contrarye, which if he had minded,
he would neuer haue yelded one inche
vnto an heretike, which haue that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner
of stoutnesse, that if one of them denie
neuer so manifest a thing (as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that S. Peter was euer at Rome: vpon
which thing all writers agree vpon, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thowghe
they differ somwhat in the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me)
but, as I sayed, be the thing neuer so
manifest to the contrarie of that, which
any of them doth affirme or impugne,
yet will the rest defend him in their wise,
not perchaunce in alowing the opinion,<note place="margin">A differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>likes and Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>
but in saing that it is a disputable questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
and so, that being grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, ergo say they, it
is no mater of faith, whether the one part

they be plaine, they doe vtter their

<hi>&amp;</hi> trifles doth he meane? forsoth, such
as be in som proses, antiphonies, repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
and rehersalls of thinges not aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke.
which be in deed in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe of the
masse, but are the outward garment, as it
were of the body. Now, wheras you say,
that Pigghius hath found out errors and
abuses in the masse, it maketh a Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
man to feare by and by, lest that, either
by Pigghius opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Christ his body were
not really present, or were not to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>&amp;</hi> the signe of the crosse wer not to be

vsed in the masse, or water and wine not
to be mengled, or the bread not to be
taken in the hand of the priest, when he
should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrat, or least som other thing
worth the talking of, were omitted or
abused. As for a versicle, or lesson, or som
one ceremony, there may be cause per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
to alter it, and yet the masse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
neuer the worser. And therfor tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
M. Iuell semeth vnto me, not to play
a bold part and vpright. for wheras pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
(as he can not but know, except he
be to much vnlearned) wheras I say, the
masse is properly the sacrifice of the new
law,<note place="margin">what a masse is.</note> in the which Christ his very owne
body is offered, by him self throwgh the
ministery of priestes, vnto God his father,
for the purging, preseruing, and beuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of his church: M. Iuell yet, setting
him selfe to talke against the masse. <hi>I will
not speake</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>of transubstantiation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A timerous bragging and vaine gloriouse weakenes of M. Iuell.</note>
               <hi>of reall presence, of sacrifice, I am content to
disauantage my selfe at this tyme in those
thinges, but I will talke of the communion
in both kindes, of the Canon of the masse, and
of priuate masse.</hi> As who should say, it is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3078:52"/>
not good to com before the face, but I
shall angre them well inowgh, in tred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on their heeles. It is the fashion of
mery men, when they are disposed to
spend good tyme idlely, to find fault with
the fashion of the apparel and gesture of
them, whose manners they can not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue.
And so in this place, if they haue
any thing, to lay against the masse, lett
them reproue, either sacrifice or presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
or one of the substantiall thinges. But
if they will make great bost, of defacing
the masse, and in effect medle with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but the circunstances therof, truly
if this be alowed, then (say I) he is no
honest mans and if I be required to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
it, I will bid the iudge to consider his
croked nose, or halting legg. Which, as
they are no good reasons, to disproue a
mans honestie: so doth most of M. Iuell
his talke, nothing perteine to the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se.
But M. Iuell craftelie perceiuing, that
of congruence in speaking against the
masse, it should folow, that he did speake
against the sacrifice and reall presence,
<hi>No</hi> (saieth he) I <hi>will not talke of them, I
<pb facs="tcp:3078:53"/>
will disauantage my selfe</hi> which is a merue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
kind of simplicity, to seke a praise of
corage and strength in very feare and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes.
This is once certaine, The sacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice
and presence disproued, all the rest
would quicklye fall. but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion vnder
both kindes, vulgar tongue, and taking
away of priuate masse (as they call it) for
a while permitted: the masse in deed is
neuer the worse, the communion in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
is neuer the better. Yet, goe to, let vs
consider, what he sayeth against the mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
euen in those pointes, which he hath
his most aduantage in, which all (except
adoration onely) if he could disproue,
he is nothing the neerer of his purpose,
which is to withdraw good Christians
mindes from the masse, and make them
hang vpon the Communion.
<q>Fyrst as touching the strainge and vnknowen
tongue,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>M.</hi> Iuell.</note> which hath ben vsed in the masse.
S. Paul his counsell in generall is, that what
soeuer is done or sayed in the congregation,
should so be done and sayed, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
may haue comfort therby, and yelde
thankes vnto God, and say Amen.</q>
It appeareth that the store is spent, when
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3078:53"/>
such argumentes are browght forth, or
rather, that there was no store at all. For
this obiection of the vnknowen tongue,
myght haue ben vttered ouer nyght at
Euensong tyde, or early at matins in the
morning, which both seruices are in the
latin tongue, which he termeth an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
tongue. But to kepe it vnto the
masse, it is out of place and fashion. And
behold, he pretendeth to talke properlye
against the masse, <hi>&amp;</hi> that he might so doe
the more properly,<note place="margin">Note how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlye M. Iuel argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against the Masse.</note> and the more to the
purpose, he dispatched his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of many
other questions, and disaua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taged him self,
of speaking against the real presence and
sacrifice, as who should say, I wyll onely
medle with the masse, and yet his first
obiection against it, doth serue first, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Euensong or matins, if we should
folow the ordre of time. And by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
also M. Iuell, you myght haue taken
vpon you to speake against the <hi>Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
Againe, this argument is good in the
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, not in the towne, emong the lay
vnleardned people, and not in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
emong scholars, vnto whom the
<pb facs="tcp:3078:54"/>
masse is not in an vnknowen tongue.</p>
            <p>Also this reason may be alowed, on this
side of the seas, and not beyond sea, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
the latin tongue in many places is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
knowen. You haue proued then,
that a simple Englishe man, should not
alow the masse, but all Latinistes and
scholars may vse the masse still. And so
the great labor, which you haue taken in
reciting of S. Paule, S. Austen, and Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,
is not against the masse, but against
her cote onely. how think you (master
myne) if I shold preach among the welsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and cry out to them, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
is nawght, and should say, alas
good people, you lacke the frute of our
Lord his supper, and the solacing of your
selues in the remembraunce of Christ his
death, and so furth. And if I did bring
this principal reason for me, bicause it is
in a tongue vnknowen vnto them, would
you not accompt me frantik, to make
such a doe against the communion, for
the tongue onely, in which it is writen?
wold you not answer, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion
in it self is good, but this litle missehap,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3078:54"/>
is leysurely to be amended? Euen so then
geue sentence vpon your owne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
and say,<note place="margin">obiections against M. Iuell co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nig his wil. that al thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges done in the church must be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstanded of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> that the masse may be good
for all this, but only the tongue in which
it is vsed, is to be amended.</p>
            <p>Before I goe to another obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his,
I wil make som against him my self, vpon
the place of S. Paule, which he trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth
in. For if euery thing is to be doon
and saied so, in the congregation, that all
may vnderstand what is sayed: wherfor is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
all the Psaltar of Dauid, appointed to be
readen in the English church, wheras all
English men vnderstand not all the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes?
why are ther not appointed and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
certain easy and licht to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed,
but without choise, they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
in ordre, as they folow? Then, how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
many of the common people are there,
which vnderstand not, the most easiest
chapter in all Scripture? for if all this whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
in so great reuelation of the Ghospell,
many yet doe not vnderstand the Lord
his praier: how should they attaine to the
Prophetes and Psalmes? Further yet, wher
singing is vsed, what shall we say, to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:3078:55"/>
case of the people, which knele in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the church? yea let them harken at
the chauncel dore it self, yet they shall not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> be much the wiser. Besides this, how will
you prouide, for great parishes, where a
thowsand people are? and if the person
haue but a small voice, is their coming to
the church frutelesse? how shall they all,
say Amen, which doe not all heare him?
Certainly, your wisdomes must prouide,
that first the minister haue a good voice.
and that he haue no more to his cure and
charge, then may heare him. the chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
shalbe well pulled down, the church
made rownd, like a Synagog of the Iues,
or like a doue howse, welshmen by them
selues, Cornishmen by them selues, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
men by them selues, fine Londo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
by them selues, broder speached men
by them selues. So shall all, say amen, vpon
the thinges which are readen, so shall the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> church florish. But yet, I had forgotten
one principall thing, all Scripture must
not be readen, nother of certen bokes
all chapters. and then, for the better ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of the parish, one chapter, and for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3078:55"/>
the poorer, an other. There would be
no end of confusion, if we should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide,
according to this deuise, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be readen in the congregation,
but that which shalbe heard and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stode
of all, which are present. But the
Apostle his purpose was of an other wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedom
and discretion. For he, in the
first vnto the Corinthians, speaking of
the giftes of the holy ghost, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
them together: correcteth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a certain vaine glory of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
emong whom, some were prowd,
for the gift of tongues, and thowght it
a ioyly matter, to speake in a strainge
language. But, sayeth the holy Apostle,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14</note>
               <hi>Folow ye spirituall thinges, and rather co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet
ye, for the gift of prophecying,</hi> which
was to expownd and open the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And then afterwardes, he doth
not dispraise the speaking with tonges,
but he preferreth the gift of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of preaching the Scriptures.
which is most trew in deed, as S. Paule
doth proue it most manifestly by the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and trumpettes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3078:56"/>
For if one were neuer so cunnyng in
Hebrew, Greke, and Latin, and would
shew a copy of those tonges, in open ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: an other were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
worthye praise, and should bring mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
profit vnto the hearers, which knew
but his natiue tongue onely, and would
preach therin vnto his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie men, then
he the thrise better learned man, whom
none of the cumpanie could vnderstand.
wherfor properly, against such vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
men, is the meaning of Saint Paul.
which seeke rather to shew theyr cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
in vsing of diuers tongues, then to
profitt the church of God, in expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the scriptures in that tongue which
is knowen vnto the audience. But yf a
parish priest say his seruice in the Latin
tongue, which none of the parish besides
doe vnderstand: is this priest in danger
of S. Paules wordes, which he speaketh
concerning the vse of a strainge langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge?
no truly. For it is written in the same
chapter of S. Paule, that <hi>he which speaketh
with to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues, speaketh not vnto men, but vnto
God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14</note> And again, <hi>He which speaketh with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3078:56"/>
tongues aedifieth him selfe. and</hi> again, <hi>if one
doe blesse and praise God with his tongue and
voice,</hi> yea although his felow be not edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
therby, <hi>yet he him selfe doth well in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of thankes.</hi> Which thing being so,
they be to folish and scrupulous, which
do admit no other prayer bokes, but such
as are onely in the vulgar tongue. And
wher now is this great fault? <hi>what so euer
is done in the congregation</hi> (saieth M. Iuell)
<hi>must be so done, as the hearers may take co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
therof.</hi> And yet, say I, one may be in
the congregation, and speake vnto God,
and praise God in a tongue vnknowen
vnto other, and be owt of blame therfor.
As S. Paule sayeth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> that <hi>he whiche spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in tongues, aedifieth him selfe, and doth
well to geue thankes, altowgh another be not
aedified.</hi> And in the end of the forsayed
chapter, <hi>if ther be not an interpretor, let him
which hath knowlege in tongues, hold his pea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
in the church, and speake vnto him self,
and vnto God.</hi> But where then is the fault?
onely in this truly, if in such matters, as
appertein vnto the instruction of the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple,
an vnknowen strange tongue be vsed.
<pb facs="tcp:3078:57"/>
as in Sermons which are to be made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them,<note place="margin">why it is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie the people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand all diuine seruice.</note> and exhortations. As for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins
and masse, what so heinous crime is
committed, if the people vnderstand not
all thinges which are spoken? If the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of any shere, would obteine of the

and bicause it were to much, for all the

men, to trauell in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon case, would
not the matter be browght vnto a good
end, except euerye plowghman should
heare, what those halfe skore did say vnto
the Counsell? Or if emong those halfe
skore, two were chosen by consent of the
rest, and those two should declare their
whole mindes: were all the matter das<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
and marred, if those two m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns tales
were not heard of the other eight? And
yet, this is but a temporall matter, and it
is done by them which may err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and
browght before them, which doe not see

and deedes. And yet no vprore is
made, althowgh two men declare the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3078:57"/>
message, and take to their charge, the
cause of the whole shere. How much
more then, is all safe, when the people
send their priest to almightye God, and
mainteine him with their costes, that he
should applye their sute, and speake for
them diligently? Shall a Carter or a
Gentleman, bicause he is best in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
shall he com to the priest, and say,
now Sir Ihon, let vs heare, what ye pray.
We will vnderstand whether you say well
or no, we will prompt you if you say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse,
and you shall not deceaue vs with
an vnknowen tongue? Wheras if the
priest were neuer so vnlerned, neuer so

with cares: the deuotion of the people,
and their good will, is considered of
God. and he for his infinite mercy, and
wisedom, doth take the priest his praiers
in as great and harty a sence, as any of
the parish doth wish. These thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
true, is ther any hastinesse to haue
all the seruice in Englishe? Doth not
god consider the har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is, not the priest the

should not the rest stand at the fote of
the hill trembling and quaking, lest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce,
they be to malepert and draw to
nigh? O what a worlde haue we? here is
a fault found, that the Canon of the mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
is not in English, which (if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible)
for the reuerence of our misteries,
should be in such a kind of tongue, that
none but priestes might vnderstand it,
not bicause disdain is taken, that lay men
should vnderstand as much as priestes do,
but bicause the breaking of many arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
fooles hart, were to be prouided for,
in barring of their curiositie. Yet, <hi>Let all
thinges be doone in the congregation,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
M. Iuell, <hi>that they maye be vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the people.</hi> yf all were reasonable
men, yet for reuerence sake, many thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
were to be reserued from them, or ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
for them. But now, som be vnclean,
before whom pretious stones were not to
be cast, som be sucklinges, which can not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3078:58"/>
yet receaue hartie strong meate, other be
deintye, which can not away with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
seruice, many moe diuersites there
are to be found, and yet, as though all
were one, without distinction of age, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
or person, it is not well, except all
thinges be doon in a common tongue.</p>
            <p>But how is that proued? Mary bicause S.
Paule saieth, that he had rather speake fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
wordes, that other may be instructed
therby: then ten thowsand in a strange
an vnknowen tongue. Truth it is, and
yet S. Paule speaketh not of all seruice of
the church, but of that part onely, which
apperteineth vnto the instruction of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in which the strainge tongue is not
alowed. For if the speaking in tongues
(according to S. Paule) is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed
of daily seruice and praier,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> why
doth he appoint two or three at the most
to speake in tonges and one to interpret
and expound them, wheras daily seruice
is and may be well done of more then
two or three skore? Again by their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of speaking in tongues, all ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
must be in the mother tongue, and
<pb facs="tcp:3078:59"/>
women thereat may sing. But S. Paule
doth so take speaking with tongues, that
he sayeth, let women hold their tongues
in the church. One thing they might
say with good reason, that the Epistle
and Ghospell, which are appointed for
the instruction of the people, might be
readen in the mother tongue, if they
were first well translated. And yet also,
euen by Sainct Paule, if the priest were
able to expound it afterwardes, he might
read it in the masse time, in an vnknowen
tongue, to the common people. For S.
Paule doth not forbid to speake with
tongues, so that one be present which
can expound them. Ergo say they, when
none doth expounde it, ther is a great
fault committed. Goe to, let me graunt,
that all is not so exact, but that heretikes
may peeke a quarell. Who shall amend
that, which is not well? or who hath made
you controllers in the howse of God?
why doe ye not first, make a priuy expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of your conceit vnto the officers?
why doe ye not then, cast your heades to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and make a most humble suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3078:59"/>
why goe not you to Rome, and
confer with Peters successor, as Paule
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ended to Ierusalem to Peter, and the
rest? Why doe ye not pray to God, that
he will helpe, when no peaceable request
can obteine? And if God, for som cause
knowen to him self, should differ his help,
must you take the sword into your han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
or vsurp the auctoritye of Christ his
church, and make your selues leutenants
vnder God? And yet, it is no greater
fault, to read the Ghospell in Latin vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
English men, then to read the same in
English vnto Welshmen. But you will
prouide hereafter, that Welshmen may
haue i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the mother tongue, or cause
them to learne English. How say you
then to Irishe men, Northen men, and
Cornishmen? Ther is no remedie, but
euery spech, must haue a boke of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
in ther proper mother tongue.</p>
            <p>But yet, in the meane time, doe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
quarters, which obey the Kinges of
England, and vnderstand not the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishe
tongue, lacke the frute of their
deuotion, whiles they be at seruice?
<pb facs="tcp:3078:60"/>
And shall we make folish co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaintes, and
exclamations, that the poore welshmen
doe lacke the liuely worde of God, that
S. Paules will is broken, that the order of
the primitiue church is neglected, and
so furth, as far as our rhetorike will ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
vs, bycause they vnderstand not what
the priest sayeth? Let it be an abuse, that
the people three yeres sence, did not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Ghospell, but onely stode
vp at it, and bowed their knee at the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of Ihesus, and did conceaue wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
high thinges to be vnderneth the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin

How much better is it now,<note place="margin">Inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences by hauing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine serui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish.</note> I pray
you, when the simple folke, and those
which are of the old making, vnderstand

tyme, to bring hym vnto theyr remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce,
whom presentlye they know by
the infallyble fayth of the church, to be
vpon the altar. What nedeth then any

            <p>And therfore good men forsake theyr
tongues, and goe to their hart, and there
speake they after a more excellent sort,
then Latinistes, Grecians, or Hebricians
can doe. Which spech of hart, (which
soundeth in the eares of God almighty)
good people had most of all, when they
were lest busied, with the spech of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely
tongues: with which, they vttered

               </gap> out of the church, they talked of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3078:61"/>
God: in the chauncell, they appointed
priestes and clerkes to prayse God, and
to pray for them. at the altar, there stode
the priest alone, and there was theyr Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior
and ours, ready for them, And after
this sort, seruice being appointed, there
remained for them, consideration of the
thinges, which were by externall signes
declared. The true religion consisteth
not in tongues, which tongues are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarye
for learning of the faith, but faith
ones receaued and taken in the hart: the
most perfect way afterwards, of seruing
God, is, to consider in our mindes, the
greatnes of his benefites, which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
by faith. And by this reason one
plaine picture of the passion of Christ,
shall gene more deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnto him which
alredy is faythfull,<note place="margin">Pictures are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people</note> then a most eloquent
learned sermon of M. Iuell him selfe. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
the end of the sermon, is, to leaue
in my hart, and mind, a picture of Christ,
and the beginning of a picture, is, the
Image of that, which I haue printed in
my conceuing. so that I may say, where a
<pb facs="tcp:3078:62"/>
preacher endeth, there beginneth a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and hearing of sermons, is for those
which are to be instructed, and beholdin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of externall signes and pictures, is for
them, which loue in silence and close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
to practise their beleife. Wherfor,
ther is no cause to haue the Canon of the
masse in Englishe: but cause ther is, why
the lay people should be instructed, what
to think, in time of the Canon. And, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
I say, it is no greate matter, to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
what is therin saied, but the only mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is, to beleue, that which therin is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.
And, as at the beginning it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarye,
to open my eares, that the worde of
God might entre by that way into my
hart: so the worde ones by faith concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and the hart being now (throwgh
the goodnes of the holy ghost) made as
it were great with childe there with all,
I shall more euidently, behold the veritie
of God, in those mysteries (of which it
is sayed, <hi>This is my body</hi>) if eares, and
eyes, and all sense, were stopped: then,
if I should entend the proper actions of
those senses.

if the people saied Amen, to the wordes

I graunt vnto yow, M. Iuell, that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament

doe you conclude thervpon? ergo there
is an abuse in the masse. Why Sir, doth

kindes consecrated in the masse? doe not
the priestes receaue both? Yea, but the
Bishopes and priestes deliuer vnto the
lay people one kind onely. They doe it
in deede, and for iust cawses. But a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopp,
or priest, is not a masse, and the
fault of men is not the fault of the serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.<note place="margin">The fault of men is not the fault of the seruice of God.</note>
Reproue then the Bishopes, and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
not against the masse. and confesse,
that the masse is autentike, and godly.
<pb facs="tcp:3078:64"/>
but that the ministers do not folow their
boke, which I say not, as thowgh the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes
and priestes were in deed giltie,
theyr doinges being grownded vppon
most iust causes: but to shew, that if the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
were any fault, it is yet more rhetorike

<q>The third point, that I promised to speake
of,<note place="margin">

very vain in it selfe, and so vncertain,
that no man can redely tell, on whom to
father it.</q>
Loe, what a fault here is, no man can tell
who made the Canon of the masse, ergo
it is not to be credited. As who might
doubt, whethere the third and fowerth
bokes of the kinges were to be credited,
the proper author of them being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen,
or as thowgh they were fautles
which haue denied S. Ihons reuelations,
and S. Paule to the Hebrewes, bycause it
hath been a question, whether they were
the true authors of those thinges. After
like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of folly it is saied, no man can
redely tell, what yere of Nero his raigne,

S. Peter did come to Rome, ergo he was
neuer at Rome. which liberty of babling
ones graunted, there may be found which
shall make this quareling argument: and
say, the histories doe not agree, what yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
of his age Christ suffered, ergo his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is not to be beleued. wel yet, among
all them which are named authors of the
Canon, take him which was farthest of
from Christ, and see, what a foule blank
M. Iuells cause must haue. Innocentius

that is S. Gregory the first. who lyuing

foloweth well, that the Canon of the

by which yow see, how farr a Christian
and good commentator would be, from
such deuyses, as yow M. Iuell doe make
vpon holye sayinges. But the Latin Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
hath no such wordes at all. neyther
before nor it after consecration, that (I
meane) God shoulde blesse Christ his
bodye. In the beginnyng of the Canon
the priest desireth God, to accept and
blesse those giftes, and presentes, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
or oblations of bread and wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
which may receiue encrease of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,

               </gap>cifullie downe, vpon those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouse

But how? not as they are in them selues

               </gap> acceptable, but as they are offered.
for who can saye, that his hart is chast
and pure? and who knoweth, whether
God wil not punishe vs, when we are not
prepared rightlie, to do that office. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
therfor, the holines of God, and
vilenes of man, the church desireth God,
to accept owr offering of Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

owr Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or (in other wordes to saye it)
to accept that bodye and those giftes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.
But of that place M. Iuell speaketh
afterward. I conclud therefore vpon his
present wordes, that he maketh an open
lie and mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est. And if hymselfe was not
the maker of it, lett hym tell, of what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
he borowed it.
<q>Further the priest saieth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>M.</hi> Iuell.</note> that he offereth
and presenteth vp Christ vnto his father.</q>
True it is, and that you may wonder the
more, not the priest onely, but all the
whole church doth offer Christ daily to
<pb facs="tcp:3078:68"/>
his father. For as concerning the priest,

               </gap>ere is no priest among vs at all, or

it is, say you, open blasphemy. So say they,
which worship false Godes, which they
haue made to them selues, by licentious
vnderstanding of the Scriptures, and by

are honorable for the sacrifice which

wheras priestes do the same very thing

not to know these thinges, or dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to passe by them, it is impiety to speak
against the church, and it is blasphemy in
deed to reuile or taunt at Christ his bodi.
But yet M. Iuel<note place="margin">

contrariwise, Christ presenteth vs, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vs a swete oblation, in the sight of

offereth not Christ.</hi> which is open blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemye,

All this which I shal say, is true. Christ

It is besides the person of him, which
hath ben brought vp among lerned men,
and for opinion of learning and graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is called a Bishop, so to dissemble, and
so to counterfaict the vice, in making of
sporte, with a fable of his owne. And first
the Canon, is not truely Englished in this
parte which he iesteth at. For the wordes
of the Latin Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be these,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>M.</hi> Iuells false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting.</note>

o Lord these thinges to be brought, by the

Yet M. Iuell to make more sport, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glisheth
<hi>perferri,</hi> to be caried away, not
to be brought or caried vp, as the truth
is. And bicause the Canon maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Angells handes, he fableth,
as though Christ should be caried vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an
Angells back, or shoulders, or as though
the Catholike did meane, that Christ
should be borne vpon an Angels backe,
and caried vp away into heuen. But what
a fable is this, sayeth he? for soth a very
folish grosse fable in deed, inuented by the
diuell, and vttered by <hi>Melhoserus,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:3078:73"/>
translated in to english by M. Iuell. A fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
grosse fable I say, bicause the church
of God hath no such carnall base, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the place. But desireth God,
that by the ministery of Angells, which
wait vpon vs and his misteries, he would
commaund the body of his soune our
Lord, to be caried vp, not according to
the changeing of place, but according to
his gracious acceptation of our seruice,
in to his high altar, which is heauen.</p>
            <p>For, thinketh M. Iuell, that when the
Angells doe cary vp, good mens almes
deades, or their praiers, or fastinges, or
teares, or any such like, in to the sight of
God, that they make those thinges vp in
fardels, and cast them vpon their backes,

the scripture speaketh, after the fashion

of men, testifying our almes dedes, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinges
and prayers, to be caried vp, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

of Angells. now if one did not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the sense of those wordes right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it were wisedom for him, to hold his
peace, rather then to vtter his grossenes,

<pb facs="tcp:3078:77"/>
which runneth by negatyues, had been
good, the authorytie and name of Christ
or Sainct Paule in that behalfe had been
sufficient: but now it ys most weake and
simple, and not worth the bringing, and
yet M. Iuell will be copious in it, saying:
<hi>The old Doctors, and holye fathers of the
Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>M.</hi> Iuell.</note> 
               <hi>Sainct Cyprian, Sainct Chrysosto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
Sainct Ambrose, Sainct Hierome, Sainct
Augustyn, and others that receiued the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
at the Apostles handes, and, as it
may be thowght, contynued the same in such
sort as they had receiued it: neuer make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in any of all their bokes, of adoring or
worshipping the Sacrament. ergo &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ys a nowghtye lying argument.
Nawghtye, by cause, if in all their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
they neuer doe speake of adoring the
Sacrament, that doth not disproue the
adoration, which Christians haue euer
vsed. And lying, bycause in deed, they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
mention in their workes, of adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Neuer, ys a long day (the prouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
ys) and also. Neuer, ys a long way.
And that those holye fathers in all their
workes (which be so manye) dyd neuer
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3078:77"/>
make mention of adoring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it ys largelye and lowdelye spoken.
It would haue eased me very much, if
M. Iuell in speakyng this great worde
<hi>(Neuer)</hi> and <hi>(in all their bokes)</hi> would
haue named the bokes, which he taketh
to be the proper workes of those holye
fathers. For perchaunse he taketh no
more for Sainct Cyprian, Sainct Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
Sainct Chrysostome, Sainct Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
and Sainct Augustynes workes: then
hym selfe hath readen and alowed. And
by that way, he may quickly make good
his worde, if he shall according vnto his
pleasure, denye that boke to be Sainct
Ambrose, or Sainct Augustynes, in which
any mention is made of adoring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
But if he will be tryed by the
consent of Christendom, or by that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
and hardye notar of the holye fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Erasmus: quicklie shall I proue,
that either M. Iuell hath not readen all
the doctors (which is in hym lykelye,) or
that he hath not well remembred them

suppose, generallie,) or that wittingly he

            <p>All blessed men doe counsell, the recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of the Sacrament, to ascend in their
hart, to loke vp to heauen, to worshipp
Christ sittyng at the right hand of the

counsell, that we should not beleue owr

bicause they couet to withdraw our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations

which is the glorie of his Father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,

As S. Augustyne sayeth very wys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fortitude: would he suffer all his church,
to be beaten downe, and would geue
strength not so much as to one, agaynst
whom all his aduersaries, should not be
able to preuaile? In the tyme of the
synagoge, and in that night, when a

when Christ liueth neuer any more to

is it not besides, not onlie all faith, but all

Behold, when Nicolaus, one of the seauen

Martion, Donatus, or any other heretike,
did begin to spring, straitwaies the church
hath noted hym, althowgh bicause of the

able, straytewayes to oppresse it. And
were the paine neuer so greate, and the
power and number for maintenaunce of

neuer left hym selfe withowt testimonie:
and valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Catholykes were found, which

and it was ioyfullie receaued thorowgh

that all Christendome did keepe it with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

agayne, his decree dyd not make that,
which was before prophane, to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,

before the holidaye was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
appoynted, and the consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie
of the father and the soun, was
before the concell of Nice, and when
orders begin to decay, new statutes are
made for the rapayring of them, not,
as who should saye, they were never vsed
before, but that it should not come to
passe, that they might be quite forgat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

that the adoration of the Sacrament, was

would yow therefor, the sacrament

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated

which do consecrate, be suspected,
and the true sacrament dishonored? The
<pb facs="tcp:3078:94"/>
lerned men, of whom yow speak, dyd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
doubt, but the sacrament was to be
honored, but some of them dyd cast the
worst, saying, what if, by malice of the
priest, or other wyse, there should be no
consecration at all? how then shall we
think (sayed they) is there anye idola<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e
committed of the ignorant people? But
you suppose, they made this argument,
It may chaunce, that an host not conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
be lifted vp, and honored of the
people, which thing ys daungerouse: er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
it had ben better, neuer to haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
corpus Christi daye, or it were well
done to take awaie the sacrament. For
this must be your conclusion, to proue,
that euen by the verie scholemen, adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is taken awaie, or not alowed. For
if this be not proued, yow are fallen from
your matter, and you talke of scholemen,
besides all lernyng. Yet graunt that there
ys daunger (bycause the dyuel hath his
chapelaines) it is easelie remedied, euen
according vnto them, which thowght
good, that the sacrament be worshipped
vnder this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, if consecration were
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3078:94"/>
performed. But according to the truth,
there is no daunger at all. As I wil proue,
which yet neadeth not (because dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger or
daunger not, adoration ys due vnto the
host trulye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated) yet, for the more
plaines, I will shew, the people to be safe,
without all question. for the vulgar and
true Catholykes, allthowgh vnskilfull in
knowledg, yet stedfast in faith, when thei
beleue once, that our Sauyor left his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
vnto his welbeloued church, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of bread, and gaue the power vnto
priestes, of consecrating the same his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
or if the people be not able to make
such distinction, yet if they beleue, what
so euer the church teacheth, and if they
agree to the ordinances of her: then loe
they, in hearing of masse, and adoring the
Sacrament,<note place="margin">the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the priest is not to be serched of the people.</note> are not bound to make serch
of the intention of the priest, but vnder
this faith, that all is well done in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyke
church, and that Christ is to be
worshipped vnder forme of bread, their
deuotion is harmeles vnto them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
vnto God.<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> 
               <hi>If thy eye be simple,</hi>

what so euer knauerie or dyuelishnes, be
wrought of man, in some particular host,
it hurteth not the pietie, of the good and

of the hartes, doth receaue vnto him
selfe, that honor which they haue apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for him, in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For they see,
the priest to reuest hym selfe, to goe to

what shold they do then, but worship the

owt of I can not tell, what old doctors <hi>&amp;</hi>
lerned mens bokes. If I were therfor sure,
that the priest doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrate, I wold then
trulie, worship my maker. How then wilt
thow be sure? hath he not vestme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hym? is he not at the altar? doth he not
al thinges as good priestes shold do? Yes,
but I wold know his inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and meaning,
by his owne word. Why, wold his worde
quiet the? or might not he thinke one
think and speak an other? Mary therefor
(as the preacher noted) it were good, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to worship Christ in the Sacrament,
for feare, least thorough the priest his dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>simulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
I shold haue nothing els there
<pb facs="tcp:3078:96"/>
but bread, and so commit idolatrie. Nay,
good felow, that was not the wysest prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cher,
that euer thow hast heard: because,
sure I am, thow honorest they father and
mother, with all obedience and seruice,
(if they be a lyue) and with thy dailye
praier (if they be departed:) but art thow
sure, that they are thy father and mother,
which are sayd to be? what discretion ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thow, before thow were begotten?
how sayest thow then? if that preacher
shall rule the: not onlie, not thow thy sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe,
but no man at all, shall worshipp any
man or woman for father or mother. By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are not otherwyse sure of them,
but that we beleue the whole parishe,
which doth testifie it. And then, if autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
shall preuaile, the whole world testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth,
that in the masse tyme Christ is
present, in forme of bread: so that thow
needest not, to make any more question
hereof, then whether thy father, be thy
father or no. And this I speak, to declare,
that as long, as we be in the world, we
should seeke for no further profe of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
than may be gathered of heering,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3078:96"/>
seeing, and other senses. And therefor,
perceauing by all externall signes, that
any priest at masse, doth as the church
hath appoynted, I should not desyre, to
creepe in to his bosome, and to withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

to a schole man? For if (as M. Iuell
hath tolde vs owt of theire writinges)
there be daunger of Idolatrie, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
ys omitted, how much hath
Duns holpen the people, by bringing in
of transubstantiation, where as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of breade neuer so much taken
away, yet there may lacke consecration:
and that failing, (as master Iuell wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth)
idolatrie may be committed, and
Duns and Durand should misse of their
purpose, for which they deuysed trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I wonder at the libertie,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3078:99"/>
which master Iuell taketh vpon hym, in
makyng, as pleaseth hym, free reportes
vpon the lerned, as thowgh they were
easie to be vnderstanded, or he had euer
great mynd to read them, or as thowgh
his report were of such authoritie, that
as he sayeth, so it must be in them.</p>
            <p>Now, as concerning Sainct Thomas,
which proueth that no bread doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in the Sacrament, bycause god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
honor ys geuen vnto it, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and present practise of the church
dyd moue hym thereunto. As though he
should saye on this wise: The church doth
geue godlie honor vnto that,<note place="margin">Of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note> which ys
vnder the formes of bread and wyne,
but no godlye honor ys due vnto anye
pure creature, ergo except the churche
should committ Idolatrie (which ys im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible)
no other substance besides the
body of Christ, can be conteined in the
Sacrament. In which his conclusion,
the honor, which the church gaue to the
Sacrament, was sufficient vnto hym,
to inferr, that no bread remayned, and
not his desire, to haue the Sacrament
<pb facs="tcp:3078:100"/>
worshipped, was the motyue and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to inuent that no bread remayned.
For, to speake the trueth, the scholemen,
as they were, for the greater part, men
of excellent witt and holynes: so, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowghe
the ghift of vnderstanding and
cumpassing weightie matters, they went
verie farr in serching owt the treasures
of all diuinitie, and yet, thorowgh the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of holynes, which qualified their dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
inuentions, they allwayes submitted
their conclusions vnto the authoritie of
the Catholyke church. In so much, that if
a thowsand Dunces and Durandes, shold
so decide this question and matter, as
master Iuell reporteth of them: yet nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not the Catholyke, for that cause,
to be trobled, or the heretyke crake of
anye victorie, agaynst the practyse and
faith of the churche. But lett vs behold,
how master Iuell plaieth the schole man,
and vttereth such an insight in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
as the greatest doctors for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitye,
haue neuer marked throwgh their
dulnes. For vpon this, which he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
Duns and Durand to saye <hi>(the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3078:100"/>
ys to be worshipped, ergo no bread must
be remayning)</hi> he inferreth a contrarie
conclusion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>M.</hi> Iuell.</note> as, that <hi>(there ys bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning,
ergo it must not be worshipped.)</hi>
Wherein both the argument concludeth
not, if he will folow Duns and Durand:
and the formar proposition ys hereticall,
if he would submitt his vnderstanding
vnto the Catholyke church. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(I saye) and the consequence ys
nawght, bycause for soth, by his doctors
Duns and Durand the schole men, for
all the substance of bread remainyng yet
might the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be adored and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped.
But that is one doctors opinion.
Then also, his antedent ys false, because
the church hath so receiued and tawght
vs, that the substance of bread ys clean
conuerted. And as concernyng master
Iuell his profes, of his antecedent, where
as he alleageth Sainct Augustyne in a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of his <hi>ad insantes,</hi> saying, <hi>that which
you see vpon the table, ys bread,</hi> it doth con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clud
that the other thing which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
to be vnder those formes of bread is
not Christ his naturall bodye. And, I
<pb facs="tcp:3078:101"/>
trow, Sainct Augustyne dyd not meane
such bread to be there, as childerne spread
their butter vpon. For it is wryten by the
same blessed doctor:<note place="margin">In lib. sent. Prosperi.</note>
               <hi>VVe honor thinges
which we see not, that ys to saye, flessh and

            <p>Then, as concerning Gelasius, which

lerned men, or the greater part doe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifye.
Agayn, before the church had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
it, and opened by her sentence,
the manner of Christ his being in the
Sacrament, it was no heresie (if proude
obstinacie dyd not make it) to saye that
<pb facs="tcp:3078:102"/>
bread remained, or that it vanished in to
nothing. Bicause both opinions dyd hold
with reall presence, and the authors of
them were contented to yeld vnto their
betters iudgement. And so, if we should
graunt vnto the heret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kes, that which
thei do require about Gelasius or Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doretus,
they both defending the reall
presence, it ys no small matter against the
heretykes other opinions, and it ys no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all against the Catholykes. But
in these dares now, when it hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
according vnto scriptures,<note place="margin">Concilium Lateranese</note> and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
fathers, in a generall councell, that
the substance of bread is conuerted in to
the bodie of Christ: now, to denie trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and to reuyle the decree of
the Catholike church, this is greatlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the faith. and this is it, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
heretikes. S. Cyprian, which defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the rebaptizing of them, whom he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retykes
had baptized before, was no he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retyke
in so doing, bycause the question
was not then determined by the church,
vnto whose iudgement, he submitted his
lerning and authoritie. But now, if it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3078:102"/>
should come in to an idle head, to bring
that blessed martyrs reasons, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Catholike church, he should do
nothing els, in wyse mens iudgementes,
but declare his owne vaine gloriouse fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
And yet, I do not, ne will not vse this
defence, but plainelie answer, that Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius
and Theodoretus, doe meane well,
and speak as papistes may doe, that the
substance or naturall propertie of bread
remaineth, that is to saie, the same quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie,
vertue and qualitie, which it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secration. Wherefor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clud
the cleane contrarie, vnto Master
Iuells assertion, I saie, that neither the
auncient doctors do affirme, that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of bread remaineth (vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

if fault shold be committed, it is not the

shall euer be concluded of them. In the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
cases then, the distinctions doe serue,
and in these occasions the church must
not be to seek, of the fynest poyntes of

teaching her more and more, and euer
leauing her manye poyntes to be lerned,
vntill she come at length vnto, heauen,
where all trueth and veritie shall be most

(as the worde it selfe doth import)
are especiallie for scholes, and they are

selues most wysest, and by a short waye,
looke what they can not vnderstand, that
are they readie to contempne. Now also,
if the scholemen haue manye thinges
not necessarie at all, it is no true part to
make the cause of the church and them

            <p>Holcot sayeth, that it maye so chaunse,
that one should meryte by the worshyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

to sett vp a candell before the dyuel. And
yow also M. Iuell, yf yow would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,
what difference there ys betwyxte
a thing done materiallye and formallye
(which termes the scholes know well

of the particular case, in which the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shypping

that yow keepe promys, least yow be

            <p>Syr, I pray yow, before Innocentius,
who vsed this argument or conclusion?
Then I aske, whether this text of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
was the cause that the Pope should
be greater then an Emperor? yf you can
not tell what to answer to the first, you
are not skillfull inowgh in owr misteries,
how great also is your knowledge and
reading, that before Innocentius tertius,
yow dare well say, that no man euer vsed
the same verie argument or similitude?
And if to the second yow saye, that the
Sonn and Moone were the cause, for
which Christians dyd make the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
betweene Pope and Emperor: you
maye goe to schoole agayne, and lerne
yowr Catechisme, for any knowledge
or vnderstanding, which yow haue in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
mysteries, whereas before Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3078:109"/>
dayes, the Pope was higher then the
Emperor, the argument of the Sonn and
Moone, being not alleaged for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.

and deceaue therewith his circunspection
and grauitie: the Ethnykes, for your so
doing, might dispense at their pleasure,
with you, and geue that praise and name
vnto you, that you be a trym felow, of a
goodlie fyne witt and a pleasaunt, and
such a one, good Iupiter, send me (might
they say) at my need: but, emong Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
in so great a question as the sowle
cummeth vnto, in open pulpitt, a famou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
scholar, a Bishopp by calling, to moue
ernest expectation, as though he would
rypp vp the high misteries of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
faith, and to recyte but an argument
of Innocentius onlie, (which he rather
for garnisshing of his letters, to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
then strength of the similitude in
it selfe and by it selfe, dyd roundelye
alleage furth vnto hym,) and to make,
as though that were the best argument,
<pb facs="tcp:3078:110"/>
and most secret misterie, of the papiste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it ys not for a sage person, matter, place,
or audience. Vnto yow M. Iuell, if one
should talke of this question, how much
the dignitie of a pope were better, then
the rome of an Emperor, he should neuer
alleage Innocentius tertius, or the glose.
Not bycause, they are to be contempned
in them selues, but rather bycause yow
doe sett so litle by them. And yet, it may
be proued vnto you, all that which Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius
would conclude, by the alluding
vnto the sonn and moone, which God
made at the beginnyng. Therefore I doe
graunt vnto you, that Innocentius argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ys not of great good force against
an ethnyke and heretike, and yet I save,
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion of the church standeth, for

were an high misterie, it could not be so

of the pope aboue the Emperor, bicause
the Sonn ys bigger then the moone, and

and strength, emong the Catholykes, for

O heauen and earth: what faultes be
these? How much ys master Iuell to be

            <p>But alas for pitie, and phy for shame.
A lerned man and browght vp emong
honest studies, so for to abuse the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of the vnlerned and vnstedfast
people, that they should think, nothing
els, to be in the sacrifice and oblation
of the Catholikes, but an obseruation of
a strange tong, lynen cloth, altar of sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
chalice of gold, or other such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
Although I would not suffer a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

not trust hym with paring of my nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
and no man (that wyse is) permitteth
his enemie to doe with the makyng of

<pb facs="tcp:3078:118"/>
of Catholikes, althowgh the life
of owr sowle consisteth not in them: but
in the holie and relieuing Sacramentes.
What should we doe, by M. Iuells pryuie
and wise counsell? if we did putt awaie,
for his pleasur, the ceremonies, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his ghostlie spirite: should we haue
nothing to putt the bread and wyne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that he findeth so great fault with an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar?
surelie, what so euer matter, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
had ben made of, good men would
haue sone applied, some one text, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the golden chalice: shold we drink
then without a cupp? what so euer me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
the chalice had ben made of, great
scholars would haue shewed, some place
or other, seruing for it. And no doubt, the
thinges them selues were first vsed, for
some good cause and reason, not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in writing perchaunse, but left in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
which being not alwaies knowen
and manifest vnto all lerned men: they,
vpon the confidence of the trueth, and
holines which is in the churche, and also
vpon this principle, that nothing is to be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3078:118"/>
condempned which serueth vnto chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:<note place="margin">The tradi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the church, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and continued withowt reason al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged.</note>
added a probable and likelie reason,
which shold make for the ceremonie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.
And whereas, without any reason

why should it be so much the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,

            <p>There ys no principall part of a man, of
whose fasshion, situation, or manner, the
philosophers did not, either geue the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or seek after it, at the lest. As, why the
eyes, be placed on high? why there be
two of them, one tong seruyng vs? why
the fingers be so manye? why the thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
so thick and short? why the braine so

in the rest. Yet, I am sure, they stode not
by God, when he made the world, that
bycause of the Ergo, which they had con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluded,
God should make that part of
his creature, which should agree with
their reason. As (in example) the hart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>

to asswage the feruentnes of it,
ergo sett the colde braine directlie ouer
<pb facs="tcp:3078:119"/>
it: I thinke not, that any man dyd at the
begynnyng make this reason, and that
therefore God dyd answer hym, with,
yow say well gentle philosopher, it shall
be so, as yowr ergo concludeth. But
God, most wyselie and agreablie, hath
sett euerye part of vs in his order. of
which has doing, there be causes, and
reasons, more then any man can t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the inventing and serching of which
he hath sett those occupyed, which will
studie naturall philosophie, and consider
the workes of wysedome. Not so yett,
that when any man, hath geauen a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and probable cause, of the makyng
or disponing of any creature: that cause
which the man inventeth, should be
termed the occasion and cause of that
creature. But this doth folowe, that God
ys a wonderfull wysedome, which (all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thowgh
no man should fynd fault with
his doinges, but take them as he hath
apoynted) hath prouided yet, that such
good reason, should be seen in all his wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kinges:
that he must be, not onlie stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,
but also folish, which would stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3078:119"/>
and murmur against them.</p>
            <p>And so I think, for the ceremonies of
all kindes which are vsed in the church,
of which a great number haue come
from the verie Apostles, and the rest ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
ben apoynted, by them which had A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike

then, once receyued of the Catholykes
were kept of them for obedience sake,
which knew not the reason and occasion
of them. Then loe, the lerned men,<note place="margin">Of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thoritie &amp; causes of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies of the catholike church.</note>

and knowing that nothing hath ben ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shelye

theyr forefathers godlye inuentions, so

them selues. For the masse in deede, is a
common function and office, to be done
of a priest, which is the legate of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
vnto God: and God his messenger
vnto them, In which offices, he speaketh
for their necessities, bringyng vnto God,
the most noble <hi>&amp;</hi> ryche present of Christ
his owne body, the soner to obteyne mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and grace at the which, not onlye the
visible parties present, but all Angels and
blessed sowles, either in heauen, or in the
way thytherward, be assistants, and doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
the priest. If .20. men be stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
by, is it common: and if thousandes
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3078:124"/>
of heauenly hostes, replenysh the place
.19. of the men lackyng, is it priuate? yf
it be sayd in the open church, is it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and yf it be browght vnto a litle
chappell, is it priuate? what meaneth he
by this word priuate, I would fayne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand?
And they answer, that, when
one alone receiueth,<note place="margin">what the Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes meane by priuate masse.</note> then it is priuate.
But is that all their reason? why then, yf
the matter hangeth vpon the nomber of
the communicantes, we shall haue as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
diuisions of common masse, as they
haue prety definitions of a priuate masse.
Three (sayeth the order of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion boke)
myndyng to receaue, do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, as three make a colledge,
(as I haue heard) with the lawiers, but
one alone maynteyneth it a colledge, by
the selfesame lawiers, ergo that masse is
not priuate, but common. and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of the least, because,) yf one lacked,
there could be no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion. well then,
yf three skore will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, the nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre
encreasyng, the state of the masse, is
altered, and therfore let this be called a
masse of the common of the more. Now,
<pb facs="tcp:3078:125"/>
yf yow make vp three hundred, that must
nedes be, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon of the greater. yf three
thousand, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon of the more greater:
so that we shall haue no end, of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
of the more, and common of the lesse.
How much more better is it proued, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
masse to be equally co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, because
the priest is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon officer, the prayers
be common, the answerer in the peoples
behalfe common,<note place="margin">the church hath no pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uate Masse but euerie one ys com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon.</note> the thing offered co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
And these so many common thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
shall one peltyng reason take away,
bycawse the priest alone receiueth? And
shall the lothsomnes to heauenly thinges,
in the people, cawse that, to be priuate,
which of his owne nature, is and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

but three distinct monethes in the yere:

and the sonn priuate, yf none could co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

               </gap>est, forhead the lay people, that
they should not come to communicate?
are not the church dores open? may not
the priest, be spoken with all? ys not the
necessary matter for the Sacrament, of
lyght charge? hath not the church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
vpon the payne of synn, once
at the least to receaue euery yere, because
someels would neuer com to that table?
wherby she declareth her sorow, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<pb facs="tcp:3078:126"/>
and how glad she would be, to
haue no occasyon of continuing her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree?
And the Sacrament lying so open,
for euery man and woman, and the priest
so ready, and the seruice of the masse so
daylye, must it, (on Luthers name,) be
called pryuate, because none will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate?
Or, is the meate on the table, and
the gestes at the table, all one? and if the
gestes depart, will the disshes aryse with
them? and ys the people be singular, must
the masse be pryuate? well, yet lightely
then, vpon Easter day in parish churches,
there are no priuate masses, and so those
masses be owte of yowr reache Master
Iuell. Then put this case, that at one
priestes masse, there were som receauers,
at a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nothers none at all, both priestes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
one boke and seruice, yf he which
sayeth the priuate masse, (as yow terme
it) doe naught, how do yow excuse hym,
withwhom some communicate? or yf his
masse be good, which hath certen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
with hym, why shall the others be
reproued, which althowght he receyue
alone, yet he sayeth no more nor lesse,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3078:126"/>
then his felow doth? In my mind, it ys
owt of reason and purpose, to fynd fault
with the masse, because of them which
here the masse and for the slowth of the
people, to disproue the diligence of the
priest, and bicause of vnwillingnes in men,
to distroye the mysteries and pleasure of
God. But now, M. Iuel, lest he shold seme
to speke withowt authoritye, he recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vp, the institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ, the order
which S. Paul receiuyd, the practyse of the
primitiue church for the space of six hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares. And what will you proue by
all this? Mary (sayeth he) that at those
daies, there was a communion. Well we
doe graunt that in the beginnyng, the
people receiued with the priestes. But
what do yow inferr of that? ergo there
was no priuate masse, and the priest did
neuer receiue alone. I deny your argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
For these two thinges: the people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
with the priest, and a priest yet to
receiue alone, be not contrary, but that
at these dayes, they may be both verifyed
in one church at an Easter tyme. But I
will not be so hasty with yow: <hi>&amp;</hi> I graunt
<pb facs="tcp:3078:127"/>
that at the begynning the people did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
daylye ergo the priuate masse
is naught. Well Syr, yf this be the fault, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
shalbe amended with me, and I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
say masse hereafter, but some shal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with me doth this please you?
and is the masse, which I say, in this case
allowable or no? I know what yow must
say (yf yow folow your masters), that it is
not allowable. Truly then I may well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
within yow. For yf the hauing of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municantes
at my masse, doe not make
the thing perfect: neither the lacke of
them shall make it vnperfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what is the
masse the better, yf three receyue with
me? No iote sayeth the heretik<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what is it
the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ser, yf none will communicate?
In no poynt, he should answer. so that to
haue or lack communicantes, is but an
accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto it, and may be absent either
present, beside the corruption of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.
Therfor, yf yow could proue, that S.
Clement, S. Denys, S. Iustyne, and the
rest, did vse a contrary masse vnto owres,
yow should saye sumwhat, but now, yow
troble your self, with prouing, that many
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3078:127"/>
did receiue with the priest, in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
church (which no man denieth) and
yow inferr thervpon slenderly, that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
masse was not then vsed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
auayleth. for more or lesse, all or
none, to receiue at a masse, it maketh so
litle difference, that as owr masse is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
the better (as yow will saye) yf all
present by, should receiue: in so by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
conclusion, it ys nothing the worse, if
none doe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate. And as the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
or naughtines of the priest, doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
profit or hinder the mysteries in
themselues: so much lesse, the comming
or the goyng of the people, can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the effect of God his word and wil.
Now yet, althowgh I haue not to deny
the testimonies of the fathers, which in
this part are alleaged, which are not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
vnto Catholikes, and are regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of them: that not withstanding, I wil
loke vpon them, and consider their faces,
most graue in the syght of Catholikes,
but not so with the Protestantes, which
some tymes geue reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and humble lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes

<pb facs="tcp:3078:128"/>
with scoffes and disdaynes inowgh,
they passe lightly by them.</p>
            <p>Behold now,<note place="margin">The incon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stantie and uncertentie of hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</note> how much ys made of S.

And agayne, yf any were absent, in S.
Iustines dayes, the sacrament was caryed
home to them, which, according to the

it should not be so much taunted at, as

that the masse hath no lacke in it

also, because the priest ys not a priuate

within .vjC. yeares after Christ, the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
was receiued vnder one kynd. Christ
owr Sauior,<note place="margin">Luc. 24.</note> toke bread, brake it, and gaue
it vnto the two disciples, with whom he
turned in at Emaus: and before he did the

of the bread, he vanysshed owt of
their syght: but that bread was his body,

therfore was there receiuyng of
Christ his bodye vnder one kynd in the

be auncient inowgh. Likewise in the .xx.
of the actes of the Aposteles, S. Paule &amp;
the Christians came together, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
to breake bread: but there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

therof also. Bycawse yf they had

therof before midnyght, but at midnyght
the young man Eutichus fel downe from

or talked to them, and after that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stle
had putt them in good comfort, that
he was not dead: then loe, he ascended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
and brake bread, and tasted it, and
so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tynued his talke vntill the morning.
So that the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stance of the day, which
the Christians kept holy, and the vnsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonablenes
of the tyme, to goe to supper
after mydnyght, sytting downe to it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sonn sett at the least: doth proue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that it was the sacrament, then that it

ergo there was no wine: remember,
I pray yow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, your owne fashion of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonyng,

welshemen haue no welshe communyon,
and at those blessed and quyet tymes,

S. Paule writing to the Romaynes,
not a forme of seruice but a verie sermon
(as it were,) wherin he entreateth of most
high, and agayne most familiar matters,
yet he write in Greik and not Latin.</p>
            <p>Which thing, did he, (trow yow) for the
lack of the Latin tong? no, that is not
trew, in him, which had the gift of all ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Did he think, that all the Romanes,
had the knowledge of Griek, as well as
of Latin? Trulye, that was for any simple
man more meeter to think, then for the
wisedome of S. Paule. Had he forgotten
him self, beyng allwayes of that mynde,
that in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, he would rather
speke fiue wordes, that other myght be
the better for them, then fiue thowsande

a principall matter, as this is,
<pb facs="tcp:3078:139"/>
according to the heretykes declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And then, in an epistle, by twentie
partes, there is more cause, to wryte in
the vulgare tong, then in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
bycause in the seruice, the quyer occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyeth
the place of the people, and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

togeather, to here what the priest did
reade, but abowte the pulpet, or other
where, all myght stand well inowgh to
here the epistle readen. And so after this
sort, I myght fynd twentie differencyes,
betwixt an order of seruice, and an epist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le.
Wherfore I wonder much, that they
make such a brablyng, abowte the strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
tong. and requyre, what aucthoritie,
example or reason we haue for it, owt of
Doctor, Councell, or, Antiquitye. It is
reason, auctoritye, and proufe abundant,
for a Christian man: that, this or that
thing hath ben done or vsed vniuersallie
in the church of Christ,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> were it vsed but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3078:139"/>
for one yeare onlye, bycause the church
is the pyllar of truth, and hath the holy
ghost her teacher and gouernor for euer,
and neuer hath ben suffered vtterly to ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
erred, in all her members at one tyme.
And then, wheras the latin seruice in the
Latin church hath been so long vsed in
these contreys, which vnderstode not the
latin tong, and also they confesse a very
long vse of it, yt is well inowgh proued,
that there is no dampnable error in the
matter. for what tong fownd yow, M.
Iuell, in the English church, when yow
were borne? or how long before, had the
english seruice, been left vnsayed, and the
latin entertayned, a strawnger before a
cuntreye man of owr owne? yf yow can
bryng forth the bokes, where the english
common prayers, were euer in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
vulgare tong, and tell vs the name
but of one Bishop, which vsed it in his
diocese, yow shall make all men wonder
at your inuention, and yf, neuer, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but latin, hath ben vsed, yt is autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytie
and reason sufficient for all English
men, that the first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uertors of this land,
<pb facs="tcp:3078:140"/>
vnto the sayth, did leaue the latin seruice
in it, nothing fearing or caring, what a
few fyne felowes would persuade to the
contrarie, after .viij. or .ix. hundred yeares
continuance. Then also, must all prayers
of necessitie, be in the common tong,
or may a few be excepted? yf yow except
any one: why should not the people here
all, and answer Amen vnto all? and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie
in the most secrete matters, which
haue most weight in them, and in which
the cause of the people, is most expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed?
yf all of necessitie, must be audiblye
expressed: how then doth your doctrine
agree with S. Basill, and S. Chrysosto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
masses, in the which the chief priest
prayeth secretelye at the altar, at certen
places, whiles the quyer in the meane ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
syngeth? Or how could S. Ambros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
(O worthy Byshop) how could he stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

it please your most excellent wysedome
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3078:140"/>
and maiestye, to com more nere to the

the more commodiouslye to answer A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
vnto my blessing, euen, as it shall

not so S. Ambrose, not so, he, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oote from the altar, but
sent his archeadeacon, not with supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but with reprehension, not as to an
Emperor of the world, but as to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Christian, saying: O Emperour, the
inward places are appoynted for priestes
onelye,<note place="margin">Hist. Eccl. li. 9. ca. 30.</note> which others are not permitted,
neither to entre into, neither to touche.
Goe furth therfore, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arye, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuyng
of the mysteries, as others doe:
for purple maketh Emperours, and not
priestes. Vnto which, the Emperor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
so mekely and Christianlike, that
he is more to be wondered at, for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercummyng
of his passions, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querying
of barbarous nations. But, to
my purpose, it appeareth by this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="tcp:3078:141"/>
of places in the church, that the
people were not suffered to here al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
And therfor I conclud, that wheras
it is no necessite that all thinges be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstode,
which the priest in the church
sayeth, yea rather, yf thys be agaynst all
good order and discipline, there is no
necessitie, that the tong should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
all to geather, where the hering of
the same tong, must be kept secrète.</p>
            <q>Or that the Bisshopp of Rome,<note place="margin">Iuell.</note> was then
called an vniuersall Bisshopp, or the heade
of the vniuersall church.</q>
            <p>I would to God, that this question of
the heade of the church of Christ, were
throughlie knowen, it would stop a great
sorte, of hastye preachers and ignorant,
which think them selues able to do much,
by cause they can speak in a matter indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
probablye: as communion vnder
bothe kyndes, seruice in the vulgare tong,
and such like. But, to this question of M.
Iuells, I answer, askyng him first, whether
any prince of that tyme, of which he
speaketh, did beare the title of defendor
of the faith? and if neither Constantinus,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3078:141"/>
neither Theodosius, neither any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
good Emperor, were precisely then
so called, shall it folow, that one may ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
that title, from the kinges of England?
Many thinges may trulye be verifyed of
certen persons, which yet they doe refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
not as vnagreyng with their dignitie,
but as vnapt for keepyng their humilitie.
As S. Peter, S. Paule, S. Iames, and Iohn,
with all the rest of the blessed Apostles,<note place="margin">Matth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Psal. 44. 2. Cor. 10.</note>
were the lightes of the world, and rulers
of the earth, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querors of all power,
which would sett it selfe against Christ,
and they dyd not obserue that stile in
their writynges, neither any of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
after them, which also were ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
and gouernors of the world. Further
it ys to be considered how this worde
(vniuersall Bisshopp) is to be taken. For
yf yow meane vniuersall Bisshopp, that
besydes hym there is no other in all the
world, but that he is one for all, as the
word importeth: then also at these da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es,
there is no vniuersall Bishop. But yf he
be called vniuersall which among all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes
is the chiefest and one ouer all,
<pb facs="tcp:3078:142"/>
so ys there,<note place="margin">In what sense in vniuersall bisshop ys to be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</note> and must be, one vniuersall
Bisshopp in the church of Christ. First
then, I answer, that yf none were called
vniuersal Bishop .vjC. yeares after Christ
yet the lack or not geauyng of that title,
doth not proue, that there was no such
thyng, or no supreame heade ouer the
church. And further I saye, that also in
these dayes, there is no vniuersall Bishop,
yf we take the worde, after som one fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyon.
For in S. Gregorye his tyme (of
which place M. Iuel in his sermons doth
oft triumph) the Bishop of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople
forgetting the humilitie of Christ
owr Sauyor, did much couet to be called
vniuersall Bishop: presuming, that sith he
was Bishopp of the same citie, where the
Emperour then dwelt, which was onlye
Emperour of all: that hys name, for that
place, might lykewise, with this gloriouse
title (of vniuersall Bishop) be right well
adorned. against whom S. Gregorie did
write, and speake ernestlye, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dempning
the desyre of that gloriouse title, grown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his argument vpon the signification
of this worde, (vniuersall.) Bicause (saith
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3078:142"/>
he) in the epistle vnto Ihon, Bishopp of
Constantinople) one should seeme, to
take away the glory of Bisshoprick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
all the rest of his brothers, which would
challenge vnto hym selfe, to be called the
vniuersall Bishop. Trew it is therfor, that
there is no Bishop vniuersall in that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
as who should say he were onelie a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopp,
but lyke as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> certen of
the elder and worthier: so the Pope ys

for all the multitude of his felowes in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
he continueth in his supremacie, as a

onlye he hath not al the spirite of God,
which for the profit of the body, is distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted

yet ys equall vnto hym in superioritie of
<pb facs="tcp:3078:143"/>
gouernement, bycause in euerye seemelie
bodie, one part ys higher then all the rest.
Agayne, S. Gregorie, which was a most
blessed Bishopp, myghte and did iustely,
fynd fault with Iohn of Constantinople,
bicause of his prowd enterprise, although
it were grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, that the title (vniuersal)
myght haue been verified in any one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.
So in one sense, which I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, I grawnte that there was neuer,
and that now there is none, which is an
vniuersall Bishopp. But yet yf we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

               </gap>e of the principle, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
I will make more playne and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdlye, wheras the Catholikes
do teach, that Christ is not locally in the
Sacrament, as in a place: to aske of them,
wherby they proue that Christes body is
or may be, in a thowsand places, which
do know but of one place, which his body
(circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scriptiue) occupyeth, and yet bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue,
that he is verilye and bodylie present,
in euery consecrated host? it is quyte owt
of the purpose. Yet for all this, I wil shew
what S. Chrisostome answereth vnto the
like question, as M. Iuell moueth. which
in expounding of those wordes of Sainct
Paule to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. &amp; 10. ho. 17.</note> that Christ doth
not offer vp hym selfe, oftentymes, as the
priest in the olde law, did enter in to the
most holye places euery yeare with the
bloud of beastes: <hi>How then doe we?</hi> sayth
Chrisostome, <hi>doe we not offer vpp euery
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/>daye? we doe offer in deed, but as men, which
make a reme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>brance of his death. And this
sacrifice is one, not manie. How is it one,
and not many? bycause, that once beyng of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3078:150"/>
it was offered in to the most holye pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and this sacrifice is an example, taken
owt of that. VVe offer vp, the self same all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
and not trulye, this tyme one lambe,
to morow an other, but allwayes the self sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.
Therfor this sacrifice is one, other ells,
by this reason, bycause it is offered in many
places, there be many Christes. No not so,
but Christ is one euery where, both here full
and whole, and there full and whole, one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye.
For as he, which is euery where, offered
vp, is one bodye and not many bodyes, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the sacrifice is one. Now, he is one Bishop,
which offered vp the sacrifice, which did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
vs cleane, the same we also now doe offer,
which at that tyme beyng offered, could not
be consumed. Yet this which we doe, is done
in remembrance, of that which was done. For</hi>
(sayth Christ) <hi>doe this in remembrance of
me, we make not an other sacrifice, as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopp
did, but allwayes the same, or rather,
we make the remembrance of that sacrifice.</hi>
Therfor I conclude, that not onelye, it is
readen, emong auncyent fathers, that
Christ his body, may be, and ys, in diuers
places offered, but that the cause therof,
<pb facs="tcp:3078:151"/>
is, for that Christ is but one, in all dayes
and places.<note place="margin">Note the diuersitie of making co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusions, for the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te, or catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>likes faith.</note> And note here the diuersitie
of reasonyng betwixt heretikes and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes.
They say, there be many chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
ergo by all reason ther must be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
bodyes, yf Christes verye bodye be on
the altar in euery church. The catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
saye with Chrisostome, there is but
one Christ: ergo no absurditie there is,
yf he be offered vp this daye, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and euery day, in euery place, in the
whole world. They, by the grosse num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
vp of diuers places, would conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
agaynst vs, that there must be many
bodyes. The Catholikes, by the beleuing
and confessing of one bodye, doe grawnt
that he is in many places, withowt diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
bycause the bodye is but one. They,
begyn at their senses, and according to
the reason of them, they conclude mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of fayth. The Catholikes begyn with
fayth, and afterwardes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde silence
and quyetnes, to their senses.

(bicause he toke vpon hym owr very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)

proposition, ergo either there be no

els they must haue a sacrifice, which they
may offer. Which sacrifice must be of

which is called therevnto, as Aaron was

how can it be saied,<note place="margin">That prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes haue authoritie to offer vp Christ.</note> that the priests

But yow will haue the proufe, to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

with the priest in Calicute: ergo the
priest of Calicute and England be of one
communion and body, so that he which
is cutt of from the one, can not remaine
in the other, and he which agreeth with
the one, agreeth with the other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for,
it is not with vs M. Iuell, as it is with

and if I like not one citie and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie,
I maye go to an other. But euen
as he, which is in the church of England
and a faithfull Catholike, is made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of the Sacraments and praiers, which
be saied in Calicute: so he which is cutt
of, and separated, from any one parte and
membre of the church, he shall not leap
to Calicute, for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, but shall
remaine quyte diuided from the body. So
that as it semeth absurd vnto you (master
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3078:161"/>
myne) that an exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate in England
should communicate with the priest of
Calicute, whether the priest of Calicute
will or nill: so make the like argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
your selfe, that it must seme as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
that he, which communicateth in
England, should not eke communicate
with him which is in Calicute, and then
shall it remaine that if none receiue with
the priest at the aultar in England, yet he
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municateth with the priest of Calicut.</p>
            <p>Of the like vaine of knowleadge co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

               <hi>That the

of oure faith, the himne of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus
Sanctus Sanctus,</hi> the saying of <hi>Agnus,</hi>
be not these so many thinges, in the mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
and transferred in to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion?
how then hath the masse, well nere, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but mans inuention, if your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
haue Christes only institution?
I take it, that M. Iuell did speak so much,
onely to saue his honesty, lest he should
haue semed not to proue that oure mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
was cleane contrary vnto S. Iames, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he would haue borowed this litle
lye, of the ignorance and rudenes of the
<pb facs="tcp:3078:163"/>
most part of his audience. But letting
the cause of oure masse to cease, hath S.
Iames masse, Christ his institution, and
hath it no mans inuention, or very litle
at all? I think, you do not meane, that
he hath nothing els but Christes institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but as oure masse hath, well nere,
nothing els but mans inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so by the
contrary you must meane, S. Iames masse
hath, well nere, nothing els but Christes
institution. whiche I speake for your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage,
bycause it serueth better for
the Catholikes, that S. Iames masse shold
haue nothing els but Christes institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
But now Sir, if S. Iames masse be so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
a thing in your iudgement, why did
not you translate it in to English? It had
ben a greate glory for you, to saye that
you did bring againe, the very order of
the Apostles, and so to proue your saying
true, by the masse which S. Iames hym
selfe vsed. which thing the Catholikes
graunting vnto you (that it is Sainct Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
masse in dede,) with more glory and
surety, you might haue turned the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
masse, owt of the church, and haue
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3078:163"/>
brought in the masse Apostolike. But
yow do not, I think, allow that masse of
Sainct Iames. Certainely then you be a
great dissembler, to speak so many faire
wordes openly of it, and in your hart to
disdaine it priuely. <hi>No mary,</hi> will you
saie, <hi>Sainct Iames in his masse had Christ
his institution.</hi> Lett vs then be tried by S.
Iames masse, whether you iustely repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
the Catholikes masse, and extoll your
communion? In the first beginning of
Sainct Iames masse, franckincense is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
with a prayer thereunto appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
how doth this sauour in yowr no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
tell the truth? Further, in that masse
the priest goeth vp solemnely with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute
praying, the Deacon in the meane
tyme singing. Againe in an other place,
the Deacon biddeth, that none of them,
come in presence of the misteries, which
be yet to lerne the faith, or which can
not praie with the faithfull (such he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
as haue not fullfilled their penaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce)
and he commaundeth the dores to be
kept. But how agreeth this with that law
of yours, which receyueth in, all sortes
<pb facs="tcp:3078:164"/>
without examination, and constrayneth
other, which wold not, to come in and be
present? Then yet againe, in that masse
the priest saieth, <hi>O Lorde allmighty king
of glory &amp;c, receiue of our handes which be
sinners, this per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ume, as thou hast receiued
those thinges which Abel, Noe, Aaron, and
Samuell, and all thy holy ones haue offred
vnto the.</hi> Further yet in that masse, the
priest maketh the signes of the crosse, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the giftes, saying vnto him selfe <hi>(Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
be to God on highe and in earth peace, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men good will)</hi> three times, and after
two other sentences, with bowing him
selfe on this side and that side, he sayeth,
<hi>Magnifie you oure Lorde with me, and lett
vs exalt his name together.</hi> Also there is in
Sainct Iames masse, a secret praier for the
priest, when he entreth with in the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynes.
further after the consecration and
secret praiers, he saieth <hi>Hayle Marie full
of grace, our Lord is with the. &amp;c.</hi> At the last
he breaketh the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated host, holding
the halfe in one, the halfe in his othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
hand. And that which is in the right hand,
he putteth in to the chalice, saying, <hi>The
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3078:164"/>
vnion of the most holy bodye and precious
bloud, of oure Lorde and God and Sauiour
Thesus Christ.</hi> Then the other part, which
was in the left hand, he blesseth, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth,
and putteth it in to chalices, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>it is vnited and sanctified, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the name of the Father and Soun and
the Holy Ghost now and euer.</hi> I leaue owt
manye thinges, as praying vnto Saincts,
and also praying for the dead, oft incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and bowinges, oft lifting vp the
voyce, oft speaking to hym selfe alone,
with incense agayne offred in the later
end of the masse. Which masse truly, yf
it were in english, and sayed accordingly,
it would seme more superstitious and
more full of cerimonies &amp; gestures, then
the masse which they saye to haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng,
well nere, but mennes inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
What memories haue these felowes,
which so frely report of S. Iames masse,
that, which they haue forgotten howe it
standeth? or yf memory faile them not,
what hartes haue they, to lye so lowdly,
and (to the shame of their communion)
to crie owt, that Saint Iames masse, hath
<pb facs="tcp:3078:165"/>
Christ his institution, that the people
which haue neuer reade it, heard it, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
it, might think it were as prety a thing
as the communion is, wheras in dede all
thinges being knowen, it vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth
all their craking and glory: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they haue forgotten that incensing,
blessing, crossing, and soft speaking, and
saluting of oure blessed lady (all which
thinges are vsed in Sainct Iames masse)
doe vtterly disagree fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their positions.
whereof it foloweth, that he speaketh
much against him selfe, which praiseth so
highely that masse, whose rites and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimonies
do turne their religion to vtter
shame and vnworthines. I praye God to
send them all better mindes, and not to
seke their owne glory, by defending of
that, which once they take in hand to
maintayne: but the honour of God and
his truth, which hath and shall continew
for euer. Amen.</p>
