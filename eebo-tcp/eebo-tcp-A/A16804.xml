            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>For that the Scholler sits alwaies crouding at home in his Chamber, eating vp the wealth of his Countrey, with his nose ouer the fire, or lapped vp in a furred Gowne, to defende him from the cold of the winter: and in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer plucking vppe the Flowers that should beautifie the grounde, and so goes he plodding vp and downe, with his eyes bended downewardes, as though he were seeking Pearles among Pybles, or else staring into the Element, as though he watched when the man in the Moone would come out among the starres: And when they come in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, then they fall to reading of one booke or other, sometime they reade the famous acts of gallant Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, such as <hi>Caesar, Alexander, Hanniball, Hector, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles,</hi> (and many other that I leaue to recount) whose victorious deedes they take pleasure to peruse, but the

               <p>Oh good sir, speake not so in discommendation of a Scholler: for why, if he sit at home (as you say) hee is not idle, when hée is reading on his booke, and when hée lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth downwardes, it is because (his hrains beeing busted about studie) hee would not lift vp his eyes, least the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of some vaine thing or other (which the worlde is full of) should carrie away his wittes with a wanton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, from his desire otherwise determined. If hee lift them vp into the Heauens, it is either for heartie repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he makes vnto God for his offences: or else for his grace, to studie no higher causes, then may be graunted with his fauour.</p>
               <p>Nowe, though hée stare, as you tearme, vppon the Moone and Starres, to marke their courses, and by them to discerne and note further causes: it argues not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he watcheth a man in the Moone: For indeede I haue studied somewhat my selfe, and I haue contemplated the Skie, the Sunne, the Moone, and Starres, and this I will say, I haue diuerse times séene a man or two in the Sunne, but in the Moone neuer any: therefore he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But happie it was for him that the day went of his side, though the victorie came not by his eloquence: I graunt hee did great good with his perswasions, for in déede good wordes will moue much: especially, in good causes as that was: besides God is good, and he dooth commonly giue the good victorie: and if he suffer them to be ouerthrowen, it is for a further good he meanes them.</p>
               <p>Nowe therefore, if he had giuen the chiefe glorie to God, and the rest to the valiaunt Captaines and Souldiours: in my iudgement, he had done wel: but to come out with <hi>Plus ego,</hi> me thinkes he played the foole, <hi>Ipse.</hi> Againe, whereas you speake of the great fauour of Schollers, that they doo vnto Souldiours, in setting foorth their famous deedes, I must giue them commendation for their paines, but for Honour, confesse who deserues more Honour, the man that dooth the déede, or he that wrytes of it, when it is done.</p>
               <p>I graunt Learning an ornament, and a necessarie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent vnto a Souldiour. Otherwise in deede, it is harde for him to bée a good Captaine, for by Learning, he knowes vpon what cause it is good to beginne warre: and warre offered, vpon what cause it growes, and if it bee without cause, howe good then is the defence.

               <p>Marrie this I say, the better the grasse, the more is the ground esteemed: and till the grounde beare grasse, what was it to be estéemed? but as barrain, and therfore a thing of little woorth: but when it brings foorth good grasse, then it is called a fatte grounde, good ground, &amp; so forth. Marrie if this grounde lie in a colde corner, it will be long ere the grasse spring, and being come vp, it commonly proues sower, and dooth not so soone nor so well fatten the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, as other that lyeth somewhat néere the sunne. Againe, if the grounde lye verie high, and neere the sunne, then is the Grasse so parched with the heate, that there is little swéetenesse left <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:4933:33"/>
Then must it be kept with watering, to coole the heate, and to refresh the roote of the grasse withall. Againe, the cold grounde must be often dunged, thereby to giue it more heate, and with that warmth, to comfort the roote of the grasse, that it may the better come vp.</p>
               <p>Now I do not denie, but these grounds may bee both indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But the ground is to be considered of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his nature: and if the grounde be of nature to beare grasse, and such common hearbs as will feede Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, it is not to be despised. But if it bee of nature to bring foorth flowers, hearbes, rootes, and fruites, for man himselfe to feede on, is it not to bee made account off, farre aboue the other? Yes surely. And this minde am I of, that at the first Creation, when God had made the Earth, hée gaue it a secret nature to bring forth Fruits, but many sundrie grounds, sundrie kinds of Natures, which according to the same are to be esteemed. God when he had made the grounde, he saide, let vs garnish it with Grasse, Flowers, Hearbs Trees, and Fruits, and so foorth.</p>
               <p>Nowe he thought it not worthie the looking on till it had brought foorth the Fruites, Flowers, and Hearbs, which his heauenly Maiestie had giuen it a secret Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to bring foorth, to beautifie it selfe with all. Which Flowers and fruites, some hee sawe heere, some there, and according to the Fruites, hee estéemed the plotte of grounde whereon they grew: therefore say <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, the ground is to be thought off according to the goodnesse of the fruits, which naturally and not by helpe, it brings foorth. The Trée was before the Fruit, but till such time, as it brought foorth fruite, what was it but a stocke? not worthy the proyning.</p>
               <p>Now there are diuers Trées, which according to the nature of the Soyle wherein they grew, bring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The temperate Soile, bringes foorth fruite, neyther too wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trishe, nor yet too drie, but betwixt both. Nowe, the Trees are to bee thought off, according to their fruites: is not the Cinamon trée to be estéemed aboue the Apple trée? is not the Damson Trée, to be made accoumpt off, aboue the Blackthorne trée? Is not the Pippin tree, to bee estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med aboue the Crabbe trée? The Abr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the Garden of Paradize, there were diuers fruite Trees, and fruites, but one théefe that was to bee honoured aboue all other: for féeding whereof, man was driuen out of the grounde, and forst with toile, to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> get his liuing abroade in the world, with Gods high displeasure.

            <p>Now, all these I answere in their kindes: as all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not of one nature, so neither are all Natures of one disposition: as one loues to be flattered, so other loue to be flatlie dealt withall.

But if fayre woordes bee truly spoken, and by authoritie confirmed: they cannot but be as fréendlie taken, as fully allowed. Wherefore, my woords in their behalfe, shall shew testimony of my true meaning, else let me abide the slander, of such hipocrisie as is hatefull to an honest minde.</p>
            <p>That I haue a Woman to my Mother, I graunt, and am heartily glad off: for surely, he that is not borne of a Woman, wants a péece of a Man, and he that despiseth his Mother, in that shée is a Woman: is to be disdained him selfe, in that he is no Man. are we not commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God, to honour Father and Mother: Is it not written in the holy Scriptures, <hi>Thou shalt honour thy Father, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Some will say, Women are couetous, are not men as handfast? besides liberalitie, of courtesie, bréedes losse of credite.

And if I must graunt, as I cannot choose, that there is none good but God: so indéede I must yeelde, that Woman is ill, and man no better, for if that Woman be ill, howe can man be good, vnto whome ill is so necessarie? But whether may man bee thought worse then ill, that will vse that ill, worse then it should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Some will say, Women are pittifull, howe is that knowne? by lookes and speeches: men are more: which is showen, as well in words of mouth, as writing.</p>
            <p>Some will say, a Woman is a wo to man, who put in that to, did it of his owne authoritie, and therefore it is not to be allowed.</p>
            <p>For consider right of the word, and the to is as well left out, as the worde falsely written, for indéede it ought to be written Woman, not Woman, for that shée dooth woo Man with her Uertues, who wedde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Now a Woman hauing not so déepe a capacitie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue or iudge of the conditions of man, is onely wedded to his will: which thing how vaine it is, is seene when it is bent to little vertue.</p>

But how wise is the man, that hath his wittes so cosened? to take one thing for another? They be Lunaticke, or in Loue, that worshippe such Idols.

In the Cheese shée is a Mouse: why? shée sette the Curdes together, should shée not taste the meate. In the bakehouse she is a Bée, for her busie stirring about. Yet her sting is but her tongue, that hurts no body, except shée be troubled: then allowe the Bée her Hiue, and let her rest. In the Buttrie shée is a Sprite, but shée dooth no hurt, but fray a Mouse from the bread, and a theefe from the Cubborde.

            <p>But well, if it were not for making women to be worse then they would be, I would tell them howe they might tear me men in sundrie places, both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the house.

            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:4933:46"/>It were but a follie, to fill my Booke with examples, of this Woman for constancie, and that for fidelitie, an other for Huswiferie, and the other Woman, for worthie wit. Let this suffice in braefe, there is in sickenesse no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comfort, in health no better companion, to a wise man, then a wittie woman.</p>
            <p>Nowe for wise women, I thinke his should shew him selfe a verie vnwise man that woulde wish for such a one. I remember a prettie speech, once vttered by a verie wise man: when a man (as it séemed) not verie wise, came to him for his counsaile, what he might doo, to come by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Iewell, that was stollen from him out of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and (hauing told his losse) before he would heare of his aduise. Sir (quoth he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> were I not best to go to a wise wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Yes marry (quoth hée) if you knewe where any such were. Meaning that they were so hard to hit on, that it were but follie to secke them. Nowe what pittie it is to sée some men so vnwise, to thinke such wisedome in any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: after he had lost his Iewell if hee would e haue lookt into himselfe, and found his owne follie, before hee had seught such wisedome in a woman: hee should haue seene that it were more wisdome for a man, to keepe that he hath warely, then vnwisely to runne to a woman, to seeke for wit how to finde it againe.</p>
            <p>But I will stand no more vpon this poynt, let it suffice that it is wisedome for a man to take heede, that a Woman be not wiser then himselfe: and howe wise so euer he bee, to count them no fooles. For in déede, as the common Prouerbe is, The wit of a Woman is a great matter: and true, when a man with all his wisedome, is sometime to learne wit of her.</p>
            <p>In mine opinion, I heard a verie wise speech of a verie wittie Woman, touching the wisedome (if any) that ought to bee in a Woman. In a Mayde, to take care in choyse of a Husbande: in a marryed woman, to loue
<pb facs="tcp:4933:47"/>
none but her husband: in a widow, to prouide for her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: in an old woman, to haue care of her end.</p>
            <p>Now for men, if a Batcheler take heed what wife hée takes, and hauing taken a wife, to loue no other woman: a Widdower, to looke for his children, before a newe wife, and an olde man his graue: is it amisse? no I warrant yee. Nowe men must bee wise, in caring for Women, and themselues to, and Women no wyser, then in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for such men as care for them. But if a man bée so vnwise to trouble a Womans wit to care for him? howe wise is hee? and what a wit hath shoe. Confesse you that haue guiltie consciences, and learne to bee wise: and thinke this sufficient commendation for a Woman, if shee bee a Uirgin for chastitie, with Uirginitie vertuous, of condition courteous, and true of loue: such a Woman ought to bee, and if such they be not, pray for them as I dee, and such as are, honour them as worthie: and for their sakes, all other whatsoeuer they bee, iudge the best till you see the contrarie: and where you knowe it, shake your heade and say nothing: but it is pittie, God hath done his part in her, God amend her: put the fault in pride, and not in her. And you shall fee such a chaunge, that it was not shee, no forsooth (as little children say) it was the Bulbegger.</p>
            <p>They say nowe, the worlde is towardes the last yeare, and men towarde theyr last wittes: then let Women bee towardes their first Wisedome. And if they shew but little Wisedome: yet let that haue such commendation, that they may bee encouraged, to continue and encrease the same. For surely (well considered) a man can not do honour to a more worthie person, then a Woman. Is it not an abuse in a man to disprayse his friende? What greater friend to a man, then a Woman? who can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend that he loues? except he dissemble sore? hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie is as ill as heresie. What can a man loue more
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4933:47"/>
then a Woman? what, such loue as betwixt them? Marrie some will say, they must loue déerely, or hate deadly. God forbidde, that anie man should bée out of charitie: I would thinke it a harde matter to hate a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Yet since it is possible to doo little better: I thinke it wisdome to conceale it, for there is nothing gotten by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing it.</p>
            <p>Well, not to séeme tedious, let me drawe towards an ende: thinke well of as many as you may, loue whome you haue cause, hate none, whatsoeuer you thinke, say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their dishonour, least you growe in their vtter dislyking: and then your roome as good as your company. When you seeke for fauonr, take a flowte with you: I maruaile you can away so long with a Womans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>c.</p>
            <p>But well, to anoyde the frumpes, flowtes, skowles, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainefull spéeches, quippes, tauntes, and angrie couute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces, that Women will soone bestow, where they sée cause, doo this: if you cannot loue, yet doo not loath: if you will not honour, yet doo not hate: if your conscience let you not, commend them, yet let your courtesie not let you doo the contrarie. Remember your Mother, forget not your friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> offend not your Mistresse, and make much of your selfe: If you like my counsaile, followe it: if not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine it not: if you loue a Woman, remember mée: if you care for none, wee will none of vs trouble you: if wee doo it, it is agaynst our willes. But who is he that loues not a Woman? and wherefore then will any looke awrie vpon mée? I knowe not, and shall I say I care not? Well, let it goe, since it is not, I doo all for the best, and I trust the best will take it so: as for the rest, there lyes neither life nor death vpon a looke, and therefore hoping the best, I will not doubt the contrarie. And if men be as well contented with me for this prayse of Women, as I am determined to content them, with the like of them
<pb facs="tcp:4933:48"/>
héereafter: if will be not froward, and Wit faile me not, I trust the Ace of Diamonds will go to the stocke, and cue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man will be pleased. In the meane time aboute some better worke, then I meane to make boast of: I must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend my Haruest, ere I fall to Hawking.</p>
            <p>Thus if I said anie thing amisse, God forgiue mée: if I haue sayde well, God bée thanked, take it among you: if I haue said truly, it is not to be blamed, if otherwise, I haue but spoken mine opinion, which I hope to see fully appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And so sorie, if I haue sayd that the wise will mistike, and glad if I haue written, that the good will take well. I conclude of a suddaine, with this short sentence, <hi>Hic &amp; haec homo, Considera quid mulier,</hi> Like of them as you list, loue whom you can: when you séeke for fauour. God send you good fortune. And so fare you well.</p>
