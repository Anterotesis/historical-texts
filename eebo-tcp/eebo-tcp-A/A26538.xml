            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AESOP,</hi> it ſeems, has been a little diſturb'd of late, and it has been argu'd <hi>Pro &amp; Con,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> whether his Indiſpoſition was the effect of <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> Waters, or Company. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has abſolv'd the Waters, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd the Company, which has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd 'em in their own Juſtification to ſend him to <hi>Bedlam</hi> to have his own
<pb facs="tcp:65487:3"/>
Brains ſet right, for endeavouring to rectifie theirs.</p>
            <p>Since his Retirement two more have ſtarted up from <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>White-Hall,</hi> that, like the two <hi>Demetrius</hi>'s in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> need only be ſeen to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Impoſture. But to avoid the Fate of their Predeceſſor of <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> they have taken Meaſures very different from his, and to ſave Dr. <hi>Ty—n</hi> the trouble of Purging their Brains, have agreed to carry none about 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe comes yet another; whether with better Title than the former, is a queſtion, <hi>Reader,</hi> we leave thee to decide. Only I ſhall take the liberty to give thee ſome Hints,
<pb facs="tcp:65487:3"/>
for the better Information of thy Judgment. Firſt then as to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it has reſemblance enough to old <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s (or the Picture of him, at leaſt, at <hi>Planudes,</hi> and others, have drawn it) that had he left any Legitimate Iſſue behind him, Ours might very well plead his Figure in evidence of his Deſcent from the old <hi>Beau</hi> of <hi>Samos;</hi> and the Poſture and Condition of their Intellects, make out the Relation betwixt him and the <hi>Bully</hi> of <hi>Tunbridge.</hi> For this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes himſelf out of his Wits when he writ, and t'other, by univerſal Conſent, mad to Write what he writ.</p>
            <p>But let me whiſper one thing in thy Ear, upon condition of ſecreſy, if thou wilt give me thy Word and
<pb facs="tcp:65487:4"/>
Honour not to diſcloſe it to any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; I'll aſſure thee they were both Mad, and ſo much the fitter for the Task they have undertaken. For who the De—l but a Madman would venture to write Truth at this time of Day? To deal frankly, the Old Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low before 'em was much ſuch another ſort of Spark. He either had, or thought he had Wit, which is much at one to an Author, and could never leave ſhewing his Brains, till a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Blockheads knockt 'em out. He took his Hint from the Women of his Time, who did as they do now, every one that cou'd be convinc'd by her Glaſs, that ſhe was no Beauty, ſet up for a Wit; and if ſhe cou'd not pleaſe People with her Face, cou'd vex 'em with her Tongue, which was equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb facs="tcp:65487:4"/>
as to point of Self-ſatisfaction. For let either Vanity, or Malice be gratified, and we are well enough. But as I was ſaying, <hi>Aeſop</hi> imitated the Women in that Piece of Cunning; for 'tis apparent he cou'd not the Men, for they haven't learnt that Craft yet to Piece out the Defects of their Perſons with a Superfluity of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding. But e'ery Hump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back't, Hard-fac'd Scarecrow is dreſs'd up in a Lac'd-Coat, and a Long Wig, to ſet off it's Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and make it more gloriouſly Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous; and the fine empty Thing, that Nature made, as the <hi>Chineſe</hi> do their Bawbles, for the Ornament of a Drawing-Room, is perpetually endeavouring to ſqueeze it ſelf into the Preſs, and labouring in <hi>Dull
<pb facs="tcp:65487:5"/>
Madrigal,</hi> or <hi>Scurvy Lampoon,</hi> to expoſe it's own want of Wit, and it's Friend's, and not content with the Reputation of a Fool amongst its Acquaintance, must publiſh it in Print to the World.</p>
            <p>But what's all this, <hi>Reader,</hi> to thee and I, that be ſure have more Wit? Theſe <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s are Perillous Bold Fellows, and have Plaguy Tongues: But what of that? Let the Beast that is gall'd, wince; and let thee and I laugh to ſee 'em kick and fling like <hi>Ralpho</hi>'s Aſs with a Thiſtle under his Tail, 'tis nothing to us, that <hi>have</hi> (as I ſaid before) more Wit, than to come within the reach of one's Tongue, or t'others Heels: And ſo I take my <hi>leave</hi> of thee.</p>
