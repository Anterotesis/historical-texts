            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

matriculated, and besides
his initiation in the Arts and

be no Science of her self, but as
she is subservient to another,

these studies, he hath sucked
the pure milke of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

and such a one will be rather
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107053:13"/>
confirmed, than shaken in
the tenets of his Faith, when
he seeth the sundry fond

have crept into the solemne
service of God, since the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive

of the Roman Church is
worse than her positions, so
that I have knowne some,
who were wrought upon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

by her Ceremonies, which
in some places are so mimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
and set forth in such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
postures, that it may
be not improperly sayd,
whereas Religion should go
array'd in a grave Matron-like
habit, they have clad
her rather like a wanton

Such a one, I meane he that
is well instructed in his own
Religion, may passe under
the torrid Zone, and not bee
Sun-burnt, if he carry this
bon-grace about him, or
like the River Danube which
scornes to mingle with the

though they run both in one
Channell, or like Arethusa,
which Travelleth many
hundred miles through the

at her journeys end issueth
out fresh againe, without the

may passe and repasse

to find out the Longitude

               <p>Lastly that hee seriously
contemplate within himself,
how the eyes of all the

who hath passed his minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

Tongues, one may attaine to
speake them to very good

               <p>Indeed some of riper

spirit hath a very great
advantage in attaining the
French, or indeed any other

not to force any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glicismes
upon the French
Tongue, that is certaine vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Phrases, Proverbs, and
Complements, which are
peculiar to the English, and
not vendible or used in
French, as I heard of one
that could not forbeare a
great while to salute his
Land-Lord by bon matin:
Another would be alwayes
complaining at play of his

when at the racket court he

               <p>He must alwayes have a

               <p>It were very requisit to

description of all
places, through which hee
passeth; and I think Bertius,
or the Epitome of Ortelius,
which are small and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
would bee the best.
At his first comming to any
Citie he should repaire to
the chief Church (if not I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous)
to offer up his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

               <p>Being come to France, his

and there let him apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
seriously to gaine the
practicall knowledge of the

Language, and for the time
hoc agere. This hee may do
with more advantage, if hee
repaires sometimes to the
Courts of Pleading, and to
the Publique Schooles; For in
France they presently fall
from the Latine, to dispute
in the vulgar tongue: So
that it were not amisse for
him to spend some time in
the New Academy; erected
lastly by the French Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
in Richelieu, where all
the Sciences are read in the

done of purpose to refine,
and enrich the Language.</p>
               <p>Some have used it as a

to have some ancient
Nunne for a Divota, with

whom hee may chat at the

speake a quaint Dialect, and
besides they have most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
all the Newes that
passe, and they will enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
discours till one bee
weary, if hee bestow on
them now and then some
small bagatels, as English
Gloves or Knifs, or Ribands;
and before hee go over, hee
must furnish himselfe with
such small curiosities; but
this I dare not advise him to,
in regard the Hazard one
way may bee greater, than
the Advantage the other way.</p>
               <p>In this retirement he must

to read the History of the

there are words to

with any great businesse, hee

every one will stand
him in 50 pounds a piece per

expences, he cannot allow
himselfe lesse than 300 l. I
include herein all sorts of
exercises, his Riding, Dancing,
Fencing, the Racket, Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hire,
with other casuall
charges, together with his
Apparell, which if it bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shionable,

               <p>The time that he spends

to improve himselfe
in the exercises afore-said,
for there the choycest Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are of any part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome.
Hee must apply
himselfe also to know the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion

observe the Person and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of the Prince, enquire
of the greatest Noble-men,

should do well to reade

thereon, for though there be
many triviall passages in

him, abroad, by which hee
meanes pieces of gold: Yet
too great a number of such
Friends, is an encomber and

make his Iourney all along

And he that loades himselfe

when he may carry it about

ease, in a small piece of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
I meane a Letter of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,

               <p>In Spaine hee must bee

will gaine mightily

the chiefest congnisance of a
Gentleman, which joyned with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107053:35"/>
discretion, can only Travaile
all the World over without a
Passeport, and of all sorts of
Friends, he is the cheapest
who is got by Courtesie, and
Complement only: Moreover
a respectfull and humble ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
is a mighty advantage
to gaine Intelligence and
Knowledge; It is the Key
that opens the breash, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks
the heart of any one:
He that looked downeward,
saw the Stars in the water,
but he who looked only upward
could not see the water in

is much more to bee got
by Humility than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>One thing I would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him from, which is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107053:35"/>
from the excessive commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
and magnifyng of his
own Countrey; for it is too
much observed, that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
suffer themselves to be
too mvch transported with
this subject, to undervalue
and vilifie other Countreys,
for which I have heard them
often censured. The Earth is
the Lords, and all the
corners thereof, he ereated the
Mountaines of Wales, as
well as the Wiles of Kent,
the rugged Alpes, as well as
the Fertile plaines of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnia,
the boggy fennes of
Frizeland, as well as the
daintiest Valleys in France;
and to inveigh against, or
deride a Countrey for the
barrenesse thereof, is tacit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107053:36"/>
to taxe God Almighty
of Improvidence or Partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And it had beene
wished, some had beene
more temperate in this
theme at their being in the
Spanish Court, in the yeare
1623. For my part, as
the Great Philosopher holds
it for a maxime, that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taignous
people, are the most
pious; so are they observed to
be the hardiest, as also the
barrener a Countrey is, the
more Masculine and Warlike
the spirits of the Inhabitants
are, having as it were more
of men in them; Witnesse
the Scythian and Goth, and
other rough-hewen hungry
Nations, which so often
over-ranne Italy, for all her
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107053:36"/>
Policy and Learning; and
herein Nature may seeme to

               <p>Having passed the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reneys
hee shall palpably

and Canons, the other to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
and Schoole Divinity;
the one is Creatura sine Praete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito

too much of both; the one
is a Prometheus, the other an

and forgets quickly, the

a judgement more abstruce
and better fixed, &amp; in se re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditum;
the one will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
the weightiest affaires
as hee walke along in the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107053:38"/>
streets, or at meales, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the least occasion
of businesse will retire so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
to a room, and if a
Fly chance to hum about
him, it will discompose his
thoughts, and puzzle him:
It is a kind of sicknesse for a
Frenchman to keep a Secret
long, and all the drugs of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt
cannot get it out of a
Spaniard.</p>
               <p>The French capacity,
though it apprehend and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unto the Tenets of
Faith, yet he resteth not
there, but examines them by
his owne reason, debates the
businesse pro &amp; contra, and
so is often gravelled upon the
quick sands of his own brain,
the Spaniard cleane contrary
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107053:38"/>
by an implicite Faith and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Obedience beleeves the
Canons and Determination of
the Church, and presently
subjects his Understanding
thereunto, he sets bounds to
all his Wisdome and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and labours to avoyd
all Speculation thereon, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
through the frailty of
his Intellectuals, to fall into
some Error.</p>
               <p>Go to their Garb and Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
the one weares long

the other close and warm,
so that although the Sun
should dart down his rayes
like lances upon him, yet he
could not bee brought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
one button of his dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107053:39"/>
the one goes gay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
the other underneath; the
one weares his Cloake long,
the other short; so, that one
might give him a Suppositor

his Doublet first, the other
last; the Frenchman butto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
alwayes down-ward, the
Spaniard upward; the one
goes high-heeled, the other
low and flat, yet looks as high
as the other; the one cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a Combe and Looking-glasse
in his pocket, the other
a piece of bayes to wipe off
the dust of his shooes: And
if the one hath a Fancy to
stars his mustachos, the other
hath a leather bigothero to lye
upon them all night; the first
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107053:39"/>
thing the one pawns, being in
necessity, is his Shirt, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Cloak, and so by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
his Cassoke goes off,
and then his Doublet; the
one cares more for the Back,
and outward appearance, the
other prefers the Belly; the
one is constant in his fashion,
for the other 'tis impossible
to put him in a constant kind
of Habit;
<q>â€”You may as soone

               </p>
               <p>Go to their Diet, the one
drinkes Watered Wine, the
other Wine watered; the one
begins his repast, where the
other ends; the one begins
with a Sallet, and light meat,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107053:40"/>
the other concludeth his
repast so; the one begins
with his boyled, the other
with his roast; the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
will Eate and Talke, and
Sing sometimes, and so his
Teeth and his Tongue go oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
together, the Spaniards
Teeth only walk, and fals
closely to it with as little
noyse and as solemnly as if
he were at Masse.</p>
               <p>Go to their Gate, the
Frenchman walks fast, (as if
he had a Sergeant always
at his heeles,) the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
slowly, as if hee were
newly come out of some
quartan Ague; the French
go up and down the streets
confusedly in clusters, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
if they be above three,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107053:40"/>
they go two by two, as if
they were going a Procession;
the French Laquays march
behind, the Spaniards before;
the one beckens upon you
with his hand cast upward,
the other downward; the
Frenchman will not stick to
pull out a Peare or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing out of his pocket,
and eate it as he goes along
the street, the Spaniard will
starve rather than do so, and
would never forgive himselfe,
if he should commit such a
rudenesse; the Frenchman if
he spies a Lady of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
he will make
boldly towards her, salute
her with a kisse, and offer to
Vsher her by the hand or
arme, the Spaniard upon such
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107053:41"/>
an encounter, useth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyle
backward, with his
hands hid under his Cloack,
and for to touch or kisse her,
he holds it a rudenesse beyond
all barbarisme, a kind of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
the Frenchmen is
best and most proper on
Horseback, the Spaniard a
foot; the one is good for
the Onset, the other for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait;
the one like the Wind
in the Fable, is full of ruffling
fury, the other like the Sun,
when they went to try their
strength upon the Passengers
Cloake. The one takes the
ball before the bound, A la vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,
the other stayeth for the
fall; the one shuffleth the
Cards better, the other playes
his game more cunningly; your
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107053:41"/>
French-man is much the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
Duellist, for when hee
goeth to the Field, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
puts off his doublet
and opens his breast; the
Spaniard cleane contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
his shirt, hath his dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet
quilted, his coat of
maile, his cassock, and
strives to make himselfe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable.</p>
               <p>Go to their Tune, the one
delights in the Ionique, the
other altogether in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique.</p>
               <p>Go to their Speech, the one
Speakes oft, the other seldome;
the one Fast, the other slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
the one mangleth, cuts off,
and eates many Letters, the
other pronounceth all; the one
contracts and enchaines his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107053:42"/>
words, and speakes pressingly
and short, the other delights
in long breathed Accents,
which he prolates with such
pauses, that before he be at
the period of his Sentences,
one might reach a Second
thought: The ones Mind
and Tongue go commonly
together, (and the first comes
sometimes in the arreare) the

they seldome or never meet

               <p>In sine Mercury swayeth

the true cause of this strange

Nations, which
bringeth with it such mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
into the World; and
keepes Christendome in a

the Ill Spirit bee the

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107053:43"/>
being the Father and fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of all discord and hatred
(it being also part of the
Turkes letany, that warres
should continue still betweene
these two potent Nations) to
hinder the happy fruit that
might grow out of their V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
yet neverthelesse it
must bee thought that hee
cannot shed this poyson, and
sow these cursed tares, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
hee had some grounds
to work his designe upon.</p>
               <p>And to fly to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
termes of Sympathy and 
Antipathy, I know it is the 
common refuge of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
when being not able to
conceive the true reason of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Actions and Passions in
divers things, they fly to inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107053:44"/>
generality, and very
often to these inexplicable
termes of Sympathy and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy.</p>
               <p>Some as Doctor Garcia,
 and other Philosophicall
Authors, attribute this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the qualities of the
clymes and influences of the
Stars, which are known to beare
sway over all Sublunary bodies,
insomuch that the position of
the Heavens; and Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which hang over Spaine, 
being of a different vertue and
operation to that of France, 
the temper and humours of the
Natives of the one, ought to
bee accordingly disagreeing
with the other.</p>
               <p>An opinion which may
gaine credit and strength from
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107053:44"/>
the authority of the famous
 Hippocrates, who in his Book
of Ayre, Water, and Climes,
affirmeth that the diversity of
Constellations, cause a diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Inclinations, of humors
and complexions; and make
the bodies whereupon they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
to receive sundry sorts of
impressions. Which reason
may have much apparance of
truth, if one consider the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
fancies of these two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as it hath reference to the
Predominant Constellations,
which have the vogue, and
qualifie the Seasons amongst
them.</p>
               <p>For then when the heate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
in Spaine, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
thereof lasteth a long time
without intension, or remission,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107053:45"/>
or any considerable change, the
humour of the Spaniard is just
so, for if he resolves once upon
a thing, he perseveres, he pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and dwels constantly upon
it, without wavering from his
first deliberation; it being
one of his prime axiomes, that
 Deliberandum est diu, quod
statuendum est semel.</p>
               <p>It is farre otherwise in
France, for be it Sommer or
 Winter, Autumne orSpring,neither the cold nor heate, nor
serenity of Ayre continueth
nere so long, without a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
vicissitude and change; so
that it may be truly said there
in the morning,
<q>Nescis quid serus Vesper
trahat.</q>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:107053:45"/>
Therefore it being granted that
all Elementary bodies depend
upon the motion and vertue of
the Heavenly; the people of
France must of necessity par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the inconstancy of the
Clime, both in their passions
and dispositions.</p>
               <p>But this reason though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
enough, resolves not the
question to the full; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we should acknowledge,
that the Celestiall bodies by
their influxions, do domineere
over Sublunary creatures, and
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>osse and tumble the humours
and the masse of bloud, as they
list; it cannot be said, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
that this vertue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to those actions that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
immediatly upon the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
empire of the Will, with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107053:46"/>
the other faculties and powers
of the soule, which are meerely
Spirituall, as Love and Hatred,
with the like.</p>
               <p>They that dispute thus, have
much reason on their side, yet if
we consider well the order and
method that our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Wils do use in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of their actions, we shal
find, that the influence of the
Heavenly bodies must have
something to do therein, though
indirectly and accidentally:
for all Terrestriall creatures
by a graduall kind of subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
being governed by the
Heavenly, it must needs follow
that whatsoever is naturall in
man, as the organs of the body,
and all the senses must feele the
power of their influence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:107053:46"/>
Now is the Soule so united
and depends so farre upon the
senses, that she cannot produce
any act, unlesse they ministeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
concurre and contribute
thereunto, by presenting the
matter to her, which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibles
species: Whence it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
comes to passe, that in
regard of this straight league
and bond, which is betweene
them, she partakes somewhat,
and yealds to that dominion,
which the Starres have over
the sensuall appetite, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Will, are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possed
off, and incited (I will
not say forced) by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes.</p>
               <p>And as that famous Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sard, 
the oldest of the Trisme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisti, did hold, that the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107053:47"/>
which are affixed to
every Spheare, doe worke
through the organs of the body
upon the faculties of the mind,
(an opinion almost as old as
the World it selfe) so it may
be said more truly, that by the
sensuall appetite, by the frailty
and depravation of the will, the
Heavenly bodies worke very
farre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>upon the Spirituall Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and passions of the Soule;
and affect them diversly,
though by accident and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
as I said before. The
position therefore of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and Asterismes, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
the Spanish Clime, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
different in their vertue
and operations to them of
France, the Minds and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of both People, must by a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107053:47"/>
necessary consequence bee also
different.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding that
this assertion be true, yet it
doth not follow, that the
Influxions of the Starres and
diversity of Climes, are the
sole cause of this Antipathy
and Aversenesse, for there are
many Nations which live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
farre more distant and
differing Climes, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affect
not one another in that
degree, therefore there must
be some other concurring
Accidents and extraordinary
motive of this evill.</p>
               <p>I reade it upon record in
the Spanish Annales, that
Lewis the eleventh desiring a
personall Conference with
the King of Castile, they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107053:48"/>
both met upon the borders,
the Spaniards came full of
Iewels and Gold Chaines
and richely apparelled:
Lewis, though otherwise, a
wise and gallant Prince, yet
had he an humor of his own,
to weare in his hat a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daille
of Lead, which he did
at this enterview, nor were
his attendants, but Regis ad
Exemplum<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but meanely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutred;
which made the
Spaniards despise them, and
make disdainefull Libels of
them, which broake out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
into much contempt
and disaffection, which came
to bee aggravated more and
more.</p>
               <p>And if we say that the
Devill made use of this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107053:48"/>
to engender that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Hatred, which raignes
between these two Nations,
it would not bee much from
the purpose, for the least ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in the World is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for him to iufuse his venom
where he finds hearts never so
little disposed to receive it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by naturall or contingent
causes.</p>
               <p>Adde hereunto the vast
extent of greatnesse the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
is come to within these
Sixe score yeares, by his sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
new acquest, which fils
the French full of jealousies,
of emulation, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of feare; and 'tis an old
Aphorisme, Oderunt omnes,
quem metuunt.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, another
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107053:49"/>
concurring motive may be,
that there passe usually o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Pyreneys, from
Gascoigne and Bearne great
numbers of poore French
tatterdimallians, being as it
were the Scumme of the
Countrey, which do all
the fordid and abject of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
to make a purse of
money, whereof Spaine
is fuller than France<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> from
Spaine also there come to
France many poore Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
to bee cured of the
Kings Evill; the common
people of both Nations
measuring the whole by

to be such, it must needs
breed mutuall apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of disdaine and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107053:49"/>
between them; so that

               <p>ANd now being come
from France to Spaine,
make accoump for matter of
fertility of soyle, that you are
come from Gods blessing, to the
warme Sun, who is somewhat
too liberall of his beames
here; which makes the
ground more barren, and
consequently to be a kind of
Wildernesse in comparison
of France, if you respect the
number of People, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Townes, Hamlets,
and Houses: for about the
the third part of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
of Spaine is made
up of huge craggie Hils and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107053:50"/>
Mountaines, amongst which
one shall feele in some places
more difference in point of
temper of heat and cold in
the ayre, then 'wixt Winter
and Sommer under other
Climes. But where Spaine
hath water and Valleis there
she is extraordinarily fruitfull
such blessings humility carieth
alwayes with her. So that
Spaine yeeldeth to none of
her neighbours in perfection
of any thing, but only in
Plenty; which I beleeve was
the ground of a Proverbe
they have amongst them,
No ay cosa mala en Espana,
sino lo que habla, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ill in Spaine, but that
which speakes: And did
Spaine excell in Plenty, as she
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107053:51"/>
doth in perfection of what she
produceth, specially did she
abound in Corne, whereof
she hath not enough for the
fortieth mouth, as also had
she Men enough whereof,
besides the Warres, so many
Colonies draine her, shee
would prove formidable to
all her Neighbours.</p>
               <p>But let the French glory
never so much of their
Country as being the richest
embroidery of Nature upon
Earth, yet the Spaniard drinks
better Wine, eates better
Fruits, weares finer Cloth,
hath a better Sword by his
side, and is better Mounted
than he.</p>
               <p>Being entred Spaine, he
must take heed of Posting in
that hot Countrey in the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107053:51"/>
Summer time, for it may
stirre the masse of bloud too
much. When hee comes to
Madrid (for I know no other
place secure enough for a
Protestant Gentleman to
live in, by reason of the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of our Ambassador)
he may take new Spanish ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
for I presume he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
his French when he
forsooke Paris: There hee
shall find the King constant
all the Seasons of the yeare
in the midst of his Kingdom,
as the heart in the body, or the
Sun in the Firmament, whence
the one giveth vigor to the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
world, th' other to the great
in equall proportion. And the
first thing he must fall to, is
Language, which hee shall
find far more easie than the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107053:52"/>
French, for in point of crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bednesse
there is as much
difference betweene the

Logique and Philosophy, the

               <p>There was a Spanish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
who had a fancy that
Spanish, Italian, and French,
were spoken in Paradise, that
God Almighty commanded
in Spanish, the Tempter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
in Italian, and Adam
begged pardon in French.</p>
               <p>I presume by the helpe of
his Governour he hath made
an introduction into the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
tongue before hee left
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107053:52"/>
France, so that in one Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and Winter he may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come to speake it discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
and to good purpose;
being in my judgement the
easiest of all Languages, by
reason of the openesse, and
fulnesse of pronunciation,
the agreement 'twixt the
Tongue and the Text, and the
freedome from Apostrophes,
which are the knots of a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
as also for the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
it hath with the Latine,
for the Spanish is nought else
but mere Latine, take a few
Morisco words away, which
are easily distinguished by
their gutturall prounciation,
and these excepted, it appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acheth
nearer &amp; resembleth
the Latine more than Italian,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107053:53"/>
her eldest Daughter, for I
have beaten my braines to
make one Sentence good I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian
and congruous Latin,
but could never do it, but in
Spanish it is very feasable, as
for Example, in this Stanza,
<q>
                     <l>Infausta Grecia tu paris Gentes,</l>
                     <l>Lubricas, sodomiticas, dolosas,</l>
                     <l>Machinando fraudes cautelosas,</l>
                     <l>Ruinando animas innocentes, &amp;c.</l>
                  </q>
which is Latin good enough,
and yet is it vulgar Spanish,
intelligible by every Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian.</p>
               <p>Mariana and Acosta, are
the most authentique Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
of Spaine, and Alvares

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107053:53"/>
entertainment for Verse, and
Guevara for pure Prose: Nor
shall he be distracted with
that confusion of Authors,
as in France, and else where,
for the Spaniard writes seldom
but soundly, and in a quite
differing straine from other
Nations of Christendome,
savouring rather of an Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
fancy, which argues that
the Moore did much mingle
with him.</p>
               <p>About the fall of the leafe
it were not amisse to make a
journey to South Spaine, to
see Sevill, and the Contrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of the Constitutions thereof,
which is accounted the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Mystery in the Spanish

Government, but he must
shew himself neither too bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,

And if he be there at the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall

which usually commeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

such a Grandeza, that the

like, nor the Gran Signior at
this day.</p>
               <p>There he may converse
with Marchants, and their
conversation is much to bee
valued, for many of them are
very gentile and knowing
men in the affaires of the

sojourne and actuall negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
and processes in the
Countrey: and in a short
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107053:54"/>
time, one may suck out of
them, what they have been
many yeares a gathering:
And very materiall it is to
know here, as every where
else, what commodities the
Countrey affoordeth most
usefull for us, either for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
or pleasure: And what
English commodities are
there in greatest request, and
what proportions the Market
usually beareth, for in the
commutative part of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Mercantile affaires,
lieth the most usefull part of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
'twixt Countrey and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;

better in Italy, where
the Prince holdeth it no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement

and put in his stake with the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107053:55"/>
Marchant: So that the old
Clodian Law is now of no
force at all amongst them.</p>
               <p>From South Spaine he may
returne by Granada, Murcia
and Valencia, and so to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona,
and then take the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
for Italy, for there are
divers Fleets passe in the

and crosse the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean
to Genoa. And it is
not amisse to see something
by Sea, and to embarque in a
Fleet of Gallies will much
adde to ones experience, and
knowledge in Sea affaires,
and in the Art of Navigation
which is more usefull and
important for Englishmen,
and indeed for all Islanders,
than others, because their

a thing of wonder, an Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility

in an impossibility, a

hath often set upon her skirts

wherein he went so farr that
he took from her Venus joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which she had long pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed,
and was the sole
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107053:58"/>
Crown she ever wore. But
if one in Story observes the
cours of her actions, he shall
find that she hath subsisted
thus long as much by Policy
as Armes, as much by reach
of Wit, and advantage of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as by open strength, it

               <p>Here one shall find the

yet some would maintaine
(though I do not) that the

               <p>Having observed in the

most remarquable (and there

is to see how in so small an

there should bee so many

               <p>How the state of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
 running from the Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhene

is sited in Italy, as France is in Europe, in the midst, and so fittest to embroyle or preserve
in peace, to disunite or conjoyne
the forces of their neighbours,
and so most proper to be Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
of all quarrels.</p>
               <p>How the Dominions of

But cleane contrary

He must observe the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the power of Princes,
how the Cavalry of France,
the Infantery of Spaine, and
the English Ships, leagued
together, are fittest to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
the World, to pull out
the Ottoman Tyrant out of

the very armes of his fifteen

               <p>How the power of the
North-East part of the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean
World is balanced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Dane, the Swede,
and the Pole, &amp;c. And the
rest between great Britaine,
France, and Spaine; as for
Germany and Italy, their
power being divided 'twixt
so many, they serve only to
balance themselves, who if
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107053:62"/>
they had one absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
a piece, would prove
terrible to all the rest.</p>
               <p>Spaine in point of treasure
hath the advantage of them al,
She hath a Veteran Army al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
afoot; but She is thinne
peopled, She hath many Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
to supply, which lye squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
up and down in disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
unsociable distances,
Her people are disaffected by
most nations, and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
with some; She wants
bread, She hath bold accessible
coasts, and Her West Indy
Fleet, besides the length of the
passage, and incertainty of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall,
is subject to casualties
of Sea, and danger of interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
by Enemies: And if
England should breake out
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107053:62"/>
with Her in good earnest into
acts of hostility, those Islands,
which the English have peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,
colonized, and fortified
lately (being warned by Saint
Christopher) in the carrere to
Her mines, would be found to
be no small disadvantage to
Her.</p>
               <p>France swarmes with men,
and now (more than ever)
with Soldiers, She is a body
well compacted (though often
subject to Convulsions, and
high fits of Feavers, the bloud
gathering up by an unequall
diffusion into the upper parts)
and it is no small advantage to
Her, that Her forme is circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
so that one part may quickly
run, to succour the other: She
abounds with Corne, and being
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107053:63"/>
the thorough fare of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
She can never want
money; She hath those three
things which the Spaniard
said would make Her eternall,
viz. Rome, the Sea, and
Counsell; for She hath the
the Pope for Her friend (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had his breeding in Her
twenty years together) Shee
hath Holland for Her Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
and Richelieu for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell;
who since he sate at the
helme, hath succeeded in every
attempt, with that monstrous
cours of Felicity: They of the
Religion, are now Town-lesse,
and Arme-lesse, and so are Her
greatest Peeres most of them
out of Office and Provinciall
command. So that if one would
go to the intrinsique value of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107053:63"/>
things, France will not want
much in weight of the vast
unweldy bulk, and disjointed
body of the Spanish Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie.</p>
               <p>Great Britaine being encir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled
by the Sea, and there being
an easie going out for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and a dangerous landing
for Strangers, and having so
many invincible Castles in
motion (I meane Her Ships)
and abounding inwardly with
all necessaries, and breeding
such men, that I may well say,
no King whatsoever hath more
choyce of able bodies to make
Soldiers of, having also most of
Her trade intrinsique, with
many other Insulary advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
She need not feare any
one Earthly power, if She bee
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107053:64"/>
true to Her selfe; yet would
She be puzzled to cope with
any of the other two single, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be upon the defensive
part, but joyning with Holland
She can give them both the
Law at Sea, and leaguing with
any of the other two, She is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to put the third shrewdly
to it.</p>
               <p>Now it cannot be denied, but
that which giveth the greatest
check to the Spanish Monarchy
is France: And there is no
lesse truth than caution in that
saying, that the yeaue of the
Conquering of France, is the
morning of the Conquest of
England (and vice versa.) It
hath not been then without good
reason of State, that England
since that monstruous height of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107053:64"/>
power that Spaine is come to
of late, hath endeavoured ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to strengthen France (to
beare up against Her) than to
enfeeble Her, having contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
both her power and purse
to ransome one of her Kings, at
that time when Spaine began
to shoot out Her braunches so
wide: Besides, during the last
Ligue, which raged so long
through all the bowels of
France with that fury, when
there was a designe to Canto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
the whole Kingdome;
Queene Elizabeth though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
a part, would not accept of
it, for feare of weakning the
whole: Therefore this chaine
of reciprocall conservation, lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them together so strongly;
England may well be taken for
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107053:65"/>
a sure Confederate of France,
while France containes Her
selfe within her present bounds,
but if Shee should reduce the
Spaniard to that desperate
passe in the Netherlands<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as
to make him throw the helve
after the hatcher, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish
those Provinces alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
it would much alter the
case: for nothing could make
France more suspectfull to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
than the addition of
those Countreyes, for thereby
they would come to be one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
piece, and so England her
overthwart neighbour, should
bee in a worse case than if the
Spaniard had them entirely to
himselfe. For it would cause
Her to put Her selfe more
strongly upon Her Guard,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107053:65"/>
and so increase Her charge
and care.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point, there
cannot be a surer maxime and
fuller of precaution for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of England, and Her
Allies, and indeed for all other
Princes of this part of the
World, than Barnevelt gave
of late yeares, a little before he
came to the fatall block.

               <p>HE must also observe the
number of Languages,
and difference of Dialects, as
neere as he can, in every
Countrey as hee passeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
               <p>The French have three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alects,
the Wallon (vulgarly
called among themselves
Romand,) the Provensall,
(whereof the Gascon is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialect)
and the speech of
Languedoc: They of Bearne
and Navarre speak a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
that hath affinity with
the Bascuence or the Canta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brian
tongue in Biscaie, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107053:67"/>
amongst the Pyrenean moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines:
The Armorican
tongue, which they of low
Brittaine speake (for there is
your Bas-Breton, and the
Breton-Brittonant or Breton
Gallois, who speakes French)
is a dialect of the old Brittish
as the word Armorica im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
which is a meere Welsh
word, for if one observe the
Radicall words in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
they are the same that
are now spoken in Wales,
though they differ much in
the composition of their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
as doth the Cornish:
Now some of the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedst<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
Antiquaries positively
hold the Originall Language
of the Celtae, the true ancient
Gaules, to be Welsh: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107053:68"/>
other Authors they
produce no meaner than Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar
and Tacitus, to confirme
this opinion: For Caesar
saith that the Druydes of Gaule
understood the Brittish Druyds,
who it seemes were of more
account for their Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
because as he saith, the
Gaules came usually over to be
taught by them, which must
bee by conference, for there
were few books then: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
Tacitus in the life of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Agricola reporteth,
that the Language of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and the Gaules little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
I restraine my selfe to
the middle part of France cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Gallia Celtica, for they of
Aquitaine spake a language
that corresponded with the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107053:68"/>
old Spanish, they of Burgundy
and Champagny with the
German, and most part of
Provence spake Greek, there
having beene a famous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony
of Grecians planted
in Marseilles: Other small
differences there are up and
down in other Provinces of
France, as the low Norman
useth to contract many
words, as he will often say,
I' ay un pet Ã  faire, for I' ay
un petit affaire, and the Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctevin
will mince the word,
and say, ma Mese, mon pese,
for ma Mere, mon Pere; but
these differences are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.</p>
               <p>The Spanish or Castilian
tongue, which is usually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Romance, and of late
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107053:69"/>
years Lengua Christiana, (but
it is called so only amongst
themselves) for a Spaniard
will commonly aske a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
whether hee can speake
Christian, that is, Castillian?
The Spanish (I say) hath but
one considerable dialect,
which is the Portugues,
which the Iewes of Europe
speake more than any other
language, and they hold that
the Messias shall come out
that Tribe, that speake the
Portingal language; other
small differences there are in
the pronunciation of the gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
letters in the Castillian,
but they are of small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
They of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Valencia and Catalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
(Goth-land) speake rather
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107053:69"/>
a language mixed of French,
and Italian: In the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of Granada (the Alpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xarras)
they speake Morisco,
that last part of Spaine that
was inhabited by the Moores,
who had possessed it above
700 yeares.</p>
               <p>But the most ancient
speech of Spaine seemes to
have beene the Bascuence or
the Cantabrian tongue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in Guipuscoa, the Asturias
and in some places amongst
the Pyrenes; but principally
in the Province of Biscaye,
which was never conquered
by Roman, Cartaginian, Goth,
Vandall or Moore, which
Nations overrunne all the
rest of Spaine, (though some
more, some lesse) therefore
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107053:70"/>
whensoever the King of
Spaine commeth to any of
the territories of Biscaye, hee
must pull off his shooes upon
the frontiers, when he treads
the first step, being as it were
Virgin holy ground. And as
it is probable that the Bascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is the primitive lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of Spaine, so doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the people of that
Countrey are a remnant of
the very Aborigenes, of her
first Inhabitants. For it is
an infallible Rule, that if you
desire to find out (the Indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>nae)
the ancientest people or
language of a Countrey, you
must go amongst the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and places of fastnesse,
as the Epirotiques in Greece,
the Heylanders in Scotland,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107053:70"/>
the Brittaines in Wales, with
whom (I meane the last) the
Biscayner doth much sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize
in many things, as in
the position and quality of
ground, in his candor and
humanity towards Strangers
more than any other people
of Spaine, his cryed up An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;
for the Spaniards
confesse the ancientest race
of Gentry to have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
there: So that a Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayner
is capable to be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
of any of the three ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
without any scrutiny to
be made by the Office, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be, limpio de la sangre
de los Moros, that is, cleare of
the bloud of the Moores or no,
'tis enough that he be a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanero,
that he be borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107053:71"/>
the Mountaines of
Biscaye. And many may
be the reasons why Hilly
people keep their standings
so well, for being inured to
labour, and subject to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemency
of the Heavens,
distemperatures of Ayre, to
short Commons, and other
incommodities, they prove
the hardier and abler men,
and happily with the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ground their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are heightned, and so
prove more couragious and
forward to repel an invading
enemy.</p>
               <p>Adde hereunto, that the
cragginesse and steepinesse
of places up and down is a
great advantage to the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and makes them inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107053:71"/>
for they serve as
Fortresses erected by Nature
her selfe, to protect them from
all incursions: as Caesar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
of some places in
Scythia, that Difficilius erat
hostem invenire, quam vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</p>
               <p>And now for further
proofe that the Cantabrian
language is the ancientest of
Spaine, I thinke it will not be
much from the purpose, if I
insert here a strange disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
that was made not
much above halfe a hundred
yeares ago, about the very
midle of Spaine, of the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuecos,
a people that were
never knowne upon the face
of the Earth before, though
Spaine hath been a renown'd
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107053:72"/>
famous Countrey visited and
known by many warlik Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
They were discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the flight of a Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
for the Duke of Alva
hauking on a time neere
certaine hils, not farre from
Salamanca, one of his Hauks
which he much valued, flew
over those Mountaines, and
his men not being able to
find her at first, they were
sent back by the Duke after
her; these Faulkners clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering
up and down, from
hill to hill and luring all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
they lighted at last up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a large pleasant Valley,
where they spied a company
of naked Savage people,
locked in between an assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of huge crags and hils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107053:72"/>
and hemmed in (as it
were) one in another: As
simple and Savage they
were, as the rudest people of
any of the two Indies, whereof
some thought a man on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
to be one creature with the
horse: These Savages ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
awhile upon them,
flew away at last into their
caves, for they were Troglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites,
and had no dwelling
but in the hollowes of the
rocks: The Faulconers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
well the track of the
passage, returned the next
day, and told the Duke, that
in lieu of a hauke, they had
found out a New World, a
New People never knowne
on the continent of Spaine,
since Tubal Cain came first
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107053:73"/>
thither: A while after, the
Duke of Alva went himselfe
with a Company of Musca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers,
and Conquered them,
for they had no offensive
weapon but slings; they were
Pythagoreans, and did eat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that had life in it, but
excellent fruits, rootes and
springs there were amongst
them; they worshipped the
Sun, &amp; new Moone, their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
was not intelligible by
any, yet many of their simple
words were pure Bascuence,
and their gutturall pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the very same, and a gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
pronunciation is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
badge of an ancient lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
And so they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to Christianity, but
are to this day discernable
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107053:73"/>
from other Spaniards by their
more tawny complexions,
which proceeds from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
of the Sun-beams
glancing upon those stony
mountaines wherewith they
are encircled, and on
some sides trebly fenced,
which beames reflects upon
them with a greater strength
and so tannes them.</p>
               <p>But I did not think to have
stayed so long in Spain now
nor indeed the last time I
was there, but he that hath to
deale with that Nation, must
have good store of Phlegme
and patience, and both for
his stay, and successe of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,

               <p>BVt these varieties of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects

are farre lesse in number to
those of Italy; Nor do I
beleeve were there ever so
many amongst the Greeks,
though their Countrey was
indented and cut out into so
many Islands, which as they
differed in position of place,
so there was some reason
they should differ something
in propriety of Speech: There
is in Italy the Toscan, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the Venetian, the Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the Parmasan, the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montese,
and others in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Abouzzo, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennine
hils; and all these
have severall Dialects and
Idiomes of Speech, and the
reason I conceive to be, is the
multiplicity of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
there being in Italy,
one Kingdome, three Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
and five or six absolute
Principalities, besides the
Popedome, and their Lawes,
being different, their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
also groweth to be so,
but the prime Italian dialect,
take Accent and Elegance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
is Lingua Toscana in
boca Romana. The Toscan
tongue in a Roman mouth.</p>
               <p>There is also a Mongrell
Dialect composed of Italian
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107053:75"/>
and French, and some Spanish
words are also in it, which
they call Franco, that is used
in many of the Islands of the
Aegean Sea, and reacheth as
farre as Constantinople, and
Natolie, and some places in
Afrique; and it is the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
speech of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>merce 'twixt
Christians, Iewes, Turkes,
and Greeks in the Levant.</p>
               <p>Now for the Originall
Language in Italy, as the
Mesapian and Hetruscan
tongue, there is not a syllable
left any where, nor do I
know any Countrey where
the old primitive Languages,
are so utterly and totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished
without the least

Touching the Latine
Tongue, which is one of the
ancientest Languages of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,
but not so ancient as
those I spake of before, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
opinion is, that the
inundation of the Goths, Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
and Longbards, were her
first Corrupters but it is not
so, as the Learned Bembo, and
our no lesse Learned Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
are of opinion; for as
the Latine Tongue grew to
perfection by certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and in Caesar and Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's
times (whereof the one
for purity, the other for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piousnesse,
were the best that
ever writ) she came to the
highest flourish together
with the Empire, so had shee
insensible degrees of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107053:76"/>
amongst the vulgar, and
intrinsique changes in her
selfe before any forrain cause
concurred; for the Salian
Verses, towards the end of
the Republique, were scarce
intelligible, no more were
the capitulations of Peace
'twixt Rome and Carthage in
Polybius his time: And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one knowes what kind
of Latine stands upon record
on the Columna Rostrata in
the Capitoll, in memory of
the famous Navall victory
of Duillius the Consull,
which happened but 150
yeares before Cicero. As also
what Latine had the vogue
in Pla<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

of the byas, to insert (in this
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107053:76"/>
Ogdoastique) a few verses of
the Latine which was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in that age, which were
given me by a worthy polite
Gentleman,

So that as before, so after Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero's
time, the Latine Tongue
wrought certaine changes
in her selfe, before any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with Strangers, or the
intervention of any forraine
cause: For as Kingdomes and
States with all other Sublunary
things are subject to a tossing
and tumbling, to periods and
changes, as also all Naturall
bodies corrupt inwardly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
of themselves, so Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
are not exempt from
this Fate, from those accidents,
and revolutions that attend
Time: For Horace complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in his dayes, that words
changed as coynes did: Yet
besides this home bredd
change, it cannot be denyed
but the Latine Tongue, had
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107053:77"/>
some forraine extrinsique
cause to degenerate so farre
into Italian, as the admission
of such multiplicities of
Strangers to be Roman Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
with the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of slaves that were
brought into the City; Adde
herunto at last those swarms

could take no impression at

There is also true Greek
spoken in some parts of the
lesser Asia, where there is no
place upon the surface of the
earth, for the proportion,
where so many differing
Languages are spoken, yet
most of them are but Dialects
and subdialects; so that of
those two and twenty
tongues, which Mithridates
is recorded to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
above two parts of

dialects.</p>

tongues, that go from the

most Spacious Arabique,
which is spoken (or learnt)
throughoutal the vast domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of the Mahumetan Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and is the most fixed
language now upon Earth, it
being death to alter it, or
Translate the Alcoran into
any other language, to adde

               <p>THe German or Teutonique

extent, for not only the large
Continent of Germany high
and low, but the Kingdomes
of England, Scotland, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marque,

And questionlesse the

Scaliger would have but
eleven, though there be foure
or five more, but I find that
they who are cryed up for
great Clearks may erre, as he
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107053:82"/>
did in this, as also when hee
made Prester Iohn an African
and placed him in Ethiopia,
in the Habassins Countrey,
whereas it is certaine that he
was an Asian, and King of
Tenduc in Tartary above two
thousand miles distant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
he was a Nestorian by his
religion, and it is well known
the Habassines are Iacobites
and Christians from the girdle
upward, and Iews downward,
admitting both of Baptism and
Circumcision.</p>
               <p>And so ancient is the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
tongue, that Goropius Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus
flattered himselfe with
a fancy, that it was the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
which was spoken in
Paradise, which Ortelius also
shewed a desire to beleeve;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107053:82"/>
they grounded this conceipt
upon these words, Adam,
Eve, Abel, Seth, &amp;c. which
they would stretch to bee
German words; also that
their language came first
from Asia, because Godt, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Moder, Broder, Star, are
found to signifie the same
things both in the German,
and Persian tongue.</p>
               <p>There is no language so
ful of Monosyllables and knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so with Consonants as the
German, howsoever she is a
full mouthd masculine speech:
the speeches of the Kingdoms
before mentioned, are but
Dialects derived from her;
And the English is but a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialect
or branch of the Saxon
Dialect, which hath no other

name in Welsh and Irish to this
day; for take an Englishman
Capa pea, from head to foot,
every member hee hath is
Dutch.</p>
               <p>Yet since the last Conquest
much French hath got in, and
greatly embellished and
smoothed the English, so that
there is very much affinity
between them, as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<q>
                     <l>La Fortune me tourmente,</l>
                     <l>La Vertu mecontente.</l>

                     <l>D' entrer en Paradis.</l>
                  </q>
Which sayings are both
French and English.</p>
               <p>Of late yeares the English
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107053:83"/>
tongue hath much enriched
her selfe, by borrowing of
some choyce, well sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and significant words
from other Languages also;
so that she may be compared
to a Posie made up of many fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
choyce Flowers: And
truly, without interest and
passion, let it be spoken, there
is in English as true straines of
Eloquence, as strong and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newy
Expressions, as elaborate
and solid pieces of Fancy, as
far fetched reaches of Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and as full of salt, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor's

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107053:84"/>
that some other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
for their soft and

having no abruptnesse of
Consonants, have some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the English; yet
many of their fancies, which
amongst themselves they
hold to be strong lines and
quintessentiall stuffe, being
turned to another tongue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
flat, and prove often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
but meere gingles, but
what is witty in English, is

(for the Theory is not

the first blessing which fell

Speech is the Index, the

of the Mind to Reasons
Palace, and the impregnable

there be but one way thither, yet
there be many sorts of Chariots,
some more sumptuous and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
harnessed than others; for
amongst tongues there be some
farre more rich, more copious,
and of stronger expressions
than others: And amongst

force an habitation, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
expence and toyle,
checking the impetuous
cours of the angry Ocean, and
shewing the World how far
Industry and Art, can curbe
and controule Nature: And
very expedient it is, hee
should take an exact Survey
of the States of the United
Provinces, because they are
accounted the surest Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
of England, and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stest

               <p>And it will be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
thing to see what
a mighty subsistence of
wealth and a huge Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable
power that State
in come too, by a rare
unparalelled industry: For
I dare avouch that the
Roman Common-wealth,
(though she had her head
as well knit in her infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
as any that ever was)
did not come neere her,
in so short a progresse of
time, to such a growth of
strength.</p>
               <p>But it seemes all things
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107053:88"/>
conspired to rayse Holland to
this passe: First, the humour
of the people, being patient<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and iudustrious, and of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
more in clinable to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocraticall
Government than
to a Monarchy: Adde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the quality of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
being every where half
cut, and as it were inlayed
with water, and thereby
much fortified, and made in
many places inaccessible; so
that, if need were, Holland
could turne her selfe into a
huge pond when she list.</p>
               <p>Hereunto concurred a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advantage of situation,
having behind her the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
Sea, which affoords her
all kind of Materials for ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and for all kind of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107053:88"/>
and Military forces
England and France, both
swarming with superfluous
people, suspectfull of the
Spanish greatnesse, and so not
unwilling to contribute auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary
strength for mutuall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
and conservation.</p>
               <p>Navigation and Mercan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Negotiation, are the two
Poles whereon that State doth
move, and to both these, it
seemes, Nature her selfe hath
expresly designed both
Countrey and People; Them
be an extraordinary kind of
Propensity, the Countrey by
apt position, for having no
Land to manure, they plow
the very bowels of the Deep,
the wrinkled fore-head of Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
being the furrowes
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107053:89"/>
that yealds them encrease.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there being
many great Rivers that slice
and cut the Countrey up and
down to disgorge themselvs
into the Ocean, those Rivers
may be said to pay them tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
as well as to the Sea,
which Rivers branching
themselves into large and
bearing streames, do so fitly
serve one another, and all
the whole, that it may bee
said, Nature in the frame of
humane bodies, did not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
more Art, in distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the veines and arteries,
for the easy conveyance of
the masse of bloud into each
part, as she hath shewed here
in dispersing those waters so
orderly for trafique.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:107053:89"/>
These Rivers bring her
what the large continent of
Germany, and other Easterne
Countreys affoord, and shee
lying between them and the
Sea; furnisheth them with all
far fetched Indian, African,
and Spanish commodities.</p>
               <p>Here you shall see the most

necessity, for the same thing
which makes a Parrot speake,

yet they abound with all

live by the idlenesse of some of

               <p>Yet in conversation they
are but heavy, of a homely

which slownesse carieth with

this may bee imputed to the

of Italy, or the Oyle and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
of Spaine.</p>
               <p>Some also there are who
by their Countenance more
than by their Cariage, by
their Diseases, more than by
their Discourses, discover
themselves to have been A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
under hot Climats.</p>
               <p>Others have a custome to
bee always relating strange
things and wonders, (of the
humor of Sir Iohn Mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile)
and they usually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
them to the Hearers,
through multiplying glasses,
and thereby cause the thing
to appeare far greater than it
is in it self, they make Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of Mole-hils, like Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton-Bridge-Eccho,
which
doubles the sound nine
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107053:93"/>
times. Such a Traveller was
he, that reported the Indian
Fly, to be as big as a Fox;
China birds, to be as big as
some Horses, and their Mice
to be as big as Monkeys; but
they have the wit to fetch
this far enough off, because
the Hearer may rather believe
it, than make a voyage so far
to disprove it.</p>
               <p>Every one knowes the
Tale of him, who reported hee
had seen a Cabbage under whose
leafes a Regiment of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were sheltred from a
shower of raine: Another
who was no Traveller (yet
the wiser man) said, hee had
passed by a place where there
were 400 brasiers making of a
Cauldron, 200 within, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107053:94"/>
200 without, beating the nayles
in; the Traveller asking for
what use that huge Cauldron
was? he told him, Sir it was to
boyle your Cabbage.</p>
               <p>Such another was the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Traveller, who was so
habituated to hyperbolize,
and relate wonders, that he
became ridiculous in al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
so that he was forced
at last to give order to his
man, when he fell into any
excesse this way, and report
any thing improbable, he
should pul him by the sleeve:
The Master falling into his
wonted hyperboles, spoke of a
Church in China, that was ten
thousand and yards<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> long; his man
standing behind and pulling
him by the sleeve, made him
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107053:94"/>
stop suddenly: the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
asking, I pray Sir, how
broad might that Church
be? he replyed, but a yard
broad, and you may thanke my
man for pulling me by the
sleeve, else I had made it foure-square
for you.</p>
               <p>Others have another kind
of hyperbolizing vaine, as they
will say, there's not a woman
in Italy, but weares an Iron
girdle next her skin in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of her husband, that for
a pistoll one may be master of
any mans life there; That there
is not a Gentleman in France
but hath his box of play <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

are few Dons in Spaine that eat

not a Mistresse besides his wife;
That Paris hath more Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans
than London honest Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(which may admit a
double sense;) That Sevill
is like a chesse-bord table, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
as many Moriscos as Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards;
That Venice hath

                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:107053:95"/>
And it is a generous kind of
civility to report alwayes the
best.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
many others (which
were too long to recite here)
an odde kind of Anglicisme<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
wherein some do frequently
expresse themselves, as to
say Your Boores of Holland,

Sir; Your Courtisans of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,
Sir: whereunto one
answered (not impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
My Courtisans Sir? Pox
on them all for me, they are none
of my Courtisans.</p>
               <p>Lastly, some kind of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
there are, whom their

do speake them Travellers.</p>
               <p>Others by a phantastique

cloathing (and touching vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety

               <p>BVt such Travellers as

Land-lopers, as the Dutchman

Such may be said to go out

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:107053:99"/>
and sundry other Regions,
only to find out the best
Crabs; or like him who came
from the furthest parts
of Hungary to England, to
eate Oysters: These Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
in lieu of the Ore of Ophir
wherwith they should come
home richly freighted, may
be said to make their returne
in Apes and Owles, in a carga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
of Complements and
Cringes, or some huge mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Periwigs, which is the
Golden Fleece they bring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with them.</p>
               <p>Such, I say, are a shame
to their Countrey abroad,
and their kinred at home, and
to their parents, Benonies, the
sons of sorrow: and as Ionas
in the Whales belly, travelled
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:107053:99"/>
much, but saw little, why, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee was shut up in the
body of that great (aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique)
beast, so these may be
said to have been carried up
and downe through many
Countreys, and after a long
pererration to and fro, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
as wise as they went,
because their soules were so
ill lodged, and shut up in such
stupid bodies: No, an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
and discerning Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
will disdaine this, and
strive to distinguish 'twixt
good and evill, 'twixt that
which is gracefull, and
what's phantastique, 'twixt
what is to be followed, and
what's to be shunned, and
bring home the best: Hee
will strive to be rather Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107053:100"/>
without shew, than shew
without substance: From the
Italian he will borrow his
reservednesse, not his jealousie
and humor of revenge; From
the French his Horsemanship
and gallantnesse that way,
with his Confidence, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else: From the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
his Sobriety, not his lust:
From the German (cleane
contrary) his Continency, no:
his Excesse, the other way:
From the Netherland his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
and that's all: His
heart must still remaine En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
though I allow him
some choyce and change of
Habit,
<q>Coelum, non animum mutetâ€”</q>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:107053:100"/>
And as the commendablest
quality of Oyle is to smell of
nothing, yet it giveth an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
relish to many sorts
of meats: So he is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetest
Traveller, who Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth
of no affectation; or
strangenesse, of no exotique
modes at all, after his returne,
either in his Cariage or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours,
unlesse the subject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it, and the occasion and
Company aptly serve for
him, to discover himselfe,
and then an application of
his Knowledge abroad, will
excellently season his matter
and serve as golden d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>shes
to serve it in.</p>
               <p>If any Forrainer be to be
imitated in his manner of
Discours and Comportement,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107053:101"/>
it is the Italian, who may be
said to be a medium 'twixt
the Gravity of the Spaniard,
the Heavinesse of the Dutch,
and Levity of our next
Neighbours, for he seemes
to allay the one, and quicken
the other two; to serve as a
buoy to the one, and a ballast
to th'other.</p>
               <p>France useth to work one
good effect upon the English,
she useth to take away the
mothers milk (as they say,)
that blush, and bashfull tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
which useth to rise up
in the face npon sudden sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes,
and enterchange of
Complement, and to enhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
one with confidence;
For the Gentry of France
have a kind of loose becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107053:101"/>
boldnes, and forward
vivacity in their cariage,
whereby they seeme to draw
respect from their Superiours
and Equals, and make their
Inferiours keepe a fitting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>In Italy amongst other
morall cautions, one may
learne not to be over prodigall
of speech when there is no
need, for with a nod, with a
shake of the head, and shrug of
the shoulder, they will answer
to many questions.</p>
               <p>One shall learne besides
there not to interrupt one in
the relation of his tale, or to
feed it with odde interlocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
One shall learne also
not to laugh at his own jest, as
too many use to do, like a Hen,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107053:102"/>
which cannot lay an egge but

               <p>Moreover, one shall learne
not to ride so furiously as they
do ordinarily in England,
when there is no necessity at
all for it; for the Italians
have a Proverb, that a gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
horse is an open sepulcher.
And the English generally

               <p>LAnguage is the greatest
outward testimony of
Travell: Yet is it a vaine and
verball Knowledge that rests
only in the Tongue; Nor are
the observations of the Eye
any thing profitable, unlesse
the Mind draw something
from the Externe object to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich

glorious and new, some moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
away, and eaten by the
Iron-teeth of Time, he come
to discerne; the best of all
earthly things to bee but frayle
and transitory. That this World
at the best is but a huge Inne,
and we but wayfaring men, but
Pilgrimes, and a company of
rambling Passengers. That
we enter first into this World
by Travaile, and so passe along,
with Cries, by weeping crosse:
So that it was no improper
Character the Wisest of Kings
gave of this life to be nought
else but a continuall Travell:

               <p>Other Passengers there are,

they are forced to trudge up and

               <p>And it is the high pleasure

For of those three that the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator

               <p>It is recorded in an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

               <p>In Carthage, the Senat
commanded, the Nobles execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the People obeyed.</p>
               <p>In Athens the Rich were
not suffered to be Extortioners,
the Poore idle, nor the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
ignorant.</p>
               <p>In Rhodes Old men were
Venerable, Young men modest,

               <p>In Thebes the Nobles
did fight, the Plebeians la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,

               <p>In Sicily Iustice was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely

               <p>Among the Sicionians there

not go out to see feathers fly
in the Ayre, or Reeds shaken
with the wind, they did not
go to get Complements or

or new Modes of cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
or to tip the tongue
with a little Language only,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:107053:108"/>
but they searchd into the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidest
and usefullest part of
humane Wisdome, which is
policy; And doubtlesse, that
rare wise King made excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
use of their observations,
and rewarded them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly:
And one of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest
advantages to a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
is, to have a discerning
and bountifull King when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
requires, for Subjects are

they find their Prince able to

in the Common-wealth of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and speculative Orbe of
Vertue, the benigne aspect and

Apollo was to the Muses, it

heate, and illumination,
whereby they are cherished and
made vigorous.</p>
               <p>The most materiall use
therefore of Forraine Travel
is to find out something
that may bee applyable to
the publique utility of one's

               <p>AMongst many other

and a thousand various
thoughts and selfe content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and selfe content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and inward solaces, it
raiseth in the memory of
things past, this is one: That
when one hath seene the
Tally and taillage of France,
the Milstone of Spaine, the
Assise of Holland, the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
of Italy, where one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bring an Egge, or roote
to the market, but the Prince
his part lyes therinna: When
he hath felt the excesse of heat,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:107053:111"/>
the dangerous Serains, the
Poverty of soyle in many places,
the Homelinesse and incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of lodging, the course cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the best sort of Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants,
their wooden shooes, and
straw hats, their Canvas
breeches, and Buckram petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coates,
their meager fare, feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commonly upon Grasse,
Hearbs, and Roots, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Water, neere the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of brute animals, who find
the cloth always ready layed, &amp;
the buttry open: When hee
hath observed what a hard
shift some make to hewe out
a dwelling in the holes of the
Rocks; others to dig one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Sea; when he feeles,
how in some Climes the
Heaven is as Brasse, in others
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107053:111"/>
as a dropping Sponge; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as a great Bellowes, most
part of the yeare; how the
Earth, in many places is ever
and anone sick of a fit of the
Palsie; When hee sees the
same Sun which only cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
and gently warmes his
Countrey men, halfe parboyle
and tanne other people, and
those rayes which scorch the
adusted soyles of Calabria and
Spaine, only varnish and
guild the green hony-suckled
plaines and hillocks of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;
When he hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
what hard shifts some
make to rub out in this world
in divers Countreys, What
speed Nature makes to finish
her cours in them; How
their best sort of women af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

and looke like
another Charing-Crosse,
or Carackes that have pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Line in three voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
to the Indies: When
hee hath observed all this,
At his returne home, hee
will blesse God, and love
England better ever after,
both for the Equality of the
Temper in the Clime, where
there is no where the like,
take all the Seasons of the
yeare together, (though
some would wish She might
bee pushed a little nearer
the Sun:) For the free
condition of the subject, and
equall participation of the
Wealth of the Land, for the
unparallelled accommodation
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:107053:112"/>
of lodging, and security of
Travell, for the admirable ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitality,
for the variety and
plenty of all sorts of firme
food, for attendance and
cleanlinesse, for the rare fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility
of Shoare and Sea, of
Ayre, Earth, and Water, for
the longevity, well favoured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and innated honesty of
the people: And above all;
for the moderation and decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in celebrating the true ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, being farre
from Superstition one way,
and from Prophanesse the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, (though (with
a quaking heart, I speake it)
there have been strange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies
committed of late)
I say, when hee hath well

               <p>HAving thus tasted of
so many waters, and
beene Salted in the World
abroad, and being safely
restored to the bosome of

settle himselfe awhile in
one of the Innes of Court,
(which hee may do and
yet bee a Courtier besides)
to understand something of
the Common Lawes of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
which are the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of every subject, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:107053:114"/>
of the constitutions and
Orders of the House of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament,
the most indifferent,
most wholesome, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
way of Government
in the World, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of King and People:
It being the greatest glory of
a King, to be King of a free
and well-crested people, and
the greatest glory of a People
to bee under a Crown so em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellished
with Flowers, and
sparckling with such ancient
and sacred gemmes of Royall
Prerogatives: Yet to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
no Law but of their
owne making, to bee the
Setters of the great Dyall
of the Common-Wealth
themselves. To bee sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to no Ordinance, to no
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:107053:114"/>
Contribution or Taxe, but
what is granted in that great
Epidemicall Counsell, wherein
every one from the Peere to
the Plebeian hath an inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Vote. And if every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
high and low, both in
Towne and Countrey is there
represented by their Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stutes;
it were a hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
(under correction, I
humbly speake it) if the
Levites, the best of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
who besides the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
of their function (as
having charge of the Nobler
halfe of man, of that which
should guide and regulate
the Understanding in making
of all Lawes, I meane the
Conscience) do make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
part of the People
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:107053:115"/>
of the Kingdome, should be
thence excluded; for though
it be inconsistent with their
calling to have hands to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
yet they may well have
heads to consult in that great
Nationall Senat: It were a
hard case, I say, if those great
Lights, which were used to
shine with that brightnesse
to the Envy (not the reproach
or Scandall of any that I
know of) of all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches, should be
now put in wooden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks:
That those Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Endowments, and
Honors, which our well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed
Progenitors provided,
to nourish the Arts, and
serve as Spurres to Learning
and Zeale, should now be cut

And he who hath spent the
vigor of his yeares and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals
in the Lords Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
it may well become
him (having served, as it
were, his yeare of Iubile) to
have his gray haires dignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with some Honor and
Authority, with reward and
rest in his old age, and by his
long experience and paines
to see that other painefull
Labourers be put into the
Vine-yard, yet to have his
hand often on the Plough
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:107053:116"/>
himselfe. If there bee a
theefe in the Candle, (as wee
use to say commonly) there
is a way to pull it out; and
not to put out the Candle, by
clapping an Extinguisher pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
upon it; If these Lights
grow dim, there is a Trienni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Snuffer for them: If these
Trees beare not good fruit,
or shoot forth any Luxuriant
boughs, they are sure to feele
the Pruning iron once every
three yeares.</p>
               <p>In the name of God, let
these Lights be brought to
move within the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of their own Orbes, and
be kept from irregular and
eccentrique motions, And I
am confident it will render
them lesse obnoxious to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:107053:116"/>
and Scandall, and draw
upon them a greater opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Reverence.</p>
               <p>There is a Castle in the
grand Caire in Aegypt, called
the Nilescope, where there
stands a Pillar with certaine
markes to observe the height
of the River of Nile, at her
annuall inundation (which
fals out precisely about the
Summer Solstice) if the
streame come to bee higher
or lower than such markes, it
portends dearth, but if at
highest floud it rest about the
middle, it is an infallible
presage of a plentifull yeare:
So we may say of these great
Streames that are appointed
to water the Lords Field,
they must not swell too high,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:107053:117"/>
nor must they run in too low
a Channell: And as humility
is the fairest gemme that can
shine in a Prelats Miter, so the
greatest badge of a well devoted
Soule, is to reverence the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensers
of the sacred Oracles of
God, the Ghostly Fathers, and
Governors of the Church,
(which in analogy to the
Triumphant in Heaven, hath
also her degrees of Hierarchy.)
For besides Revenue there is
a Veneration, due to this holy
function, and it were no hard
matter to produce a Gran
Iury of examples both Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
and Divine, that where
this Reverence fayled, it hath
been a symptome, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
presage of a declining
State, or some approaching
judgement.</p>

But I hope I shall never
live to see the day that the
Noble English Nation, who
have been so renowned all
the world over, and cryed
up for their exemplary Piety,
as well as Prowesse, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue
themselves so farre,
and grow distrustfull or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
of their owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
their owne wonted
Worth, and Ability so far, as
to thinke those Nations (who
have not meanes to make the
Church shine with that lustre)
to be Wiser than they, or to
out go them in zeale, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
laws for the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

God from those, who have
been far behind them, both

and the Reformation
thereofâ€”Proh pudorâ€”I
will not say, by what I heard
muttered abroad, it will be
accounted a Nationall dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution,
but if it should fo fall
out, it is no hard matter to be
a Prophet, yea, by what
hath passed already, to take
a plaine prospect of those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall
confusions, and
fearefull calamities, which
will inevitably ensue both in
Church and State; unlesse
with the pious care which is
already taken to hinder the

Vineyard; there be also a

Her from other Vermine, and
lesser Animals (the belluam

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107053:118"/>
to brouze her leaves, to
throw down her hedges, and so
lay her open to wast, spoyle and

cours taken, I say, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
those petty Sectaries,
which swarme so in every
corner, with that connivence
(to the amazement of all the
world, and disparagement of
so well a policed Kingdome)
who by their capricious and
various kind of gingling fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in serving God, do their
best to bring in the opinion
of the Pagan Philosopher
(Themistius) delivered once
to Valens the Emperor, That
as God Almighty had infused
into his handmaid Nature, a

the beauty of the Universe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:107053:119"/>
in a proportion of so many

hath a share and interest in it,

his Birth and Baptism,

When the Windows come

down (and the chief Pillars

Heaven, as having taken but

of his Maker, who will not run
and reach his hand to beare up
his Temple.</p>
