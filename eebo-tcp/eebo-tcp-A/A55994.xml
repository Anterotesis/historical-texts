            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>YOU're welcome, Gentlemen, I'm glad to ſee,</l>
                  <l>That Knaves, and Fools, ſo lovingly agree.</l>
                  <l>Here our <hi>Advent'rers,</hi> and <hi>Projectors,</hi> met,</l>
                  <l>In Crowds together undiſtinguiſh'd ſweat.</l>
                  <l>See how each huggs his Cully like a Brother.</l>
                  <l>They match like <hi>Tickets</hi> cut from one another.</l>
                  <l>For <hi>Knave</hi> and <hi>Fool</hi>'s ſo like, in all but heart,</l>
                  <l>You'd ſwear, that one was 'tother's Counterpart.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>This throng'd Appearance rids me of my Fear</l>
                  <l>Of a lean Harveſt this untoward Year.</l>
                  <l>By <hi>Neal,</hi> and <hi>Speed,</hi> you've been ſo often bit,</l>
                  <l>I was afraid our <hi>Project</hi> wou'd not hit.</l>
                  <l>But, Heaven be prais'd! Ours is a Fertile Soil,</l>
                  <l>The forward Crop outſhoots our buſieſt toil.</l>
                  <l>Henceforth we'l fear no Dearth, or Reformation</l>
                  <l>Of <hi>Fools,</hi> the Glory of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation,</l>
                  <l>Pure <hi>Sterling-Fools,</hi> that <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Caution</hi> hate,</l>
                  <l>Whoſe pride 'tis to be dull, and obſtinate.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>As <hi>Flanders</hi> was your Nurſery for <hi>Bullies,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>So <hi>Projects</hi> are Hot-beds that force up <hi>Cullies;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And <hi>Lott'ries</hi> are a Spot, that manag'd right,</l>
                  <l>Raiſes vaſt Crops, like Muſhromes, in a Night.</l>
                  <l>By often paring, and reducing low,</l>
                  <l>Like Vines, by pruning, they more fruitful grow,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I laugh to ſee ſo many Thouſands round,</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>Not one, that has a ſingle Ticket got,</l>
                  <l>Wou'd be contented with a meaner Lot.</l>
                  <l>Each huggs himſelf on his imagin'd Luck,</l>
                  <l>And Grins to think how the <hi>bilkt Fools</hi> will look.</l>
                  <l>So Pops, that laugh at Matrimony, wed,</l>
                  <l>That hiſs'd their Neighbour, when he ſhar'd his Bed,</l>
                  <l>They own the Sex all naught, but <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>Fate,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Each thinks, reſerves that <hi>one</hi> to be his <hi>Mate.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Faith, let the Frolick here for once go round,</l>
                  <l>Let each Man think he has the <hi>Thouſand Pound.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>For this Conceipt will be, when all is o're,</l>
                  <l>As juſtly grounded, as his hopes before.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But, comfort Friends, let no One here relent,</l>
                  <l>You've no great reaſon to be penitent.</l>
                  <l>For if your <hi>Stars</hi> ordain'd you <hi>Fools,</hi> the <hi>Fates</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Have made you ſo at very eaſy Rates.</l>
                  <l>All thoſe, that heretofore with <hi>Neal</hi> have traded,</l>
                  <l>In <hi>Bank, Eaſt-India Stock,</hi> and <hi>Projects</hi> waded,</l>
                  <l>Have paid exceſſive Fines, to raiſe their Gains,</l>
                  <l>And Summs advanc'd to ſhew a want of Brains.</l>

                  <l>That rail, and call us Whores, and Proſtitutes?</l>
                  <l>That challenge all our Bounties as their due,</l>
                  <l>And loath old Favours, only charm'd with new?</l>
                  <l>No! We muſt Fools our truſty Slaves advance;</l>
                  <l>None thrive, like Altars rais'd by Ignorance.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But the irrevocable Prize is gone,</l>
                  <l>Which ſo devoutly all attend upon.</l>
                  <l>Which cou'd I but recall, I wou'd beſtow it,</l>
                  <l>Upon the City Laureat, our Poet;</l>
                  <l>Who has ſo much, and ſo divinely Writ,</l>
                  <l>Yet never was ſuſpected for a Wit.</l>
                  <l>Of Slaviſh ſenſe he ſtill disdains the Yoke,</l>
                  <l>And Apes the Nonſenſe, <hi>Thou,</hi> and <hi>Woden</hi> ſpoke;</l>
                  <l>Stiff haughty Bombaſt rumbles in each line,</l>
                  <l>Like that which does in <hi>London's Triumphs</hi> ſhine;</l>
                  <l>For which next venture, he ſhall be ſo trim,</l>
                  <l>Scarce ſhall his <hi>Pageants</hi> dare to rival him.</l>
