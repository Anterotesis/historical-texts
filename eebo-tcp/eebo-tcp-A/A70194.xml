            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The QUAKERS Creed concerning the Man Chriſt Jeſus, tranſcribed <hi>verbatim</hi> out of a Treatiſe enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The Way caſt up,</hi> lately written by <hi>George Keith</hi> a Quaker, with Animadverſions upon it.</head>
            <p>G. Keith PAGE 90. <hi>So that as far as the moſt high Heavens do excel the baſe and low Earth, ſo far doth Chriſt even as Man excel all other Men, and that not only in accidents as the Popiſh Schoolmen and Presbyterian Teachers following them do teach, but in Nature and Subſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> The Quakers from hence believe that Chriſt had a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood differing in Nature from the Manhood of all other Men, contrary to <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>For both be that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all of one,</hi> (i. e.) one common Nature with <hi>Adam,</hi> ver. 17. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>G. K. <hi>God created all things by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 3. 9. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt ſignifieth properly, the Word made Fleſh, or made Man. It is clear that according to the Apoſtle, the Word was made Fleſh, or Man, even from the beginning,</hi> Pag. 93.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> They believe from hence, that the Word was made Fleſh or Man, before the creation of this World, contrary to <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>But when the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a Woman,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Pet. 1. 20. <hi>Who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the World, but was manifeſt in theſe laſt times for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pag. 95. <hi>And therefore bad Fleſh and Blood,</hi> to wit, <hi>Heavenly and Spiritual, even from the beginning, on which the Saints in all ages did feed: And ſeeing Chriſt had fleſh and blood from the beginning, he was Man from the beginning. As God ſimply he cannot have fleſh and blood, for God is a Spirit, and therefore it is the fleſh and blood as he is Man, or the Son of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>G. K. <hi>Anim.</hi> They believe that Chriſt had real fleſh and blood before the creation of the World. The Apoſtle ſaith in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 39. <hi>There is one kind of fleſh of Men, another fleſh of Beaſts, another of Fiſhes, another of Birds:</hi> but the Quakers have found out another kind of fleſh beſides theſe four ſorts, yet the fleſh of a Man, but of a man before <hi>Adam,</hi> as man excelling all other Men in Nature, which they call Spiritual and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65440:3"/>
Heavenly. <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Caro non dicitur Hebreis niſi de corpore Mortali,</hi> They might as well ſay the Stars have fleſh and blood, or the Angels have fleſh and blood.</p>
            <p>G. K. Pag. 97. <hi>Chriſt ſignifieth anointed, and it is the Man Chriſt that is anointed with the Holy Spirit, and not the Word, or</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>which is God himſelf; for the Godhead anoints not the Godhead, but it is the Godhead that anoints the Manhood of Chriſt, which Manhood hath been anointed from the beginning, and therefore the man Chriſt hath been from the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> From hence they believe, that Chriſt as man was anointed by God from the beginning of the World, forgetting that the Prophets frequently ſpeak of things to come as preſent. As well might the Author ſay, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had a Soul and Body, and did exiſt in fleſh and blood 100 years before he was born, for he is called by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Gods anointed ſo many years before his birth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 1. The Chriſtian believeth that Chriſts firſt anointing as man, was when the Manhood was united to the Godhead, which began in the firſt conception in the Womb of the Virgin: and what was that but an anointing that is ſpoke of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>And he ſaw the Spirit of God deſcending like a Dove, and lighting upon him,</hi> compared with <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>And Jeſus being full of the Holy Ghoſt, returned from</hi> Jordan.</p>
            <p>G. K. ☞ <hi>This is the promiſed Seed which God promiſed to our Parents after the fall, and actually gave unto them even the Seed of the Woman that ſhould bruiſe the head of the Serpent, and therefore though the outward coming of the man Chriiſt was deferred according to the outward birth in the Fleſh for many ages, yet from the begininng, this heavenly man the promiſed Seed did inwardly come into the hearts of thoſe that believed in him, and bruiſed the head of the Serpent.</hi> Pag. 99.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> Hence they believe there was a twofold coming of the man Chriſt in the Fleſh, the inward and outward; the laſt was deferred for many ages, but the firſt was actually performed to our firſt Parents; ſo that you might properly ſay, that the man Chriſt the Seed of the Woman, came into the Man and Woman four thouſand years before he was made of a Woman. And in the next you will hear of another myſtery beyond this, <hi>viz.</hi> That this promiſed Seed the man Chriſt came into our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents before the promiſe was made.</p>
            <p>G. K. Pag. ibid. <hi>And thus Chriſt is the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the World, namely in that from the beginning, even as ſoon as our firſt Parents fell, the meaſure of the life of the Lamb which lived in our firſt Parents in the innocent ſtate, came as it were to be ſlain in them by tranſgreſſion, and to undergo ſore and deep ſuffering by reaſon of mens ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65440:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> From hence they believe, that the man Chriſt did ſuffer, was ſlain, and crucified when our firſt Parents ſinned, and doth ſuffer, is ſlain, and crucified as often as man ſins and apoſtatizes, contrary to the Scripture that teſtifieth that the man Chriſt Jeſus was perſonally and really ſlain, crucified, and offered for ſin but once; the other is but either in decree, promiſe, type, or metaphore. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. <hi>But now once in the end of the World hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</hi> The Quakers ſay it was from the beginning of the World, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for ſin.</hi> The Quakers ſay he hath often ſuffered.</p>
            <p>G. K. <hi>Even as the Seed that complained by the Prophet,</hi> Amos 3. 13. <hi>Behold I am preſſed under you, as a Cart is preſſed that is full of Sheaves. This muſt needs be underſtood of the life of Chriſt as man.</hi> Pag. 100. <hi>For as God he cannot ſuffer nor be ſlain, whereas the life of Chriſt as man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuffering and being crucified unto us, although that life ſtill lives in itſelf unto God, namely that ſeed or meaſure of it graffed or imprinted in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> They believe from hence that the man Chriſt did really ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, when the Prophet brings in God, ſpeaking in <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Behold I am preſſed under you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for as God he cannot ſuffer.</hi> As well might they ſay that God as God, hath now, and had then (when the Prophets writ) ſuch eyes, ears, feet, hands, as we have, for the Scripture ſpeaks of him frequently in that manner. And take notice that here they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, this man Chriſt, as man, may be crucified and ſlain in a ſinner, and yet at the ſame time may, as man, be alive in that ſame ſinner.</p>
            <p>G. K. Pag. ibid. <hi>Although as man he may and doth ſuffer, yet in due time his ſuffering-life will prevail, and be raiſed up over all its ſuffering in all Men where it ſuffers by reaſon of ſin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> They believe the man Chriſt is ſtill ſuffering by reaſon of ſin, that he is ſlain, and not yet compleatly riſen; whereas the Scripture ſaith <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Knowing that Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him.</hi>

            <p>G. K. The Author proves, Pag. 101. <hi>Chriſt to be a real man from the beginning, by the inſtance of the man that wreſtled with</hi> Jacob, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24. <hi>by inſtancing in one of the three men that appeared to</hi> Abraham, <hi>when</hi> Sodom <hi>was deſtroyed,</hi> Gen. 18. 2. <hi>By the inſtance of him that</hi> Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar <hi>ſaw in the Furnace.</hi> And ſaith, <hi>though it is commonly ſuppoſed that it was God that appeared thus, in a fantaſtical form or ſhape of a man, and not that really it was the man Chriſt Jeſus; yet this is by no means to be granted, otherwiſe we ſhould give away the cauſe to the</hi> Manichees, <hi>and ſuch as affirm that Chriſt was never a real and true man,</hi> Pag. 102. <hi>even when born of</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:65440:4"/>
               <hi>the Virgin, and crucified on the Croſs, but only that it was a phantaſm, or phantaſtical appearance of man; for indeed, ſeeing he is called as really man before his outward birth in the fleſh as afterwards, we have as good cauſe to believe him to be true and real man before his outward birth in the fleſh as after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> They believe from hence, that when Chriſt appeared in the times of the Old Teſtament, in the ſhape and form of a man, to have aſſumed a real Body of their kind of Spiritual fleſh into union with the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Word, and to be as really man as he was when born of the Virgin: ſo that the Word was made Fleſh very frequently, for he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the form of a man very frequently. Now let it be conſidered, this man that appeared is likewiſe called an Angel, compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 18. 1. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 2. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24. with <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 4. and read <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 28. ſo that by the ſame way of arguing Chriſt did from the beginning really take upon him Angelical nature, as well as mans nature. And likewiſe the two Angels that were with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. were really men, for they are called ſo, and appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> to be ſo. The Author was aware of this objection, and therefore prudently hath prevented it he thinks, by ſaying in the ſame <hi>Pag.</hi> 101. <hi>Angels are a ſort of Heavenly men;</hi> ſo that if Chriſt had taken on him the nature of Angels, he had taken on him mans nature, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a kind of heavenly Manhood. But to go on by this way of reaſoning, when <hi>Zechariah</hi> ſaw a man riding upon a red Horſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 8. this Horſe and Man was as real as the Man and Aſs which went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that we read of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. We ſay of theſe that God appeared in the form of Man, and ſo ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 9. <hi>God appeared to</hi> Jacob, he did by his own power create a Body, or form or faſhion it out of ſome pre-exiſtent matter, and did act and aſſiſt it to do that preſent work for that preſent time, and then laid it aſide again or annihilated it; and this the Eternal Word did as a <hi>Preludium</hi> of his future Incarnation, when he ſhould aſſume Mans nature, a real Humane rational Soul, and a real Humane Body, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of earthly Fleſh and Blood, in the Womb of the Virgin in the fulneſs of time.</p>
            <p>G. K. <hi>Even from the beginning he was the heavenly Man, and had his Soul and heavenly Fleſh and Blood, by which he reached unto the Saints in all ages, and did refreſh and feed them unto Eternal Life; and foraſmuch as he gave them of his Fleſh and Blood from Heaven, he alſo gave them of his Life and Spirt, as he is the heavenly man or ſecond</hi> Adam; <hi>for the Life and Spirit of the ſecond</hi> Adam <hi>doth extend as far as his heavenly Fleſh and Blood. And thus the Word was made Fleſh from the beginning.</hi> Pag. 103.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:65440:4"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> They believe from hence, that the Manhood of Chriſt (which hath been from the beginning) conſiſts of Fleſh and Blood, this is the Body; and then of a Soul, Spirit, or Life, and that this is the food that Saints are fed withal unto Eternal Life, and calls it the Spirit of the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> believes that both parts of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Fleſh, Blood, and Soul is extended to, and into every Saint in Heaven and Earth. I do but query, whether this Life and Spirit of the Manhood of Chriſt be not the ſame with, or differing from the Holy Ghoſt? If it be not the ſame, but a Creature (as afterwards he confeſſes,) how any thing that is but a Creature can be food for Saints to Eternal Life? and how one Body of Fleſh and Blood can penetrate another? and why this Heavenly man Chriſt ſhould be called by the Author, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> when as he was the firſt <hi>Adam?</hi> for he was a man that had a Body of Fleſh and Blood, and a Soul before <hi>Adam</hi> was. Thus indeed the laſt ſhould be firſt, and the firſt laſt.</p>
            <p>G. K. <hi>For the Saints cannot contain Chriſt even as Man, they only partake of ſome meaſure, or ray, or emanation of him; they have not the center or ſpring of his Soul and Life in them, but only an emanation or ſtream of it; the center and ſpring it ſelf was for moſt part in Heaven, until it deſcended and cloathed it ſelf with the likeneſs of our ſinful fleſh in the Virgins Womb.</hi> Pag. ibid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> We query whether this Manhood of Chriſt that is in every one, be not the ſame with that Light the Quakers have ſo much talked of? and if ſo, then ſee how much they differ among themſelves. <hi>Fox</hi> the younger, in his Book, <hi>Pag.</hi> 53. calls the Light within <hi>the true Eternal God. Keith</hi> here, but <hi>a ray of the Manhood.</hi> They ſay, the ſpring of this Soul and Life was for moſt part in Heaven. Was the man that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo frequently to the Patriarchs without it? They believe this Center &amp; Spring deſcended and cloathed it ſelf with Fleſh in the Virgins womb. Now let them produce one Scripture, and they ſhall carry it, where it is ſaid, the Man or Manhood became Fleſh: It ſaith, <hi>The Word was made Fleſh,</hi> Joh. 1. 1. <hi>God was manifeſted in the Fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. ult. <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 3. <hi>God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh.</hi> Is this Manhood God, is it the Word, is it the Son of God? In the next Quotation mark, he ſaith, <hi>As man he was the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>G. K. ☞ Pag. 104. <hi>And therefore let all the Scriptures be ſearched, and it ſhall not be found that Chriſt became Man, and took to himſelf the Soul of Man at his conception in the Womb of the Virgin, but only that he took Fleſh, and was the ſon of</hi> Mary, David, <hi>and</hi> Abraham <hi>according to the Fleſh; but according to his Heavenly nature, even as man he was the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> They believe that Chriſt did not become man when the Virgin conceived by the overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt, but was man before. They believe that he only took Fleſh, Blood, and Bones of the Virgin, and that this Body thus taken never had ſuch a humane Soul to inform it as ours is, but inſtead of that, the heavenly Fleſh with the Soul of the Manhood of Chriſt informed it, which Manhood is of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature and ſubſtance from ours. Thus Chriſt was never man, had never a humane nature; for as they have ſaid before <hi>Pag.</hi> 102. <hi>The Soul moſt properly is the man,</hi> and Chriſt never had a humane ſoul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Keith;</hi> ſo that he is ſo far from being like to us in all things, that he is not like unto us in any thing; for though he had a Body like to ours, yet that Body is not informed as ours. Herein again he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to us, and how is he (let them tell us) the ſon of <hi>Mary, David,</hi> &amp;c? A ſon is a real man, conſiſting of ſuch a ſoul, as well as body, as <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had. A ſon is not a ſon, if he hath not the ſame nature with the Father and Mother: Now that Chriſt had ſuch a ſoul as others, let the Scriptures be ſearched, and it will be found in <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. ult. <hi>Jeſus increaſed in Wiſdom,</hi> his ſoul was then ſubject to ſome kind of ignorance, though not ſinful; it did not know all preſent or paſt things, and therefore it was not the heavenly Manhood, for that <hi>(Keith</hi> ſaith) is <hi>omniſcient and omnipercipient.</hi> The Scripture ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. <hi>I will raiſe up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet from among their Brethren, like unto thee.</hi> How was Chriſt like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> if he had not a ſoul of the ſame nature with <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſoul? Chriſt (according to <hi>Keith)</hi> when he appeared in Fleſh, was more like to the Angels that appeared in humane ſhape in the time of the Old Teſtament, than like to men. What Spirit was that which Chriſt committed to his Father when he gave up the Ghoſt on the Croſs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 46. Was it the ſoul of the Manhood which <hi>Keith</hi> is ſpeaking of, which afterward he ſaith is <hi>omnipreſent?</hi> And if they are for the pre-exiſtence of the ſoul of Chriſts Manhood, why not for the pre-exiſtence of the ſouls of all other men?</p>
            <p>G. K. Pag. 109. The Author proves the man Chriſt to be in all. <hi>When</hi> Paul <hi>preached to the</hi> Corinthians <hi>and</hi> Galatians <hi>in the time of their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm, he preached Chriſt crucified in them.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>The words in both places according to the Greek Are [crucified in you.] And it was a great part of the myſtery that</hi> Paul <hi>preached unto the</hi> Gentiles, to wit, <hi>Chriſt in the Gentiles.—</hi>See <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>What is the riches of the glory of this myſtery in the</hi> Gentiles? <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>He preached the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable riches of Chriſt in the</hi> Gentiles. <hi>And</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh, preached in the</hi> Gentiles. <hi>So the Greek in all theſe places,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>G. K. Pag. 128. <hi>I ſhall more particularly prove that the man Jeſus, even in the days of his fleſh, did know the thoughts of men, from expreſs teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture,</hi> Matth. 12. 25. <hi>And Jeſus knew their thoughts,</hi> Luk. 6. 8.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> They believe this Manhood of Chriſt perceives and knows all things paſt and preſent of it ſelf, and by it ſelf, conſidered without any relation to, or union with the Deity, and that it needs not God as to the knowledge of any preſent or paſt things, but only as to the things to come, and that it is every where in Heaven, Earth, and Hell; and all this <hi>Keith</hi> aſſerts of the man Jeſus as born of the Virgin, of which <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 24, 25. Let the Reader ſee if all this is not in the laſt Paragraph. We query notwithſtanding what is ſaid to the contrary, whether this is not to conſtitute a new God in time? is it not <hi>Jehovahs</hi> prerogative what is ſpoken, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. from the firſt to the 14. of <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the Reins,</hi> and <hi>being omnipreſent?

As to the firſt he was ignorant of many things as man, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it could not be ſaid that Jeſus grew in Wiſdom, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. ult. As to the ſecond, it is ſpoke, <hi>Now am I no more in the World, and me you have not always, I go away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>G. K. Pag. 131. <hi>The whole ſoul or ſpirit of Chriſt is not in every place, nor in every man, for the ſpring and center, or fountain of it is only in that Body that was crucified on the Croſs at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and is now aſcended and glorified in Heaven, which remaineth the ſame in ſubſtance that it was on Earth, although it be wonderfully changed as to the mode and manner of its being, it being no more a body of Fleſh, Blood, and Bones, but a pure ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real or heavenly body, like unto which the bodies of the Saints are to be at the Reſurrection: for earthly and heavenly are not ſo differing, but that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining one in ſubſtance, they may be changed one into another.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> The Quakers (not to wrong them) believe that beſides the heavenly body of heavenly fleſh and blood which was crucified when <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, Chriſt hath another body of another kind of fleſh and blood taken of the Virgin, and that was crucified without the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But we query wherefore it was offered, whether as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory ſacrifice for Sin, and whether his ſoul was made an offering for Sin according to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10? and if ſo, whether you mean any thing but the ſoul of the heavenly Manhood which he had before the World was? They believe this ſecond latter Body is aſcended, glorified in Heaven, yet remains the ſame in ſubſtance, contrary to their former Faith. When the Queſtion is put to <hi>J. Crook,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether doſt thou believe that the ſame body of man after the departure of the ſoul from it, doth riſe to life again?</hi> anſwers in his late Book called <hi>Counter.

Manhood an emanation rather than a Creation. You ſee they are at a loſs what name to give this Child of their own begetting and breeding in the imagination; can Fleſh and Blood and a humane ſoul be ſaid to ray and beam from God, who is a free and ſimple ſpirit, as light which rays neceſſarily from the body of the Sun, which is a body of light; therefore you ſhall hear he hath denied it again in the next Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>G. K. <hi>For the moſt bleſſed and glorious Diety properly hath no center or rays diſtinct by way of emanation, but rather is all center.—And therefore the bleſſed Deity is as centrally and eſſentially in us as in the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Pag. 136.</p>

By the Neſchamah or Niſchmah I underſtand, that ſubſtantial dignity, and excellency of the ſoul of Chriſt that it hath in its nature, (being a divine nature ſo to ſpeak,) above and beyond the ſouls of all other men and ſpirits of the moſt excellent and holy Angels; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Nepheſeh and Neſchamah be two principles really diſtinct, or two faculties and powers of one only principle, I ſhall not in this place determine, nor is it material to the thing in hand to enquire.</hi>

               <hi>Animad.</hi> They believe that this heavenly Manhood, this Fleſh and Blood, and one of the ſouls at leaſt were breathed into <hi>Adam</hi> when God breathed into <hi>Adam</hi> the breath of life: This I ſuppoſe was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Light in Man. Now it was (as the Author hath ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that Chriſt came to be ſlain in our firſt Parents: I query here whether beſides this Niſchma <hi>Adam</hi> had a rational ſoul, which was the root of his animal ſenſes and diſcourſive parts, and whether this that was breathed into <hi>Adam</hi> was the center of the ſoul of Chriſt, or ſome ray, only, it ſhould be the center, in that Niſchma is the excellency (the Author ſaith) of this ſoul, yet I remember he hath ſaid, that as to the center it was moſt what in Heaven, it may be this was one of the times it came out of Heaven: Now if the Niſchma of Chriſt was in <hi>Adam,</hi> (as this man ſaith,) and yet <hi>Adam</hi> had a diſtinct Nepheſh proper to himſelf, then was <hi>Adam</hi> a more compleat man than Jeſus Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth:</hi> Upon this ſuppoſition that the Author hath ſuggeſted, that Chriſts Nepheſeh may be but a diſtinct faculty of the ſame ſoul; but if neither of the two <hi>Adams</hi> had a rational humane ſoul diſtinct from the Niſchma, which is not of this Creation, as <hi>Keith</hi> ſaith, then neither of the <hi>Adams</hi> were compleat men, neither had the nature of man, but only bodies acted by a divine nature, (as here he calls it,) nay it deſtroys all humane nature, ſo that there never was, nor is a compleat man, as we have had the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a man in the World: for doth not God breath this Niſchma into
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65440:8"/>
every body formed in the Womb as he did into <hi>Adams</hi> body in its crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and let it be conſidered, <hi>Adams</hi> body, and ſo every others mans body had and hath as an intire perſonal union with the God head as the body which Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> had, for ought I can learn from <hi>Keiths</hi> Divinity. It's true he ſaith, the ſoul or ſpirit of the heavenly Manhood of Chriſt hath an immediate and wonderful manner of union with the Deity, as no other ſoul or ſpirit of men were partakers of, <hi>Pag.</hi> 83. but what union the body of Chriſt, that was taken of the Virgin, had with the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which any of the Quakers bodies have not, I cannot yet learn; yet <hi>Keith</hi> ſaith, the center of the ſoul of Chriſt dwells there only ſince it was taken of the Virgin; but then I query what difference betwixt the N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſchma that is the excellency and dignity (as he ſaith) of this ſoul, and the center of it? and is not this Niſchma breathed into every man that is made alive in the womb, as it was breathed into <hi>Adam</hi> in his creation? Look into <hi>Buxtorfs Lexicon</hi> you that are Scholars, and there you will ſee that this curious diſtinction of Nepheſeh and Niſchma is groundleſs. Niſchma ſignifies the very breath as well as the mind and ſoul: ſo Nepheſeh the mind and ſoul as well as breath. It's true the Hebrew uſeth Niſchma moſtwhat for the rational immortal ſoul of man, and this is ſurely the root of the animal ſenſes, and diſcurſive parts; but that it ſhould ſignify ſomething not of this Creation, far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling the holy Angels ſpirits, a divine nature, and yet ſubjected in man as <hi>Keith</hi> affirms, I no where find. Before I leave this, to let you ſee the vanity of this mans reaſoning, from Gods breathing into <hi>Adam</hi> the breath of Life, that <hi>Adam</hi> was made partaker of the ſoul of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt, as well might he ſay that the excellency of the ſoul of the Manhood of Chriſt was in every animal before the Flood, and is now in every Beaſt, Bird: for the ſame word is uſed of the Beaſts, and Fowls, and the creeping things that were deſtroyed by the Flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 22. In whoſe Noſtrils was Niſhmah, Ruach, Chaiim, <hi>(i. e.) The breath of the ſpirit of Life of all that was in the dry Land, died.</hi> I deſire the Scholars to call to mind how this notion of the ſoul of Chriſt in all, ſuits with <hi>Plato</hi>'s of the <hi>Anima Mundi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>G. K. Pag. 145. <hi>But the fleſh of Chriſt that the Saints fed upon, is rather that divine Body, the ſubſtance of which is of another kind than the outward Body, how much ſoever made glorious or spiritual, but this Body cannot ſanctifie us without the ſoul of Chriſt extended into it.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> They believe from hence that Chriſt had and hath two Bodies; one they call divine, the other outward; and thoſe two differ in kind and nature, though the outward Body be now glorious and

ſpiritual. They believe this divine Body of Chriſt is in us, and not alone, but with the ſoul of Chriſts Manhood, and theſe both together do ſanctify us. I query, whether this ſoul of Chriſt be the Holy Ghoſt, but how can that be, when the Author hath ſaid it is a Creature: why then, the Chriſtian hath a great advantage of a Quaker, in that his ſanctification is of another and better nature than that of the Quakers, in that it is the Holy Ghoſt, who is God, who myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally dwells in them: But they underſtand the Holy Ghoſt that is God, is not ſeparated from this Body and Soul of Chriſt, but why then did they not expeſs themſelves ſo? but this is language that the Scripture is not acquainted with, that the Soul of the Manhood of Chriſt is extended into the body of the ſame Manhood, which ſoul and body are both created Beings, and both together are extended into the ſoul of every Saint, and there ſanctifies together with the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>G. K. Pag. 159. <hi>Whoſe nature as man is heavenly and divine, although it be inferior to the Godhead, for he ſaid My Father is greater than I; nor will his omnipreſence, nor omnipercipiency prove that as Man he is as great as the Father: for the whole Univerſe of created Beings of Heaven and Earth, viſible and inviſible, are as the duſt of the Ballance, and drop of the Bucket in compariſon of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> They believe this humane nature is divine: Farewel that diſtinction then, yet its inferiour to the Godhead, yet omnipreſent and omniſcient; but this Author thinks, that omnipreſency and omniſciency may be attributed to the Manhood, yet the Manhood not be confounded with or equalized to the Godhead, contrary to the Doctrine taught by our Chriſtian Divines, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are Attributes of God not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to the Creature, and among them are theſe two, Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and Omnipreſency; theſe cannot be communicated to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it immediately becomes God. Let it be conſidered likewiſe, there is thought by judicious Divines, that there is an infinite ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this Globe of the Heaven and Earth: I query, whether this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood if omnipreſent muſt not be there? By the Authors own Argument it muſt be there, otherwiſe it cannot perceive any ſuch ſpace, nor Gods preſence there: for he hath ſaid, it <hi>perceives nothing</hi> but where it's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>Pag.</hi> 129. <hi>Parag.</hi> 16. and if preſent there throughout, this is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity, and then the Univerſe is but as a drop of the Bucket to the Manhood of Chriſt; is it not then equal to God, and confounded with God.</p>
            <p>G. K. <hi>And therefore that the Heavenly man Chriſt Jeſus, his Spirit, Light, and Life, doth every where extend it ſelf into all things, will not,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65440:9"/>
               <hi>prove that Chriſt as man is equal unto God, nor yet confound his Godhead and Manhood, it only proveth that the man Chriſt Jeſus is a great and mighty, and moſt excellent Being, for above all, and excelling all Men and Angels, and all angelical and heavenly Powers, which is a moſt certain truth, and therefore do all the Angels worſhip him as they are commanded.</hi> Pag. ibid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animad.</hi> He here ſpeaks of the Manhood of Chriſt as diſtinct from the Godhead, not confounded with it, nor equal to it, yet hath omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſency and omnipercipiency Attributes of its own, and of it ſelf in its own nature, is a moſt excellent Being far above all Angels, and thus lays the ground and foundation of the Angels Worſhip upon the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the nature of the Manhood, barely conſidered in it ſelf: I query ſelemnly if it be not grand Idolatry for Men or Angels to worſhip any Creature, and that Creature though never ſo excellent, be not in perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal union with God, and the worſhip terminated upon the Godhead: Chriſt is God and Man, Chriſtians worſhipping him terminates the worſhip upon the Godhead? See if <hi>Keith</hi> hath not made the Angels Idolaters.</p>
            <p>Take but theſe two or three things along with thee Reader in peruſing <hi>Keiths</hi> Book, and all his vain ſcribling is anſwered. 1. That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſpoke of many things that were to come, as if they were preſent. 2. That Chriſt acted in his Mediatorſhip in all things before his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in reference ſtill to his Incarnation, which was to be in the fulneſs of time. 3. That many things in Scripture are ſpoken of Chriſt by that figurative ſpeech of the communication of Properties, when that which is proper to one nature only is attributed to the other, or to the whole Perſon, the reaſon of this is becauſe Chriſt hath two diſtinct natures, but yet is but one Perſon; the Manhood is taken up into perſonal union with the Godhead.</p>
            <p>The Sum of the whole is this, The <hi>Quakers</hi> Chriſt conſiſts, Firſt, Of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, who is God. Secondly, Of a Manhood created, but before the World was. Now this Creature Manhood conſiſts of two parts, 1. The Body. 2. The Soul. The Body conſiſts of two parts, (or as <hi>Pennington</hi> ſaith) of three, <hi>viz.</hi> Fleſh, Blood, and Bones. The Soul conſiſts of three parts, or elſe there are two Souls, (for yet it is not determined,) <hi>viz.</hi> The Center, Niſchma, and the Nepheſch: To theſe ſeven add an eighth, an outward Body, or Veſſel of Fleſh, and Blood, and Bones that was taken of the Virgin, without any rational ſoul as we have, created and infuſed into the Body in the Womb. The firſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly body of Fleſh and Blood is extended throughout Heaven, Earth,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65440:9"/>
and Hell, and infinite imaginary ſpace (for ought I can ſee) is in all Saints, they in all Ages fed upon it, and is in all Men, and in all Devils (for ought I can ſee that is ſaid to the contrary;) the Soul is extended with it into all Saints, Men, Devils, in Heaven, Earth, and Hell, for it is omnipreſent: It is a Creature, but not of this Creation, yet rather an emanation, yet no emanation, for there are no emanations or rays pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly from God: It is inferior to the Deity, yet it is the Word made Fleſh, or incarnate Word, <hi>Pag.</hi> 143. It is omnipreſent and omniſcient: The center of the Soul hath been for the moſt part in Heaven, yet created who knows how long before the Heaven. The rays from this center are only in men, not the center it ſelf, yet the very Niſchma of it which is the excellency of it, was breathed into <hi>Adam.</hi> This man Chriſt hath been every moment ſince the fall crucified in every Sinner, is daily ſlain, dies in this crucifixion as to the Sinner, but yet lives in the ſame Sinner as to it ſelf. The Nepheſh of this Niſchma, or elſe as a diſtinct principle of it ſelf, was the root of the Animal ſenſes and Diſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive parts in that outward Body which was taken of the Virgin, which outward Body is aſcended into Heaven, not changed as to ſubſtance, but is Fleſh and Blood no longer, but a heavenly Body, yet the other firſt and heavenly Body always had and hath Fleſh and Blood in and out of Heaven; ſo then there belongs to Jeſus, 1. The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, two Bodies of different kinds. 2. Souls, yet neither of them a rational and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane like to ours that is formed by <hi>Jehovah</hi> in us, for it is not of this Creation; thus there is a Creation before this Creation that we read of that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and there was a man of Fleſh and Blood in exiſtence before <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let all Chriſtians judge, if this be the Chriſt of God, if this be not another Jeſus, and then the <hi>Quaker</hi> (it will follow) brings in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel, and ſo is acted by another Spirit, and hath therefore a curſe from the Apoſtle upon him, 1 <hi>Gal.</hi> 8. 9. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, The Apoſtle exhorts the Chriſtians, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>Be not carried about with divers and ſtrange Doctrine.</hi> Now here is a ſtrange Doctrine. We read of ſeveral Hereſies touching the Perſon of Chriſt, as 1. the <hi>Macedonians</hi> and <hi>Valentinians</hi> ſaid, that Chriſt brought a heavenly Body from Heaven with him. There is ſomething of this in this Hereſie of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> they do acknowledge he took a body of the Virgin, yet he likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them brought another body from Heaven. 2. <hi>Apellis</hi> ſaid he had an airy Body and ſtarry Fleſh that paſſed through the Virgin, and do not theſe ſay that Chriſt had a heavenly Body, and heavenly Fleſh and Blood, and was not this in the womb of the Virgin, and paſſed through,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65440:10"/>
it with the outward, and is not the outward Body now aereal or ethereal? 3. The <hi>Manachees,</hi> that he had an imaginary Body: ſo theſe, for this heavenly Body and Fleſh was never ſeen, felt, or heard, neither can be by the outward ſenſes, it hath a foundation only in <hi>Keith</hi>'s imagination. 4. <hi>Apollanaris,</hi> that inſtead of the rational Soul the Divinity did inform the Body, they ſay the Niſchma is the Word incarnate, and the Nepheſh of this Niſhma being a part of that one and ſame faculty, is the root of the animal ſenſes of that Body that was taken of the Virgin. 5. The <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> that there were two. Perſons as well as two Natures in Chriſt: The <hi>Quakers</hi> that there are three Natures if not ſour. The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> one. The heavenly Manhood two. The outward Body three. The the Niſchma of the Manhood which he calls a <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> it is above all humane and angelical Nature, yet not the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> it ſelf, ſo that it may be of a middle nature betwixt both here is the fourth Nature, let them tell us plainly whether the outward Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to his Perſon, or is a diſtinct Perſon of it ſelf. 6. The <hi>Eutychians</hi> gave the divine Attributes to the Humane Nature, ſo theſe, they ſay it is omniſcient. 7. The <hi>Ubiquitarians</hi> that aſcribed Majeſty and Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſency to the Humanity, ſo theſe they ſay the Manhood is in all things. Thus. <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> is the common Shore of all the grand Hereſies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perſon of Chriſt, theſe ſeven poyſonous Streams here meet and commence into the black dead Sea of the worſt and neweſt Hereſie called <hi>Quakeriſm.</hi>
