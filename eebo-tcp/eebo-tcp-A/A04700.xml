            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But what and if I denye your antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and proue it by scripture, that faith and not loue is the lyfe of the iustified. Abacuc. ii. The iust man liueth in his faith.

            <p>Abacuc. ii. Also Paul sayth. The life which I nowe lyue in my fleshe, <hi>per
<pb facs="tcp:8385:70"/>
fidem uiuo filij dei.</hi> I lyue it by the faithe of the sonne of god.

But I argew thus to you, Charite can not loue god onles she first knowe god. but by faith iustifienge god is firste knowne, ergo faith iustifienge is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore charite louinge. Wherfore cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie iustifieth not. For the thynge muste be firste knowen ere it be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, Then thus, faith iustifienge is before charitie louyng, For the man is iustified in the former accion of faith knowyng &amp; beleuinge in gods mercye thorowe christe. For faith is a lyuelye faith in hir owne proper work of beleif into christ, ere she wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth by charite. But you wold make charitie egall in accion with faythe, in the worke of iustificacion, whiche

ye shall neuer do with all the popes lawe ne with all his dirtye diuinite, ye haue. And to proue your popishe parte, ye sweate greatly to ioyne life to charitie as though then ye hadde your purpose.

How proue ye that the turke may do well to thatainement of iustificacion when he neuer enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to knowne beleue in Christe to be God and man, his sauior, ne to be iustifyed by his passion? but only by the good works of Mahumets lawe as ye by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good workis of the popis lawe. by which your good dedis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thei ne you shal euer be iustified <hi>Where vnto herken a litle here how wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely ye speke in your iustificacion by onely faith.

And therfore your (Iffes) sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in a wrong place. For your baptisme with water is such a condicion, that as al thei that be baptized therwith, be not therfore saued, so were not all they that beleued in christ, and al the chosen infantes conteined vnder the promise, dyinge before circumcision or baptisme dampned, but withoute circumcision and baptisme of water saued by election and their beleif.</p>
            <p>And therefore your doctrine of your (Iffes) holdeth not.

ne mans work may do that thing. It is god only in christ that regenereth with the spirit of faith,<note place="margin">i. pet. iii. Titu. iii. Ioan. iii. i.

If you shulde tarye till ye haue fulfilled all your conditions for your saluacion, ye shulde come to short of the gates shuttinge. And therefore merciablye saith the lorde in Isay.

<pb facs="tcp:8385:171"/>
no saluacion nether as causes effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes ne formall.
