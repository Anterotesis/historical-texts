         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now because I had in no respect offended them, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded wherefore they molested me, saying it was contrary to law and the profession of Christians. Then did they aske me if I had spoken any thing against the king, and against the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> I answered nothing.

He immediatly commaunded me to prison, whether they carried me, and put a paire of shackles on my h√©eles, where I remained two daies. Then was I brought forth into a Church, where the Inquisitor sate vsually in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: who being ready set, commaunded me to kn√©ele downe and to do homage to certaine images which were before me, I tolde him I would not do that which I knew to be contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of Almighty God, neither had I b√©ene brought vp in the <hi>Romaine</hi> lawe, neither would I submit my selfe to it. He asked me why I would not?

I would not now commit Idolatrie, which is vtterly con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Then the Inquisitor charged me (as at all other times he vsed to do) that I should speake what I had to say, and to speake the truth, otherwise I should be euen now tormented to the death I s√©eing my selfe in the hands of such cruell tyrants, as alwayes thirst after the bloud of the innocent, euen as <hi>Caine</hi> who being wroth with his brother <hi>Abell,</hi> and carrying an heauie counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, could no way be eased but with his brothers bloud: so I past hope of life, turned my back toward them, and s√©eing my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments present before me, I fell downe vpon my kn√©es, &amp; besought the Lord to forgiue me my sinnes, and to strengthen my faith,

Then s√©eking further, I found a long Cane whereon there hung many puddings and Sauceges, I plucked downe the Cane, but had little minde on the victuall. Then I found certaine kniues, then I espied some light at a great window in a Garret or loft ouer me: wherefore I tied a crooked knife to the Cane, and thrust vp a long Towell, and with the knife at the end of the Cane I drew the Towell about a barre of the window, and drew it to me, and with that towell I did climbe vp into the windowe, but then I could not get forth betw√©ene the barres, wherefore I digged forth one of the barres, and tyed my towels and napkins together end to end, and fastned one end to a barre of the windowe, and then did slide downe by them till I came within thr√©e or foure fathom of the ground, when the towels brake in sunder, and I fell downe into a Well which was direct vnder me, where I was almost drowned: yet it pleased God to deliuer me.

Then went I with all sp√©ede into the woods, lying all dayes in woods as close as I could, and trauailed by nights thorow woods and mountaines: and vpon the third night about midnight, I happened into an Oliue garden, not aboue halfe a bow shoote from the sea side, in which garden I found a little skiffe or boate lying vnder a Pomegranate tr√©e, and there lay in the boate a hatchet, all which serued happily for my deliuery.</p>

            <figure/>
            <p>I was no sooner brought before this Nobleman, but he
<pb facs="tcp:6462:14"/>
demanded whether I would turne <hi>Moore,</hi> I answered that I would not immediatly he commanded a paire of shackels to be put on my h√©eles, and a claspe of Iron about my neck<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> with a chaine thereat<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
            </p>
            <p>Then was I set vpon a Mule, and conveyed to <hi>Cookooe,</hi> where the King lay<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> when I was came thether I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently brought before
<figure/>
the king: who inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what I was, and from whence I came &amp; what my pretence was. I aunswered that I was an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman, and that I came from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian shore, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to passe to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gire.</hi> Then he asked me what I could do. I tolde him I could do nothing. Then he demanded whether I were a Gunner,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gunners are in great esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation with them.</hi>
               </note> I said no: then he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded me very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to y√©elde to their religion, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to preferre me: wherefore, I desired him to giue me liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to depart, for my desire is to be in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with my wife and children. Yea, said he, but how wilt thou come there, for they minded to k√©epe me still: and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the king assayed to seduce me with promises of great preferment, saying: if I would serue him and turne <hi>Moore,</hi> I should want nothing. But on the contrary, I besought him to giue me libertie to go to <hi>Argire,</hi> where I was in hope to
<pb facs="tcp:6462:14"/>
be deliuered, and sent home to mine owne countrie.</p>
            <p>Now he s√©eing he could winne me by no gentle meanes, commaunded me to prison, saying, that he would either make me to y√©elde and turne <hi>Moore,</hi> or else I should die in capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie.</p>
            <p>In this while that I remained in prison, diuerse of the kings house came to me, perswading me to y√©elde to the kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, alledging how hardly the king might vse me, being now in his power, vnable any way to escape, and againe how bountifully the king would deale with me, if I would submit my selfe.</p>
            <p>Within a little time after, it happened there was great preparation for to receiue the King of <hi>Abbesse,</hi> whose coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try adioineth to the king of <hi>Cookooes</hi> land, and are in league together, and ioyne their armies in one against the king of <hi>Argire.</hi> Now at his comming, I was fetcht foorth of prison, and commaunded to charge certaine p√©eces of Ordinance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>These men are nothing expert in Artillerie.</hi>
               </note> which were thr√©e Sacres and two Minions of brasse, which I refused not to doe, trusting thereby to get some libertie, wherefore at the comming of this king of <hi>Abbesse</hi> into the towne, I discharged the Ordinance as liked them very well, for they are not very expert in that exercise, for which I had some more libertie then before.</p>
            <p>This King of <hi>Abbesse</hi> tarrying some certaine time there in consulting with the king of <hi>Cookooe,</hi> for matters tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the warres with <hi>Argire,</hi> and vnderstanding of me, sent for me, bring very desirous to talke with me, where after cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine questions, he desired of the other king that he might buie me, which he would not graunt. Then the King of <hi>Cabiles</hi> or <hi>Cookooe</hi> perswaded me very seriouslie to serue him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and to turne <hi>Moore,</hi> and offered to giue me vij. hundred Dubles by the yeare,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Very many offers of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment to drawe me from the word of God.</hi>
               </note> which amounteth to the summe of fiftie pounds of English money, and moreouer to giue me by the day thirtie Aspers (which is worth twelue pence English) to finde me meate, and likewise to giue me a house and lande sufficient to sowe an hundreth bushels of graine yearely, and two Plowe of Oxen, furnished to till the same: also to furnish me with horse, Musket, Sworde, and other necessaries, such
<pb facs="tcp:6462:15"/>
as they of that country vse. And lastly he offered to giue me a wife fr√©ely, which they est√©emed the greatest matter, for al buy their wiues at a great price, yea if there were any in his court could content me I should make my choise, but if there were not, he would prouide one to my contentment, whatsoeuer it should cost him. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> he perceiued all he said was in vaine, he sent the Qu√©ene and her gentle women to talke with me.
<figure/>
When she came, she very courteously intreated me to turne and serue the King, and to consider well what a large offer the King had made, saying, that I was much vnlike to come to any like preferment in my country: and many times she would shew me her Gentlewomen, and aske me if none of them could please me, but I tolde her I had a wife in mine
<pb facs="tcp:6462:15"/>
owne country to whome I had vowed my faith before God and the world, which vow I said I would neuer breake while we both liued. Then she sayd she could but maruaile what she should be whome I est√©emed so much<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> as to refuse such offers of preferment for her sake, being now where I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in captiuity &amp; slauery, all the daies of my life, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> she<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> could preuaile no way with me, when she had vttered these forsaid sp√©eches, &amp; many other which were friuolous to reherse, she left me, yet by her meanes I had more libertie then before.</p>
            <p>After this I was set to sawe Boardes and Plankes, and was commaunded to make a carriage for a p√©ece of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: Thus they compelled me to labour daily, which I did the more willingly, because I hoped still to get my libertie thereby in the end. Then they willed me to shew the fashion of our edge tooles after the English, which when they saw the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, their Smithes wrought them very artificially, &amp; gaue them very good temper: for these things I was had in more estimation, insomuch that they tooke off my Irons, and let me walke abroad with a k√©eper. Then was I commanded by the king,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I was made maister of worke wherin I had but small skill.</hi>
               </note> to teach the Carpenters to frame a house after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of English building, and for that purpose were sent foorth Carpenters and workemen with me to the woods to fall tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, all which were to do what I appointed vpon the kings commandement. Now I being chiefe Maister of the worke, appointed out the tr√©es which were very speciall good timber: in small time we had finished our frame, which liked the King very well. By this means I had more liberty then before, and was very well intreated, yet I was greatly gr√©eued in minde, that I could not procure any meanes for my liberty, although at that time I wanted few necessaries: yet was I daily deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing how I might escape away, for thr√©e speciall causes: one was, for the speciall care I had of my saluation, because (as you haue heard) there were many temptations laide before me, to drawe me from a Christian to be an abhominable idolatour. The second cause was, for the loue &amp; dutifull allegiance which I owe to my Prince &amp; naturall countrie. The third is, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the vow which I had vowed in matrimonie, &amp; the care of my poore wife &amp; children: which causes mooued me so much,
<pb facs="tcp:6462:16"/>
that whereas by reason of my diligence in these foresaid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I walking abroad with my k√©eper, who not suspecting me, was not so attentiue as before he had b√©ene. So soone as our frame was finished, I tooke opportunitie, and shewing them a paire of heeles, tooke my way ouer the Mountaines, intending to go for <hi>Argire.</hi> But presently there was great store of men, both on horseback and one foote, who being more perfect in the way then I was, quickly ouertooke me, &amp; caried me back againe to <hi>Cookooe.</hi> I was presently brought before the King, who asked me why I ran away? I told him to haue libertie. Then he called certaine of his seruants to him, and commanded them to lay me downe at his f√©ete, which foure of them did, and laying me flat vpon the belly, one of them gaue me 75 stripes with a great cudgell, till I was not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue out of the place. Then the king commanded to carie me to prison againe, whether two of them caried me, and put me in Irons and there left me, where I remained for the space of two moneths:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I was now made a water bearer.</hi>
               </note> then was I brought forth of prison, &amp; sent daily to a fountaine or well, about halfe a league from the towne to fetch water with a couple of Asses, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vse of the kings house.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6462:16"/>Now in this time many artificers, as Smithes, Ioynces, and carpenters, and many other, came to me to vnderstand the fashion of many English tooles, as Plane yrons, Goudges<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Chissels, and such like, for which they shewed me some fauour, and gaue me some money: and when I had gotten a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I bestowed it vpon apparrell, and caused it to be made like to theirs, which I caried secretly, when I went to fetch water, and did hide it in a drie caue vnder the side of a rocke: I bought me likewise a sworde and a launce, such as they vse to trauaile with, I also prouided a file, all which I laide vp with my apparell.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>It happened that the King of <hi>Abbesse,</hi> came againe to visit the King, and to take counsails about warlike affaires, as vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb facs="tcp:6462:17"/>
they did, wherefore when they heard of his comming, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great preparation for him, it fell out so that there wanted water, in the offices: where in an euening there was exc√©eding thunder<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and raine, and lightning so that there was no man would goe for water, but euery one calling for the English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: then I, which durst say no nay, tooke the vessels, and hung them vpon the Asses, and so went thorow raine, and winde, and thunder, and all, till I came to the well, where I left my Asses, to wander whither they would, and went to my apparrell, and with my File cut off my yrons, and made me ready, in my sute of Moores clothing, and with my sworde by my side, and my Launce on my shoulder, tooke my way once againe towards <hi>Argire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that night I went about twentie miles ouer Rockes, and mountaines, k√©eping my selfe out of beaten waies, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my way by the moone and starres. When the day began to be light I lay me downe in a brake of thicke bushes, and there I slept the most parte of the day, and in the euening I began to trauell forth on my way.</p>
            <p>Now on the third night I was to passe a bridge where was continuall watch, and warde, both day and night, where I must of necesitie passe, by reason the riuer ran betwixt two mountaines which were so st√©epe that no man can neither goe downe to enter water, nor yet b√©eing in, can by any possible meanes get vp on the other side, which riuer is a great defence to the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Where I vsed no delay but entered the Bridge in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the night, about nine of the clocke, being in great doubt of the watch, but at the first end of the Bridge I sawe no man, vntill I was happily passed ouer, then there came one after me and asked who goes there, it being somewhat darke and I in apparrell and with my weapons like a Moore, of their countrey, answered bouldly that I was a freind and tolde him I was comming to the Gouernour to deliuer letters from the King, for neere the riuers side there is a Uillage, where dwelleth hee who hath charge of the k√©eping of this passage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6462:17"/>Whereby I went onward thorow the Uillage, but before I was farre passed: I heard horsemen vpon the Bridge, which asked whether any man had passed that night, the watchmen told them there was one gone euen now, which said he went to deliuer the Kings letters to the Officer.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>But I thought no time now to heare any more of their talke but betooke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e to my h√©eles, and so soone as I was without the Towne I went out of the Porte way, into woodes, and kept desert wayes that night and day following. And the next night I came within the liberties of the King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gire,</hi> where I knew the <hi>Cabiles,</hi> could not fetch me backe againe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6462:18"/>In this order I escaped their hands, by the mightie power of God: for vnderstand, that in these desart Mountaines there are all manner of wilde beasts in great number,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Many dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wilde beasts in that countrey.</hi>
               </note> as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Beares, Woolues of marueilous bignesse, Apes, wilde Swine, and also wilde Horses and Asses, with many other hurtfull beasts, yet was I neuer in danger of any of these.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>In this countrie of <hi>Cabyles,</hi> there is diuerse kindes of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie pure mettales, as Golde, Siluer, and Lead, and good Yron and St√©ele, but they for want of knowledge and skill, make no vse of any mettall, except Yron and St√©ele: although at such times as I haue b√©ene present whiles the Smithes haue tryed their Yron, I haue s√©ene among the drosse of the Yron very perfect golde, which they perceiuing me to beholde, were very inquisitiue to vnderstand whether it were golde, or any
<pb facs="tcp:6462:18"/>
other mettall of substance: but I tolde them it was but a kinde of drosse, whereof we made coulours for paint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> in England.</p>
            <p>They caried me out to the Mountaines, and shewed me the rockes where they gathered their Yron, which rocks had vaines of very pure golde Oare, which I would not reueile to them, but answered as before: because I doubted if the king once knew me to haue experience in such mysteries, he would k√©epe me the more straight, whereby I might haue remained in bondage during my life.</p>
            <p>Now when I was within the countrie of <hi>Argire,</hi> I was out of danger from the pursuers, and then did I walke by day, and kept the common wayes, where comming within the view of <hi>Argire,</hi> vpon the way I met a Turke, who knew me at the first sight, since I was prisoner in <hi>Argire,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded if I had not b√©ene captiue with such a man? I sayd yes: he then inquired whether I wente to the citie? I saide yes, then returned he backe, and did accompanie me to the Citie.</p>
            <p>When I came there, I would haue gone to the English house, but he led me violently to my olde Maister, where I rested me a day and a night, my maister not being very earnest, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in this time that I was absent all the English captiues were red√©emed and sent home. Wherefore I went to the English counsell, hoping to be presently deliuered, who gaue me very good words, but did not shew me that fauour which he professed.</p>
            <p>I could make some discourse of his vnkinde dealing with me and other of our countreymen, which I will leaue till moe fit occasion: for vnderstand that whiles I was with him, there came a messenger from my olde maister, with whome I was before I went to <hi>Genua,</hi> who would haue caried me away by force, but I would not goe, requesting the counsell to take order for my deliuerie: but he perswaded me to goe with him, saying, that he would in time prouide for my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</p>
            <p>But by meanes I would not y√©elde to go to my Maister, nor yet the counsell would not take order for me I was taken
<pb facs="tcp:6462:19"/>
by the kings officers, and put in chaines in the Kings prison among other captiues: and at the next setting out of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies I was put to my olde occupation, where I remained a Galley slaue for thr√©e yeares and aboue after.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>In which time I was eight voyages at sea, and at such time as the Galleys lay in harbour, I was imprisoned with the rest of the captiues, where our ordinarie foo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e was bread and water, and at some fewe times, as once or twise in the w√©eke a small quantitie of sodden wheat.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I passed my time in sicknesse and extreame slauerie, vntill by the helpe of an honest Marchant of this citie of <hi>London,</hi> and hauing a very fitte opportunitie by meanes of certaine our English ships were ready to set saile bound homeward, vpon Christmas euen being the 23 of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1592.

            <p>Thus haue you heard how it hath pleased the Almightie God (after many and great miseries) to bring me to the porte which I longed greatly to s√©e: bes√©eching God of his mercy, to prolong the dayes of our most gratious and renowmed Qu√©ene, whose fame reacheth faire, and whose most happy gouernment is in admiration with forraine Princes<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> So wishing all to t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
