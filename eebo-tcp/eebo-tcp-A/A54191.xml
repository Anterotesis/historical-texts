            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF it was permitted to <hi>Antient Chriſtians</hi> to
Addreſs <hi>Pagan Emperours,</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> to
Solicite <hi>Chriſtian Caeſars</hi> for Indulgence,
with Succeſs, 'twere Rude in us, to doubt the
Iſſue of a Diſcourſe of this Stile and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
with our Superiors, when the Intereſt
of the <hi>Monarch,</hi> as well as Miſeries of ſome
of His <hi>Subjects</hi> make it neceſſary. For if we
conſider the great Numbers that are Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
in their <hi>Livelihoods,</hi> and ſome that
languiſh to Death by <hi>Confinement,</hi> and the
<hi>Spoil</hi> that is daily made of the <hi>Eſtates</hi> of others
by <hi>Fines,</hi> and the laviſh and exceſſive way of
raiſing them, for pure <hi>Diſſent</hi> in Matters of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:</hi>
And on the other hand, how <hi>Injurious</hi> a
ſtate of <hi>Severity</hi> is to the Intereſt of the <hi>Prince,</hi>
by the <hi>Diſcouragement</hi> and <hi>Poverty</hi> of ſo great
a Number of His People; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
how much a <hi>diſcreet Indulgence</hi> would
contribute to the <hi>Trade, Peace</hi> and <hi>Amity</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:45312:3"/>
His <hi>Kingdom,</hi> we ſhall be forc'd to conclude,
That in <hi>Prudence</hi> as well as <hi>Conſcience,</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
is a deſirable thing.</p>
            <p>It were, doubtleſs, one of the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
things in the World, that Mankind
were of <hi>One Mind,</hi> becauſe the occaſion that
we ſee is taken at the Differences Men have
about <hi>Religion,</hi> that ſhould teach them to
agree, make them ſo uneaſie, and unhappy
one to another. But the pleaſure of that
Harmony is a thing to be wiſht, rather
than yet expected. 'Tis Fact we differ, and
upon a point wherein <hi>Vnity</hi> is out of our
Power: ſuch as we are, what ſhall we do?
Deſtroy one another for our Differences,
or be moderate, and try a <hi>diſcreet Liberty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men</hi> muſt thank themſelves for their <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity,</hi>
that ſuffer their <hi>Opinions</hi> to deſtroy their
<hi>Affections.</hi> Let us reflect what it was confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the firſt <hi>Tongue,</hi> and if Diſobedience has
not divided <hi>Man's Judgment?</hi> yet we do not war
for Mother-Tongue, nor ought we for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<hi>Man's</hi> Fault has been to ſlight the
<hi>Divine Oracle</hi> in his perſuit of Truth, and
he is apt to entitule his own Thoughts to her
Reputation. Too many things in Religion,
<pb facs="tcp:45312:3"/>
and thoſe too fine and nice, made neceſſary
to be believed, have preſt ſo hard upon the
Liberty of Mankind, that Nature heaves
againſt the Burden.</p>
            <p>We ought in Charity to preſume, that all
men think they chuſe the beſt way to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
eſpecially where the choice is againſt
the Stream, and draws Loſs or Diſgrace after
it. If they are Miſtaken, they muſt be
Rectified there where the Miſtake lies, and
that is in the Underſtanding: And to
do it Succeſsfully, there muſt be <hi>Light</hi> and
<hi>Moderation:</hi> God gives one, and it is our Duty
and Wiſdom to exerciſe the other.</p>
            <p>Let us then pray to Almighty God, <hi>That he
would enlighten our Vnderſtandings;</hi> And to the
end we may obtain our deſire, let us be ſure
to uſe the Light we have, and more will be
given us. Let us with it ſee if Expedients
may not be found to unite our <hi>Intereſts,</hi> and
ſo our <hi>Affections,</hi> if not our <hi>Faiths.</hi> How to
keep the <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Indulge Diſſenters</hi> ſafely,
ſerves the <hi>Government.</hi> And to ſee clear, we
muſt put away the Prejudices of former
Heats; and not call <hi>Wrath, Zeal,</hi> nor <hi>Railing,
Loyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45312:4"/>
As things now are, what is beſt to be done?
I take to be the Wiſe Man's Queſtion; as to
conſider and anſwer it, will be his Buſineſs.
<hi>Moderation</hi> is a Chriſtian Duty. <hi>Let your</hi>
Moderation <hi>be known to all Men:</hi> And has ever
been the Prudent Man's Practice. Thoſe
<hi>Governments</hi> that have uſed it in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
have Succeeded beſt, and the contrary
been unhappy. I remember, it is made in
<hi>Livy</hi> the Wiſdom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they
relaxed their hand to the <hi>Privernates;</hi> for by
making their Conditions eaſie, they made
them moſt faithful to their Intereſt. And
it prevailed ſo much with the <hi>Petilians,</hi> that
they would endure any Extremity from
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> rather than deſert their Friendſhip,
that had governed them with ſo much <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi>
even then, when the <hi>Romans</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
their Fidelity, and ſent them the
Diſpair of knowing they could not relieve
them. So did one Act of <hi>Humanity</hi> overcome
the <hi>Faliſci</hi> above Arms: Which confirms that
noble Saying of <hi>Seneca, Mitius imperanti, Melius
paretur,</hi> the Mildeſt Conduct is beſt obeyed:
A Truth Celebrated by <hi>Grotius</hi> &amp; <hi>Campanella:</hi>
Practiſed, doubtleſs, by the braveſt Princes.
<pb facs="tcp:45312:4"/>
For <hi>Cyrus</hi> exceeded when he built the <hi>Jews</hi> a
Temple, and himſelf no <hi>Jew. <hi>Alexander</hi>
               </hi> Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
the Princes of his Train with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Veneration he paid the High Prieſt of
that People. And <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was ſo far from
Suppreſſing the <hi>Jewiſh Worſhip,</hi> that he ſent
<hi>Hecatombs</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to encreaſe their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Moderation</hi> fill'd the Reigns of the moſt
Renowned <hi>Caeſars:</hi> They were <hi>Nero's</hi> and
<hi>Caligulas</hi> that lov'd Cruelty then.</p>
            <p>But that which in a ſingular manner
makes <hi>Moderation</hi> the <hi>King's Intereſt,</hi> is that
thoſe penal Laws which vex <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſeem
in themſelves <hi>Antimonarchical;</hi> and it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
leſs to be wonder'd if any of them have
been tempted to be ſo too. For whereas the
Prerogative is the peculiar Glory of the <hi>King;</hi>
That which gives weight and luſtre to his
Crown, it, is ſo ſhar'd by theſe Laws, to <hi>Poor</hi>
and <hi>Informers,</hi> that the <hi>KING</hi> can but put in
for a third of his own Power: A <hi>Triumvirat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
or <hi>Three Eſtates</hi> of <hi>Prerogative: King,
Poor</hi> and <hi>Informers:</hi> For tho' the King would
remit, and the Circumſtances of the Perſon
deſerve a Pardon, it cannot be, without
the Conſent of the other Two: which is a
<pb facs="tcp:45312:5"/>
kind of an Excluſion from two thirds of his
Power, and ſo a <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of that entire
Prerogative that his Anceſtors had, &amp; is his
undoubted Right in the like caſes. And as
ſome of theſe Laws injure the <hi>Prince,</hi> ſo they
deeply affect the <hi>Subject.</hi> For People are not
only tempted to Inform by <hi>Rewards,</hi> (to be
ſure, not the cleaneſt way of Juſtice) but
the <hi>Oaths</hi> of ſuch are made the <hi>Evidence</hi> to
Convict; which is <hi>Swearing in their own Cauſe,
and to their own profit.</hi> But this is not all, Men
are <hi>Try'd, Caſt and Fin'd, without a Jury.</hi> An
expreſs Contradiction to one of the moſt
celebrated Branches of the <hi>Great Charter.</hi>
So that the Intereſt of <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People</hi> (as
they ever ſhould) conſpire in the <hi>Repeal</hi> of
thoſe Laws that furniſh harſh and unkind
Folks with the Power of diſturbing their
Conſcientious Neighbours, and which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
the Prince to Receive and Redreſs the
<hi>Complaints</hi> of ſuch of his Suffering <hi>Subjects.</hi>
The Example is to <hi>both</hi> dangerous, but to the
<hi>KING</hi> moſt.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Church of England</hi> claims the <hi>King's
Promiſe of Protection;</hi> 'tis fit ſhe has it. But
her <hi>Diſſenters</hi> cannot forget <hi>That</hi> of his
<pb facs="tcp:45312:5"/>
               <hi>Clemency:</hi> And as they were both great, and
admirably diſtinguiſh't, ſo by no means are
they inconſiſtent or impracticable.</p>
            <p>And if his Juſtice will not let him be
wanting in the <hi>One,</hi> His wonted greatneſs
of Mind will hardly let him leave the <hi>Other</hi>
behind him in the Storm, <hi>unpitied</hi> and <hi>unhelpt.</hi>
Pardon me, We have not to do with an inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<hi>Prince,</hi> but one <hi>Toucht with our Infirmities.</hi>
More than any Body fit to judge our Cauſe, by
the ſhare he once had in it. Who ſhould give
Liberty of Conſcience <hi>like the Prince that has
wanted it?</hi> To ſuffer for his own was Great,
but to deliver other mens, were Glorious. It
is a ſort of paying the Vows of his Adverſity,
and it cannot therefore be done by any one
elſe, with ſo much <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Far be it from me to ſolicite any thing in
Deminution of the juſt Rights of the <hi>Church
of England:</hi> Let her reſt protected where
ſhe is, and if in any thing Miſtaken, let
<hi>God</hi> alone perſwade her. I hope, none will
be thought to intend her Injury, for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to underſtand the <hi>King's Promiſe</hi> to her, in
a <hi>Ruinous ſenſe</hi> to all Others. For it is morally
impoſſible that a <hi>Conſcientious Prince</hi> can be
<pb facs="tcp:45312:6"/>
thought to have ty'd himſelf to compell
others to a Communion, that himſelf cannot
tell how to be of, or that any thing can oblige
him to ſhake the Firmneſs of thoſe he has
confirmed by his own <hi>Royal Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having then ſo Illuſtrous an Inſtance of
<hi>Integrity,</hi> as the hazard of the loſs of <hi>Three
Crowns</hi> for <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Let it at leaſt, excuſe
our <hi>Conſtancy,</hi> and provoke the Friends of the
<hi>Succeſſion</hi> to <hi>Moderation,</hi> that we may none of us
looſe our <hi>Birth-Rights</hi> for our <hi>Perſwaſion;</hi> &amp; us
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> to live <hi>Dutifully,</hi> and ſo <hi>Peacably</hi> under
our own Vine, and under our own Fig-Tree,
with <hi>Glory to God on High,</hi> to the <hi>King, Honour,</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ODERATION, the Subject of this
Diſcourſe, is in plain Engliſh, <hi>Liberty
of Conſcience to Diſſenters:</hi> A Cauſe
I have, with all Humility undertaken
to plead againſt the Prejudices of the
Times.</p>
            <p>That there is ſuch a thing as <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and the
<hi>Liberty</hi> of it, in reference to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> towards
God, muſt not be denyed, even by thoſe, that are moſt
ſcandal'd at the <hi>Ill</hi> uſe ſome ſeem to have made of ſuch
Pretences. But to ſettle the Terms: By <hi>Conſcience,</hi> I
underſtand <hi>the Apprehenſion and Perſwaſion a man has of his
Duty to God.</hi> By <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> I mean, <hi>A free
and open Profeſſion and Exerciſe of that Duty:</hi> But I alwayes
premiſe, this <hi>Conſcience</hi> to keep within the bounds of <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
and that it be neither <hi>Frantick</hi> nor <hi>Miſchievous,</hi> but a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45312:7"/>
               <hi>Good Subject,</hi> a <hi>Good Child,</hi> a <hi>Good Servant:</hi> As exact to
yield to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, as jealous of
with-holding from <hi>God</hi> the thing that is <hi>God</hi>'s: For he
that with-holds from Man the thing that God requires him
to pay, with-holds it from God, who has his Tribute out
of it. They do not reject their Prince, Parent or Maſter,
but God, who enjoyns that Duty to them: The difference
being only this, They deny not God his Due immediately,
and to his face, but they do it too often in the Perſon of his
Deligate. Thoſe Pathetick words of Chriſt will naturally
enough reach the caſe, <hi>In that ye did it not to them, ye did it not
to me;</hi> for Duty to ſuch Relations have a divine Stamp: And
divine Right runs through more things of the World and Acts
of our Lives than we are aware of: And Sacriledge may be
committed againſt more than the Church. Nor will a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
to God, of the Robbery from Man, expiate the
Guilt of Diſobedience: For though Zeal could turn <hi>Goſſip</hi>
to Theft, his Altars would renounce the Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſcience</hi> then that I ſtate, and the <hi>Liberty</hi> I pray,
carrying ſo great a <hi>Salvo</hi> and Deference to publick and
private Relations, no ill deſign can with any Juſtice be fixt
upon the Author, or Reflection upon the Subject, which by
this time I think I may venture to call a <hi>Toleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to this ſo much craved, as well as needed</hi> Toleration,
<hi>I meet with two Objections of weight, the ſalving of which
will make way for it in this Kingdom. And the firſt is a
Disbelief of the Poſſibility of the thing.</hi> Toleration of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Worſhips from that eſtabliſh't, is not practicable <hi>(ſay ſome)</hi>
without danger to the State, with which it is interwoven. <hi>This
is</hi> Political. <hi>The other Objection is,</hi> That admitting Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be in the Wrong (which is alwayes premiſed by the National
Church) ſuch Latitude were the way to keep up the Diſ-union, and
inſtead of compelling them into a better Way, leave them in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45312:7"/>
poſſeſſion and perſuit of their old Errors. <hi>This is</hi> Religious. I
<hi>think I have given the Objections fairly, 'twill be my next
buſineſs to anſwer them as fully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſtrength of the firſt Objection againſt this Liberty,
is the <hi>Danger</hi> ſuggeſted to the <hi>State;</hi> the Reaſon is, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Form being <hi>interwoven</hi> with the Frame of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But this ſeems to me only ſaid, and not only (with
ſubmiſſion) not prov'd, but not true: For the eſtabliſht
Religion and Worſhip are no other ways interwoven with
the Government, than that the Government makes profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of them, and by divers-Laws has made them the <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Religion,</hi> and required all the Members of the State to
conform to it.</p>
            <p>This is nothing but what may as well be done by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
for any other Perſwaſion, as that. 'Tis true, 'tis
not eaſie to change an eſtabliſh't Religion, nor is that the
Queſtion we are upon; but <hi>State Religions</hi> have been chang'd
without the change of the <hi>States.</hi> We ſee this in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> upon the <hi>Reformation:</hi>
But more clearly and near our ſelves, in the caſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the
<hi>eighth, Edward</hi> the <hi>ſixth, Queen Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> for the
Monarchy <hi>stood,</hi> the Family <hi>remained</hi> and <hi>ſucceeded</hi> under all
the Revolutions of State-Religion, which could not have
been, had the Propoſition been generally true.</p>
            <p>The change of Religion then, does not <hi>neceſſarily</hi> change
the Government, or alter the State; and if ſo, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
of Church-Diſſenters, does not <hi>neceſſarily</hi> hazard a
change of the State, where the preſent State-Religion or
Church remains the ſame; for That I premiſe.</p>
            <p>Some may ſay, <hi>That it were more facile to change from one
National Religion to another, than to maintain the Monarchy
and Church, againſt the Ambition and Faction of divers
diſſenting Parties.</hi> But this is improbable at leaſt. For it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45312:8"/>
were to ſay, That it is an eaſier thing to change a whole
Kingdom, than with the Soveraign Power, followed with
<hi>Armies, Navies, Judges, Clergy,</hi> and all the <hi>Conformists</hi> of
the Kingdom, to ſecure the Government from the Ambition
and Faction of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as differing in their Intereſts
within themſelves, as in their Perſwaſions; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they
united, have neither Power to awe, nor Rewards to allure
to their Party. They can only be formidable, when <hi>headed</hi>
by the Soveraign. They may ſtop a <hi>Gap,</hi> or make, by his
<hi>Acceſſion,</hi> a Ballance: Otherwiſe, till 'tis harder to fight
broken and divided Troops, than an entire Body of an Army,
it will be always <hi>eaſier</hi> to maintain the Government under
a Toleration of Diſſenters, than in a total change of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and even then it ſelf, it has not fail'd to have been preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
But whether it be more or leſs eaſie, is not our point;
if they are many, the danger is of exaſperating, not of
making them eaſie; for the force of our Queſtion is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch Indulgence be ſafe to the State? And here we
have the firſt and laſt, the beſt and greateſt Evidence for
us, which is <hi>Fact</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> the Journal and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
of Time, and Treaſure of the Sage.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> the <hi>Iews,</hi> that had moſt to ſay for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and whoſe Religion was <hi>Twin</hi> to their State (both
being joyn'd, and ſent with Wonders from Heaven) <hi>Indulg'd</hi>
Strangers in their Religious Diſſents. They requir'd but the
belief of the <hi>Noachical</hi> Principles, which were common to the
World: No <hi>Idolator,</hi> and but a <hi>Moral Man,</hi> and he had his
<hi>Liberty,</hi> ay, and ſome <hi>Priviledges</hi> too, for he had an apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Temple, and this without danger to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Thus <hi>Maimonides,</hi> and others of their own Rabbles,
and <hi>Grotius</hi> out of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was very admireable in this,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45312:8"/>
that though they had many Sects of Philoſophers among
them, each diſſenting from the other in their Principles, as
well as Diſcipline, and that not only in Phyſical things, but
points <hi>Metaphyſical,</hi> in which ſome of the Fathers were not
<hi>free,</hi> the School-men <hi>deeply engaged,</hi> and our preſent Acca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies
but too much <hi>perplext;</hi> yet they <hi>indulged</hi> them and
the beſt Livers with ſingular Kindneſs: The greateſt States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Captains often becoming <hi>Patrons</hi> of the Sects they
beſt affected, honouring their <hi>Readings</hi> with their Preſence
and Applauſe. So far were thoſe Ages, which we have made
as the original of Wiſdom and Politeneſs, from thinking <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi>
an Error of State, or dangerous to the Government.
Thus <hi>Plutrach, Strabo, Laertius,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>To theſe Inſtances I may add the Latitude of old <hi>Rome,</hi>
that had almoſt as many <hi>Deities</hi> as Houſes: For <hi>Varro</hi> tells
us of no leſs than thirty <hi>Thouſand</hi> ſeveral <hi>Sacra,</hi> or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Rites among her People, and yet without a Quarrel:
Unhappy fate of <hi>Chriſtianity!</hi> the beſt of Religions, and yet
her Profeſſors maintain leſs Charity than Idolators, while it
ſhould be peculiar to them. I fear, it ſhews us to have but
little of it at Heart.</p>
            <p>But nearer home, and in our own time, we ſee the effects
of a diſcret <hi>Indulgence,</hi> even too Emulation. <hi>Holland,</hi> that
<hi>Bogg</hi> of the World, neither Sea nor dry Land, now the
<hi>Rival</hi> of talleſt Monarchs; not by <hi>Conqueſts, Marriages,</hi>
or acceſſion of <hi>Royal Blood,</hi> the uſual wayes to Empire, but
by her own ſuperlative <hi>Clemency</hi> and <hi>Induſtry;</hi> for the one
was the effect of the other: She cheriſht her People, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
were their <hi>Opinions,</hi> as the reaſonable ſtock of the
Country, the Heads and Hands of her Trade and Wealth;
and making them eaſie in the main point, their <hi>Conſcience,</hi>
ſhe became great by them: This made her fill with <hi>People,</hi>
and they fill'd her with <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45312:9"/>
And if it ſhould be ſaid, <hi>She is upon her Declenſion for all that.</hi>
I Anſwer, All States muſt know it, nothing is here <hi>Immortal.</hi>
Where are the <hi>Babylonian, Perſian</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> Empires?
And are not <hi>Lacedemon, Athens, Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi>
gone before her? Kingdoms and Common-Wealths have
their <hi>Births</hi> and <hi>Growths,</hi> their <hi>Declenſions</hi> and <hi>Deaths,</hi> as
well as private Families and Perſons: But 'tis owing, neither
to the <hi>Armies</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> nor <hi>Navies</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but her own
<hi>Domeſtick</hi> Troubles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventy Two</hi> ſticks in her Bones yet: The growing
Power of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> muſt in ſome degree, be an
<hi>Ebb</hi> to that States Strength; for they are not ſo unanimous
and vigrous in their Intereſt as formerly: But were they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
againſt the danger of their own Ambition and Jealouſie,
any body might enſure their Glory at <hi>five per Cent.</hi> But
ſome of their greateſt men apprehending they are in their
<hi>Climacterical Juncture,</hi> give up the Ghoſt, and care not, if
they muſt fall, by what hand it is.</p>
            <p>Others chuſe a <hi>Stranger,</hi> and think one afar off will give
the beſt Terms, and leaſt annoy them: whileſt a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Party have choſen a <hi>Domeſtick</hi> Prince, <hi>a Kin</hi> to their
early Succeſſes by the <hi>fore-Father's ſide</hi> (the Gallantry of his
Anceſtors.) And that his own greatneſs and ſecurity are
wrapt up in theirs, and therefore modeſtly hope to find
their Account in his Proſperity. But this is a kind of Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
only before I leave it, I dare venture to add, that if
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> changes not the Policies of that State,
he will not change her Fortune, and he will mightily add to
his own.</p>
            <p>But perhaps I ſhall be told, <hi>That no body doubts that <hi>Toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi>
is an</hi> agreeable <hi>thing to a Common-Wealth, where every
one thinks he has a ſhare in the Government; ay, that the one is the
conſequence of the other, and therefore moſt carefully to be avoided
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45312:9"/>
by all Monarchical States.</hi> This indeed were ſhrowdly to the
purpoſe, in <hi>England,</hi> if it were but true. But I don't ſee how
there can be one true Reaſon advanc'd in favour of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection:
<hi>Monarchies,</hi> as well as <hi>Common-Wealths,</hi> ſubſiſting
by the Preſervation of the People under them.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Firſt,</hi> if this were true, it would follow by the <hi>Rule</hi>
of <hi>Contraries,</hi> that a <hi>Republick</hi> could not ſubſiſt with <hi>Vnity</hi>
and <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> which is <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the Church; but it muſt,
from ſuch <hi>Monarchy</hi> in <hi>Church,</hi> come to <hi>Monarchy</hi> in <hi>State</hi> too.
But <hi>Venice, Genova, Lucca,</hi> ſeven of the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Switzerland,</hi>
(and <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf, for ſhe is an <hi>Ariſtocracy)</hi> all under the
the loftieſt <hi>Hierarchy</hi> in Church, and where is no <hi>Toleration,</hi>
ſhow in fact, that the contrary is true.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> this Objection makes a Common-Wealth the
better Government of the two, and ſo overthrows the thing
it would eſtabliſh. This is effectually done, if I know any
thing, ſince a Common-Wealth is <hi>hereby</hi> rendred a more
copious, powerful and beneficial Government to Mankind,
and is made better to anſwer Contingencies and Emergencies
of State, becauſe this ſubſiſts <hi>either</hi> way, but <hi>Monarchy</hi> not,
if the Objection be true. The one proſpers by <hi>Vnion</hi> in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Diſcipline, and by <hi>Toleration</hi> of diſſenting Churches
from the National. The other only by an <hi>univerſal Conformity</hi>
to a National Church. I ſay, this makes <hi>Monarchy</hi> (in it ſelf,
doubtleſs, an admirable Government) <hi>leſs Powerful, leſs Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
leſs Propitious,</hi> and finally <hi>leſs Safe</hi> to the People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, than a <hi>Common-Wealth;</hi> In that <hi>no Security</hi> is left to
<hi>Monarchy</hi> under diverſity of Worſhips, which yet no man
can defend or forbid, but may often arrive, as it hath in
<hi>England,</hi> more than five times in the two laſt Ages. And
truly 'tis natural for men to chuſe to ſettle where they may
be ſafeſt from the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Miſchief</hi> of ſuch Accidents of
State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:45312:10"/>
Upon the whole matter, it is to reflect the <hi>laſt Miſchief</hi>
upon <hi>Monarchy,</hi> the worſt Enemies it has could hope to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
or endanger it by; ſince it is to tell the People under it,
that they muſt either <hi>conform,</hi> or be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> or to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
turn <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> or <hi>change</hi> the Frame of the Government
they are under. A perplexity both to <hi>Monarch</hi> and <hi>People,</hi>
that nothing can be greater but the comfort of knowing the
Objection is <hi>Falſe.</hi> And that which ought to make every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
man of this Opinion, is the cloud of Witneſſes that
almoſt every Age of <hi>Monarchy</hi> affords us.</p>
            <p>I will begin with that of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the moſt exact and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Patern of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> begun by a valiant Man, tranſlated
to the beſt, and improv'd by the wiſeſt of Kings, whoſe
Miniſters were neither <hi>Fools,</hi> nor <hi>Fanaticks:</hi> Here we ſhall
find Proviſion for Diſſenters. Their <hi>Proſoliti Domicilii</hi>
were ſo far from being compelled to their National
Rites, that they were expreſly forbid to <hi>obſerve</hi> them.
Such were the <hi>Egyptians</hi> that came with them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> and <hi>Canaanites,</hi> a great People, that after their
ſeveral Forms worſhipt in an <hi>apartment</hi> of the ſame Temple.
The <hi>Jews</hi> with a Liturgy, they without one: The <hi>Jews</hi>
had <hi>Prieſts,</hi> but theſe none: The <hi>Jews</hi> had variety of Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
theſe People burnt Offerings only: All that was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of them was the Natural Religion of <hi>Noah,</hi> in which the
Acknowledgement and Worſhip of the true God, was, as it
ſtill ought to be, the main point; nay, ſo far were they from
coercive Conformity, that they did not ſo much as oblige them
to obſerve their <hi>Sabbath,</hi> tho' one of the ten Commandments:
<hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Selden</hi> ſay more. Certainly this was great Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
ſince ſo unſuitable an Uſage lookt like <hi>prophaning</hi> their
Devotion, and a common <hi>nuſance</hi> to their National Religion.
One would think by this, that their Care lay on the ſide of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45312:10"/>
preſerving their Cult from the <hi>touch</hi> or <hi>acceſſion</hi> of Diſſenters,
and not of <hi>forcing</hi> them, by <hi>undoing</hi> Penalties to conform,
muſt needs be evident. For if Gods <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Monarchy</hi>
(for ſo we are taught to believe it) did not, and would not
at a time, when Religion lay <hi>leſs</hi> in the Mind, and <hi>more</hi> in
Ceremony, compel Conformity from Diſſenters, we hope we
have got the beſt of Preſidents on our ſide.</p>
            <p>But if this Inſtance be of moſt Authority, we have another
very Exemplary, and to our point pertinent; for it ſhows
what <hi>Monarchy</hi> may do: It is yielded us from the famous
Story of <hi>Mordecai.</hi> He, with his <hi>Jews,</hi> were in a bad pleight
with the King, <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> by the ill Offices <hi>Human</hi> did
them; the Arguments he uſed were drawn from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Topicks of <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Sedition, <hi>That thy were an
odd and dangerous People, under differing Laws of their own, and
refuſed Obedience to his;</hi>
               </hi> So denying his <hi>Supremacy.</hi> Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with a witneſs; things moſt render to any Government.</p>
            <p>The King thus incenſt, commands the Laws to be put in
Execution and decrees the Ruin of <hi>Mordecai</hi> with all the
<hi>Jews:</hi> But the King is timely entreated, his Heart ſoftens,
the Decree is revokt, and <hi>Mordecai</hi> and his Friends ſaved.
The Conſequence was, as extream Joy to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo Peace
and Bleſſings to the King. And that which heightens
the Example, is the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and <hi>Infidelity</hi> of the Prince:
had the Inſtance been in a <hi>Jew,</hi> it might have been plac'd
to his <hi>greater Light or Piety:</hi> In a petty Prince, to the
<hi>Paucity</hi> and <hi>Entireneſs</hi> of his Territory; but that an <hi>Heathen,</hi>
and King of one hundred and ſeven and twenty Provinces,
ſhould <hi>throughout</hi> his vaſt Dominions, not fear, but practiſe
<hi>Toleration</hi> with good ſucceſs, has ſomething admirable in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>If we pleaſe to remember the <hi>Tranquility, &amp;</hi> ſucceſs of thoſe
Heathen <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, that allowed Indulgence; that
<hi>Aguſtus</hi> ſent <hi>Hecatombe</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the wiſeſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45312:11"/>
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and at laſt ſpared the divers Sects of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> it
will certainly oblige us to think, that Princes, whoſe Religions
are <hi>nearer of Kin,</hi> to thoſe of the Diſſenters of our times,
may not unreaſonably hope for quiet from a diſcreet Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
eſpecially when there is nothing peculiar in <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>
to render Princes unſafe in ſuch an Indulgence. The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Prudence</hi> of the Emperor <hi>Iovianus,</hi> in a quite contrary
method to thoſe of the Reigns of his Predeceſſors, ſettled the
moſt <hi>Imoroiled</hi> time of the Chiſtian World, <hi>almoſt to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle;</hi>
for though he found the Hearts of the <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi>
carried to a barbarous height, (to ſay nothing of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,</hi>
and other diſſenting Intereſts) the Emperor eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe Calamities the effect of Coercing Conformity to
the Prince's or States Religion; and that this courſe did not
only waſte <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but expoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to the ſcorn of
<hi>Heathens,</hi> and ſo ſcandal, thoſe whom they ſhould Convert,
he reſolutely declared, <hi>That he would have none <hi>Moleſted</hi>
for the different exerciſe of their Religious Worſhip;</hi> which (and
that in a true (for he reigned but ſeven Moneths) calmed the
impeſtous Storms of Diſſention, and reduced the Empire,
(before agitated with the moſt uncharitable Conteſts) to a
wonderful Serenity and Peace; thus a kindly Amity,
brought a civil Unity to the State; which endeavours for a
forc'd Unity, never did to the Church, but had formerly fill'd
the Government with incomparable Miſeries, as well as the
Church with Incharity; and which is ſad, I muſt needs ſay,
that thoſe <hi>Leaders</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> that ſhould have been the <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi>
and <hi>Examples</hi> of Peace, in ſo ſingular a juncture of the
Churches ferments, did, more then any, <hi>blow the Trumpet and
kindled the Fire of Diviſion.</hi> So dangerous is it to <hi>Super-fine</hi>
upon the Text, and then <hi>Impoſe</hi> it upon Penalty for Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valantinian <hi>the Emperor (we are told by</hi>
               </hi> Socrates Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticus)
was a great Honourer of thoſe that favoured his own
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45312:11"/>
Faith; but ſo, as he moleſted not the <hi>Arrians</hi> at all. <hi>And</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus
<hi>further adds in his Honour,</hi> That he was much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd
for his Moderate Carriage during his Reign; inſomuch,
that amongſt ſundry Sects of Religion, he troubled no man for
his Conſcience, impoſing neither this nor that to be obſerved;
much leſs with menacing Edicts and Injunctions, did he compel
others, his Subjects, to bow the Neck, or conform to that which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
worſhipped, but left ſuch Points as clear and untouch'd as he
found them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gratianus</hi> &amp; <hi>Theodſius</hi> the <hi>great, Indulged</hi> divers ſorts
of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but the <hi>Novations</hi> of all the Diſſenters were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd:

of them, and the Aſſumption of the <hi>ſecular Power</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
much at the ſame time. But the <hi>Novations</hi> at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
were not ſo dealt withal; for the <hi>Greek</hi> Biſhops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to permit them the quiet enjoyment of their diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Aſſemblies; as <hi>Socrates</hi> tells us in his fifth and ſeventh
Book of Eccleſiaſtical Story.</p>
            <p>I ſhall deſcend nearer our own times; for notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Age has been more furiouſly moved, then that which
<hi>Jovianus</hi> found, and therefore the Experiment of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<hi>was never better made,</hi> yet to ſpeak more in view of
this time of day, we find our Contemporaries, of remoter
Judgments in Religion, under no manner of difficulty in
this point. The <hi>Grand Signior, great Mogul, Zars</hi> of
<hi>Mnſcovia,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia;</hi> the great Monarchs of the <hi>Eaſt</hi>
have <hi>long allow'd and proſper'd with a Toleration:</hi> And who

only in the Town, of the Empire, but in their <hi>proper</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,

him in <hi>Civil</hi> Matters.</q> It was of thoſe Letters of this
extraordinary Man, for ſo he was (whether we regard him
in his Eccleſiaſtical Dignity or his greater Chriſtian and Civil
Prudence) that the great Lord <hi>Fulkland</hi> ſaid, <hi>A Miniſter of

               <hi>France,</hi> we ſhall find the <hi>Indulgence</hi> of thoſe Proteſtants,
hath been a flouriſhing to that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as their <hi>Arms</hi> a
Succour to their <hi>King.</hi> 'Tis true, that ſince they help't the
Miniſters of his Greatneſs to Succeſs, that haughty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
has changed his Meaſures, and reſolves their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to his own Religion, or their Ruin; but no man
can give another Reaſon for it, than that he thinks it for
his turn to pleaſe that part of his own Church, which are
the preſent neceſſary and unwearied Inſtruments of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Glory. But let us ſee the end of this Conduct, it will
require more time to approve the Experiment.</p>
            <p>As it was the Royal Saying of <hi>Stephen, <hi>King</hi>
               </hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi>
That he was a <hi>King of <hi>Men,</hi> and not of <hi>Conſcience;</hi> a
Commander of <hi>Bodies,</hi> and not of <hi>Souls.</hi>
               </hi> So we ſee a
<hi>Toleration</hi> has been practiſed in that Country of a long time,
with no ill Succeſs to the State; the Cities of <hi>Cracovia, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covia,</hi>
and many other Towns of Note, almoſt wholly
diſſenting from the common Religion of the Kingdom,
which is <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> as the others are <hi>Socinian</hi> and
<hi>Calvaniſt,</hi> the moſt oppoſite to that, as well as to themſelves.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> in his large Town of <hi>Altona,</hi> but
about a Mile from <hi>Hambrough,</hi> and therefore called ſo, that
is, <hi>All to near,</hi> is a pregnant proof of our point. For though
his Seat be ſo remote from that place, and another ſtrong
and inſinuating State ſo near, yet under his <hi>Indulgence</hi> of
divers Perſwaſions, they enjoy that <hi>Peace,</hi> and he that <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
that he is not upon better Terms in any of his more

Reader, if it be not much owing to this <hi>Freedom,</hi>
and that a contrary courſe were not the way for him to

            <p>If we look into other parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> where

the Prince to his People in other things, ſo in this to the
Empire; for he has made bold with the Conſtitution of it,
in the Latitude he gives his Subjects in this Affair.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Bradenburg</hi> is himſelf a <hi>Calvaniſt,</hi> his People
moſtly <hi>Lutherain,</hi> yet in part of his Dominions, the <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi>
enjoy their Churches quietly.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Newburg,</hi> and a ſtrict <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law
to the preſent Emperor, in his Province of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,</hi>
has, not only at <hi>Dewsburg, Mulheim,</hi> and other places,
but in <hi>Deuſeldorp</hi> it ſelf, where the Court reſides, <hi>Lutherain,</hi>
and <hi>Calvaniſt,</hi> as well as <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> by Religion a <hi>Lutherain,</hi> in his
City of <hi>Budiſſin,</hi> has both <hi>Lutherains</hi> and <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in
the ſame Church, parted only by a Grate.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Auſburg,</hi> they have two chief Magiſtrates, as their
<hi>Duumvirat,</hi> one muſt alwayes be a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and the
other a <hi>Lutherain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Oſnabrug</hi> is himſelf a <hi>Lutherain,</hi> and in
the Town of his Title, the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> as well as
<hi>Lutherains,</hi> have their Churches; and which is more, the
next Biſhop muſt be a <hi>Catholick</hi> too; for like the Buckets in
the Well, they take turns, one way to be ſure, ſo that one
be but in the Right.</p>
            <p>From hence we will go to <hi>Sultzbach,</hi> a ſmall Territory,
but has a great Prince, I mean, in his own extraordinary
Qualities; for among other things we ſhall find him act the
Moderator among his People. By profeſſion he is a <hi>Roman
Catholick,</hi> but has <hi>Simultaneum Religionis Exercitium,</hi> not
only <hi>Lutherains</hi> and <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> enjoy their different
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45312:13"/>
Worſhips, but <hi>alternatively</hi> in one and the ſame place, the
ſame day; ſo ballancing his Affection by his Wiſdom, that
there appears neither Partiality in him, nor Envy in them,
though of ſuch oppoſite Perſwaſions.</p>
            <p>I will end theſe forregin Inſtances with a Prince and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
all in one, and he a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> too, and that is
the Biſhop of <hi>Mentz;</hi> who admits, with a very Peaceable
ſucceſs, ſuch <hi>Lutherains</hi> with his <hi>Catholicks,</hi> to enjoy their
Churches, as live in his Town of <hi>Erford.</hi> Thus does Practice
tells us, that neither <hi>Monarchy</hi> nor <hi>Hierarchy</hi> are in danger
from a Toleration. On the contrary, the Laws of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi>
which are the Acts of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and the <hi>Soveraign
Princes</hi> of it, have tolerated theſe three Religious Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman-Catholick, Lutherain</hi> and <hi>Calvaniſt,</hi>
and they may as well tolerate three more, for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and with the ſame Succeſs. For it is not their <hi>greater
nearerneſs</hi> or conſiſtency in Doctrine, or in Worſhip; On
the contrary, they differ much, and by that, and other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
are ſometimes engaged in great Controverſies,
yet is a <hi>Toleration</hi> practicable, &amp; the way of Peace with them.</p>
            <p>And which is cloſeſt to our point at home it ſelf, we ſee
that a <hi>Toleration</hi> of the <hi>Iews, French</hi> and <hi>Dutch <hi>Churches</hi>
               </hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> both <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the <hi>National Way:</hi> And the
Connivance that has been in <hi>Ireland;</hi> And the down-right
<hi>Toleration</hi> in moſt of <hi>his Majeſties <hi>Plantations</hi>
               </hi> abroad, proves
the Aſſertion, <hi>That Toleration is not dangerous to Monarchy.</hi>
For Experience tells us, where it is in any degree admitted,
the <hi>King's Affairs proſper</hi> moſt; <hi>People, Wealth</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi>
being ſure to follow ſuch <hi>Indulgence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all that I have ſaid in Reaſon and Fact, why <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi>
is ſafe to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> Story tells us that worſe things
have befallen Princes in Countries under <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Vnion,</hi>
than in places under divided forms of Worſhip; and ſo, tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45312:14"/>
Countries ſtand to the Prince, more than upon equal
terms with conforming ones. And where Princes have
been expoſed to hardſhip in tolerating Countries, they have
as often come from the Conforming, as Non-conforming
party; and ſo the <hi>Diſſenter</hi> is upon equal terms, to the Prince
or State, with the <hi>Conformiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is evident in the <hi>Iews,</hi> under the conduct of
<hi>Moſes;</hi> their Diſſention came from the men of their own
Tribes, ſuch as <hi>Corah Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> with their
pertakers. To ſay nothing of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Miſeries and Slaughters of <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperor
proves my point, who by the greateſt <hi>Church-men</hi> of his
time was withſtood, and his Servant that perpetrated the
Wickedneſs by them, ſubſtituted in his room, becauſe more
officious to their Grandure. What power but that of the
Church, dethron'd <hi>Childrek</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and ſet <hi>Pippin</hi>
in his place? The miſeries of the Emperors, <hi>Henry</hi> the
fourth and fifth, Father and Son, from their rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
raiſed and animated by the power of <hi>Conformiſts;</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throning
both, as much as they could, are notorious. 'Tis
as plain that <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> King of <hi>Sweedland,</hi> was rejected by
that <hi>Lutherain</hi> Country, becauſe he was a <hi>Roman-Catholick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we come nearer home, which is moſt ſuitable to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> we find the <hi>Church-men</hi> take part with
<hi>William Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt againſt <hi>Robert</hi> their elder
Brother; and after that, we ſee ſome of the greateſt of them
<hi>make Head</hi> againſt their King, namely <hi>Anſelm,</hi> Arch-Biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and his party, as did his Succeſſor <hi>Thomas</hi> of
<hi>Becket</hi> to the ſecond <hi>Henry. Stephen</hi> Uſurpt the Crown
when there was a <hi>Church Vnion:</hi> And King <hi>John</hi> lived <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
for all that, and at laſt dyed <hi>by one of his own Religion
too.</hi> The Diſſentions that agitated the Reign of his Son

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:45312:14"/>
Bleſſing to <hi>Mumford</hi> their General. The <hi>Depoſition</hi> and
<hi>Murther</hi> of the ſecond <hi>Edward,</hi> &amp; <hi>Richard,</hi> &amp; ſixth <hi>Henry,</hi>
and his Son the <hi>Prince.</hi> The <hi>Vſurpation</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the third,
and the <hi>Murther</hi> of the Sons of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, in the
Tower of <hi>London.</hi> The <hi>civil War</hi> that followed between
him and the <hi>Earl of Richmond,</hi> afterwards our <hi>wiſe <hi>Henry</hi>
               </hi>
the <hi>ſeventh</hi> were all perpetrated in a Country of <hi>one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
and by the Hands of <hi>Conformiſts.</hi> In ſhort, if we
will but look upon the civil War, that ſo long raged in this
Kingdom, between the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Laneaſter,</hi> and
conſider that they profeſſed but one and the ſame Religion,
and both back't with numbers of Church-men too (to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Miſerable end of many of our Kings princely
Anceſtors in <hi>Scotland,</hi> eſpecially the firſt and third <hi>James)</hi>
will find cauſe to ſay, <hi>That Church-Vniformity is not a Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for Princes to depend upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we will look next into Countries where <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from
the National Church are tolerated, we ſhall find the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt</hi>
not leſs Culpable than the <hi>Diſſenter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Diſorders</hi> among the <hi>Iews,</hi> after they were ſettled in
the Land that God had given them, came not from thoſe
they tolerated, but themſelves. They <hi>caſt off Samuel,</hi> and
the Government of the <hi>Judges.</hi> 'Twas the Children of the
<hi>National</hi> Church, that fell in with the Ambition of <hi>Abſolom,</hi>
and animated the Rebellion againſt his Father <hi>David.</hi>
They were the ſame that revolted from <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Son, and
cryed in behalf of <hi>Jeroboam, To your Tents, O Iſrael!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not two Ages ago, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> too generally
fell in with the Family of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> againſt their lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
<hi>Henry</hi> the fourth: Nor were they without Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the greateſt of their Belief, who ſtiled it an <hi>holy
War;</hi> at that time, fearing (not without cauſe) the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>
of that Kingdom from the <hi>Roman</hi> See. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45312:15"/>
the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> made up the beſt part of that King's
Armies, and by their Loyalty and Blood, preſerved the
<hi>Blood Royal</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and ſet the Crown on the Head of
that Prince. That King was twice aſſinated, and the laſt
time murdered, as was <hi>Henry</hi> the third, his Predeceſſor; but
they fell, one by the hand of a <hi>Church-man,</hi> the other, at leaſt
by a <hi>Conformiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, that the next <hi>civil War</hi> was between the <hi>Catholicks</hi>
and the <hi>Hugenots,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Cardinal Richlien,</hi>
and the <hi>Duke of Roan.</hi> But as I will not juſtifie the
Action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo their <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Cautions</hi> ſo ſolemnly ſettled by
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>fourth,</hi> as the reward of their ſingular Merit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the Miniſtry of that <hi>Cardinal</hi> invaded, they ſay, they
did but defend their own, and that rather againſt the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,</hi>
than the <hi>King,</hi> whoſe ſoftneſs ſuffered him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a property to the great <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
And there is this Reaſon to believe them, that if it
had been otherwiſe, we are ſure that <hi>King Charles</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi>
would not in the leaſt have countenanced their Quarrel.</p>
            <p>However, the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> like himſelf, wiſely knew when
to ſtop: For though he thought it the Intereſt of the Crown,
to moderate their greatneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and check their growth, yet
having freſh in Memory the <hi>Story</hi> of the fore-going Age, he
ſaw, <hi>'twaswiſe to have a Ballance</hi> upon occaſion. But this was
more then recompenc'd in their firſt Adheſion to the <hi>Crown</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi> under the Miniſtry and Direction of the
ſucceeding <hi>Cardinal,</hi> when their Perſwaſion had not only
Number, and many good Officers to value it ſelf upon, but
yielded their <hi>King,</hi> the ableſt Captain of the Age, namely,
<hi>Turene:</hi> It was an <hi>Hugenot</hi> then, at the Head of almoſt
an <hi>Hugenot</hi> Army, that fell in with a <hi>cardinal</hi> himſelf, (ſee
the Union, Intereſt makes) to maintain the Imperial
Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and that <hi>on a Roman-Catholicks head:</hi> And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45312:15"/>
together <hi>with their own Indulgence, that Religion, as National
too,</hi> againſt the pretences of a <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Army, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a <hi>Prince,</hi> brave and learned of the ſame Religion.</p>
            <p>I mention not this, to prefer one party to another; for
contrary Inſtances may be given elſewhere, as Intereſts
have varied. In <hi>Sweedland</hi> a Prince was rejected by
<hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and many of
the <hi>Principalities</hi> of <hi>Germany, <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi>
               </hi> have
approv'd themſelves Loyal to their <hi>Kings, Princes</hi> and
<hi>States:</hi> But this ſuffices to us, that we gain the Point; for
it is evident in Countries where <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are tolerated, the
<hi>Inſecurity</hi> of the Prince and Government, <hi>may as well come
from the Conforming, as Diſſenting Party,</hi> and that it comes
not from Diſſenters, <hi>becauſe ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how happy and admirable was this civil Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Cardinal</hi> and <hi>Turene?</hi> two moſt oppoſite,
Religions, both followed by People of their own Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
One ſays his <hi>Maſs,</hi> 'tother his <hi>Directory,</hi> both invoke
<hi>one</hi> Deity, by <hi>ſeveral</hi> wayes, for <hi>one ſucceſs,</hi> and it followed
with <hi>Glory,</hi> and a <hi>Peace</hi> to this Day. O why should it be
otherwiſe now! what has been, may be: Methinks <hi>Wiſdom</hi>
and <hi>Charity</hi> are on that ſide ſtill.</p>
            <p>It will doubtleſs be objected, that the <hi>Diſſenting Party of
<hi>England,</hi>
               </hi> fell in with the <hi>State Diſſenter</hi> in our late <hi>Civil,
but Vnnatural War:</hi> And this ſeems to be againſt us, yet
three things muſt be confeſſed; Firſt, That the War rather
<hi>made the Diſſenters,</hi> than the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> made the War: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that thoſe that were then in being, were not tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
as in <hi>France,</hi> but <hi>proſecuted:</hi> And laſtly, that they did
not lead, but <hi>follow</hi> great Numbers of <hi>Church-goers,</hi> of all
<hi>Qualities</hi> in that unhappy Controverſie, which began upon
other <hi>Topicks</hi> than Liberty for <hi>Church-Diſſenters.</hi> And
though they were herein blameable, Reaſon is Reaſon, in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45312:16"/>
all <hi>Climates</hi> and <hi>Latitudes.</hi> This does not affect the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion:
Such Calamities are no <hi>neceſſary Conſequences</hi> of
<hi>Church-diſſent;</hi> becauſe they would then follow in all places
where <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are <hi>tolerated,</hi> which we ſee they do not:
but theſe may ſometimes indeed be the effects of a <hi>violent
endeavour</hi> of <hi>Vniformity;</hi> and that <hi>under all Forms of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
as I fear they were partly here under our <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
But then this teaches us to conclude, that a <hi>Toleration</hi> of
thoſe, that a contrary courſe makes <hi>uneaſie</hi> and <hi>deſperate,</hi>
may prevent or Cure <hi>Inteſtine Troubles;</hi> as <hi>Anno</hi> forty eight, it
ended the Strife, and ſettled the Peace of <hi>Germany.</hi> For 'tis not
now the queſtion, how far men may be provok'd, or ought
to reſent it; but <hi>whether Government is ſafe in a Toleration,
eſpecially <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
               </hi> And to this Iſſue we are come in
Reaſon and Fact, <hi>That 'tis ſafe,</hi> and that <hi>Conformiſts</hi> (gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſpeaking) have for their Intereſts, as rarely known
their Duty to their <hi>Prince,</hi> as <hi>Diſſenters</hi> for their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
So that the danger ſeems to lie on the ſide of <hi>forcing
Vniformity</hi> againſt Faith, upon ſevere <hi>Penalties,</hi> rather than
of a diſcreet <hi>Toleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, I ſhall endeavour to shew the <hi>Prudence</hi>
and <hi>Reaſonableneſs</hi> of a <hi>Toleration</hi> by the great Benefits that
follow it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Toleration,</hi> which is an Admiſſion of diſſenting Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
with Impunity to the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> ſecures <hi>Property,</hi>
which is <hi>Civil Right,</hi> and That <hi>eminently the <hi>Line</hi> and
Power of the <hi>Monarchy:</hi>
               </hi> For if no man ſuffer in his <hi>Civil
Right</hi> for the ſake of ſuch <hi>Diſſent,</hi> the point of <hi>Succeſſion</hi> is
ſettled without a <hi>Civil War,</hi> or a <hi>Recantation;</hi> Since it were
an abſurd thing to imagin, that a man born to <hi>five Pounds</hi>
a Year, should not be liable to forfeit his Inheritance
for <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> and yet a <hi>Prince of the Blood, and an Heir
to the Imperial Crown, ſhould be made incapable of his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for Church-diſſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:45312:16"/>
The Security then of <hi>Property,</hi> or <hi>Civil Right,</hi> from being
forfeitable for Religious diſſent, becomes a ſecurity to the
<hi>Royal Family,</hi> againſt the Difficulties lately labour'd under
in the buſineſs of the <hi>Succeſſion.</hi> And though I have no
Commiſſion for it, beſides the great Reaſon and Equity
of the thing it ſelf, I dare ſay, there can hardly be a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter</hi>
at this time of day ſo <hi>void</hi> of Senſe and Juſtice, as
well as Duty and Loyalty, as not to be of the ſame mind.
Elſe it were to deny that to the <hi>Prince,</hi> which he needs,
and prays from him. Let us not forget the Story of <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>
of <hi>Sweedland,</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> and
eſpecially of our own <hi>Queen Mary.</hi> Had <hi>Property</hi> been
fix't, the <hi>Line</hi> of thoſe Royal Families could not have met
with any let or Interruption. 'Twas this Conſideration that
prevail'd with Judge <hi>Hales,</hi> though a ſtrong <hi>Proteſtant</hi> after
King <hi>Edward's</hi> Death, to give his Opinion for <hi>Queen Mary</hi>'s
ſucceſſion, againſt that of all the reſt of the Judges to the
contrary: which noble Preſident, was recompenc'd in the
Loyalty of <hi>Arch-Biſhop <hi>Heath,</hi>
               </hi> a <hi>Roman-Catholick,</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Succeſſion of <hi>Queen Elizabeth;</hi> and the ſame
thing would be done again, in the like caſe, by men of the
ſame Integrity.</p>
            <p>I know it may be ſaid, <hi>That there is little Reaſon now for the
Prince to regard this Argument in favour of Diſſenters, when
it was ſo little heeded in the caſe of the <hi>Preſumtive Heir</hi> to
the Crown.</hi> But as this was the Act and Heat of Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men within Doors, ſo if it were in Counſel or Deſire,
the Folly and Injuſtice of any Diſſenters without Doors,
ſhall many entire Parties pay the Reckoning of the few
buſie Offendors? They would humbly hope, that the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Mildneſs and Clemency, which make up ſo great a part
of his Majeſties publick Aſſurances, will not leave him in
his Reflection here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:45312:17"/>
'Tis the Mercies of Princes, that above all their Works,
give them the neareſt Reſemblance to Divinity in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration.
Beſides, it is their Glory to meaſure their
Actions by the Reaſon and Conſequence of things, and not
by the Paſſions that poſſeſs and annimate private Breaſts:
For it were fatal to the Intereſt of a Prince, that the <hi>Folly</hi>
or <hi>Vndutifulneſs</hi> of any of his Subjects, ſhould put him out
of the way, or tempt him to be <hi>unſteady</hi> to his Principle and
Intereſt: And yet, with ſubmiſſion, I muſt ſay, it would
be the Conſequence of Coertion: For by expoſſing <hi>Property</hi>
for Opinion, the Prince <hi>expoſes</hi> the Conſciences and Property
of his own Family to the Church, and <hi>diſarms</hi> them of all
Defence, upon any alteration of Judgment. Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that ſeveral of the ſame Parliament-men, who at
firſt ſacrificed civil Rights for Non-conformity in <hi>common
Diſſenters,</hi> fell at laſt to make the Succeſſion of the <hi>Crown</hi>
the <hi>Price of Diſſent in the next Heir of the Royal Blood.</hi> So
dangerous a thing it is to hazard Property to ſerve a turn
for any Party, or ſuffer ſuch Examples in the caſe of the
meaneſt Perſon in a Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all the benefit that attends the <hi>Crown,</hi> by the
preſervation of Civil Rights; for the <hi>Power of the Monarchy</hi>
is kept more entire by it. The King has the benefit of his
Whole People, and the Reaſon of their <hi>Safety</hi> is owing to
their <hi>Civil,</hi> and not Eccleſiaſtical Obedience: Their <hi>Loyalty
to Caeſar,</hi> and not Conformity to the Church: Whereas the
other Opinion would have it, that no Conformity to the
Church, <hi>no Property</hi> in the State: Which is to clog and
narrow the civil Power; for at this rate, <hi>No Church-Man,
<hi>No Engliſh-man,</hi>
               </hi> and <hi>no Conformiſt, <hi>no Subject.</hi>
               </hi> A way
to <hi>Alien</hi> the King's People, and practiſe an <hi>Eccluſion</hi> upon
him, from, it may be, a fourth part of his Dominions.
Thus it may happen that the ableſt State-man, the braveſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45312:17"/>
Captain, and the beſt Citizen may be diſabled, and the
Prince forbid their Imployment to his Service.</p>
            <p>Some Inſtances of this we have had ſince his late Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Reſtoration: For upon the firſt <hi>Dutch-War,</hi> Sir
<hi>William Penn</hi> being commanded to give in a Liſt of the
ableſt Sea-Officers in the Kindom, to ſerve in that Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
I do very well remember he preſented our preſent
King with a Catalogue of the knowingeſt and braveſt
Officers the Age had bred, with this ſubſcrib'd, <hi>Theſe men,
if his Majeſty will pleaſe to admit of their Perſwaſions, I will
anſwer for their Skill, Courage and Integrity.</hi> He pickt them
by their Ability, not their Opinions; and he was in the
right; for that was the beſt way of doing the King's
buſineſs. And of my own knowledge, <hi>Conformity</hi> robb'd
the King at that time of Ten men, whoſe greater Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Valour, than ſome one ten of that Fleet, had in
their room, been able to have ſaved a Battel, or perfected a
Victory. I will name three of them. The firſt was Old
Vice-Admiral <hi>Goodſon;</hi> than whom, no body was more
Stout, or a Sea-man. The ſecond, Captain <hi>Hill,</hi> that in
the <hi>Saphire</hi> beat <hi>Admiral <hi>Everſon,</hi>
               </hi> hand to hand, that came
to the Relief of old <hi>Trump.</hi> The third was Captain <hi>Potter,</hi>
that in the conſtant <hi>Warwick,</hi> took Captain <hi>Beach,</hi> after eight
hours ſmart Diſpute. And as evident it is, that if a War
had proceeded between this Kingom and <hi>France,</hi> ſeven years
ago, the buſineſs of Conformity had deprived the King of
many Land-Officers, whoſe ſhare in the late Wars of <hi>Europe,</hi>
had made knowing and able.</p>
            <p>But which is worſt of all, ſuch are not ſafe, with their
diſſent, under their own extraordinary Prince. For though
a man were a great <hi>Honourer</hi> of his Prince, a <hi>Lover</hi> of his
Country, an <hi>Admirer</hi> of the Government: In the courſe of
his Life, ſober, wiſe, induſtrous and uſeful; if a Diſſenter
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45312:18"/>
from the eſtabliſh't Form of Worſhip, in that condition
there is no <hi>Liberty</hi> for his Perſon, nor <hi>Security</hi> to his Eſtate;
As <hi>Vſeleſs</hi> to the Publick, ſo <hi>Ruin'd</hi> in himſelf. For this <hi>Net</hi>
catches the beſt: Men true to their Conſcience, and who
indulged, are moſt like to be ſo to their Prince: whilſt the
reſt are left to <hi>Couſen</hi> him by their change; for that is the
unhappy end of forced Conformity in the poor ſpirited
Compliers. And this muſt always be the conſequence of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitating
the Prince to put <hi>more and other Teſts</hi> upon his
People, than are requiſit to ſecure him of their Loyalty.</p>
            <p>And when we ſhall be ſo happy in our meaſures as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
this Miſchief to the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> it is to be hop'd, it will
be thought expedient to diſ-intangle <hi>Property</hi> from <hi>Opinion,</hi>
and cut the untoward Knot, ſome men have tyed, that hath
ſo long hamper'd and gaul'd the Prince as well as People.
It will be then, when civil Puniſhments ſhall no more follow
Church faults, that the <hi>civil Tenure</hi> will be recover'd to the
Government and the <hi>Natures</hi> of Acts, Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſo diſtinguiſh't, as <hi>Loyalty</hi> ſhall be the ſafety of
Diſſent, and the whole People made <hi>uſeful</hi> to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>It will, perhaps, be objected, <hi>That Diſſenters can hardly
I obliged to be true to the Crown, and ſo the Crown unſafe in
their very Services; for they may eaſily turn the Power given
them to ſerve it, againſt it, to greaten themſelves.</hi> I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to obviate every thing, that may with any pretence be
offer'd againſt our entreated <hi>Indulgence.</hi> I ſay, No, and
appeal to the <hi>King</hi> himſelf, (againſt whom the Prejudices of
our late Times ran higheſt, and therefore has moſt reaſon
to reſent) If he was ever better lov'd or ſerv'd, than by the
Old <hi>Roundheaded</hi> Sea-men, the Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> Sir <hi>William
Penn,</hi> Sir <hi>J. Lawſon,</hi> Sir <hi>G. Aſcue,</hi> Sir <hi>R. Stainer,</hi> Sir <hi>Jer.

Captain <hi>Sanſum, Cuttins, Clark, Robinſon, Molton, Wager,
Tern, Parker, Haward, Hubbard, Fen, Langhorn, Daws,
Earl, White;</hi> to ſay nothing of many yet living, of real
Merit, and many inferior Officers, expert and brave And
to do our <hi>Prince</hi> Juſtice, he <hi>deſerv'd</hi> it from them, by his
Humility, Plainneſs and Courage, and the care and affection
that he always ſhew'd to them.</p>
            <p>If any ſay, <hi>That moſt of theſe men were <hi>Conformiſts:</hi>
               </hi> I
preſume to tell them, I know as well as any man, they
ſerv'd the King never the better for that; on the contrary,
'twas all the ſtrife that ſome of them had in themſelves, in
the doing that ſervice, that they muſt not ſerve him
without it; and if in that they could have been Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
they had perform'd it with the greateſt Alacrity
<hi>Intereſt</hi> will not lye. Where People find their Reckoning,
they are ſure to be <hi>True.</hi> For 'tis want of Wit that makes
any man <hi>falſe</hi> to himſelf. 'Twas he that knew all mens
Hearts, that ſaid, <hi>Where the Treaſure is, there the Heart will
be alſo.</hi> Let men be eaſie, ſafe, and upon their preferment
with the prince, and they will be Dutiful, Loyal, and
moſt Affectionate.</p>
            <p>Mankind by nature <hi>fears</hi> Power, and <hi>melts</hi> at Goodneſs.
Pardon my Zeal, I would not be thought to plead for
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> Preferment; 'tis enough they keep what they
have, and may live at their own Charges. Only I am
for having the Prince have Room for his choice, and not
be crampe and ſtinted by Opinion; but imploy thoſe
who are beſt able to ſerve him: And I think out of <hi>ſix</hi>
Parties 'tis better picking, than out of <hi>one</hi> of them; and
therefore the Prince's intereſt is to be head of all of
them; which a <hi>Toleration</hi> effects in a moment; ſince thoſe

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45312:19"/>
I am ſure, I have <hi>Monarchy</hi> on my ſide, if <hi>Solomon</hi> and his
<hi>Wiſdom</hi> may ſtand for it, who tells us, <hi>That the Glory of a
King is in the Multitude of his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this all, for the Conſequences of ſuch an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Content would be of infinite moment to the <hi>ſecurity</hi>
of the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> both <hi>at Home</hi> and <hi>Abroad. At Home,</hi> for
it would <hi>behead the factions without Blood,</hi> and <hi>Baniſh</hi> the
<hi>Ring-leaders without going abroad.</hi> When the great bodies
of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſee the care of the Government for their <hi>ſafety,</hi>
they have no need of their Captains, nor Theſe any ground
for their Pretences: For as They us'd the People to value
themſelves, and raiſe their Fortunes with the <hi>Prince,</hi> ſo
the People followed their Leaders to get that eaſe, they ſee
their Heads promis'd, but could not, and the Government
can, and does give them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Multitudes</hi> cannot Plot, they are too many, and have not
Conduct for it, they move by another Spring. <hi>Safety</hi> is the
pretence of their Leaders: If once they ſee they enjoy it, they
have yet Wit enough not to hazard it for any Body: For
the endeavours of buſie men are then diſcernable; but a
ſtate of Severity gives them a pretence, by which the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
is eaſily taken.</p>
            <p>This I ſay, upon a Suppoſition, that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi>
could agree againſt the Government; which is a begging of
the Queſtion: For it is improbable (if not impoſſible without
<hi>Conformiſts)</hi> ſince beſides the <hi>Diſtance</hi> they are at in their
Perſwaſions and Affections, they dare not hope for ſo good
terms from one another, as the <hi>Government</hi> gives: And that
<hi>Fear,</hi> with their <hi>Emulation,</hi> would draw them into that
Duty, that they muſt all fall into a Natural dependance,
which I call holding of the <hi>Prince,</hi> as the <hi>Great Head of the
State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>From abroad,</hi> we are as ſafe as from within our ſelves: For
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45312:19"/>
if leading Men at home are thus diſappointed of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in the People, <hi>Forreigners</hi> will find here no Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of their <hi>dividing Language,</hi> nor matter (if they could)
to work upon; for the Point is gain'd, the People they
would deal in, are at their eaſe, and cannot be bribed; and
thoſe that would, can't <hi>deſerve</hi> it.</p>
            <p>It is this that makes <hi>Princes</hi> live <hi>Independent</hi> of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
and <hi>to be lov'd at home, is to be fear'd abroad:</hi> One
follows neceſſarily the other. Where <hi>Princes</hi> are driven to
ſeek a forreign Aſſiſtance, the iſſue muſt either be the <hi>Ruin</hi>
of the <hi>Prince,</hi> or the <hi>abſolute ſubjection</hi> of the People; not
without the hazard of becoming a Province to the power of
that Neighbour that turns the Scale. Theſe conſequences

it were true, what's the cauſe of it? It has not been old
Friendſhip, or nearneſs of Blood, or Neighbourhood; Nor
could it be from an Inclination in our Miniſters, to bring
things here to a like iſſue, as ſome have ſuggeſted; for then
we ſhould have clogg'd his Succeſſes, inſtead of helping
them in any kind, leſt in doing ſo, we should have put it
into his power to hinder our own.</p>
            <p>But perhaps our <hi>croſs</hi> Accidents of State may ſometimes
have compell'd us into his Friendſhip, and his Councils have
carefully improv'd the one, and husbanded the other, to
great Advantages; and that this was more then made for
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt; and yet 'tis but too true, that the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
Heats</hi> of ſome men, that moſt inveighed againſt it,
went too far to ſtrengthen that underſtanding, by not
taking what would have been granted, and creating an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
at home, that might naturally have diſſolved that
Correſpondence abroad.</p>
            <p>I love not to revive things that are uneaſily remembred,
but in Points moſt tender to the late King, he thought himſelf
ſometimes too cloſely preſt, and hardly held; and we are
all wiſe enough now to ſay, a milder Conduct had ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
better: For if reaſonable things may be unreaſonably
preſt, and with ſuch private Intentions as induced a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
Heats about things doubtful, unwiſe or unjuſt, muſt
needs harden and prejudice.</p>
            <p>Let us then create an Intereſt for the Prince <hi>at Home,</hi> and
<hi>Forreign</hi> Friendſhips (at beſt, uncertain and dangerous) will
fall of courſe; for if it be allow'd to <hi>private men,</hi> ſhall
it be forbid, to <hi>Princes</hi> only, to know and be true to their

in his Printed <hi>Apologies</hi> for <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience:</hi> But
actually treated by ſome of their greateſt Men, with the
Miniſters of thoſe Times for <hi>Indulgence,</hi> upon the aſſurances
they offer'd to give of their <hi>good Behaviour</hi> to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as then eſtabliſht. On the other hand, we ſee the
<hi>Preſbyteriens,</hi> That in <hi>Scotland</hi> began the <hi>War,</hi> and in
<hi>England</hi> promoted and upheld it to <hi>Forty Seven,</hi> when
ready to be ſupplanted by the <hi>Independants,</hi> wheel to the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45312:21"/>
King. In <hi>Scotland</hi> they Crown him, &amp; come into <hi>England,</hi> with
an Army to reſtore him, where their Brethren joyn them;
but being defeated, They help, by <hi>private Collections,</hi> to ſupport
him abroad, and after the Overthrow of Sir <hi>G. Booth</hi>'s At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
to almoſt a Miracle, reſtore him. And which is more,
a great part of that Army too, whoſe <hi>Victories</hi> riſe from the
<hi>Ruin</hi> of the Prince they reſtored.</p>
            <p>But to give the laſt Proofs our Age has of the power of
<hi>Intereſt,</hi> againſt the Notion oppoſed by this Diſcourſe. Firſt,
the <hi>Independants</hi> themſelves, held the greateſt <hi>Republicans</hi> of
all Parties, were the moſt Laviſh and Superſtitous Adorers
of Monarchy in <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> becauſe of the regard
he had to them; allowing him, and his Son after him, to be
<hi>Cuſtos Vtriuſ<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> Tabule,</hi> over all Cauſes, as well Eccleſiaſtical
as Civil, <hi>Supream Governour.</hi> And next, the <hi>Conformiſts</hi>
in Parliament, reputed the moſt <hi>Loyal</hi> and <hi>Monarchical men,</hi>
did more than any body queſtion and oppoſe the late King's
<hi>Declaration of Indulgence;</hi> even They themſelves would not
allow ſo much Prerogative to the Crown.</p>
            <p>This proves the Power of <hi>Interest,</hi> and that all Perſwaſions
<hi>center</hi> with it: And when they ſee the <hi>Government</hi> engaging
them with a fix't <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> they muſt for their
own ſakes ſeek the <hi>Support</hi> of it, by which it is maintained.
This <hi>Vnion,</hi> directed under the Prince's Conduct, would
awe the greatneſs of our Neighbours, and ſoon return
<hi>Europe</hi> to its antient <hi>Ballance,</hi> and that into his hand too.
So that he may be the great <hi>Arbiter</hi> of the Chriſtian World.
But if the Policy of the Government places the Security of
its Intereſt in the <hi>Diſtruction</hi> of the <hi>civil Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
it is not to be wondered at, if they are leſs found in
the praiſes of its Conduct, than others to whom they are
offered up a Sacrifice by it.</p>
            <p>I know it will be inſinuated, <hi>That there is danger in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45312:21"/>
upon the Vnion of divers Intereſts;</hi> and this will be aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
to the <hi>Prince,</hi> by ſuch as would engroſs his <hi>Bonny</hi> and
intercept his <hi>Grace</hi> from a great part of his People. But I
will only oppoſe to that meer Suggeſtion, three Examples
to the contrary, with this Challange, That if after rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maging
the Records of all Time, they find one Inſtance
to contradict me, I ſhall ſubmit the Queſtion to their
Authority.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> is given by thoſe <hi>Chriſtian Emperors,</hi> who
admitted of all ſorts of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> into their <hi>Armies, Courts</hi>
and <hi>Senates.</hi> This, the Eccleſiaſtical Story of thoſe Times,
aſſures us, and particularly <hi>Socrates, Evagrius,</hi> and
<hi>Onuphrius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Next</hi> Inſtance is that of <hi>Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi>
               </hi>
who by a timely <hi>Indulgence,</hi> united the ſcattered ſtrength
of <hi>Holland,</hi> and, all animated by the <hi>Clemency,</hi> as well as
<hi>Valour</hi> of their Captain, crown'd his Attempts with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Glory; and what makes, continues Great.</p>
            <p>The <hi>laſt</hi> is given us by <hi>Livy,</hi> in his account of <hi>Hannibals
Army;</hi> 
               <q>That they conſiſted of divers <hi>Nations, Languages,
Cuſtoms</hi> &amp; <hi>Religions:</hi> That under all their ſucceſſes of War
and Peace, for <hi>Thirteen Years together,</hi> they never mutinied
againſt their General, nor fell out among themſelves.</q>
What <hi>Livy</hi> relates for a Wonder, the Marqueſs <hi>Virgilio
Malvetzy</hi> gives the Reaſon of, to wit, their <hi>Variety</hi> and
<hi>Difference, <hi>well managed by their General;</hi>
               </hi> for ſaid he, <q>It
was impoſſible for ſo many <hi>Nations, Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Religions</hi>
to combine, eſpecially when the <hi>General's</hi> equal hand gave
him more Reverence with them, than they had of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for one another. This (ſays he) ſome would wholly
impute to <hi>Hannibal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but however great he was, I attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
it to the variety of People in the Army: For (adds
he) <hi>Rome's</hi> Army was ever leſs given to Mutiny,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45312:22"/>
when ballanced with Auxiliary Legions, then when intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Roman.</hi> Thus much in his Diſcourſes upon <hi>Cornelius
Tacitus.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And they are neither few, nor of the weakeſt ſort of men,
that have thought the <hi>Concord</hi> of <hi>Diſcords</hi> the firmeſt Baſis
for Government to build upon. The buſineſs is to <hi>Tune</hi>
them well, and that muſt be by the skill of the <hi>Miſitian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Nature we ſee, all Heat <hi>conſumes,</hi> all Cold <hi>kills:</hi> That
three Degrees of Cold to two of Heat, allays the Heat, but
introduces the contrary Quality, and over-cools by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
but <hi>two Degrees</hi> of <hi>Cold</hi> to <hi>two</hi> of <hi>Heat,</hi> makes a <hi>Poize</hi>
in Elements, and a <hi>Ballance</hi> in Nature. And in thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
where the eveneſt Hand is carried, the Work is beſt
done, and the Maſter is moſt reverenced.</p>
            <p>This brings me to another benefit, which accrues to the
<hi>Monarchy</hi> by a <hi>Toleration,</hi> and that is a <hi>Ballance <hi>at home:</hi>
               </hi>
For though it be improbable, it may ſo happen, that either
the conforming or non-conforming Party may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>tiful;
the one is then a Ballance to the other. <hi>This might have
prevented much Miſchief to our ſecond and third <hi>Henry,</hi> King
<hi>John,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard,</hi> and unhappy
<hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, as it undeniably ſaved the <hi>Royal Family</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> and ſecured <hi>Holland,</hi> and kept it from truckling
under the Spaniſh Monarchy.</hi> While all <hi>hold</hi> of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
'tis that which gives the Scale to the moſt Datiful;
but ſtill, no farther than to ſhow Its Power, and awe the
diſorderly into Obedience, not to deſtroy the <hi>Ballance,</hi> leſt It
ſhould afterwards want the means of <hi>Over-poizing Faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this is more than Fancy; plain it is, that the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter</hi>
muſt firmly adhear to the Government for his <hi>Being,</hi>
while the <hi>Church-man</hi> is provided for. The one ſubſiſts by
its <hi>Mercy,</hi> the other by its <hi>Bounty.</hi> This is ty'd by <hi>Plenty,</hi>
but that by <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> which being the laſt of Tyes, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45312:22"/>
ſtrongeſt of Obligations, the Security is greateſt from him,
that it is fancied moſt unſafe to <hi>Tolerate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides this, the <hi>Tranquility</hi> which it gives at Home,
will both oblige thoſe that are upon the Wing for <hi>Forreign
Parts,</hi> to <hi>pitch here again;</hi> and at a time when our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Monarch is waſting his People, excite thoſe Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers
into his Majeſties Kingdoms, whoſe Number will
encreaſe that of his Subjects, and their Labour and Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Trade and Wealth of his Dominions.</p>
            <p>For what are all <hi>Conquests</hi> but of People? And if the
Government may by <hi>Indulgence</hi> add the Inhabitants of <hi>Ten
Cities</hi> to thoſe of its own, it obtains a <hi>Victory</hi> without <hi>charge.</hi>
The Antient <hi>Perſecution of</hi> France <hi>and the</hi> Low Countries,
has furniſht us with an invincible Inſtance; for of thoſe
that came hither on that account, we were <hi>inſtructed</hi> in moſt
uſeful <hi>Manufacturies,</hi> as by courſes of the like nature, we <hi>loſt</hi>
a great part of our <hi>Woollen Trade.</hi> And as men, in times
of danger, draw in their Stock, and either tranſmit it to other
Banks, or bury their Talent at home for ſecurity (that being
out of ſight, it may be out of reach too (and either is fatal
to a Kingdom) So this mildneſs entreated, ſetting every
mans Heart at reſt, every man will be at work, and the
Stock of the Kingdom employed; which, like the <hi>Blood,</hi>
that hath its due paſſage, will give <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Vigour</hi> to every
Member in the publick Body.</p>
            <p>And here give me leave to mention the Experiment made
at Home by his late Majeſty, in his Declaration of <hi>Indulgence.</hi>
No matter how well or ill built the act of State was, 'tis no
part of the buſineſs in hand, but what effect the <hi>Liberty of it</hi>
had upon the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Wealth</hi> of the Kingdom, may have
inſtruction in it to our preſent Condition. 'Twas evident,
that all men Laboured cheerfully, and Traded boldly, when
they had the <hi>Royal Word</hi> to keep what they got, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45312:23"/>
the <hi>King</hi> himſelf became the <hi>univerſal <hi>Juſurer</hi>
               </hi> of Diſſenters
Eſtates. <hi>White-Hall</hi> then, and <hi>St. James</hi>'s were as much
viſited and courted by their reſpective Agents, as if they had
been of the <hi>Family:</hi> For that which <hi>eclipſed</hi> the <hi>Royal Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
being by his <hi>own Hand</hi> thus removed, his benigne In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
drew the returns of Sweetneſs and Duty from that
part of his Subjects, that the want of thoſe Influences had
made barren before. Then it was that we look't like the
Members of one Family, and Children of one Parent. Nor
did we envy our eldeſt Brother, <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> his Inheritance,
ſo that we had but a Child's Portion: For not only <hi>Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
vaniſh't,</hi> but no matter was left for ill Spirits, forreign
or domeſtick, to <hi>brood</hi> upon, or hatch to Miſchief. Which
was a plain proof, that it is the <hi>Vnion</hi> of <hi>Intereſts,</hi> and not
of <hi>Opinions,</hi> that gives Peace to Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>And with all Deference to Authority, I would ſpeak it, the
<hi>Liberty</hi> of the Declaration, ſeems to be our <hi>Engliſh Amomum</hi>
at leaſt, the <hi>Soveraign Remedy</hi> to our Engliſh Conſtitution.
And to ſay true, we ſhifted Luck as ſoon as we had loſt it;
<hi>like thoſe that looſe their <hi>Royal Gold,</hi> their <hi>Evil</hi> returns.</hi>
For all Diſſenters ſeem'd then united in their affection to the
<hi>Government,</hi> and follow'd their Affairs without fear or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction.
<hi>Projects</hi> then, were ſtale and unmerchantable,
and no body cared for them, becauſe no body wanted them:
That gentle <hi>Opiate</hi> at the Prince's hand, laid the moſt buſie
and Turbulent to ſleep: But when the loſs of that <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
made them uncertain, and that uneaſie, their Perſons
and Eſtates being again expoſed to pay the Reckoning of
their <hi>Diſſent,</hi> no doubt, but every Party ſhifted then as they
could: Moſt grew ſelfiſh, at leaſt, jealous, fearing one
ſhould make Bargains apart, or excluſive of the other. This
was the fatal part <hi>Diſſenters</hi> acted to their common Ruin:
And I take this Partiality to have had too great a ſhare in our
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45312:23"/>
late Animoſities; which, by freſh Accidents falling in, have
ſwell'd to a mighty Deluge, ſuch an one as hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
the former civil Concord and Serenity of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
And pardon me if I ſay, I cannot ſee that thoſe <hi>Waters</hi>
are like to <hi>aſſwage,</hi> till this <hi>Olive Branch</hi> of <hi>Indulgence</hi> be ſome
way or other reſtored: The <hi>Waves</hi> will ſtill cover our Earth,
and a ſpot of Ground will hardly be found in this glorious Iſle,
for a great Number of uſeful People to ſet a quiet foot upon.
And to perſue the Allegory; what was that <hi>Ark</hi> it ſelf, <hi>but
the most apt and lively <hi>Emblem</hi> of <hi>Toleration?</hi>
               </hi> A kind of
<hi>natural Temple</hi> of <hi>Indulgence.</hi> In which, we find <hi>two of every</hi>
living Creature dwelling together, of <hi>both</hi> Sexes too, that
they might <hi>propagate;</hi> and that as well of the <hi>unclean</hi> as
<hi>clean</hi> kind: So that the <hi>baſer</hi> and leſs uſeful ſort were ſaved.
Creatures never like to change their Nature, and ſo far from
being whip't and puniſh't to the Altar, that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
forbid. <hi>Theſe were Saved, theſe were Fed and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to their Antient Paſtures.</hi> Shall we be ſo mannerly
as to complement the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> with the ſtile of <hi>Clean,</hi> and
ſo humble as to take the <hi>Vnclean</hi> kind to our ſelves, who are
the leſs Noble, and more Clowniſh ſort of People? I think
verily we may do it, if we may but be ſaved too by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi>
of our <hi>Engliſh Ark.</hi> And this the <hi>Peaceable</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Diſſenter</hi> has the leſs reaſon to fear, ſince <hi>Sacred Text</hi>
tells us, <hi>'Twas Vice,</hi> and <hi>not Opinion</hi> that brought the Deluge
upon the reſt. And here (to drop our Allegory) I muſt
take leave to hope, that thought the Declaration be gone, if
the reaſon of it remain, I mean, the <hi>Intereſt of the
Monarchy,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and His <hi>Great Council</hi> will graciouſly
pleaſe to think a <hi>Toleration,</hi> no Dangerous nor Obſolete thing.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Toleration</hi> has many <hi>Arguments</hi> for it, that are drawn
from the Advantages that have &amp; would come to the Publick
by it, ſo there are divers <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> that muſt unavoidably
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45312:24"/>
follow the <hi>Perſecution</hi> of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that may reaſonably
diſſwade from ſuch Severity. For they muſt either be
<hi>Ruin'd, Fly</hi> or <hi>Conform;</hi> and perhaps the laſt is not the
<hi>Safeſt.</hi> If they are <hi>Ruin'd</hi> in their Eſtates, and their Perſons
<hi>Impriſon'd,</hi> modeſtly computing, a <hi>fourth</hi> of the <hi>Trade</hi> and
<hi>Manufactury</hi> of the Kingdom <hi>ſinks;</hi> and thoſe that have
help't to <hi>maintain</hi> the <hi>Poor,</hi> muſt come upon the <hi>Poors Book</hi>
for <hi>Maintenance.</hi> This ſeems to be an <hi>Impoveriſhing</hi> of the
Publick. But if to avoid this, they <hi>Tranſport</hi> themſelves,
with their Eſtates, into <hi>other</hi> Governments; nay, though
it were to any of his <hi>Majeſties Plantations,</hi> the Number were
far <hi>too great</hi> to be ſpar'd from Home. So much <hi>Principal
Stock</hi> wanting to turn the yearly Traffick, and ſo many
People too, to conſume our yearly Growth, muſt iſſue <hi>fatally</hi>
to the <hi>Trade</hi> one way, and on the <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Rents</hi> of the
Kingdom the other way.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, If they ſhould reſolve, neither to <hi>ſuffer</hi> nor
<hi>fly,</hi> but <hi>conform</hi> to prevent both. It is to be enquired, if this
<hi>Cure</hi> of <hi>Church-Diviſion</hi> be <hi>ſafe</hi> to the State; or not rather,
a raking up <hi>Coals under Aſhes,</hi> for a future Miſchief? He
whom Fear or Policy hath made <hi>Treacherous</hi> to his own
Conſcience, ought not to be held <hi>True</hi> to any thing but his
own <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Revenge.</hi> His Conformity gives him the
firſt, and his Reſentment of the Force that compels it, will
on no occaſion let him want the laſt. So that <hi>Conformity
couzens</hi> no body but the Government: For the <hi>State Phanatick</hi>
(which is the <hi>unſafe</hi> thing to the State) being <hi>chriſten'd</hi> by
<hi>Conformity,</hi> he is Elegible every where, with Perſons the
moſt devoted to the Prince: And all men will hold themſelves
<hi>protected</hi> in their Votes by it.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Receipt</hi> to make <hi>Faction keep, and preſerve Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty
againſt all Weathers.</hi> For whereas the nature of <hi>Teſts</hi>
is to <hi>diſcover,</hi> this is the way to <hi>conceal</hi> the Inclinations of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45312:24"/>
men from the Government. <hi>Plain Diſſent</hi> is the <hi>Prince with
a Candle in His hand:</hi> He ſees the <hi>Where</hi> and <hi>What</hi> of
Perſons and Things: He diſcriminates, and makes that a
rule of conduct: but forc'd <hi>Conformity</hi> is the <hi>Prince in the
dark:</hi> It blows out his Candle, and leaves him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Diſtinction: Such Subjects are like <hi>Figures in Sand,</hi>
when Water is flap't upon them, they run together, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcernable:
Or <hi>written Sedition,</hi> made <hi>illegible</hi> by writing the
<hi>Oaths</hi> &amp; <hi>Canons</hi> upon it: <hi>The ſafeſt way of blotting out Danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I know not how to forbear ſaying, that this <hi>neceſſary
Conformity</hi> makes the Church <hi>dangerous</hi> to the State: For even
the <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> that follows, makes the Church both <hi>conceal</hi> and
<hi>protect</hi> the Hypocrites; which together with their <hi>Liberality</hi>
to the <hi>Parſon, Charity to the Poor, and Hoſpitality to their
Neighbours,</hi> recommends them to the firſt favour they have
to beſtow. That <hi>Fort</hi> is <hi>unſafe</hi> where a part of the <hi>Garriſon</hi>
conſiſts of <hi>diſguiſed Enemies;</hi> for when they take their turns
at the <hi>Watch,</hi> the <hi>danger</hi> is hardly evitable. It would then
certainly be for the ſafety of the <hi>Fort,</hi> that ſuch Friends in <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade</hi>
were induſtrouſly <hi>kept out,</hi> inſtead of being <hi>whipt</hi> in.</p>
            <p>And it was ſomething of this I remember that was made
an Argument for the <hi>Declaration of Indulgence</hi> in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble,
to wat, the <hi>greater Safety of the Government, from <hi>Open</hi>
and <hi>Publick,</hi> then private, diſſenting Meetings of worſhip;</hi> as
indeed the reſt bear the like reſemblance. For theſe were the
Topicks, <hi>quieting</hi> the People, <hi>encouraging</hi> Strangers to come
and live among us, and <hi>Trade</hi> by it; and laſtly, <hi>preventing</hi>
the Danger that might ariſe to the Government by <hi>private</hi>
Meetings. Of greater reaſon then from private men, not
leſs diſcontented, but more concealed and ſecured by the
great <hi>Drake</hi> of Church Conformity. It is this will make a
<hi>Comprehenſion</hi> of the next Diſſenters to the Church dangerous,
tho' it were practicable, of which ſide ſoever it be. For in an
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45312:25"/>
Age, the <hi>preſent Government</hi> ſhall feel the Art and Induſtry of
the comprehended. So that a <hi>Toleration</hi> is in reaſon of State
to be prefer'd. And if the Reaſons of the <hi>Declaration</hi> were
ever good, they are ſo ſtill, becauſe the Emergencies of State
that made them ſo, remain; and our Neighbours are not leſs
powerful to improve them to our detriment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it will be now ſaid,</hi> Though the Government ſhould find
its account in what has been laſt alledged, this were the way to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the Church, and encourage Diſſenters to continue in their
Errors. <hi>Which is that ſecond main Objection I propoſed at
firſt, to anſwer in its proper place, and that I think this is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I humbly ſay, if it prove the Intereſt of the three conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>Church-Intereſts</hi> in this Kingdom, a <hi>Relaxation,</hi> at leaſt,
can hardly fail us. The three Church Intereſts are, That of
the <hi>Church of England;</hi> That of the <hi>Roman-Catholick-Diſſenter;</hi>
and That of the <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Church of England</hi> ought <hi>in Conſcience and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
to conſent to the Eaſe deſired.</p>
            <p>I pray firſt, that it be conſidered, how great a reflection
it will be upon her Honour, that from a <hi>Perſecuted,</hi> ſhe
should turn a <hi>Perſecuting Church:</hi> An overthrow none of her
<hi>Enemies</hi> have been able to give to her many <hi>excellent Apologies.</hi>
Nor will it be excuſed, by her ſaying, <hi>She is in the Right,</hi>
which her Perſecutors were not; ſince this is a confidence
not wanting in any of them, or her <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> and the
truth is, it is but the begging of a Queſtion, that will by no
means be granted.</p>
            <p>No body ought to know more then <hi>Church-men,</hi> that
<hi>Conſcience cannot be forced.</hi> That Offerings againſt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi>
are as <hi>odious</hi> to God, as <hi>uneaſie</hi> to them that make
them. That God loves a <hi>free Sacrifice.</hi> That Chriſt <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
Fire,</hi> though from Heaven (it ſelf) to puniſh <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi>
and commanded that the <hi>Tares ſhould grow with the</hi>

Wheat <hi>till the Harveſt.</hi> In ſine, that we ſhould <hi>love Enemies</hi>
themſelves: And to exclude worldly ſtrife for Religion;
<hi>That his Kingdom is not of this World.</hi> This was the
Doctrine of the <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> perſues the ſame courſe. Is glad Chriſt is
Preached, be it of <hi>Envy;</hi> the worſt ground for <hi>Diſſent</hi>
that can be. It was he that ask't that hard, but juſt
Queſtion, <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another mans Servant?
To his own Lord he ſtandeth or falleth.</hi> He allows the
Church a Warfare, and Weapons to perform it, but they
are not <hi>Carnal,</hi> but <hi>Spiritual.</hi> Therefore it was ſo adviſed,
that every man in matters of Religion, ſhould be <hi>fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in his own mind,</hi> and if any were ſhort or miſtaken, God
would, in his time, <hi>Inform</hi> them better.</p>
            <p>He tells us of <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks</hi> too, and their
puniſhment, which is to the point in hand: He directs to a
<hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Admonition,</hi> and if that prevail not, <hi>reject
them:</hi> That is, <hi>refuſe</hi> them Church Fellowſhip, <hi>diſown</hi> their
Relation, and <hi>deny</hi> them <hi>Communion.</hi> But in all this there
is not a Word of <hi>Fines</hi> or <hi>Impriſonments,</hi> nor is it an excuſe
to any Church, that the <hi>civil Magiſtrate</hi> executes the ſeverity,
while they are <hi>Members of her Communion, that make and
execute the Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the Church could gain her Point, I mean <hi>Conformity,</hi>
unleſs ſhe could gain <hi>conſent</hi> too, 'twere but <hi>Conſtraint</hi> at

Number, <hi>not her Devotion.</hi> On the contrary, the reſt of
her Sons are in danger by their Hypocriſie. The moſt cloſe,
but watchful and Revengeful thing in the World. Beſides,
the Scandal can hardly be removed: To <hi>over-value Coyn,</hi> and
<hi>Rate Braſs</hi> to <hi>Silver,</hi> Beggers any Country; and to <hi>own</hi> them
for <hi>Sons</hi> ſhe <hi>never begat,</hi> debaſes and deſtroyes any Church.
'Twere better to <hi>indulge</hi> forreign Coyn of <hi>intrinſick Value,</hi> and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45312:26"/>
let it paſs for its <hi>Weight.</hi> 'Tis not Number, but <hi>Quality:</hi> Two
or three <hi>ſincere Chriſtians,</hi> that <hi>form</hi> an Evangelical Church;
and tho' the Church were <hi>leſs, more Charity</hi> on the one hand,
and <hi>Piety</hi> on the other, with exact Church-cenſure, and leſs
<hi>civil Coertion,</hi> would give her credit with <hi>Conſcience</hi> in all
Sects; without which, their Acceſſion it ſelf would be no
benefit, but diſgrace, and hazard to her Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>And to ſpeak prudently in this Affair 'tis the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of
the <hi>Church of England,</hi> not to ſuffer the Extinction of
<hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that ſhe may have a <hi>Counter Ballance</hi> to the
<hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> who, though few in Number, are
great in <hi>Quality,</hi> and greater in their forreign Friendſhips
and Aſſiſtance. On the other hand, it is <hi>her</hi> Intereſt to
<hi>Indulge</hi> the <hi>Roman-Catholick,</hi> that by his Acceſſion. She
may at all times, have the <hi>Ballance</hi> in her own hand, againſt
the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenter, <hi>leaning</hi>
               </hi> to either, as ſhe finds
her <hi>Doctrine</hi> undermined by the one, or her <hi>Diſcipline</hi> by
the other; or laſtly, her <hi>civil Interest</hi> endangered from
either of them.</p>
            <p>And it is certainly the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of both thoſe <hi>Extreams</hi> of
<hi>Diſſent,</hi> that <hi>She,</hi> rather than either of them ſhould hold
the <hi>Scale.</hi> For as the <hi>Proteſtant-Diſſenter</hi> cannot hope for
any Tenderneſs, excluſive of <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> but almoſt
the <hi>ſame Reaſons</hi> may be advanced againſt him; ſo on the
other hand, it would look imprudent, as well as unjuſt, in
the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> to ſolicite any Indulgence <hi>excluſive</hi> of
<hi>Protestant Diſſenters.</hi> For beſides that, this keeps up
the Animoſity, which it is their Intereſt to bury: The
conſequence will be, to take the advantage of Time, to
<hi>ſnatch</hi> it from one another, when an united <hi>Requeſt</hi> for <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
once granted, will oblige both Parties, in all times,
for <hi>Example</hi> ſake, to have it <hi>equally</hi> preſerved. Thus are all
Church-Intereſts of <hi>Conformiſts</hi> and <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> rendered
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45312:26"/>
conſiſtent and ſafe in their civil Intereſt one with the

            <p>
               <hi>But it will laſt of all, doubtleſs, be objected,</hi> That though a
Toleration were never ſo deſirable in it ſelf, and in its conſequence
beneficial to the Publick, yet the Government cannot allow it, without

knock them on the Head: Let us call to mind, that the <hi>Religion</hi>

any Religion more, than declining to ſupport it ſelf by its
<hi>own Charity</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> and taking Sanctuary in the <hi>Arms,
rather than the Vnderſtanding of men.</hi> Violences are ill Pillars
for Truth to reſt upon. The Church of <hi>England</hi> muſt be
maintain'd: Right; but can't that be done without the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter</hi>
be deſtroyed? In vain then did <hi>Chriſt</hi> command <hi>Peter</hi>
to put up his Sword, with this Rebuke, <hi>He that kills with the
Sword, with the Sword ſhall be killed,</hi> if his Followers are to
draw it again. He makes killing for <hi>Religion,</hi> Murder,
and deſerving Death: Was he then in the right, Not to
call Legions to his aſſiſtance? And are not his Followers of
theſe times in the wrong, to ſeek to uphold their Religion
by any methods of Force? The <hi>Church of England</hi> muſt be
maintain'd, therefore the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that almoſt hold the
ſame Doctrine, muſt be ruined. A Conſequence moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
as it is almoſt impoſſible. For beſides that, the
<hi>Drudgery</hi> would unbecome the civil Magiſtrate, who is, the
Image of divine Juſtice and Clemency, and that it would
faſten the Character of a <hi>Falſe</hi> Church, upon one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres

upon a Task that is hard to be performed. <hi>Kings can no more
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45312:27"/>
make Brick without Straw, than Slaves.</hi> The Condition of
our Affairs is much chang'd, and the Circumſtances our
Government is under, differ mightily from thoſe of our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.</hi>
They had not the ſame <hi>diſſents</hi> to deal with, nor thoſe
Diſſents the like Bodies of People to render them formidable,
and their Proſecution miſchievous to the State. Nor did

               </gap>: There are
other Reaſons to be aſſigned, of which, the opportunities
Domeſtick Trouble gave to their Increaſe and Power, and
the Severities uſed to ſuppreſs them, may go for none of
the leaſt. So that it was as <hi>involuntary</hi> in the <hi>Prince,</hi> as to
the <hi>Church</hi> Anxious. And under this neceſſity to tye the
Magiſtrate to old meaſures, is to be regardleſs of Time,
whoſe <hi>freſh</hi> Circumſtances give <hi>Aim</hi> to the conduct of wiſe
men in their preſent Actions. Governments, as well as
Courts, <hi>change</hi> their Faſhions: The <hi>ſame Clothes</hi> will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſerve: And Politicks made <hi>Obſolete</hi> by new Accidents,
are as <hi>unſafe</hi> to follow, as antiquated Dreſſes were <hi>ridiculous</hi>
to ware.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Sea-men</hi> know, and teach us in their daily practice:
They <hi>humour</hi> the <hi>Winds,</hi> though they will <hi>lie</hi> as near as they
can, and <hi>trim</hi> their Sails by their Compaſs: And by pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
under theſe conſtrained and uneven Courſes, it is they
gain their Port at laſt. This juſtifies the Governments
change of Meaſures from the change of Things; for <hi>res no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt
male Adminiſtrari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to be free, it looks more then Partial, to Elect and
Reprobate too. That the <hi>Church of England</hi> is prefer'd, and
has the <hi>Fat of the Earth, the Authority of the Magiſtrate, and
the Power of the Sword in her Sons Hands, which comprehends
all the Honours, Places, Profits, and Powers of the Kingdom,</hi>
muſt not be repined at: Let her have it, and keep it all,
and let none dare ſeek or accept an Office that is not of her.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45312:27"/>
But to ruin <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to compleat her Happineſs, (pardon
the Alluſion) is <hi>Talvauiſm</hi> in the worſt ſence; for this is
that <hi>Horrendem Decretum</hi> reduc'd to Practice: And to purſue
that ill-natured Principle, <hi>Men are civilly Damn'd for that
they cannot help,</hi> ſince Faith is not in Man's power, though
it ſometimes expoſes one to it.</p>
            <p>It is a <hi>ſevere Dilemma,</hi> that a man muſt either renounce
<hi>that</hi> of which he makes Conſcience in the ſight of God, or
be <hi>civilly</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtically Reprobated.</hi> There was a time
when the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> her ſelf ſtood in need of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and made up a great part of the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> of
this Kingdom, and what ſhe then wanted, ſhe pleaded for,
I mean a <hi>Toleration,</hi> and that in a general Stile, as divers of
the Writings of her Doctors tell us: Of which let it be
enough but to mention that excellent Diſcourſe of Dr. <hi>Taylor,
Biſhop of Down,</hi> entituled <hi>Liberty of Prophecy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that which makes Severity look the worſe in the
Members of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> is the <hi>Modeſty</hi> ſhe <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes</hi>
about the truth of the things ſhe believes: For though
perhaps it were indefencible in any Church to compel a
man to that which ſhe were infallibly aſſured to be true, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſhe ſuperceeded his Ignorance by <hi>Conviction, rather than
Authority,</hi> it muſt doubtleſs look rude to puniſh men into
Conformity to that, of the truth of which, the Church her
ſelf pretends no certainty. Not that I would leſs believe a
Church ſo cautious then one more confident; but I know not
how to help thinking Perſecution harſh, <hi>when they ruin Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for not believing that, which they have not in themſelves the
power of believing,</hi> and which ſhe <hi>cannot give them,</hi> and of
which her ſelf is <hi>not infallibly aſſured.</hi> The Drift of this is
<hi>Moderation,</hi> which well becomes us poor Mortals, <hi>That
for every idle Word we ſpeak muſt give an account at the Day of
Judgment,</hi> if our Saviour's Doctrine have any credit with
us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:45312:28"/>
It would much mittigate the Severity, if the diſſent were
<hi>Sullen or in Contempt.</hi> But if men can't help or hinder their,
Belief, they are rather <hi>Vnhappy</hi> than <hi>Guilty,</hi> and more to be,
<hi>pitied</hi> than <hi>blamed.</hi> However, they are of the reaſonable
ſtock of the Country, and though they were unworthy of
<hi>Favour,</hi> they may not be unfit to <hi>live.</hi> 'Tis Capital, at Law,
to <hi>deſtroy <hi>Baſtards</hi>
               </hi> and <hi>By-blows</hi> are lay'd to the Pariſh
to keep: They muſt maintain them at laſt: And shall not
theſe natural Sons, at leaſt, be laid at the Door of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
Unhappy fate of <hi>Diſſenters!</hi> to be leſs heeded, and
more deſtitute then any Body. If this ſhould ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be the effect of their own Folly, with ſubmiſſion, it can
never be the conſequence of the <hi>Government's Engagements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Election</hi> does not neceſſarily imply a <hi>Reprobation</hi> of the
reſt. If God hath elected ſome to Salvation, it will not
follow, of courſe, that he hath abſolutly rejected all the reſt.
For tho' he was God of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he was God of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
too, and they were his People, tho' the <hi>Jews</hi> were his <hi>peculiar</hi>
People. <hi>God reſpects not Perſons,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the good of
all Nations are accepted. The Difference at laſt will not be
of <hi>Opinion,</hi> but <hi>Works: Sheep</hi> or <hi>Goats,</hi> all, of all
Judgments will be found; and, <hi>Come, well done;</hi> or <hi>Go ye
Workers of Iniquity,</hi> will conclude their Eternal State: Let
us be careful therefore of an <hi>Opinion-Reprobation</hi> of one
another.</p>
            <p>We ſee the God of Nature hath taught us ſofter Doctrine
in his great Books of the World: His <hi>Sun ſhines,</hi> and his <hi>Rain
falls upon all.</hi> All the Productions of Nature are by <hi>Love,</hi>
and shall it be proper to <hi>Religion</hi> only to propagate by
<hi>Force?</hi> The poor <hi>Hen</hi> inſtructs us in Humanity, who, to
defend her feeble Young, refuſes no danger. All the <hi>Seeds</hi>
and <hi>Plants</hi> that grow for the uſe of Man, are <hi>produc'd</hi> by the
kind and warm Influences of the Sun. 'Tis <hi>Kindneſs</hi> that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45312:28"/>
upholds human Race. People don't <hi>multiply in ſpight:</hi> And
if it be by <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>friendly</hi> ways, that <hi>Nature</hi> produces and
matures the Creatures of the World, certainly <hi>Religion</hi> ſhould
teach us to be <hi>Mild</hi> and <hi>Bearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let your Moderation be known to all men,</hi> was the ſaying
of a great Doctor of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, and his Reaſon for
that command <hi>Cogent; For the Lord is at hand.</hi> As if he had
ſaid, Have a care what you do, be not <hi>bitter</hi> nor <hi>violent,</hi>
for the <hi>Judge is at the Door:</hi> Do as you would be done to,
leſt what you <hi>deny</hi> to others, God should <hi>refuſe to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after all this, ſhall the <hi>Church of England</hi> be leſs tender
of mens <hi>Conſciences</hi> than our <hi>common Law</hi> is of their <hi>Lives,</hi>
which had rather a <hi>Thouſand <hi>Criminals</hi>
               </hi> ſhould eſcape, than
that <hi>One <hi>Innocent</hi>
               </hi> ſhould periſh? Give me leave to ſay, that
there are many <hi>Innocents</hi> (Conſcience excepted) now expoſed,
Men honeſt, peaceable and uſeful; free of ill deſignes; that
pray for <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and pay their Tribute to <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any tell us, <hi>They have, or may, ill uſe their Toleration.</hi> I
ſay, this muſt be look't to, and not Liberty therefore refuſed;
for the <hi>Engliſh Church</hi> cannot ſo much forget her own Maxim
to Diſſenters, That <hi>Propter abuſum non eſt Tollendus uſus.</hi> It
ſuffices to our <hi>Argument,</hi> 'tis no <hi>neceſſary</hi> Conſequence, and
that <hi>Fact</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> are for us. And if any miſuſe ſuch
Freedom, and entitle <hi>Conſcience</hi> to <hi>Miſbehavour,</hi> we have
other Laws enough to catch and puniſh the Offendors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>treating <hi>One Party</hi> with the Spoils of <hi>Six.</hi>
               </hi> And when
Religion becomes no mans Intereſt, it will hardly ever be
any mans Hypocriſie. Men will chuſe by Conſcience, which
at leaſt preſerves Integrity, though it were miſtaken: And
if not in the wrong, <hi>Truth</hi> recompences Inquiry, and <hi>Light</hi>
makes amends for Diſſent.</p>
            <p>And ſince a plain Method offers it ſelf, from the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45312:29"/>
of our caſe, I take the freedom to preſent it for the
<hi>Model</hi> of the <hi>entreated Toleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much has been deſired, ſaid and preſt in reference to the
late King's being <hi>Head</hi> of a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> League, which takes

Chriſtians being excluded. But I moſt humbly offer, that
our wiſe men would pleaſe to think of another Title for our
<hi>King,</hi> and that is <hi>Head</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian League,</hi> and give
the Experiment here at Home in his own Dominions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> is admitted <hi>of All</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi>
and <hi>by All</hi> acknowledged, in the <hi>Apoſtles Creed.</hi> Here every
Party of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> meet, and center as in a General. The

into, are thoſe divers Perſwaſions we have within this
Kingdom; the <hi>Church of England, Roman-Catholicks,
Grecians, Lutheraus, Preſbyterians Independents,
Anabaptiſts, Quakers Socinians:</hi> Theſe I call ſo many
Orders of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that <hi>unite</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> and <hi>differ</hi> only in
the <hi>Comment;</hi> All owning one <hi>Deity, Saviour</hi> and <hi>Judge, good
Works, Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments:</hi> which <hi>Bodies</hi> once regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
and <hi>holding</hi> of the Prince, as Head of the Government,
<hi>maintaining</hi> Charity, and <hi>preſſing</hi> Piety, will be an <hi>Honour</hi>
to Chriſtianity, a <hi>Strength</hi> to the Prince and a Benefit to
the Publick: For in lieu of an <hi>unattainable</hi> (at beſt an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere)
Vniformity,</hi> we ſhall have in <hi>Civils, <hi>Vnity</hi>
               </hi> and
<hi>Amity</hi> in <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Iews</hi> before, and in the time of <hi>Herod,</hi> were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into divers Sects. There were <hi>Phariſees, Sadduces,
Herodians</hi> and <hi>Eſſenes.</hi> They maintained their Diſſent
without <hi>Ruine</hi> to the Government. And the Magiſtrates
fell under <hi>no cenſure</hi> from Chriſt for that <hi>Toleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as already has been obſerv'd, had their
<hi>divers</hi> orders of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> as <hi>diſagreeing</hi> as ever
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45312:29"/>
Chriſtians were, and that without danger to the Peace of
the State.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves ſhow us, that both <hi>other Religions,
and divers Sects</hi> of their own, are very Tolerable, with ſeou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to their Government.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman Church</hi> is a conſiderable inſtance to our
point; for ſhe is made up of divers <hi>Orders</hi> of both Sexes, of
very <hi>differing Principle,</hi> fomented ſometimes, to great <hi>Feuds</hi>
and <hi>Controverſies;</hi> as between <hi>Franciſcans, Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,
Ieſuits</hi> and <hi>Sorbomiſts;</hi> yet without danger to
the Political ſtate of the Church. On the contrary, ſhe
therefore caſt her ſelf into that Method, that ſhe might <hi>ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give vent to Novelty and Zeal, and ſuffer both without danger
of Schiſm.</hi> And theſe <hi>Regulars,</hi> are by the <hi>Popes Graunts,</hi>
privileg'd with an <hi>Exemption</hi> from Epiſcopal Viſitation and
Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>Changing then the Terms, from <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>State,</hi> the
whole contrivance looks very <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Imitable.</hi> For as by
this, <hi>Schiſme</hi> in their Church, ſo <hi>Faction</hi> in our State may be
prevented. And theſe <hi>civil Regulars</hi> depending on the <hi>civil
Power,</hi> as thoſe Religious ones do upon the <hi>Popes,</hi> will Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
like them, become the Perpetual <hi>Votarys</hi> of its
greatneſs. And thus all Parties hanging, like <hi>Keys,</hi> by one
Ring, at the civil Magiſtrates Girdle, tho' each has its several
Lock, he that keeps them can open and ſhut every Door,
as the Perſons deſerve and the publick Safety requires.</p>

               <hi>Atticus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> would by no means
have the Miniſter of <hi>Nice</hi> to reſpect any Opinion or Sect
whatſoever, in the Diſtribution of the Money ſent by him
for the Relief of Chriſtians; and by no means to prejudice
thoſe that practiſe a contrary Doctrine and Faith to theirs:
That he ſhould be ſure to relieve thoſe that hunger &amp; thirſt,
and have not wherewith to help themſelves, and make that
the rule of his conſideration. In ſhort, he made the <hi>Hereticks</hi>
to have his Wiſdom in Admiration, in that he would by no
means trouble or moleſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proclus</hi> (another Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople)</hi> was of
this Opinion, <hi>That it was far eaſier by fair means to allure unto
the Church, than by force to compell:</hi> He determined to vex no

            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi> the Father of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, laid
this down for a Principle, <hi>That thoſe that were Diſloyal to God,
would never be truſty to their Prince.</hi> And which is more, he
liv'd thus, and ſo dy'd, as his great Speech to his great Son,
on his Death-bed, amply evidences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantine <hi>the Great, in his Speech to the Roman
