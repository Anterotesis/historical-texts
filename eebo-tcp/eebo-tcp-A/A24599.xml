            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This is the Account of Rock, (<hi>viz.</hi> all that appears) if more was uſed this Year, it neither paid nor ſecured any Duty.</p>
            <p>Hence appear ſome Inconveniencies and Uncertainties to the Revenue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If Rock be uſed <hi>in Specie,</hi> there is 19 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr>
               </hi> allow'd in each Buſhel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Allowance is to the Refiner, which (if melted in Sea-water) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a much greater Quantity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The whole Charge allow'd for Officers is loſt, as is plain by ſhewing, that whatſoever Duty was paid from Salt refined, would have been paid from Brine Salt; we never uſe more or leſs than there is occaſion for, therefore whatever is paid for the one is rebated for the other.</p>
            <p>'Tis demonſtrable that 56 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr>
               </hi> Rock melted in freſh Water makes 56 <hi>l.</hi> of Salt, but 75 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr>
               </hi> is allow'd the Refiner as Parr with 56 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr>
               </hi> to the Maker from Brine: Therefore the Account of laſt Years Refining compared with Brine ſtands thus, for 70788 Buſhel, which the 19 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr>
               </hi> over made more, the Revenue was leſſened 11798 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr>
               </hi> beſides the Charge of Officers.</p>
            <p>It is to be known what the 12 <hi>
                  <abbr>d.</abbr> per</hi> Buſhel (paid before the uſe of the Rock Salt) amounted unto, and would give light into this Secret.</p>
            <p>What is exported of it, hinders the Manufactory of ſo much Salt at leaſt, if not double. But if not permitted to be dugg'd, no Frauds could be made.</p>
