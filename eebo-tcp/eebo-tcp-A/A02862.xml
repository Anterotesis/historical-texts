            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO HIS HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NORABLE
FRIEND
SIR I. P. Knight.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, holding my selfe behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vnto you, for many
kind courtesies, I cannot but
oftentimes bend and busie
my deuise, to thinke how
(in some sort) to thanke you
for the same; and if not fully
to discharge, yet freely to
acknowledge and professe my debt: to satisfie
(I say) in desire, when in deed I am not able. But,
howsoeuer in other performances I shall be weake,
yet I will not faile to leaue a large memorie of your
true habit of honestie and vertue: and in the meane
season not omit to visit you with such exercises of
penne, as the streightnes of other occasions shall
permit me leisure to contriue. For this present I haue
made choyce to present vnto you, a small enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of certaine passages of speech, lately raised at
the table of <hi>N.</hi> which, being much frequented by
persons of most principall note, hath commonly the
great varietie of dishes, answered with like varietie
of discourse.</p>
            <p>The first part of the dinner was passed ouer in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
sad and sober silence, our tongues seeming to giue
place to the office of our teeth; and euery man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17100:4"/>
the goodnesse of our fare, by close feeding
vpon the same. At the last silence was broken, and
some speeches spent in matters of conceit. In which
veine one of the companie tooke often occasion
to speake of a <hi>Terrible blow;</hi> alluding to the same
words in that letter, whereby the late practise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Maiestie and the whole body of the State,
was beaten out and brought into light. Hereupon
<hi>N.</hi> did breake forth into a liberall commendation
of the Lord <hi>Mounteagle,</hi> to whom the letter was
directed: affirming, that hee was a personage of
true honour and merit, for that by his felicitie and
faith, not onely the liues of many thousand parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
persons, and whatsoeuer else was deerest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, but the life also of this Empire was at that
time preserued; that his high Nobilitie, enobled
and made pretious both with curtesie and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie,
had now iustly placed him in the formost
ranke of same. He proceeded to declare, the fashion
of that hot and hatefull attempt: what faire opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
was thereby opened to secure our selues, from
the fierie furie of those homebred enemies, who,
rather than wee should not bee destroyed, would
ouerwhelme vs in the ruines of the state: That se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie
could not hereupon be interpreted crueltie;
that hereupon nothing could be interpreted to be
done in regard of religion, but onely for the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
defence of our safetie.</p>
            <p>This speech was diuersly taken, according as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
were diuersely disposed; some did liuelie,
some faintly, and (as it was coniectured) fainedly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
it; none did openly oppose against it.</p>
            <p>From this, they fell to talke of the Bill propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Parliament against Recusants; and of the Oath
of supremacie, which was appointed generally to be
taken. Of the first they did but sparingly speake, as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17100:4"/>
being a matter then handled in highest place of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation:
vpon the second they maintained a
longer stay. <hi>N.</hi> repeated many conueniences for
which this Oath ought generally to bee taken.
Whereto a certaine Knight replied, not directly
contradicting him, but inuoluing his intents in
such soft and nice distinctions, that hee seemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to declare that he would not haue the Oath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
at all, then in what fashion he would haue it
imposed.</p>
            <p>These obscure speeches hauing bred some incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie,
whilest euery man rather coniectured then
assured what should be ment: and controuersies of
conu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>niencie being not alwaies easie to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by way of discourse, because all men are
apt to attribute much to their owne conceits; I
drew the question to a higher degree. Affirming,
that it seemed not onely conuenient, but necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
also in all grounds and reasons of State, that a
King who acknowledgeth no superiour vnder God,
should be acknowledged to haue supreame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
vnder God in Ecclesiasticall affaires: That this
is a principall point of Regalitie, and therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
annexed to the soueraigne maiestie of euery
state: That it is a hard matter if not impossible, for
any nation, either to grow or long time to continue
very great, wherein a foraine power doth hold the
regiment in Religion: That in all ancient Empires
and Common wealthes it hath been vsed, That;</p>
            <p>I could not finish that which I was about to speak,
being interrupted by a confused clamour of three or
foure at the table, who esteemed that which I had
said, not for a <hi>paradoxe,</hi> but for an <hi>Adoxe,</hi> or flat ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie:
seeing many Christian countries, both late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and at this present, haue admitted forain gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in matters of religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:17100:5"/>
By this time the Basons and Ewers were set
vpon the table, and all of vs were attentiue to the
giuing of thankes. After wee had washed, and the
cloath was taken away. <hi>N.</hi> in this sort renewed
speech.</p>
            <p>What hath been the vse of auncient Empires and
Common-wealths, concerning supreame gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in matters pertaining to religion, I haue not (I
doe confesse) obserued: But it seemeth indeed, that
the politicall gouernment in Ecclesiasticall affaires
should be a point of Regalitie; and that it is a hard
matter, if not impossible, for any state either to grow
or long time to continue very great, wherein a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
power doth hold the regiment in religion. At
the least, either to grow or continue any greater, then
that forraine power shall thinke expedient.</p>
            <p>That which from me was openly reiected, being
allowed by <hi>N.</hi> and in the very same words by him
repeated, found good acceptance among the rest.
Whereupon I tooke occasion to say, that speech
(I perceiued) was oftentimes like vnto coine, which
passed for currant, not in regard of the mettall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but chiefely in regard of the stampe that was set
vpon it.</p>
            <p>Nay, said <hi>N.</hi> beautifying his speech with a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
smile, we will also bring your mettall to the
touch. There is but one truth in religion, which is
not subiect to any humane power: but the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
thereof, or matters of circumstance and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
forme, are held by our Church to depend vpon
the power of the Prince. If question be made touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
matter of substance, the same also may be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
within the realme, by the Clergie thereof, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
together by authoritie of the Prince. Or if
the Clergie of any other countrie should be taken to

superiours. For so <hi>Eusebius</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Euseb. lib. 6. cap. 34.</note> reporteth, that <hi>Cyprian</hi>
Bishop of Carthage did aduise with the Bishop of
Rome, concerning the affaires of the Church: and
that <hi>Dyonise</hi> of Alexandria<note n="b" place="margin">Euseb. lib. 6. cap. 46. &amp; lib. 7. cap. 5. &amp; 9.</note> aduised in like sort
with <hi>Cornelius, Stephen</hi> and <hi>Sixtus</hi> Bishops of Rome,
without attributing vnto them either title or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

ranke.</p>
            <p>Now, I haue read many controuersies in Diuinitie
concerning this question, whereof the multitude
doth rather cloy then content; and therefore I will
not embarke you in that disputation. If you can
make proofe out of other writers, that this authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in matters of religion, is a right of Regalitie, it will
follow (I suppose) that it cannot without apparant
danger depend vpon a foraine power. If also you
do manifest, that in all principall Empires and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
this authoritie hath bin exercised by
the chiefe in state, you may probably conclude that
it is a Regalitie. For these rights doe little varie, but
remaine in a manner the very same in all states, of
what kind soeuer they are. And although true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is reuealed vnto vs by God, yet religion in the
generall proceedeth from nature; in regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
there is some coherence and communitie in all
sorts of religions; as to acknowledge that there is a
God; to worship him; to worship him by oblation
and sacrifice &amp;c. For although all nations doe not
acknowledge and worship the true God, yet there is
no nation (as <hi>Cicero</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">De Nat. deo. lib. 1.</note> saith) which doth not both
acknowledge and adore some. These generall points
which naturally, or by consent of nations are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in religion, may well bee considered without
contending which religion in particular is true. For
this will hardly by all parties be agreed: because e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man (as <hi>Philo</hi> saith<note n="d" place="margin">Phil. de leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17100:6"/>
iudgeth his owne religion best. So<note n="e" place="margin">Chrysost. in Act. homil. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>
affirmeth, that in all differencies of religion,
euery man will say, <hi>I say true</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Singuli di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt, ego ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum dico.</note>. But this argument
which you haue propounded being new; this point
being not pointed at by any whom I haue seene, I
would gladly here you fortifie the same.</p>
            <p>The argument being new (answered I) and now
newly raysed into question, you must not engage
your expectation too farre; I shall doe much, if I
minister some matter for better iudgements to work

            <p>The rights of Soueraignty or of maiesty, so termed
by <hi>Cicero;</hi> and by <hi>Liuie,</hi> the rights of Empire, and of

the highest actions and affaires in some cretaine
state. These are the proper qualities of Soueraigne
or Maiesticall power; that it be both absolute and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> also perpetuall. If it be absolute but not perpetuall,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n is it not soueraigne; for such power hath been
oftentimes committed, by the <hi>Romanes</hi> to their
<hi>Dictators,</hi> by the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to their <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mostes;</hi>
by many Kings to their Regents, Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royes
or Lieutenants. But because they haue no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie
of power inherent in them, but only an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
or exercise thereof committed to their
charge, vnder limitation of time; because also it
may vpon iust cause bee reuoked within that time;
they are not accounted to haue the same in Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignetie.
And this holdeth true, although such
power bee committed for a very long time; as the
<hi>Athenians</hi> did to their great <hi>Archos</hi> for tenne yeres:
although it bee committed also in a most ample
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17100:6"/>
manner, which the auncient Latines called <hi>optima
lege,</hi> without controlement or account; such as
had the <hi>Pontifices</hi> in Rome; or as the <hi>Cuidians</hi> euery
yeere chose 60. of their Citizens whom for this cause
they called <hi>Amimones;</hi> that is, men without imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or account. And lastly, although it be without
certaine limitation of time; as sometimes had the
Regents of France, created for the infancie, furie or

then is it not soueraigne. For such power was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
by decree of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperor to the
Senate of Milan; <hi>To confirme the constitutions of the
Prince, as also to infirme and abrogate the same; to
dispence contrarie to the statutes; to make enablements,
giue prerogatiues, graunt restitutions &amp;c. that no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
should be made from the Senate &amp;c. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they should doe, should haue like force as if it were
done or decreed by the Prince.</hi>

tyrant of Constantinople, that the Sea of Rome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/>
should be the chiefe of all other Churches. But this
was an errour in the Emperours of Constantinople;
first, to settle so great dignitie and prerogatiue in a
place, far distant from the principal seat and strength
of the Empire. Secondly, to permit affaires of so
high nature to depend vpon direction of any one
within their Empire. For, by this meanes the Bishops
of Rome did steale into such strength with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, that by their Interdictions only, they
were of power to withdraw them from paying tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
and bearing alleagance to the Emperours of
Constantinople: vpon occasion, that <hi>Leo</hi> surnamed
<hi>Iconomachus,</hi> had caused the Images of Saints to be
taken downe. Finally, they pulled the west-part of
the Empire from their subiection, and left the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due,

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> The west Empire flourished for a time, first in
France, and afterwards in Germanie; and the most
apparant cause whereby it was broken and beaten
downe, was the absolute &amp; vnlimited power, which
the Bishops of Rome challenged, principally in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
affaires, and consequently in all. For, by
entitling themselues the <hi>Vicars</hi> of Iesus Christ; the
Spouse of the Church; the Soueraigne Bishop, and
Prince of all others; the Maisters and Lords of all
the world; (for these are the titles which <hi>Innocent</hi>

in matters which concerne the soule; they haue

            <p>Afterwards, weary of nothing so much as of quiet,

<hi>Henrie</hi> the fifth Emperour, the most part of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,

whom he so strongly seconded with the Normanes

the Popes to vse force of armes, when the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

this rule held good, cloisters and Colledges were in

were in steed of many armies. These were their

of all their enemies, by thundring forth threats
against those who disobeyed them; not of death,
which might be peraduenture either contemned or
else auoyded; but of damnation, which as it is most
terrible, so was it held for this cause vnauoydable.

            <p>Thus much in substance, but somwhat more brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deliuered: it seemed that there was not any man

to the discharging of their minds, which is pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said to haue dissolued the Parliament of women;
because they could not agree to speake one at once.
Many shewed themselues so impatient of silence;
and they who vpon aduisement could haue said
least, were vpon the suddaine most franke and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in words. At the last, that which was the cause
that no man could haue free libertie of speech, did
driue them all into a dumbe dumpe: which oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity

certaine examples of dangerous consequence, when
either strangers or subiects haue bin followed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
You shewed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> for auoiding the like dangers,
two policies were anciently obserued; one consisted
in excluding external ceremonies &amp; rites; the other,
in setling the gouernment for matters in religion, in
the supreame power and authority in the State. That
this last was practised among the Iewes, Aegyptians
&amp; in diuers other countries. In the foure great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies
also, of Assyria, of Persia, of Graecia, and of
Rome. Of Rome (you say) first, vnder the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Kings; secondly, in the popular state; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
vnder Heathen Emperours; and lastly, (for a good
space) vnder Christian Emperors; who in matters of
circumstance and of external forme in religion, both
vsed, and were acknowledged to haue supreame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie:
of whose lawes, diuers were afterwards ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
assumed by Popes, or attributed vnto them.
Concerning matters of substance, and of internall
forme, they assembled generall Councels; wherein
they held the Primacie; and confirmed the acts of
them by Imperiall decree. You declared also, that
when Constantinople was aduanced to be the head
of the Empire, a stiffe strife did arise betwixt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of Constantinople and of Rome, whether
should be greatest; that diuers Emperours fauoured
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17100:26"/>
the Church of Constantinople; but at the last, Pope
<hi>Boniface</hi> obtained of the Emperour <hi>Phocas,</hi> that the
Sea of Rome should be the chiefe of all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
This you account an errour in gouernment; to
settle a power of so high qualitie, in a place farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the principall strength of the Empire. For
hereby the Bishops of Rome did grow to such great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that they drew the west part of the Emp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Infidels. Lastly you haue shewed, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of Rome, aduancing their authoritie by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
haue been of power, to reduce the west Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
to a feeble state; and to hold, not the Emperour
alone, but all the chiefe Kings in Europe, either as
vassals or as tributaries to their Sea. Generally, that
they haue challenged Soueraigne iurisdiction ouer
all Kingdomes and Common-wealthes in the

seuerall points, I would think it fit, (vnder the leaue
of better Iudgements) to take some reasonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite
to aduise vpon them; because questions of this
high nature, are not alwaies the same which sodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they seeme: and he bewrayeth too great opinion
of his owne sufficiencie, who presently will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
a controuersie of this weight. But, if Christ
hath committed supreame power in religion to the
Sea of Rome, then is no place left to these rules and
reasons of state.</p>
            <p>Nay (answered <hi>N.</hi>) I haue protested before, that
we haue neither leasure nor lust to engulphe our
selues in such an Ocean. <hi>If Christ hath committed to
the sea of Rome!</hi> This is a large supposall indeed; and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17100:26"/>
that which will neuer settle in the opinion of many,
who are otherwise firmely affected to the doctrine
of the Church of Rome. Yea, I am assuredly perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the violence of ambition hath pulled many
Bishops of Rome from their owne iudgement, in
making cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me to that authoritie which they neuer
had either title to hold, or abilitie to rule. For di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of them being sodainely borne out of a low re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
state; namely, from some Cloister or heremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
into an vnknowne Sea of absolute authoritie,
they were ouerswayed therewith, like a small boate
with too large a saile: And being men for the most
part, spent in age, vntrained in experience, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by nature nor by education of abilitie, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the bounds and degrees of great affaires, they
tooke to themselues a licentious libertie; supposing
it reasonable, yea altogether necessarie, that all the
Kings and Princes of the earth, who hold their estate
immediately from heauen, who receiue their power
from the hand of God, should be subiect to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
the passions, the fierie furie; the ignorance, the
errors, the malice, of one haughtie and humerous
man, whose weaknes is subiect (as it hath bin plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
declared by their liues) to all immoderate moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of humanitie. And al this vpon no other ground
but because Christ said to S. <hi>Peter; Thou art Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note>
               <hi>and vpon this rock will I build my Church &amp;c.</hi> But what
is this to Supremacie? what is this to the Bishop of
Rome? diuers questions must be cleered before this
will serue the one or the other.</p>
            <p>For, first it is but weakely assured, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/>
was at Rome. Many reasons are alleaged against
it; and many authorities are brought for it. But it
often happeneth that the common consent of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
is like vnto a flocke of fowles; as one flieth all
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17100:27"/>
doe follow. Secondly, it is lesse assured that euer he
was Bishop of Rome. For, being an Apostle, his
charge was generall;<note place="margin">Matth. 28.</note> 
               <hi>goe teach all nations;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to be, as a Bishop, either limited or settled
in any one particular place. Or if we wil say, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by appointment or by choise, some part of this
generall charge was apportioned to S. <hi>Peter;</hi> then
this seemeth, or rather is most assured to haue been
<hi>Iudea,</hi> by that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath written: that, <hi>the
Gospell of Circumcision was committed vnto Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Galath. 2. 7.</note> as
<hi>the Gospell of the vncircumcision was vnto him.</hi> And
therefore we find in Scripture,<note place="margin">Act. 23. 11.</note> that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
sent to Rome; but that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was euer
at Rome, we hold it by tradition. This is further
confirmed by the long aboade which S. <hi>Peter</hi> made
in Iudea, and by the short stay which is possible
he could haue made at Rome, euen by computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them who best fauoured the dignitie of that
Sea.</p>
            <p>With that he called for <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> and out of him
read vnto vs, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> liued after the death of
Christ 34. yeeres, 3. monethes and odde daies; that
the first nine yeeres he remained in Iudea; that in the
tenth yeere after Christs Passion, in the end of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
yeere of the Empire of <hi>Claudius,</hi> he departed
from Iudea for feare of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> from whose impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment
hee had been deliuered by an angell;<note place="margin">Act. 12.</note> that
after he had trauailed preaching through many cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
he came to Rome, and there contended with
<hi>Simon Magus:</hi> That after foure yeeres, <hi>Agrippa</hi>
being dead, for feare of whom he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>orsooke Iudaea, he
returned to Ierusalem, and was there present at the
Councell of the Apostles, wherein circumcision was
abrogated: That after this he remained seuen yeeres
at <hi>Antioch;</hi> that in the beginning of the Empire, of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17100:27"/>
               <hi>Nero</hi> he returned to Rome, and from thence trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

            <p>Now, said he, the third question is, whether by

against it:<note place="margin">Aug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

denie it. Whereas the Scripture giueth so large
and plaine testimonie, both for the title and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of Kings, as it seemeth no greater can be added
thereunto.</p>
            <p>The fourth question may bee, whether any power
was giuen vnto S. <hi>Peter,</hi> as Bishop of Rome: (which
before the ascension of Christ hee could not bee) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
how falleth it, that the same should bee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fixed in the Church of Rome, then in any of
those Churches, where it is manifest by the scriptures
that he remained many yeeres, imploying himselfe
in the exercise of his charge?</p>
            <p>Fiftly, what assurance can we haue, that the power
which is said to be committed to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> was to be
transmitted entirely to any of his successors in place,
who are so farre from being mentioned, as it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

probable that euer they were ment. For, as
<hi>Matthias</hi> was not the worse for succeeding vnto <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
in place; so is not any man the better, onely for
his locall succession to S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, seeing the promises of God are with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
if we continue in obedience to his wil: and
therefore, although all the land of Canaan was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
promised to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his seede for an
euerlasting possession,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 8.</note> yet was the posteritie of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
for their disobedience, first cast out of the
greatest part thereof, and afterwards dispossessed of
all.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 7. 16. Psal. 89. 36.</note> And although the kingdome of Israel was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
promised to <hi>Dauid</hi> and to his seede for euer,
yet the succession was broken off, by reason of their
sinnes.<note place="margin">Apoc. 2.</note> Againe, seeing the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
furnished with many excellent vertues, was
threatned notwithstanding, that the candlesticke

their first loue was abated. If wee should suppose
(supposall is free) that expresse promise was made
to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and to his successours the Bishops of
Rome, that they should represent the authoritie of
Christ vpon earth; it will be a hard piece to perswade

               </gap>p of Colen. As this Archbishop
being also Duke of <hi>Colen,</hi> passed through a small Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
in Germanie, with so great a trame of armed
men (according to the fashion of that people) that it
neerly approched the greatnes of an armie; a certain
countrie fellow brake forth into a loude laughter
against him. And being therefore presented before
the Archbishop, hee boldly said, that hee could not
refraine both to laugh and to admire, considering
the great pouertie, the great humilitie, wherein the
Apostles passed the trauailes of this life, that they
who carrie themselues for the Apostles successours,
should thus plunge themselues both in plentie and
in pride. Simple fellow, said the Archbishop, I doe
now beare the state and presence of a Duke; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
an Archbishop when I am within the church.
At this speech, the fellow did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ise into a more broad
and bolde laughter. And being demaunded the
cause thereof, I pray you, said hee, whilest this Duke
ruineth the Church, both by action and example,
how is the Bishop in the meane time busied; and
when this Duke for this cause shall goe to the diuell,
what shall then become of the Bishop?</p>
            <p>There was not any amongs vs, who did not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
this conceit with a smile. And this had put
a period to our discourse, had not one maintained it
with further speech; that he would gladly heare these
questions so fullie followed, as then hee saw them
fairely laid. Assirming, that thereby he supposed it
would appeate, that it is impossible to find a worke
of so great waight, as is the supremacie of the Bishop
of Rome, vpon so weake and feeble a foundation.
But this will require (said hee) both the leasure and
labour of some excellent Diuine.</p>
