            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The third Figure hath the small ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of an Ash; lying with his two leaves in the kernel of an Ash, both

                  <p>The seventh Figure shews what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress the Chick hath made in his forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the third day after incubation.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57260:14"/>
made more pliable, tender, and easie to be wrought upon, the little parts of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ire should break loose; and they finding this moisture a sit subject to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, should drive it into all the parts of the little Mass, and digesting it there, should make the Mass swell.</p>
                     <p>This increase (saies he) of bulk, and swelling of the little Mass, wil of its own nature be towards all sides, by reason of the heat, whose motion is on every side, from the center to the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. But it will be most efficacious up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards the Air; because the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance is least that way, both by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the little thickness of earth over it, as also by reason that the upper part of the earth lieth very loose, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding porous, through the continual operation of the Sun, and falling of rain upon it. It cannot choose therefore but mount to the Air, and the same cause that maketh it do so, presseth at the same time the lower parts of the Mass downw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rds. But what ascendeth to the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57260:14"/>
Air must be of the hotter, and more moist parts of the fermenting Mass, and what goeth downwards, must be of his harder and drier parts; proportionate to the contrary motions of Fire and of Earth, which predominate in these two kindes of parts. Now this that is push<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upwards, coming above ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expos'd to Sun and wind, contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thereby a hard and tough skin on its outside but within is more tender. In this sort it defendeth it self from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward injuries of weather, whiles it mounteth; and by thrusting other parts down into the Earth, it holdeth it self stedfast, that although the winde may shake it, yet it cannot overthrow it. The greater this Plant groweth, the more juice is daily accrewed unto it, and the heat is encreased, and consequently, the greater abundance of humors is continually sent up; which when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to clog at the top, new humor pressing upwards, forceth a breach in the skin, and so a new piece like the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57260:15"/>
main stem, is thrust out and beginneth on the sides, which we call a branch. Thus is our Plant amplified, till Nature not being able still to breed such strong issues, falleth to works of lesse labour, and pusheth forth the most elaborate part of the Plants juice, into more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der substances: but especially at the ends of the branches; where abundant humor, but at the first not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, groweth into the shape of a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; and more and better concocted humor succeeding, it groweth softer and softer, (the Sun drawing the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilest parts outwards) excepting what the coldness of the Air, and the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Winde, do harden into an outward skin. So then the next parts to the skin are tender; but the very middle of this Button must be hard and dry, by reason that the Sun from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and the natural heat within, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and driving out the moisture, and extending it from the Center, must needs leave the more earthy parts much
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57260:15"/>
shrunk up, and hardned by their eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating out from them. This Button thus dilated and brought to this passe, we call the fruit of the Plant; whose harder part encloseth oftentimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not so hard as dry. This drought maketh these inner parts, to be like a kinde of dust, or at least such as may easily be dried into dust, when they are bruised out of the husk that enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them. And in every parcell of this dust, the nature of the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideth, as it were contracted into a small quantity: for the juice which was first in the Button, and had passed from the root through the manifold varieties of the diverse parts of the Plant, and had suffered much concoction, partly from the Sun, and partly from the inward heat, imprisoned in that harder part of the fruit, is by these passages, strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and concoctions, become at length to be like a tincture extracted out of the whole Plant, and is at last dried up into a kinde of magistery. This
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57260:16"/>
we call the Seed, which is of a fit na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by being buried in the Earth, and dissolved with humor, to renew and reciprocate the operation descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>
                     <p>But a sensitive Creature (saith he) being compared to a Plant, as a Plant is to a mixed Body; you cannot but conceive, that he must be compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it were of many Plants, in like sort as a Plant is of many mixed Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: But so, that all the Plants, which concur to make one Animal, are of one kinde of nature, and cognation. And besides, the matter, of which such diversity is to be made, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be more humid, and figurable, then that of an ordinary Plant: and the Artisicer, which worketh &amp; mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, must be more active. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must suppose, that the Mass, of which an Animal is to be made, must be actually liquid; and the Fire that worketh upon it, must be so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, that of its own nature, it may
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57260:16"/>
be able to convert this liquid matter, into such breaths and steams, as we see do arise from Water, when the Sun or Fire worketh upon it. But lest this moisture being wrought on by such an active heat, should vanish quite away; we must suppose it to have such unctuous parts, that may hold them together; so that the heat imprisoned in this viscous liquid matter, riseth in bubbles: and by reason of its solid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuousness cannot break forth, but stretch themselves longer and longer; and every one would be as it were a little Brook, whereof the chanel would be the enclosing viscous substance, and the inward smoak that extendeth it, might be compared to the Water of it.</p>
                     <p>This liquid smoak-like substance, the Fire works on in these Chanels, he makes to be three-fold; First, Watry streams, which first flie out, settle in the remotest parts, and is fittest for fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration. Secondly Oily, which give to the other continuance, and solidity.

Thirdly Fiery, which is made of the grosser, more fixt parts incorporated with Fire, having sufficient moisture to keep it flowing, and is like a Caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of fire; and these last vapours are for the continuance of heat.

                     <p>HOw much this Conceipt subverts the antique principles of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, I shall not here undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate: How far it shoulders out Truth it self, and so blots out those indeleble Characters, fixt by the finger
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57260:17"/>
of the Creator on every species; those inscriptions on all his works, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct constitutions, parts, operations, and figures (which are as so many Bushes, or Signes hung out, to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what are the inhabitants within) will easily shew us. For if heat rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a substance, making it thrust it self into a larger space were the sole author of all generation; and were the cause why Plants grow up in stalk and leaves, and downwards in root: we must either admit those differing Characters to be vain accidental chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or else look out some other agent, from whose fruitful womb, this vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety might spring forth. If we but mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster over the numerous Regiments or several species of Plants, and consider how this grows up with a square stalk, that with a round; some start up hex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular, others triangular; some bear a fruit of one form, some of another: and in them fashion seeds, of as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring figures as themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57260:18"/>
leaves also and flowers shew as much of variety, as skill in the Workman; every Plant being by them as soon discern'd, as seen. Let us call over like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the differing numbers of Animals, Insects, and others; and examine all the starting holes, that Fire can breathe forth a stream by; all the casual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressures of cold, or external accidents; and compare them together, we shall see whether such a fruitful stock of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in colours, shape form, vertue, and many other differing signatures, can be the issue of such accidental, and equivocal parents.</p>
                     <p>If this formation of Creatures arise from heat extending, and enlarging a small moistned lump; without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consideration, why are not these Atomes extended circularly; and so all Bodies should be cast into the same Mould with the Heavens; and should, as they seem to us, be all sphericall. But he tells us of some light parts, that, besides the power of the Fire enforcing,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57260:18"/>
naturally climb upwards: and of others, which by their natural weight, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to sink into the Farth, to hold the mounting parts stedfast, that they may not be overthrown by Windes. But were there nothing else to give a figure to Plants, but ascending and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending, of light and heavy parts; whence should that variety arise in the fashion of those ascending and descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts: the weight of the parts should carry them directly downwards, as the lightness doth upwards; and so all roots should descend in one continued round, but long, lump: what then makes some spherical, others stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out infinite numbers of hairy threds; some directly downwards, others pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the superficies. The Author tells us the figures of them, as of the ascending parts, are caused by some external accidents: As when the more hot and moist parts are ascended, and broken from the prison of the Earth, the cold air compresseth and hardneth
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57260:19"/>
the external parts, and so enricheth this sprouting upstart, with a hard tough skin; both armour and clothes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the interior softer parts. The hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Earth, likewise compresseth the descending parts, into such forms as we finde them of. But may not the truth of this be vehemently suspected; when, if we examine the coat, we shall finde it more penetrable then the Body: and more subject to external injuries, then that inclosed? as in all Trees and Plants, the Bark and Rinde is of a more flexible, tender, and soft composure then the invested Trunk: and the hard solid shell of Walnuts, Almonds, stones of Plumbs, &amp;c. are invironed with a very tender substance. Besides this, there is yet a greater doubt, how this external cold air should in the same place, at the same instant of time, fashion these mounting Atoms into a round stem, with a long, sharp leaf: and close by that, compress others into a square, hexangular, or triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57260:19"/>
shape; with leaves round, jagged, indented, scollopt, or the like? as may be seen in several Plants, inhabitants of the same piece of ground, under the same Heavens, inviron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d with the same Air, and heavenly influences. These di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct figures cannot spring from the cold circumstant Air; for this apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self alike to all, and every side of these ascending parts, should equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compresse every part; and so all Plants should sprout up cylindrical, as the Trunks of Trees do.</p>

of Bodies, proceed from a defect in one of the three dimensions; caused by the concurrence of accidental cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; we shall finde it extreamly straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the most delightful variety of the Creation, and the infinite power of the Creator. For upon these grounds it must be supposed, that the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect figure is to be cubical, and all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies should have been cast into that mould, but that some external causes stepping in, hinder almost all from obtaining that perfection: the Creator not being able to withstand their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency; or by patching up that defect, could not give perfection to all that, which his own mouth assures us was good. The examples also which he produceth, teach us there is but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle truth in this position; for how can we conceive the watry drops of rain falling, should suffer violence (as to be pared round) by the softer Air, which is not able so much as to hinder it from falling? The fashioning of Salts
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57260:21"/>
(as he relates) doth as little satisfie. As for Alume, it is not of such unctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts as he reports; for how then could it so indiscernably be dissolved in Water, and so much resist Fire, which is not proper to unctuous Bodies? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, being dissolved and falling again, what should hinder the parts from meeting all in a lump, and conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves to the fashion of the bottom of the Vessel, in which they are contained; as we see all unctuous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do? As for Salt, if that should acquire his figure on the superficies of the Water as he informes us, it should be only long and broad, without thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: whence then come those exact cubical forms in Salts, which are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to coagulate of themselvs. Where you shall finde the most exact Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician out-gone by this natural Art. Neither is this caused by the falling of parts one upon another, (as hee speaks be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ore of Alume) ere the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are throughly hardned: for then
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57260:21"/>
why should it not arise still in height, by the continual addition of descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts, as long as there are any Attoms to fall, by which meanes it should not become cubical, but a long square. But we finde the contrary, while it most exactly casts it self into cubes; the angles sometimes looking upwards, sometimes transversly; which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, if those squares were made, by long and broad Bodies falling one upon another. And vitriol, though calcined to perfect redness, if dissolv'd and fixt again, not onely recovers his bright shining greenness, but is squared out into various angles, looking every way, as if it had been fashioned by the hand of the Artificer.</p>
                     <p>The figure of Saltpeeter is almost neglected by him; onely he tels us, that by reason of its drinesse, it is more difficultly figured, and therefore is not equally increased. But if we examine it well, we shall finde it more unctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then the other two, and is more
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57260:22"/>
readily cast into that figure, then the other. For it doth not onely shoot forth presently almost in water, after it is removed from the heat; but we shall finde it oftentimes upon new Wals shot forth to a great length, without the help of Water to fashion it in. So that there seems to be some more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular agent to be found out, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately imprinteth these determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble figures; which should rather work by a conceived designe of producing such a figure, in such a Body. How else could such effects continually be wrought, (accidental causes working not still alike) and therefore it were impossible to expect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The formation of Animals affords us little lesse perplexity.

                        </gap>ector cannot appear. That there are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57260:22"/>
in all Animals three sorts of chanels, is an unquestionable truth; but that there are distinct Bodies conveighed by them, though taught us by our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, is not granted, nor by him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for a truth. For in the next Chapter we shall finde him applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the circulation of the blood; and describing its motion through, and from the Arteries to the Veins, and from them to the Arteries again. Both of these chanels then must be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the same liquor; onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the Veins it may be something cooler, and thicker; as our Bath wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are lesse hot in the gutters, then in the spring. That which is conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the other chanel, the Nerves, we can scarce afford it the distinction of another Body; it being only the pure, and most subtile selected parts of the blood, which was conveighed in the other two chanels. Neither, if it were granted that three distinct Bodies, were continually traversing those three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57260:23"/>
chanels into the Bodies of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals; doth he shew us, how they put themselves into such various shapes and figures, (when they have escaped this conquering expelling heat) as we finde them wonderfully exprest in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature.</p>
                     <p>All things arising in fumes &amp; steams, as moist Bodies wrought on by heat will do, when they are freed from that which rarified them, return to their own nature and forms again. As Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rarified, (when those minute parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of heat that divides it into such small Atomes, and mixed themselves with it, are either lost or overcome by the watery Atomes,) returns again to water. Or if those particles remain still active, they do but further divide it; and so it becomes more like Fire, by having a greater number of fiery Atomes mixed with it, yet is not made another thing, either in substance or figure. But in the generation of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is far otherwise; where the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57260:23"/>
product or effect is much differing from what the matter or the agent were. Now how this difference doth arise, and how this change is wrought, we must enquire a little further, then what heat and moisture will lead us unto.</p>

                     <p>HAving thus far wandered in the search of a truth, examining those opinions which have endeavoured its discovery; and finding them much fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their labours: I shall the more boldly attempt the same enterprize: hoping if I fail in so great a businesse, to passe along in the crowd, though not undiscern'd, yet favourably censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57260:24"/>The production of all Creatures, after the first Omnipotent <hi>Fiat</hi> was executed; is by Philosophers called <hi>Generation.</hi> Which is performed by parts selected from the generators, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in them the substance, forms, properties, and operations of the parts of the generators, from whence they were extracted: and this <hi>Quintessence or Magistery</hi> is called the <hi>seed.</hi> By which the Individuals of every Species are multiplied; and that which the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for its transgression, made to have an end; by the fertility of this Sperm, is continued to immortality.</p>
                     <p>From this all Creatures take their beginning; some laying up the like matter, for further procreation of the same Species.</p>
                     <p>In others, some diffus'd Atomes of this extract, shrinking themselves into some retired parts of the Matter; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as it were lost, in a wilderness of other confused seeds; and there sleep, till by a discerning corruption
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57260:24"/>
they are set at liberty, to execute their own functions. Hence it is, that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny swarms of living Creatures are from the corruption of others brought forth: From our own flesh, from other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, from Wood, nay, from every thing putrified, these imprisoned, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal principles are muster'd forth, and oftentimes having obtained their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by a kinde of revenge feed on their prison; and devour that which preserv'd them from being scatter'd.</p>
                     <p>Neither are these without their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate forms; for from the walls of their bodies frequently, broken by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, issue forth other Creatures, differing in <hi>specie</hi> from themselves; as whosoever will but examine the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Insects,</hi> shall easily finde.</p>
                     <p>This seed consists of two parts, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Atomes,</hi> animated and directed by a spiritual form, proper to that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies whose the seed is; and given to such matter at the creation, to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it from other matters, and to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57260:25"/>
make it such a Creature as it is. Both which are separated, the Material A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes from the body; the form, from the form of the generator. Which in Vegetables. and sensitive Creatures, where the forms are composed of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial substances, our Philosophers are easily perswaded to believe. But how the immortal soul of man, should be communicated to these corruptible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Atomes of the seed of Man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to its most pure nature, seems a Riddle to our Philosophers, and impiety to our Divines. I shall not undertake those large disputes <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> about this argument, but do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Soul of Man may be traduced, though not generated; may spread and multiply it self into many, without fear of corruption. It being a substance incorruptible, immortal, like the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the breath of his own mouth, which still retains so much of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from whence it was breathed; that without the least diminution, it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57260:25"/>
is able to communicate, and dilate it self into many Millions, and yet still remain the same entire substance that at first it was.</p>
                     <p>For the material part of this seed, there is a large dispute, whether it be <hi>à toto vel à parte decisum.</hi> I shall not stand to tell you the names of those that are Patrons of the one, and of the other: nor rehearse their Arguments. If you examine them, you shall finde theirs most rational, that affirm the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision from the whole body; what we finde more particularly discours't of by our forementioned Author, in his 24 Chapter, we shall take up and a little review. Where he hath truly and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evicted the wandring phancies of some, that would have this compound of severall parts, to be collected from every particle, so as passing by, or through every little Atome of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents body, in its passage; should be impregnated, and imbued with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, and so retire to the reserve
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57260:26"/>
where it is kept for generation. And afterwards these particles being fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by convenient heat, do take their posture and scituation; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the posture and dispositions of those Atomes they visited in their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and from whom they received those imbibed natures. But this circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating our Author tells us, is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I will not wrong him so much as to rank his more solid reasons with mine own. Could we finde these cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels and conveighances in the Body, by which this matter should passe; yet I might doubt of the unquestionable verity of this doctrine. For what should hinder this matter circulating about the Body, from receiving qualities, and so likewise the nature of every part it passeth by; and so every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of this matter, should be impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the natures of the whole; and every small Atome should become a living Creature, or else the Subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent should blot out the Antecedent
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57260:26"/>
Character, and the impression should be onely from the last part. We may likewise as truly, as safely conclude with our Author, that it is impossible for every little part to remit some parts impregnated with the nature of that whole part from whence it fell. This by some is thought to be done by that <hi>Quasi epilepsia in coitu,</hi> that kinde of convulsion or concussion of the parts, by which is shook off from them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what retaining the nature, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of every part, and these being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, make up the Seed. This seems to be very much befriended by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors relation of the Cats kitned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tails: and the Womans daughters with six fingers upon a hand. My self also have seen a kinde of Poultry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rumps: which breeding with their own kinde, still brought forth Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en wanting that part: If with others, sometimes they had rumps, sometimes but part of a rump. And not long since I saw a Mungril Bitch, that had her
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57260:27"/>
tail cut close to her body almost, whose Whelps were half without tails, and half with tails: the next year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, she brought them forth all with long tails, as she had before the cutting off. Which though it seems to favour (as I said) this opinion, it doth no way confirm it; as may appear by the more frequent perfect generations of muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated creatures; which beget children or issue with two legs or arms, though they had but one; Spaigniels, whose tails are always cut, bring forth Whelps whose tails need as much cutting, as their Dams or Sires did. Wee must therefore look out some other way, how this may be done, without the parts themselves.</p>
                     <p>Some others have supposed this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision to be made from the blood, when it is <hi>tantum non assimilatus;</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All which, returns to the first opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by our Author. Who hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise fairly cleer'd the other part of the doubt, whether this matter be divided, or taken only from similar parts alone, and so the matter of bone, should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to the conveniency of place and use, become round, blady, circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or long, and the flesh likewise, only by the help of fermenting heat.</p>
                     <p>After our noble Author hath so stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57260:28"/>
confuted these phansies, we shall finde him laying down his own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and seeking some other means and course of Generation: He tels us, that the superfluous part of the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, when it is drained from the rest, and reserv'd in a convenient place, by little and little through digestion gaineth vigour, and spirits, and becomes a homogeneal body, like to other sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple compounds; which by other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of heat and moisture, is changed into another substance, and that again by other temperaments into another. And thus by the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But if we more seriously examine this assertion, we shall finde it to leave the truth very much behinde it. For first, if we but look on the Body to be nourished; we shall finde it to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57260:28"/>
of many several parts, of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring natures, which would sufficiently instruct us in the disagreeing and hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneal particles of that which nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>heth this heterogeneal Body. But if we more curiously anatomize this juice or blood, it will abundantly shew us, it is no homogeneal Body; neither therefore can that superfluous part se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and drained from it, claim that priviledge.</p>
                     <p>Should we grant this, it cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how heat working upon this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneal body, should make in it a total change in the nature of it; or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it an other substance quite different from the first, making it lesse homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal. And in every digestion or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of heat upon it, it should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come still lesse homogeneal, until that substance be produced which wee see compos'd of so many heterogeneall parts. If we examine the workes of heat, we shall finde it penetrating, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding, and mixing of small particles of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57260:29"/>
it self, with the Atomes of the bodies it works upon; and in progress of time, divides the body into such small indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible parts, that it becomes like it self, in respect of rarity. As Fire working on, and mixing it self with Water, divides it into small indiscernable Atomes, which now attains unto the same rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and lightnesse with the Fire; and being accompanied and intermixt with those fiery Atomes, flies alo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And then those unseen Atomes of Water, collect themselves again to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer temper, and bulk, no whit changed or altered either in qualities or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which were impossible, were this change total, or could this action of heat create heterogeneall parts, in this homogeneal substance. If we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consider the power of heat, (or any other qualities) wee shall surely finde, that in no action there can any
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57260:29"/>
substantial thing be given, which is not originally in the agent, or giver. Fire could not give heat, nor Water, moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, unlesse it were inherent in those Bodies. Neither can heat or Fire work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on an homogeneal body, give it any other heterogeneal parts then fiery ones; nor moisture, any other, then moist ones, which indeed accidentally may give hardnesse to bones, and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to flesh; but how comes this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny substance in this place blady, in that round, in another long? this Muscle round, that triangular? this Plant of one form and nature, that of another? We must seek out some other agent to fashion these parts, and to compose this difficulty; and confidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, this way to be lame, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; of which our Author seems to be conscious, and that makes him so staggering, and at last falling upon an opinion, which he before in part rejected, <hi>viz.</hi> That the blood in its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation visiting every part, is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57260:30"/>
with the nature of them, and the purest part of this blood being extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted like a quintessence out of the whole Mass, is reserved in convenient receptacles till there be use of it; which is the seed, of which a new Animal is to be made. This imbuition of speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique qualities from every part, will appear as impossible as the former. For first, there are many parts from which the blood doth not again return, as from all those parts, which have attracted their specifick nourishment from out of the vessels; from them there is no return made. Besides the blood, in its circulation, is carried in vessels of the same nature, from the one end of the body to the other; and out of those vessels there is not the least motion in the blood.

comes it to passe that receiving so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny differing qualities, the one doth not confound the other, and that which is last imprest doth not blot out all the rest? These or the like difficulties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kenn'd by our Author, makes him flye to another refuge; and to tell us, that the heart of every perfect Animal, containeth in it, the specifick vertues of all the several parts of its own body; by reason of the bloods continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorting to it, in a circle from all parts of its body, and its being nourished by that juice; so that the Heart is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of the whole, and imbueth the blood with those specifick quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, from whence is extracted the seed. But neither can this cleer all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer difficulties. For how shall we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, so many distinct qualities to be imprest in so narrow a compasse, as in the heart, without confusion; or how so short a stay in the heart, could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant such a numerous Regiment of qualities in the blood; or why not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering

faculties in the same particle of blood; all sliding (without distinction) through the ventricles of the heart? we shall be forc'd therefore to seek out some other way, which indeed our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath chalkt out unto us, though himself hath not trod in it.</p>

                     <p>OUr noble Author hath laid this ground for us, which I hope will easily lead us to the truth, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is necessary the parts should be made in generation, of a matter like to that which maketh them in nutrition. Now what that is from whence every part receiveth his nourishment, wee must search for in the blood: Which is a tincture extracted from those things we eat, concocted and separated in the

Stomack, Liver, and Heart; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by its circulating in the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Veins, is pellicanized (as the Chymists term it) and becomes most pure, and defaecated from all its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and is made a fit nourishment for every part. The things we eat are not simple, but compounded of as great a variety as the parts to be nourished can expresse. What variety of Plants goes to the making up of one piece of flesh we eat? What multitudes of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Atomes are conjoyned in one piece of bread, or draught of drink, or Wine? The extract then sure must be furnisht with as great a swarm of differing parts; onely here they are more refin'd, more subtiliz'd, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated one from another. But how doth this variety of parts in the blood, make it the fitter for nourishment? by comprehending in it small indivisible particles, cognate or similar Atomes, which are of the same substance, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and nature with the parts, to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57260:32"/>
which they are to be adjoyned, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similated: and want nothing but sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and afterwards union and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with, to be part of those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, for whose nutriment they were provided; which operation is called as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similation. For then these similar, or cognate parts, are become like to those, to which they are joyned.<note place="margin">How nu`riti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made.</note> And this is the matter and manner of our nutrition, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> if slightly considered, may perhaps go amongst the number of falsities. But if we examine from the Creation, the product of Creatures from the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed first created Chaos; or since that time, the continual hourly decay, or expiration of every part of us, (in so much that Physitians allow us clearly a new Body every seven years,) we shall soon discover the truth of this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. How the great Architect fetcht from the bowels of this Lump, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created particles, to supply him with fit matter for such bodies; and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57260:32"/>

The continual expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of particles from all bodies will more cleerly illustrate it. The hourly decay is by expiration of material, the last dissolution is both of material and formal Atomes. Now as all agree that material parts throughout multitudes of (nay all) mutations, remain incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; so also according to, not onely the judgement, but several experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of knowing men, diligent inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers into the various works of Nature, and mutations of natural compounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> natural forms themselves also do not perish at their parting from their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but onely are dissolved and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipated, lying after that in their scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Atomes, confused and mixt with some others; constituting perhaps a quite differing bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57260:33"/>
such a form. If it be so then that the matter of every particle in every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Atomes of their forms likewise, still remain, though scatter'd into millions of several bodies; what should hinder, (when these Atomes are again rallied,) an easie union with particles of the same condition, and nature? and why should not then the blood, which is made up of many and distinct bodies, be furnisht with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Atomes comprehended in those bodies: and those Atomes being agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our parts, be as easily united to them?</p>
                     <p>The way of nutrition being cleared; let us see now, how from the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter generation is performed.

This juice or blood they concoct, &amp; strain through their finer parts; and separate them from other earthly excrementitious particles, (or such as belong to another species) till it becomes fit only for the repairing of that Plant, for, and by which they were selected, and suckt out of the Earth. From this quintescence, this juice, are selected parts of the same substance, nature, qualities, and form with the Plant, and agreeing with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particle of it, whose blood it is, and from it, is the species propagated.

in some, propagation is made by this juice residing in part of the Plant, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the Trunk, and fixt in the ground: In others, by part of the root transfer'd: In others, by seed.</p>
                     <p>The first is done by that juice which is retained in the part taken from the Plant, which reserving parts sit for the nourishment of<note place="margin">How a Sprig put into the ground grows.</note> every particle in the Plant, from whence it was taken, hath now some parts which are ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, for that Sprig which is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated.

become more vigorous, and will not be idle; but since they cannot be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, drawn by, and adjoyned to other parts; they will set themselves to work, and falling to their proper place, the lowest region of the Sprig, collect themselves in the same method they should have done in the root, to which they should have been adjoyned. And there finding the bark softned by the external moisture of the Earth, and fitted to give way to them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus setled, they thrust forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into the Earth; from whence they extract cognate juice, with all sorts of Atomes fit for the augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nourishment of themselves, &amp; the whole Plant.

lying one upon another, with a stalk reaching to the point of the seed, (not that which is fastned to the tree, but the other) to which is loosely adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it were, a navel string from the stem, conveighing nourishment to this young Plant, while it is upon the Tree: as in the third Figure of the first Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is delineated. In the Maple, both greater and lesser, though the seeds be winged as the Ash, yet these seminal Atomes or this young Tree, is inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the round knob; within whose tough and harder skins, is found a stalk and two leaves rowled round together, which are the very same that first comes up: as in the sixth Figure is discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. In Beans and Pease, betwixt the kernel, you shall finde those very leaves which first break the ground, with a stalk, whose end passeth through one of the thicker skins, and is contained onely within the outermost thin skin: as in the several faces of the fourth and fifth Figures is described. Which if it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57260:37"/>
be any way moistned by an adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious moisture; presently gives way to the swelling stalk and leaves, which when they are distended beyond the capacity of the outmost skin, break forth and shew themselves. In other smaller seeds, the leaves are inclos'd and rapt round, the stalk lying betwixt them; as in the Cabbage and Radish seeds; figure the second. But when they break through the ground, they erect themselves upright, sometimes carrying the hard skin up upon their tops. The greater seeds have, besides these small plants, a substance which we call the kernel; unto which their stalk is fastned, neer about the middle of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by two short stalks; from which substance they receive nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while they are inclosed within their skins, and matter afterwards for the distention of the stalk and leaves, after they have enlarged their territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, both upwards and downwards, in root and leaves: as in Beans, Pease,

Wheat, Barley, Acorns, whose parts turn into a milky substance, fit nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment for these tender Plants. That these seminal Atomes do conform and dispose themselves likewise, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the same method they did, or should have done in the Plant, whose they were, or for which they were prepared for nourishment, will easily appear by that artificial generation of Plants, which not onely casually hath faln out, but by many hath studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been effected. When from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or liquor of Plants, (as is related by <hi>Libarius,</hi> and others, I need not name the Authors being so common an experiment) they shall again be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called to live, and start up stalk and leaf; which but now was dust, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. I shall onely relate one experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment casually, though twice made by a learned grave Physitian, neerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to me: which will explain the manner of this operation to the full.</p>
                     <p>Having in the evening expos'd a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57260:38"/>
decoction for a clister (made of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let leaves, Strawbery leaves, Mallows, and the like) to the cold of the night. The next morning he found it cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a slender crust of Ice, which gave him leave through it to behold in the Water, the leaves in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect shapes, of all those Plants, of which the decoction was made, both in fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and colour; which remained in that posture till the Ice was broken; which was no sooner done, but all those fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious Plants presently vanished, nothing remaining but the cleer liquor of the decoction.</p>
                     <p>Now how this could be performed, unlesse it were by the union of these seminal Atomes dispersed in the liquor; (drawn from the other parts, by the gentle heat of the Fire acting with the Water) disposing &amp; setling themselves in their right and natural places, will appear impossible. How could a slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heat in so short a time give a form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or square out such a matter into that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57260:38"/>
figure which but now it lost? or why when the matter is thus fashioned, should it not retain that figure and bulk when the inclosure is broken? We must therefore conclude, that these seminal Atomes of the Plants, which were separated from the other parts by decoction, and by the sudden clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Ice intercepted from flight; were actuated by some remaining par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of heat, and put in minde of their office and nature; insomuch that every Atome began to seek out his proper situation and neighbour, to settle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in such method as they held one towards another, before they were parted from the Herbs, and so make up perfect Plants both in figure and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. But the Ice being broken, and the liquor moved, these appearing Plants, being made of such fine spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual parts without cement; were soon shattered into their first indivisible par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; which being again dissolved, and the order broken, could not be by the sense discerned.</p>

                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:57260:39"/>The reason why these seminal Atoms could not then constitute a perfect solid Plant, was, because there was wanting some other more sixt parts of the same nature, and condition, with these more spiritual, to conserve them in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and to cement them together; to fix and harden them into a consistence. These are of the same nature, particles belonging to every part, Atomes of Leaves, Stalks, Flowers, Fruit, and Root as the others; but are grosser, more terrestrious, which cannot act themselves; but give solidity, strength, and hardnesse to the other when they are joyned together; and are so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly united with them, when the Plant is entire; that they cannot, but by dissolution of the whole, be distinguished These in this decoction, were left behinde in the expressed Stalkes, Rootes, and Leaves, and therefore the Plants were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent.</p>

none, to be perfectly united with any; but being dispers'd in small parcels, they cannot easily unite themselves, till a greater portion of them be met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> generally is at the Spring, when the Suns heat begins to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vigor to them; and dissolves the excrementitious humors of the Body they are inclosed in; so that they much easier obtain their freedom, and so uniting themselves in their proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and order, become such crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as those Atomes can fitly consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. These Animals too, sometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their external forms, and become another thing then what at first they seemed to be; as from a Worm, the next advancing Sun salutes a Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly; such is the growth of all Insects, which appear first to be Worms; the Tadpoles grow to be Frogs; the spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or eggs of Flies, to be Worms, and then Flies again; which is caused by the addition of new parts, which they themselves procure from their
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57260:41"/>
nourishment; by which these parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come larger, solider, and so discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which before could not be seen. As the germen or young plant in the seed, when it hath obtained a new stock of moisture and nourishment, puts out leaves of a differing form from those which first come up; as the Maple, Borage, Cucumber, and almost all plants differ in their second leaves, from their first, which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly appear inclosed in the seed. The other are so small and wrapt up, that until there bee new parts adjoyned from their nourishment, they are not discerned.</p>
                     <p>These imperfect Animals spring not up alike indifferently, from all Bodies; some Animals being made of one kinde of Matter, some of another; some Plants retaining the seminal Atomes of one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect, some of another; so that from one Plant or Animal ariseth one kind, from another, another. I shall not stay to look out their several originals.</p>

juice of both; the Femal adding those parts fitted for the growth and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Foetus, from her own blood. The yolk, the grosser aliment, is composed in the Vitellary, or Egg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag, selected from large vessels imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately arising from the Aorta. The other part, the White is made in the Matrix, by a certain milky viscous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udation, flowing from the rough wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led membranes of the Womb; whose property it is to convert that blood, which by several great vessels is brought to it, into that milky spermlike sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                     <p>Besides these seminal parts there is (I say) a contribution of nourishment conveighed with them in the same Egg, for the nourishment and growth of the Foetus, while it is inclosed in those walls. And this is, as I said, of two sorts, agreeable to their double use, fitted for their nourishment while the Atomes are uniting, but tenderly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and growing together: and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57260:43"/>
this is the White, which is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the nature of Sperm; and answers to the Mothers blood, which gives growth and nourishment while the Foetus lives in the Mothers womb.</p>
                     <p>The other, the Yolk, of a more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and confirmed substance, is for its nourishment when it hath atchieved some perfection and growth; the parts then expecting a more solid nutriment.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57260:44"/>
Cicatricula, which afterwards, as the Yolk increaseth to bignesse, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more evidently.</p>
                     <p>When the Egg is perfect, if you break the shell at the bigger end, you shall finde this Circle in all prolificial Eggs; the fashion of it you may see in the first Figure of the second Table, the innermost Figure, A.</p>
                     <p>This Cicatricula after the first dayes incubation, you shall see dilated and grown wider, as in the first figure at B. with a little white spot in it, easily to be distinguished from the rest.</p>
                     <p>The second day being past, in the third day ye shall finde it spread yet larger. I have seen it enlarg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to the breadth of a Sixpence, distinguished with several Circles within it, exactly round, representing the Eye. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most round was of a much paler yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low colour then the rest of the Yolk, and of a thinner consistence, as if it had bin by the heat of the Hen dissolved &amp; melted.

of a most resplendent cleerness; through which did passe some small white threads into the outmost pale circle. This inner clear Circle was of a substance like to the white of the Egg, but cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>arer, and very fluid. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this clear round, was another of a pale yellow, like to the first; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed another translucid Circle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it, in which was a clear small Body, but something obscurer then the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, containing in it a little whiter spot, easily to be distinguished from it: which seemed to be center to all the inclosing circles. This you may see in the second figure of the second Table. The inner white Circle and spot in the after discoveries, will be found to be the Carina and heart of the Chick. The two clear Circles to be that liquor, or humor, in which the tender Atomes of the Chick, while they are collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conjoyning, do swim in; that by external motions they might not be disordered and hindered from uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57260:45"/>
The middle yellow was some of the same matter, not yet dissolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that clearness. The outmost yellow Circle was some dissolving by the heat of the Hen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and preparing for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of blood, from which it now dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers onely in colour; which the next day or the day following will appear in those small threads, conveighed to the white spot within: which the fourth day ye shall finde filled with this blood, and moving.</p>
                     <p>Towards the latter end of the third day, you shall finde this Cicatricula to be all clear in the middle Circles, the yellow being obliterated; and now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains onely the white Circle and spot in the middle, somewhat enlarged, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed by a larger resplendent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; environed with the outermost yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low round; in which, by the help of Glasses may be discovered the small vessels coming from this dissolved yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low matter, from every side to the middle of the white Circle; which by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57260:46"/>
a Microscope appears now to be the Carina or back and neck of the Chick, and the heart in the midst of it: this is delineated in the seventh Figure of the first Table.</p>
                     <p>On the fourth day, this Cicatricula was spread the full compasse of the big end of the Egg; the outmost Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle whereof, was filled with veins va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously spread abroad, and Arteries, as might be supposed, (though by their coats not to be distinguished,) because their Anastomases were evident; which being collected into four trunks from the opposite points, passed through the refulgent clear Circle to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or center. Without the extream limbe of this pale yellow Circle, were no vessels to be seen.</p>
                     <p>Within the white Circle in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which was much dilated too, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a red sparkling line encompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the white spot, now red too, and moving: whose motions plainly shew, it was the heart; as afterwards I saw
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57260:46"/>
by the help of a Microscope, exactly shewing me the heart perfectly fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with both his ears, and this red line joyned to it, running quite round in the inside of the white Circle. By the help of this Glasse, I saw the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart and ears for a long time; one anticipating the other, and continuing after the others decay. When the hearts motion was almost spent, the ears contracted themselves in due order, and after five or six pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of the ears, the heart would move once, and then rest again, till after such a number of pulses were performed by the ears.</p>
                     <p>The heart when it had emptied it self, by its continual pulsation, of all the blood, and was become perfectly clear, and transparent as before the blood came to it; moved a long time after, observing the same order, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the pulsation of the ears, as when it was watered from that bloody Fountain.</p>

                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:57260:47"/>This Glasse shewed me the head too, consisting of three bubbles as it were; whereof one confest it self to be the eye, by the manifest discovery of the Pupilla in the middle. From hence the Spina was carried round almost to the head again, which is that transparent white Circle without the red line. From whence appeared some small ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure clouds, fastned in the proper places of the wings and thighs: which in the fifth dayes observation, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be so indeed, without the help of Glasses. Besides, from this Carina, were drawn some small streamings, which were the rudiments of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ribs This fourth dayes obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation may be seen delineated in the third Figure of the second Table.</p>
                     <p>The fifth dayes this transparent clear body, together with the Foetus swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in it, sunk lower to the side of the Egg, then in the day before; and what was then clear and transparent, begins now to thicken and grow ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure.

The bulk of the body hardned into a visible form and obscurer then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet not so darkned, but that the pulsation of the heart being red with

This thin bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being opened, from the great vein might be seen some rudiments of the Liver, some small puttings forth of vessels, which had some blood between them hardned.

                     <p>About the fourteenth and fifteenth dayes, the beginnings of the feathers appear, the skin being covered with little black spots, which are the roots of the feathers.

white of the Egg, passes through the upper part of the Liver, perforating the Vena Cava, near the basis of the heart. The other coming from the yolk insinuates it self into the Vena Porta, in the lower part of the Liver. Which shews what disserence Nature hath made betwixt these two liquors: the one, the white, concocted and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for present use, is carried immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the Vena Cava and to the heart, to be distributed into every part for their encrease and nourishment; out of which every part might select cognate and appropriated Atomes, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from all excrements, for their augmentation and nutrition</p>
                     <p>As soon as this is done and spent, because the Foetus is not yet strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to seek his own nourishment abroad; neither is the Hen able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for it: Nature hath ordained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother reserve of provision, which though it be not so fine, yet having another Cook to dresse it, the Liver

And as the yolk daily les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens by the growth and increase of the Chick; this membrane is contracted, and the guts with the yolk by degrees are drawn up into the belly, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up by this skin; where a portion of it may be seen after the Chick comes abroad, if by dissection it be enquired after, and serves to nourish it, even after it is disclosed.

On which (as I have shewn) these seminal Atomes being fixt, by the former observations you clearly see, how they daily grow up into a living thing of the same species. And this seems to be as the Germen or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle plant reposited in every seed; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> grows up to a bignesse not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the skins of the seeds, but breaks through that and the earth that covers them; and then shews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a visible form and bulk, which before could not, but by the curious observer, be discovered.</p>
                     <p>This Cicatricula in the small grains in the Vitellary, seems to be, nay are the same seminal Atomes, disposed in their due method and places which they observe one towards another; as when they appear in a more visible bignesse afterwards. For before they are sate

on by the Hen, there appears in this Cicatricula some distinction of parts; there is a little white spot, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a white circle to be seen; which particles never vanish, but grow larger still, till they discover themselves what they are. The middle spot is found to be the heart, the white circle becomes the Carina or Spine; at the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, three or four dayes incubation shews the head; and so the rest of the parts as Nature hath need of them, grow up to their offices in their visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble figures. So that these seminal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes as soon as they are conjoyned in a convenient place, by the due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and regulating of the specifick soul, put themselves in order, fall to their proper places, and make up a Chick before the Egg be pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>These, as the former, are the issue o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

in the examination of that doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no the femal contributes any spermatical particles, towards the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Foetus, in Coition. When we shal observe what parts Nature hath bestowed on the females; I mean testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, (for so they are, and not glanduls for I know not what use;) to which are derived Arteries and veins, of the same original with those distributed to the Masculine stones: and when in these testicles ye shall finde spermlike matter, and vessels from them to the womb. When also in coition ye shall observe the same delight and concussion as in Males; why should we suppose Nature, beyond her custome, should abound in superfluities and uselesse parts.</p>
                     <p>The principles therefore of these li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving births, arise as the other, from some selected Atoms by the testicles of both, thrown into the Matrix of the Female. Where being united &amp; mixt by the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting heat of the womb: the several Atomes fall to their respective places:

                     <p>While this is doing the tenacious part of the sperm, in which these A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes were laid up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is now hardned into membranes inclosing several sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; the one inclosing the pure se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Atomes which are in fashioning themselves, in a clear transparent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor as in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gg; the other inclosing both that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the other parts of the seed from which these Atomes are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and nourished.</p>
                     <p>This outward Membrane, sticking to, and about those asperities, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar extuberancies, which are caused by the orifices of Arteries, and Veins opening into the cavity of the womb, gives way to the gently distilling blood, to descend to these Atomes; to furnish them with store of cognate parts, to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57260:54"/>
be selected by, and added to them for their future growth.</p>
                     <p>But that these yet tender parts, may not be overwhelmed with too great a flux of blood, and be stifled with too much nourishment, before they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to dispose of it: (a frequent cause of abortion) Nature suffers it to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der through a Labyrinth of an infinite number of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vessels, dispers'd through this outmost membrane; from whence by one chanel it is conveighed to this new Animal. But not to remain all of it, within the limits of this little frame; but being conveighed to the heart of the Infant, by its continuall motion some is thrown into every part, according to the capacity of their ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels. And because all parts of this too, are not fit for the repair of these young Atoms, but do require a greater choice; therefore at every motion of the heart, some of this blood is thrown out of this Infant, by appropriated Arteries, back to the Mother again. So that by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57260:55"/>
this continual circulation of the blood, through this new Animal; fresh and cognate moisture is supplied to irrigate, and augment every part of it. From whence, as at the first, cognate Atomes are selected &amp; adjoyned to every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, until the Foetus come to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and then breaking through those membranes, it is brought forth a living creature.</p>
                     <p>It will be requisite I should here sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie a doubt, which may perhaps perplex some in the receiving this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of generation, <hi>viz.</hi> why there should be a distinction of Sexes? and why there should be a collection of these seminal Atomes by both Sexes? and that without the admixture of both these, there could be no gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?</p>
                     <p>The reason why there are distinct Sexes, is, because one of them must supply the part, and office, that the Earth doth to Vegetables; which is, to contain, preserve, and supply it with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57260:55"/>
fitting nourishment; which is done by the Female. But why cannot all bee done by this one? what need is there of another seed?</p>
                     <p>The use of these differing seeds, is evidenced in the former discourse of Plants: where I shewed you, that these seminal Atomes were of two sorts, spiritual, and more material; whose duty was to fix and cement the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Atomes together, that they might mutually cohere the one to the other; the Masculine, are to actuate, enliven, and to act for all the rest: and this diversity of Atomes, makes a difference in seeds, and a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Sexes. The Masculine seed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undergone concoctions and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations by a greater, and purer heat, becomes more spiritualiz'd &amp; subtile; and is like to those spiritual Atomes of the appearing and rising Plants out of the spirits of a former Plant corrupted, as I before declared. Which contains in it all parts fitting to constitute such a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57260:56"/>
body, as that was from whence it was taken: and being thrown into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or power of the Atomes of either Sex, so is the Foetus fashioned and distinguished. If the Atomes constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57260:57"/>
the Masculine parts prevail, then is a Male generated: but if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of the Females seed prevail either in quantity, or energy, over the Masculine; then is the product a Female: and those Atomes which were ordained for, and belong to the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine parts, being but few in number, and lesse in power, are obscured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing scattered amongst the rest, or else being of no use, and having no parts to joyn with them, to unite and cement them together, are quite lost.</p>
                     <p>This is the cause too, why the Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus or Infant hath parts, some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Father, some the Mother, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sometimes the Mothers Lip, the Fathers Eye. &amp;c. according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of the respective Atomes.</p>
                     <p>Besides, by how much the more the Masculine Atomes abound in a Female Infant; by so much the more the Foetus is stronger, healthier, and more Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, a Virago. If the Female Atomes abound much in a Male Infant, then is

that issue more weak and effeminate. If either parent hath any extraordinary Mark, or part more then usual; as the Woman with six fingers; whom our Author relates to have born all her Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, with the like number of fingers: It is caused by these seminal Atomes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the blood, carrying along with them Atomes belonging to every part, communicated to the seed, and so to the Infant; especially if the Atomes, in which these supernumerary parts or marks reside, prevail over the rest. As the example of that Woman illustrates, who brought forth all her Males with the usual number of fingers; all her Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males with six upon an hand, like her self. The Sex shewed the prevalency of her seed, which having the mastery of the Masculine, all the several Atomes contained in her seed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shewed themselvs in the same posture, as in her own body. In the Males, those particles of her seed being weaker, served onely to cement the masculine Atomes, and no more.</p>

Sometimes supernume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary particles are found in the seed,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57260:58"/>
which being many and prevalent, do unite themselves, and joyn to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and there put forth; so that there are seen sometimes two perfect bodies, conjoyned in one part or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or four arms, &amp;c. as several Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories relate of severall monstrous births.

                     <p>But here arises a great difficulty, how this disturbance of the seminal Atomes, should be occasioned by the disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Mothers phansie? How the imagination works upon parts of the same body, Authors tell us, is by the mediation of humors and spirits: but how it should operate upon these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Atomes, at this time, before there is any influx either of humors or spirits from the body to them?

                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:57260:59"/>I should think it done by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the soul, traduced with the seeds.

                     <head>Chapter the Eleventh.</head>
                     <p>OUr Author brings in an opinion of Doctor <hi>Harvies</hi> to father his acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental formation upon, so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to me, that I cannot baulk the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57260:59"/>
relation and examination of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That the seed of the Male, doth not remain in the womb of the Female in any sensible bulk: but (as it seemeth) evaporateth, and incorporateth it self either into the body of the womb, or rather into some more interiour part, as into the semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vessels, which by mediation of the Females seed, suck up the Males seed, and turn it into a vapour, operating in such sort as our Author before relates, in the generation of Animals. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a certain time, some six weeks, or two moneths, (as the Doctor observed in Does and Hinds) these seeds distill again into the womb and by little and little do clarifie in the midst, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle red speck appeareth in the midst of the bright clearnesse.</p>
                     <p>The right observation of this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment (under favor) in my judgement was not truly made; for this inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the wombs of creatures cannot be, but by dissection; which must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly hinder that second work, namely
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57260:60"/>
the returning back of the seed into the womb: And if so, how shall it come to our knowledge, that the seed, which at the time of accoupling, was received into the womb, and afterwards when the observation was made was evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and attracted by the Females te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticles, shall afterwards distill into the womb again; unlesse the same Female were preserved to make those distinct observations, at several times. I should rather believe the Does, or Hinds in whose wombs the Doctor found no sperm after the accoupling, were bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and so never received the Mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line seed into their wombs or at least never retained it; or else had not then coupled with the Male. And that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the two moneths, he met with some others that had conceived, in which he found that resplendent clearness and red spot. All which will not amount to a considerable argument, to support this change of substances by accidental causes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:57260:60"/>Not unlike to this is that opinion of <hi>Fabricius,</hi> asserting that the seed of the Cock is not cast into the womb of the Hen; but into the beginning of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, and there by an irradiating influx foecundates the Hen, and makes fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful all the eggs that shall for a long time after be produced, without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of the seeds at all. This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his is grounded upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility (as he supposes) of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Males seed into the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males womb; the inner orifice being so closely shut, that from without it is impossible to receive any thing. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides in dissection, he could never finde any part appointed for the ejaculating the sperm into the womb. The Penis <hi>or Prick</hi> being wanting in the Cock; so the seed cannot be thrown further then the entrance into the womb.</p>
                     <p>Whether or no there be a present union of the material parts of the seeds, after every coition, which impregnates the Females; former observations

                        </gap>ly deceive us. For if nothing be found in their wombs then; we may as safely and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively argue, that either that Female never coupled with the Male, or never retained his seed as to say it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for the seed to enter, because I never found it there The experiment ought to be made on some creatures, under the continual view of our obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and presently after copulation, if we see nothing reflowing again; then to search where that seed lyes, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly discover the truth to us.</p>
                     <p>That observation of Doct. <hi>Harvies,</hi> related to us by Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> (though I confesse his curious eye, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome takes any thing upon trust, or slightly passes by what is observable) seems to presuppose a conception; and on that supposition to ground his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Males seed is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57260:61"/>
in the womb, but evaporated; because in his dissections of those crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he supposed had conceived, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause done at the usual time of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling) he never found it: till after, some two moneths, meeting with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whose pregnant wombes discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red some rudiments of a growing Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus; he concludes, those creatures, he two moneths before dissected, would have shewn then, the fertility of their wombs in the same manner We may as truly argue (I say) they had not conceived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the time of his dissecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; neither (had they escaped his knife) would they, without a new coupling, have had that red spot, in the midst of that clear body.</p>
                     <p>But when wee shall consider the great quantity of sperm, emitted by the Male in every coition; and see that quantity retained by the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, if by that copulation she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives; and finde no other part capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious enough to keep it, but the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57260:62"/>
womb: when we shall finde the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial parts of the Male, copied out to the life in the Foecus; even his marks, which never came under his sight or knowledge peradventure, to be brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the young one: we must needs acknowledge something more then an irradiation, or foecundating quality, imprest on the womb by the Mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line seed; and more then phansie in the Females to produce such effects. A Hen trod by a Pheasant, though in a dark room, that so she could never see his proportions or colour, brings forth Chickens, resembling both her self and the Pheasant. A Bitch lined with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kindes of Dogs, though in the dark, where her phansie could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate to the assimulating of her births, brings forth her whelps fashioned and coloured, like to all those she coupled with. The Horse leaves some material impressions of himself, on the Mule, which he begets on the Asse.</p>
                     <p>That strict closure of the wombs
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57260:62"/>
orifice in the time of dissection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot exclude the seeds entrance. For wee know in the time of coupling in all Creatures, those parts, all of them are much differing from themselves, at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, dilated, and swollen up by a more then ordinary heat, encreased by an extraordinary afflux of blood to those parts, at that time. Which heat not onely increaseth the desire, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth the cavities and pores: that those parts will now be open, which before were shut. The Hen, and Does in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition elevate the Velabrum, which at other times closely shuts that passage. So it will be no marvel, if the straight orifice of the womb in coition shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, to admit that guest she so much desires; and moves it self directly, to receive what is thrown into it by the Male.</p>
                     <p>As for his second ground, that the Cock wants that part which should eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the sperm into the Matrix: dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section will shew us that, though it be

So that if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve dissection (the surest guide) we shall see Natures bounty to this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; whose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ecessary so to be, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no common receptacle, to receive the sperm from both testicles; as the Prostata in other creatures: one Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis could emit but from one stone; therefore are there two, that in co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nutrition, furnisheth us with an example to illustrate his Argument; which bears the weight and vigour of his Argument, and may seem very much to infeeble my foregoing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. Suppose (sayes he) a Man, a Horse a Cow, a Sheep, and 500 more severall Species of living Creatures, should make a meal of Let ice: to avoid all perplex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ty in the Argument, let us allow, that every one did eat a pound; and and let us conceive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pound of this herb to be burned:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57260:64"/>
as much to be putrisied under a Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage root, and the like, under five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Plants more of divers Species. Then cast how much of every pound of Lettice is turned into the substances that are made of them, or that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by them: as how much ashes hath been made by one pound, how much water from another by distillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; how much a Man hath been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by a third, how much a Horse by a fourth, &amp;c. And when you have summ'd up all these several quantities, you will finde them much to exceed the quantity of one pound; which it would not do, if every pound of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice were made up of several different similar parts actually in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by different substances of the nature of those parts: and no substance could be encreased by it, unlesse parts of its nature were originally in the Lettice.</p>
                     <p>In answer to this, we shall return this confession, that if it were certain
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57260:64"/>
that all of so many distinct Species, that have altogether different parts one from another, did or could from the same quantitv of one Plant or thing, receive a valuable bulk of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment; his Argument would remain exceeding valid and considerable. But when it cannot be made appear, that every one takes something of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and is nourished by it. Nay, when the contrary appears, that all are not nourished by the same food: Some choosing one sort of meats, some another; one feeding on, and living by that, which kills another; this grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fat by that, which starves another. It will appear that there is a choice and election of Atomes in that which nourishes, appropriated to the Species for which they are provided: and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well a selection of those Atomes again, to constitute a new Individuum of that Species. In distinct Regions we finde several sorts of Plants and Animals, which are the proper off-spring of

                     <p>It may yet be objected; If the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall Atomes do so dispose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their due and natural orders, as to make up a body resembling the Species; or at least to lay the first foundations, and rude draught, as it were, of a Body. Why are they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57260:65"/>
not thus disposed, and setled in the seminal vessels of both Sexes, as soon as the sperm is made? There wants neither heat nor life to actuate them.</p>
                     <p>To this I shall answer; first, that perhaps if these seminal Atomes had convenient room in those vessels, they might be conjoyned in an orderly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. And therefore Nature hath so ordered these vessels, that the parts, both separating and containing these Atomes, should not be one continued cavity, as the Matrix is, which receives them in coition; but should be a glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous and porous body; in which the particles or Atomes of the seed lie scattered, and parted one from another by the substance of the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule. For first, these Atomes are sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the testicles, a glandulous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; next, they are conveighed to the Prostata, a glandule too; in which they are reserved until the time of use. In the Ejaculatory vessels, their
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57260:66"/>
passage betwixt the testicles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata; though they circulate through divers Meanders, and Cavities; yet there they cannot rank themselves in order, because they are in continual motion, (the subsequent particles still driving on the former) which hinders their conjunction: rest being the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Union. Those seminal vessels, which in dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ections are found joyned to the Prostata, having many Cavities, and full of thin liquor, do not contain these seminal particles, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata, (as I said) and from thence in coition are they emitted. The liquor that is found in these seminal cavities, supplies perhaps (besides that other in coition) the office of the thin transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent liquor in the Egg, in which the Chick swims, and by which the finer parts are nourished at first, that is first concocted into the blood.</p>
                     <p>Besides, these Atomes in their orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring must (I said) be regulated by the soul, traduced with them; which is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57260:66"/>
not fastned to the seed, while it remains in the seminal vessels, more then to the blood, or other humours in their chanels, on whose losse or preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the soul doth no way depend.</p>

                  <head>THE Sympathetical Cure OF WOVNDS.</head>
                  <p>THese universal and general Laws of Nature being laid down and rightly understood, the Cure of Wounds w thout Topical Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Medicines, to the part affected, will soon appear an unquestionable Truth, and not a Magical delusion, as hath bin supposed: and by some, whose laborious Pens have endevoured a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ction, most unjustly bin stiled diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, it is absolutely true, and an unquestionable law of Nature, (if, prejudice laid aside, right reason takes
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57260:69"/>
her place,) that all actions and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are performed by <hi>Atomes,</hi> or small bodies, moving after a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, proportionable to their severall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igures; and not by I know not what qualities, (which have onely a notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal subsistence,) acting without the bodies to which they belong, and leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one subject to another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing their forms.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a constant <hi>Effluvium</hi> or expiration of such Atomes from all bodies: caused by a compression of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumjacent bodies; driving the parts closer together; or else by the mtion of other Atomes crowding into the porous parts of that body; disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the repose and quiet of the former inhabitants, and thrust them out, to wander about in the air, till they meet with some other body of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or return to the same body from whence they were driven, where they may obtain their desired rest a while, which is but very short.</p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:57260:69"/>
                  <p>5. This expiration, some by the help of Glasses, have seen in the form of a mist to flow from a Loadstone, and other bodies whose aporcheas are more plentiful: In bodies that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually hot, this Fffluvium is sensibly apparent to the smell, especially to Creatures of an acuter sense; whose expirations hanging in the air, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground; are as sure a guide to the persecuting Dog, as if they were continually in his eye. <hi>Sanctorius</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us too, that they are no lesse sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly discovered by weight, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, a Man in one nights space to be lighter by three pounds weight, then he was at the beginning of the night, caused onely by this insensible expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. These Atomes are not of one Figure, nor of one magnitude or grossenesse: some being so subtile and slender, that they admit of no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, but continue their course through all mediums: and whatever may seem
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57260:70"/>
to oppose them in their way, such are not discovered by us, but by their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>enetrating, and acting what their Figure can do, before we are sensible of them: such are the contagious Atomes of bodies infected w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th the Plague, or other pestilential diseases; which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ot only commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to others, by their harbouring in the visitants clothes; but being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>erst in the air, are conveighed to remote places and persons, on whom they exercise their tyranny, not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered till they break out into open violence. Others again are grosser, and cannot so easily passe by, or through others of the same or greater grosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and are therefore driven by the strongest, and inforc'd from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended voyage; and sometimes bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into the pores of other bodies. And such Atomes are apprehended by our senses, as heat, cold, smels, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, &amp;c. &amp; move more slowly then the former. Some are so grosse that they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57260:70"/>
move solid and fixt bodies out of their places, as the winde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are driven to and fro by the winde, as it moveth, they change their place. These Atomes we are sensible of, and shall without much difficulty, be perswaded to confesse their being and activity. The magnetick effluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums, and influences of the Planets, the subtile expirations of all bodies, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those which are not raised by the attenuating of much heat are to be ranked in the first Classis, and have been heretofore Christned by the name of <hi>Occult qualities.</hi> The others have been stiled prime qualities, vapors, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations, or the like.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is another general Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that all bodies desire rest; and would continue in their own proper places, if they were not disturbed by an intruder: Rest being the Mother of union, which is the desire of all natural bodies.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There are some places more sit
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57260:71"/>
for the receiving and holding of some bodies, or Atomes, then others; in which they may better and longer rest. And that in respect of the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and form of the pores receiving them; being proportionable, and more agreeable to the figures of the Atomes. As some Atomes are Angular, some Cylindrical, branched, smooth sharp, rough. There are in bodies pores a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to these figures; so that some Atomes shall bee received into po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es proportionate to them, others exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; as the fire, sharp and penetrating Salt, creep into the pores of a Stone; which the Atomes of Water, cold, and light, cannot: the infectious Atomes of that pestilential disease amongst beasts, called the <hi>Murren,</hi> insinuate themselves into Cows and Swine, not into Horses, or Men, as the infection of the Pox or Measils in Men, is not communicated to Beasts, &amp;c. This agreement betwixt the pores and the Atomes, makes that, we call <hi>Cognation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:57260:71"/>6. No Atomes rest any where, but in those cognate or proportionate pores. They may be driven into other bodies, or may accompany other Atomes, into pores that do not exactly correspond with their figures but cannot rest there; being still thrust out by those that do better sill up that place, and correspond with the capacity and proportion of those pores; and hence ariseth a natural inclination and tendency towards those bodies where such pores are. For being once dislodged, and thrust out of those cognate places, they are still shouldered out, and prest to give way for those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, whose figures cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m a right to those pores they are now wandring in: being thus thrust out, &amp; prest on every side by other dislodged Atoms, they are inforc'd to move that way where they finde least crowding, and where the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence least urgeth; and that is on the side where these pores are, and perhaps from whence they were first disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For other Atomes not finding
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57260:72"/>
entrance into the pores of such bodies, rebounding back, cause other behinde them to rush into their place, to give way for them rebounding; who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise not being entertained, return too, thrusting others into their room: till at last it comes to the turn of those cognate Atomes: who being violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrust on by those behinde them, are also now by these that were before them, returning; are prest upon these proportionate pores, who in respect of their cognate figures, sinding admitance by their entrance, make way for others of the same proportion to follow them. So that there is a constant necessitated motion of such Atomes this way, forc'd by the impulsion of other Atomes. Which motion is natural too, in respect of the cognation betwixt the place and the Atomes, though in respect to other Atomes, and the force imprest by them, it be violent and forc'd. And this is that motion which they say is caused by <hi>Sympathy.</hi> Such are all magneticall
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57260:72"/>
motions; amongst which likewise m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y be ranked these Atomes curing at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. No distance hinders the motion of these Atomes towards their natural places. For no pores agreeing with their figure, but their own, that are p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to them, they will still be thrust out by those Atomes which are fitted for those pores in which they are: so that being enforc'd by the pressure of others to move from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will still keep on moving that way whither they are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ust, till they come to a place proportionable to them where they may be freed from this violence So that as the large sphere of magnetical motions may not seem wonderful, so neither rightly can this sympathetical motion of these curative Atomes be accounted magical, if they cure the part they seem not to touch.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The nearer these Atomes approach to their desired home, the resistance is still lesse on that side, and the pressure
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57260:73"/>
greater on the contrary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their motion is swifrer, in a shorter distance, and also slower at a greater.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. There may be, and oftentimes is a Conjunction of Atomes, which in their Pilgrimage, flie on the back one of another, and may and do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate together: as the Winde doth carry with it many infectious Atomes, and sometimes rare and comfortable smels.</p>
                  <p>These things premised and layed as foundations of truth, which can (if examined with an unbiassed judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) appear no other; they will demonstratively illustrate this way and cure of wounds without any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall application. It remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that wee explain the manner of this operation; what the Medicine is, and why it workes more effectually at a distance, then if applyed to the part.</p>
                  <p>First, the Medicine is made of a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57260:73"/>
Zaphyrian Salt, calcined by a celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fire, operating in Leo and Cancer, into a Lunar complexion. The heat must bee such, that it draws out all adventitious moisture, leaving it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensly dry, and in this condition it must be kept. If at any time it meets with any moisture, it loseth its ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and must to the aethereal fornace again, it must be such a proportioned heat, and not a greater; for by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of heat, all the volatile parts and sinest Atomes, which onely work this cure, will bee evaporated: and onely the grosser saline parts remain, which neither can be raised to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Atomes of the blood: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if they could, would they cure; but by their sharper angles, grate the orifices of the capillary veins, and so procure an efflux of blood, and not a consolidation of the wound.</p>
                  <p>The substance of this medicament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> other unctuous bodies, is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57260:74"/>
applyed to the wounds themselves, in most cicatrizing and drying emplasters. Which when the sharp angles are blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the unctuousnesse of the adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed medicaments, doth dry up, and unite the wounded parts most effectually, as in the emplaster called Diapalma, &amp;c. Much more effectual then must the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner active <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> parts; and conveighed into the remotest pores of the wounded part, by the help of the bloody Atomes returning home: upon whose score they finde a far greater and more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come entertainment, then if they came alone, or joyned with any other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers.</p>
                  <p>The manner of applying the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is in this fashion. The blood, or bloody m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tter taken from the wound on a cloath, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ust be lightly covered over with this powder, kept very dry; and afterwards wrapt up close from the air, and so kept in a temperate heat;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57260:74"/>
neither must it finde any muta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excesse; the wound in the mean time must be kept clean, and clothed up with drie clean clothes. If it hath been an old sore or ulcer, that Nature hath found a convenient passage to vent the burden of her excrements that way, and there be a tumor, (as necessarily there will be) the first dressing doth most violently drein this Fountain, and you shall finde the wound to run most strangly: afterwards when the matter is lessened, and is reduced to such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as nature and the medicine may conveniently buckle with it, then it turns it into laudably concocted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which every day lessens, and the wound closeth. But if the wound be fresh, the applied medicine presently stoppeth the blood, and hinders an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of humors to the part. So that there is nothing to be done, but the uniting the severed parts, which this medicine doth in a wonderful short time.</p>
                  <p>The way which these balsamical A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57260:75"/>
of the Medicine, applyed to the blood, take to come to the wounded part, is next to be shewed. All action being performed <hi>Applicando activa pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sivis,</hi> either by a real or virtual (which indeed must be reall too) contact, it must needs make this cure suspected; because the medicine being applyed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the blood, there appears to be no kinde of contact, &amp; therefore it should follow, that there is no operation or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the wound; especially when the wound is at so great a distance from the medicine.</p>
                  <p>But if we shall review the former Laws of Nature, the contact will soon appear to be as real, as that made by the Sun darting his beams into any of these inferiour bodies, though thousands of miles remote from it. The medicine therefore being a body constituted of several particles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that there is an effluvium, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant expiration of Atomes from it, by the second law of Nature. And by the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57260:75"/>
ninth rule these may be conjoyned with the Atomes of blood extrave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and accompany them in their flight. Nay, they must joyn with them, for the Medicine being a Salt, when it comes to imbibe the moisture of the blood, is (as all Salts will be) dissolved, and perfectly mixt together with it; which being kept in a constant continued heat, are continually breathing forth insensibly Atomes from both. Being thus united and exposed, the particles of blood being most, and most active, they carry their companion along with them. Who by the sixth and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth rules, must of necessity be driven to the wounded part, though remote from it a very great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                  <p>When these companions the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of the extravenated blood,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57260:76"/>
and the Medicine are come to the wounded part, the Atoms of the blood are received, finding an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie entrance at those cognate parts, those proportionate pores; with which covertly slips in the other of the Medicine; who meeting there with more moisture, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently delivers up its saline parts to bee conjoyned with those new moist parts; which by the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these newly resolved salt particles, become more fluid and loose, fitter to bee driven out, which is suddenly done. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this loosening the superfluous matter in the wound, the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine hath such parts as contracts the solider parts neerer together, and so shuts the orifices of the veins, that the efflux of blood and humors thence, is presently stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57260:76"/>
hindered the union of the parts, is prest out, so that the wound is more easily soadred up. Which worke is quickly performed by Nature her self, when there shall be nothing to hinder the appositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such fitly prepared particles, as shee hath provided in every part for their nourishment and augmentation. This double work of the Medicine, the loosening and diluting the fluid parts, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stend the pores of the wound, (which causes that pain, which is an inseparable companion of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of continuity) as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the constriction of the pores, and joyning the more solid parts neerer together; is demonstrable in all Salts, when they are laid on bodies retaining any quantity of moisture in them. For Salt lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57260:77"/>
from it; aster which you shall finde the flesh harder, and shrunk closer together: and at last, if it continues long, the moisture is clean dreined out of it. So in the making of some Syrups, if upon Limons or Apples sliced thin, you strew Sugar (which is a kinde of Salt) it will drein out all their moisture, and leave them dry and hard. This being done by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Salts, wee must expect a far greater &amp; speedier operation from this, whose parts claim a greater activity in binding up and closing, then any Salt, as every tongue will soon confesse that toucheth it, either before or after its prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It will be no wonder then, to see so large an efflux of Matter from an Ulcer, till all bee consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, after the sirst dressing of the cloth; or to see so sudden a stop

                  <p>The cloth in which the blood and Medicine are kept, must bee wrapt up close, and kept warm in a temperate heat, not declining to either excesse. First, because the cold doth prohibit the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and breathing forth of these Atomes, so that the wounded part is for that time destitute of those balsamical Atomes, which should drein forth the superfluous humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and restrain the afflux of blood, and other humors to the part. So that the blood flowing to this weakned part, distends its pores, and vessels again beyond its natural and accustomed limits, and rends asunder what was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most united before. And this is that which causeth that pain, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by exposing the clothes
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57260:78"/>
to the cold air. Besides, this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the efflux of these apor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rheas from the cruentated cloth by cold, there may bee some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Atomes; (as those of cold or icy parts, whose activity in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating of bodies, I conceive to bee little lesse then those of fire,) which being conveighed along with these Atomes from the cloth, more slenderly now trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; may disaffect the wound, according to the figure and nature of the Atomes: as may appear by that story of Sir <hi>Kenelm Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> usage of Master <hi>Howels</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entated Garter, heating it over coals in a dish of Vinegar; which put the lame Gentleman into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream pain and torture; but upon the removall of those, and the fresh dressing of the Garter, hee presently received ease, and in a very short time a perfect Cure
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57260:78"/>
The other extream, <hi>viz.</hi> of heat, doth as much exasperate the wounded part, as may appear by this story, as well as by another, from a very credible Reporter, who in the cure of some Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulous Ulcer by this powder, had almost perfected the Cure; the Father still keeping the Cloth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> his pocket; but being to lodge abroad one night, left the Cloth with this Gentleman; who dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Cloth, as before, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>re continued in very good case since the first dressing, all that afternoon and the night following was extreamly tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and slept not at all. In the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57260:79"/>
morning when he came to dresse the Childe again, hee found the wound had bled much, and was very sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: but dressing the Cloth again, put it up in his own pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; and so returned to his good fire; the Childe continuing in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity of pain, they sent their servant to acquaint him with it; who presently apprehending, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the change of the keeping of the Cloth might bee the cause of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, gave the Cloth to the Boy to put it in his pocket: who followin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> his imployments, came not to the fire at all, and in a quarter of an hour after, hee found the Childe playing, and in very good ease. The reason of this was not onely because there were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>any fiery particles joyned with these A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oms, which inflamed the wound; but because the extreame heate working on the matter and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57260:79"/>
in the Cloth, in an unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall manner, raised a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number of these saline parts then usually; which when by the sanguineous Atomes they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, did by their sharp an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular parts shave and corrode the small orifices of the veines: and gave way to that efflux of blood, and by their sharpnesse lay conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually pricking and dividing the tender parts, which was occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by some of grosser and more fixt parts.</p>
                  <p>This Cure, by this Atomicall energy wrought at a distance, is more sudden, then any the most excellent Balsame could perform, or then the substance of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine it self, applyed to the part could do. For first, as I said, the Medicine being a calcined Salt; the sharp part of it would
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57260:80"/>
erode the orifices of the small vessels, which in all wounds are divided; and would prove rather corrosive then curative. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus transmitted with the united Atomes of blood, they steal in undiscerned, and by the vertue of that cognation betwixt the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Atomes of the blood and the pores they are to enter, they are more freely entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and admitted to passe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate themselves farther, then if they came alone; whose dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned Atomes would scarce finde an entrance there, without the other. Being thus freely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into every pore, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the finer volatile parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, whose angles though keen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet have not that hardnesse to fret off the tender mouthes and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of veins: First, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the superfluous humid parts,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57260:80"/>
and make them fit to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled: then by their more then ordinary restrictive power shrink together the pores, and squeez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out that humidity, and glew together those disunited parts. And thus in a very short time is the cure performed.</p>
                  <p>The easing of the Toothach by this Medicine too, is performed by its Atoms, repelling those hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which were flowing to, and distending the thin, and most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatly sensible membrane, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Marrow of the Teeth. Which is done by closing and shutting the pores, that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready imbibed humours must be exprest, and others that are flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are prohibited from ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>

                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:57260:81"/>Thus have I cleared what to Philosophers seemed one of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Cabbinet-Secrets, but to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that condemn all they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not for Magicall, it hath seemed, and been accused to have been done by some diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall compact.
