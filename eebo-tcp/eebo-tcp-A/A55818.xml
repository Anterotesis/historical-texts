            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER TO THE DEISTS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF I am not miſtaken, the Reaſon you give for your Renouncing that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ye were baptized into, and is the Religion of the Country in which ye were born, is, <hi>That the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt is an Impoſture:</hi> An Aſſertion that I tremble to repeat. But whether that <hi>Goſpel</hi> be right, or ye are in the right that deny it, will appear from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Nature of an <hi>Impoſture</hi> and from the Life of that moſt infamous
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35444:4"/>
               <hi>Impoſtor</hi> (whom we, as well as you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be ſuch) which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given you the exact Picture of. And if you can find any one lineament of it, any one line of all its filthy features in the whole <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> I durſt ſay (ſo ſure I am of the contrary) that for the ſake hereof I will give you all you contend for, and yield you up the whole Cauſe. And therefore, that we may throughly examine the Matter, I will lay down, in the firſt place, What an <hi>Impoſture</hi> is; 2dly. What are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable Marks and Characters of it; And, 3dly. That none of theſe Marks can belong to the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And when I have done this, I hope I ſhall convince all ſuch of you, who have not totally abandoned your ſelves to your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, That the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is that ſacred Truth of <hi>God,</hi> which you are all bound to believe.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Impoſture,</hi> taking the word in the full latitude of its ſignification, may denote any <hi>lye</hi> or <hi>cheat,</hi> whereby one Man impoſeth upon another. But it is moſt frequently uſed to expreſs ſuch <hi>cheats</hi> as are impoſed on us by thoſe who come with falſe <hi>Characters</hi> of themſelves, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be what they are not, in order
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35444:4"/>
to delude and deceive. And when this <hi>character,</hi> which is thus falſely aſſumed, is no leſs than a pretended <hi>Embaſſy</hi> from Heaven, and under the credit of it a New <hi>Religion</hi> is delivered to the World as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from <hi>God,</hi> which is nothing elſe but a <hi>Forgery,</hi> invented by the firſt Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of it, to impoſe a cheat upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, it amounts to be an <hi>Impoſture</hi> in that ſenſe, in which you would have the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be ſuch. And in this ſenſe it is to be underſtood in the Controverſie between us; ſo that the whole <hi>Queſtion</hi> which we are to examine into, is, Whether the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> be a Truth really given unto us by <hi>divine Revelation</hi> from <hi>God</hi> our <hi>Creatour,</hi> or elſe a meer humane invention, contrived by the firſt <hi>Propagators</hi> of it, to impoſe a cheat upon mankind. And when I have fully diſproved the latter part of this <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,</hi> that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> cannot be ſuch an invention, contrived to cheat and impoſe upon us, that will ſufficiently prove the former, that it muſt be that divine Truth, which all we that are <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> firmly believe it to be.</p>
            <p>That it is poſſible ſuch a cheat may be impoſed upon Men, cannot be denied. It is ſufficiently proved in the foregoing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35444:5"/>
               <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> which is a very full inſtance of it; and I have laid it before you for this very purpoſe, that you may therein ſee clearly delineated and diſplayed in all its proper colours the whole nature of the thing, which you charge our <hi>holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> with. All that I contend for, is, That if <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> be ſuch an <hi>Impoſture</hi> as we all acknowledge the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be, it muſt be juſt ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing as that is, with all the ſame Marks, Characters, and Properties of an <hi>Impoſture</hi> belonging thereto; and that if none of thoſe Marks, Characters, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties can be diſcovered in it, it muſt be a clear eviction of the whole charge, and manifeſtly prove, That our holy <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> cannot be that thing, which you would have it to be. For our only way of knowing things, is by their Marks and Properties; and it is by them only that we can diſcover what the nature of them is. It is only by the Marks and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Man, that we know a Man from another living Creature, for we cannot ſee the Eſſences of things. And ſo it muſt be only by the Marks and Properties of an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> that we can know an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture</hi> from that which is a real truth, when atteſted unto us. And as where we
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35444:5"/>
find none of the Marks and Properties of a Man, we aſſuredly know that cannot be a Man, how much ſoever any one may tell us that it is: So where we find none of the Marks and Properties of an <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,</hi> we may aſſuredly know that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> how much ſoever you, or any other like you, may aſſert it ſo to be.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> which I look on to be inſeparable from every ſuch <hi>Impoſture,</hi> are theſe following: 1. That it muſt always have for its end ſome carnal intereſt. 2. That it can have none but wicked Men for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it. 3. That both theſe muſt neceſſarily appear in the very contexture of the <hi>Impoſture</hi> it ſelf. 4. That it can never be ſo framed, but that it muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome palpable falſities, which will diſcover the falſity of all the reſt. 5. That where-ever it is firſt propagated, it muſt be done by craft and fraud. 6. That when entruſted with many conſpirators, it can never be long concealed: And, 7. That it can never be eſtabliſhed, unleſs backed with force and violence. That all theſe muſt belong to every <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and all particularly did ſo to <hi>Mahometiſm</hi>; and that none of them can be charged
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35444:6"/>
upon <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> is what I ſhall now proceed to ſhew you of each of them in their order.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>
                  <hi>SECT.</hi> I.</head>
               <p n="1">I. That every <hi>Impoſture</hi> muſt have for its end ſome carnal intereſt, is a thing ſo plain and evident, that I ſuppoſe it will not need much proof. For to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a cheat upon mankind, and in a matter of that great importance, as all that have any Religion hold that to be, is a thing of that difficulty to compaſs, and of that danger to attempt, that it cannot be conceived, why any one ſhould put himſelf upon ſuch a deſign, that doth not propoſe ſome very valuable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to himſelf in the ſucceſs. To cheat one Man is not always ſo eaſie a matter, or is it without its miſchiefs and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences in the diſcovery. But to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize a cheat upon all mankind, and in a thing of that importance, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing of a New <hi>Religion,</hi> and the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of the Old one (to which ſo many both by cuſtom and education will be always zealouſly affected, be it what it will) muſt be an undertaking of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt difficulty and hazard imaginable.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35444:6"/>
For whoever engageth himſelf in ſuch a plot of <hi>Impoſture,</hi> muſt unavoidably meet with many ſtrong oppoſitions to ſtruggle with in the management of it, which will continually put his thoughts upon the rack to find out devices to ſurmount them, and his body to inceſſant pains and labour to bring them into Execution; and for the effecting hereof, he muſt have ſome confidents to aſſiſt him, ſome to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the deſign, whom he muſt truſt with the ſecret of it; and the more he hath of ſuch, the more he hazards all to a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. And all this while his mind will be fill'd with anxious cares, and his thoughts diſtracted with many uneaſie and affrighting apprehenſions (as is uſual with Men on wicked deſigns) about the ſucceſs, and every failure will expoſe him to that terrible revenge from thoſe he attempts to declude, as ſuch a villainy whenever detected, moſt juſtly deſerves. This was <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s caſe all the while he was propagating his <hi>Impoſture</hi> at <hi>Mecca,</hi> and ſo it muſt be of every other ſuch <hi>Impoſtor</hi> alſo. And when a man puts himſelf upon all this, the nature of the thing manifeſtly leads us to conclude, he muſt propoſe ſomething to himſelf here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by which may make him amends for all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35444:7"/>
in the reſult. For when ſo much is put to hazard, men do not uſe to do it for nothing. There muſt always be ſome great intereſt in the bottom of ſuch a deſign, ſomething that the undertaker values at a more than ordinary rate to make him engage in ſo exceeding diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and dangerous an enterpriſe. For where-ever the venture is great, it muſt be taken for granted there is an end propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which in the eſtimation of the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer is equivalent thereto. What it was that put <hi>Mahomet</hi> on his <hi>Impoſture</hi> the foregoing <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of his life ſufficiently ſhews, it was his ambition and his luſt. To have the ſoveraignty over his Country, to gratify his ambition, and as many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as he pleaſed to ſatiate his luſt was what he aimed at, and to gain himſelf a party for the compaſſing of this was the grand deſign of that new <hi>Religion</hi> which he invented, and the whole end and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his impoſing it on thoſe he delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereinto. And whoever purſues the like method muſt certainly have ſome ſuch end in it, it being totally incredible that any one ſhould take upon him the trouble, fatigue and danger of carrying on ſuch a cheat only for cheating ſake. But here we challenge all the enemies of that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35444:7"/>
                  <hi>holy Religion</hi> which we profeſs, to find out any thing like this in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> any thing that ſavours of worldly intereſt either in him the firſt <hi>Founder</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> or in any of his <hi>holy Apoſtles,</hi> who were the firſt <hi>Propagators</hi> of it. <hi>Vaninus,</hi> one of the moſt zealous Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of Impiety that ever appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Cauſe (for he died a Martyr for it) hath attempted this: but after the moſt accurate and diligent ſearch which ſo keen an Adverſary could make, he was forced to give up the Point; and plainly acknowledge, that in the whole ſeries of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and actions of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> he could not find any thing that he could charge with ſecular intereſt or deſign to blaſt him or his <hi>Religion</hi> with. And if you will renew the ſame attempt, though you extend the inquiry much farther, even to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and all the reſt of his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> who firſt preached this holy <hi>Religion</hi> to the <hi>World,</hi> and take in to your aſſiſtance all the enemies of it; after the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny that you can make, you will never have any better ſucceſs herein.</p>
               <p>For had our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s deſign been to ſeduce the People for his own intereſt, he muſt have taken the ſame courſe, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35444:8"/>
other Seducers do. He muſt have flattered them in their humors, and formed his doctrines to their fancies; courted thoſe that were in greateſt authority and eſteem with them, and made it his buſineſs moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preach againſt and decry thoſe who were leaſt in their favour, and ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and practiſed all other ſuch arts of popularity, whereby he might beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate into their good liking, and gain that intereſt with them, as might be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſerve his purpoſe and obtain the end propoſed. Theſe were the methods whereby <hi>Mahomet</hi> firſt propagated his <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and theſe are they which all others muſt take, whoſe purpoſe it is to deceive the People. But our <hi>Saviour</hi> in every particular acted contrary hereto, which ſufficiently proves that he had no ſuch deſign to compaſs. For he freely preach'd againſt whatever he found blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the people, ſpared not their moſt beloved errours, or framed his doctrines to indulge them in any one evil practice how predominant ſo ever amongſt them, and was ſo far from courting thoſe in the greateſt authority and eſteem with them, that he was moſt ſharp and bitter againſt them above all others, whom they moſt idolized, I mean the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi>;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35444:8"/>
For he on all occaſions detected their <hi>Hypocriſies,</hi> and laid open their evil practices, and in the ſevereſt manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked and condemned them for their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity therein, even to the preferring and juſtifying before them the wicked <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> who for their exactions and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon the people in their gathering the publick <hi>Taxes</hi> were held among them the moſt hated of men and the worſt of ſinners. And therefore, though his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> often drew their admiration and their applauſe on the one hand, his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and his preachings as faſt alienated them from him on the other; ſo that thoſe very ſame Men, who, for the ſake of the former, followed him often in multitudes, and were ready to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be the Meſſias, were as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſet againſt him at other times for the ſake of the latter, and at laſt crucified him on the account thereof. And is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceive, that he, who took all thoſe courſes ſo contrary to the humour of the people, without regarding how much they tended to exaſperate them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, ſhould have any intereſt or deſign of his own to ſerve himſelf of them?</p>
               <p>When our <hi>Saviour</hi> took upon him to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35444:9"/>
be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was promiſed, had he done it only as an <hi>Impoſtor</hi> to promote a ſecular intereſt and deſign of his own, he would certainly have aſſumed that chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter according to thoſe Notions in which the <hi>Jews</hi> expected him. For in this caſe the expectation of the people muſt have been the grand motive to the <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and their looking for ſuch a <hi>Meſſias</hi> to come the main inducing reaſon of his putting himſelf thereon, and therefore to be ſure, had he been an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> he would have offered himſelf to them no otherwiſe than juſt ſuch a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as their notions of him would have him to be; and there are two ſpecial reaſons which in this caſe would have determined him hereto. 1. Becauſe thoſe notions offered to him the higheſt ſecular intereſt, that could be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto: And, 2. Becauſe the ſuiting of his pretenſions exactly according to them, would have been the readieſt and moſt likely way for him to carry the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, whatever it was, which you may ſuppoſe him to have aimed at.</p>
               <p>And, firſt, the notions which the <hi>Jews</hi> had of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> offered him the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſecular intereſt that could be attained unto; and therefore to be ſure, when he took upon him to be that <hi>Meſſias,</hi> had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35444:9"/>
he done it only as an <hi>Impoſtor</hi> for a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar intereſt, he would have laid hold of that intereſt offered, and under the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter which he aſſum'd moſt certainly have claim'd all that, which according to thoſe notions the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to have. For this was nothing leſs than a moſt glorious ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Kingdom, the expectations of the <hi>Jews</hi> being then concerning this matter the ſame as they have ever ſince continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt them; that the <hi>Meſſias</hi>

And at that time when our <hi>Saviour</hi> firſt appeared on his <hi>Miſſion,</hi> there was the moſt favourable juncture, that could offer it ſelf, for his ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up for all this: For then the People
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35444:10"/>
of the <hi>Jews</hi> being fallen under the Yoke of the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, and alſo grown very impatient under it, entertained a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral expectation of the ſpeedy Coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> under that character of a <hi>Temporal Prince,</hi> which they had conceited of him, to deliver them from this bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and by conquering thoſe who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them thereto, again reſtore the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And theſe hopes had then taken that poſſeſſion of their minds, and they were all ſo full of them, that every one ſtood in a manner ready and prepared to join with him, whoſoever ſhould take upon him to be the perſon, as ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not only from <note n="¶" rend="inter">

From all which places compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, it appears, that there was among the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the time of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral expectation of the ſpeedy Coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and that their notion was of a temporal deliverance and a temporal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be effected by him. And this expectation was it which made the multitude ſo ready to join themſelves to <hi>Theudas,</hi> and after to <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> of whom mention is made <hi>Acts</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 36, 37. and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that to an <hi>Egyptian Jew, Acts</hi> 21. v. 38. on their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be the perſons, from whom this deliverance was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</note> the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but alſo from the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> which <note n="(*)" rend="inter">

For, ſaith he, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is not to be known by Signs or Wonders (for he is to work none) but only by conqueſt. And therefore his Words are. <hi>If there ariſeth a King of the Houſe of</hi> David, <hi>who is ſtudious of the Law, and diligent in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the precepts of it, as was</hi> David <hi>his father; that is, not only of the Law, which is written, but of the Oral alſo, and inclineth all</hi> Iſrael <hi>to walk therein, and repairs the breaches, and fights the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of the Lord, this perſon may be preſumed to be the</hi> Meſſias. <hi>But if he proſpers in what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes, and ſubdues all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations round about him, and re-builds the ſanctuary in its former place, and gathers together the diſperſed of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>then he is for certain the</hi> Meſſias. Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides in Yad Hachazekah Tract. de Regibus &amp; Bellis eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, c. 11. §. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> wrote of thoſe times. And therefore had our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> by taking upon him to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> aimed only as an <hi>Impoſtor</hi> at a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intereſt, What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given, why he ſhould not with the name of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> have alſo
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35444:10"/>
claimed this grand intereſt of a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion of all thoſe, who expected a <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> belonged thereto? or why he ſhould not in ſo favourable a juncture, as was then offer'd for it, have poſſeſſed himſelf thereof? But he was ſo far from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either of theſe, that he waved both, and not only omitted this opportunity of poſſeſſing himſelf of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but alſo renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and diſclaim'd the whole thereof. For inſtead of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any pretence to it, he ſet himſelf to confute thoſe very notions which gave it unto him, and to convince the People that they were miſtaken in them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by overthrew all that which offered unto him the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Secular intereſt which the Men of this world uſe to aim at. And not only ſo, but advanced in the ſtead of thoſe Errours, ſuch
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35444:11"/>
Doctrines concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as were not only without all manner of worldly intereſt in them, but all levelled directly oppoſite thereto. For he taught them, that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was not a <hi>Temporal,</hi> but a <hi>Spiritual Kingdom</hi>; that he was not to be a Judge and a Ruler over them in the Secular affairs of this World and the pomp and glory thereof, but to govern and direct their hearts within by the power of his holy Spirit, in order to conform them to that Law of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which might fit them to reign with him in the Kingdom of everlaſting Glory hereafter. And therefore when the <hi>Jews</hi> being convinced by his wonderfull Works that he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> would have taken him by force and made him their <hi>King,</hi> he withdrew from among them to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the deſign. And when interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Pilate,</hi> he told him his <hi>Kingdom</hi> was not of this World. And had he aimed at any ſuch thing, he would never have taught ſuch Doctrines of himſelf, which ſo directly overthrew all that which gave him the moſt favourable advantage of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thereto. Had he offered at more of this World's intereſt than the <hi>Notions</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> inveſted him with (if it were poſſible more could be had than thoſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35444:11"/>
gave their <hi>Meſſias</hi>;) or if he had joined thereto, the enjoyment of carnal pleaſure as <hi>Mahomet</hi> did, there might then have been ſome ground of charging him of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from thoſe Notions for the ſerving of his own intereſt; but when the change was on the quite contrary hand, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being that reigning and glorious <hi>Meſſias,</hi> amidſt the higheſt pomp and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of this World, as the <hi>Jews</hi> would have had him to be, he declared himſelf only for ſuch a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as had nothing of this World in it, and whoſe greateſt perfection lay in its greateſt oppoſition thereto; he that will ſay that there was any thing of this World in his thus ſtripping himſelf of all the pomp and glory of it, or that there could be any deſign of intereſt for himſelf, where all manner of ſelf-intereſt is thus renounced, muſt reconcile contradictions, and make the nature of one extreme to conſiſt in the other, which is moſt directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite thereto. Had he, when he took upon him to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> done it only for a worldly intereſt, this great intereſt of reigning, ſo obviouſly offered it ſelf unto him under that character, that it cannot be conceived how he ſhould ever have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided it. The power, and glory, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35444:12"/>
riches of a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> are too great baits of allurement to the worldly-minded Man, ever to be refuſed by ſuch an one, after he had aſſumed that character, which in the generally-received Notion of it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted him with them. Or can it be imagined, ſince theſe are the only things which could make that character at all deſirable to an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> why any Man ſhould run the great hazard and trouble of being ſuch in the aſſuming of it, but for the ſake of them? All thoſe falſe <hi>Chriſts,</hi> who have been real <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> and have in ſeveral Ages ſtarted up to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the World with this pretence have ever with the name of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed thereto; and that in every ſuch ſcene of deceit, which hath opened in the World, hath always appeared to have been the bait, which allured thoſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to act that part therein. And had our <hi>Saviour</hi> been ſuch an one as they, he muſt certainly have taken the ſame courſe. For to do otherwiſe, would have been to do the wickedneſs without the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to run the hazard without that which was to reward the ſucceſs. But he having been ſo far herefrom, that he did not only renounce this Kingdom, but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35444:12"/>
all manner of other worldly intereſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; this plainly ſhews he could have no deſign upon this World by that <hi>Miſſion</hi> which he undertook, or had any other reaſon for his entering on it as the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but that he was really that perſon, whom <hi>God</hi> by his holy <hi>Prophets</hi> had ſo often promiſed, and at length, in fulneſs of time, accordingly ſent to bring life and ſalvation unto us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Had our <hi>Saviour,</hi> when he took upon him to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> done it only as an <hi>Impoſtor</hi> for a Secular intereſt, he would have aſſumed that character ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe notions in which the <hi>Jews</hi> expected him, becauſe this would have been the readieſt and moſt likely way for him to carry that intereſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may ſuppoſe it to be. For the eager expectations of that People being then for ſuch a reigning <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as they had drawn a Picture of in their own fancies, his only way to have gotten them to own and receive him for the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> was for him exactly to have humour'd them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and propoſed himſelf to them juſt ſuch an one as they would have had him to be. And had his intent been only to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them under that character, in order to ſerve himſelf of them for a Secular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35444:13"/>
this method is that which is ſo obviouſly neceſſary in ſuch a caſe, that it could not have been avoided. For to do otherwiſe, would evidently have been to put the matter in a moſt certain me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod totally to miſcarry, and make the whole deſign impracticable. To come to them as their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> under a character totally differing from that in which they expected him, would be ſufficient to make them, for that very reaſon, never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him. Although humility and the debaſing of a Man's ſelf, may in other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be a means to court Popularity, and procure the favour of the People, it could never have ſerved in this; nor would our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s taking upon him the Character of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſo vaſtly lower as to this World, than the general opinion then gave it unto him, have been of any ſtead to him in order thereto; but quite the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For the <hi>Jews</hi> had then framed their notions of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> they expected, for their own ſakes rather than his; ſuitable to thoſe worldly intereſts they were moſt in love with, and thoſe notions went cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant through the whole <hi>Nation,</hi> as the true and exact deſcription of him, by which he was to be known at his coming: And therefore for any one to propoſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35444:13"/>
himſelf to them, as the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> under a character totally diſagreeing herefrom, would have been the readieſt way for him to be told, that he was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Man; and this, inſtead of being a means to ſeduce them to him, become ſuch a reaſon for their rejecting him, as no art of <hi>Impoſture</hi> would ever have been able to maſter. And this indeed proved the main cauſe, that notwithſtanding our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Miracles, the <hi>Jews,</hi> who daily ſaw them, were ſtill hardned in their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion againſt him; and it continues with them to this day the grand ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block of Infidelity, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get over. For they looked for a <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> that was to ſubdue their Enemies, and deliver them from the ſlavery of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by the eſtabliſhment of a <hi>Temporal Kingdom</hi> over them advance the ſtate of their <hi>Nation</hi> to the higheſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and their <hi>Law</hi> to the higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of obſervance, which both were capable of. But he propoſed himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them as a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which had nothing to do with this World, or any of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of it; and inſtead of the <hi>Temporal Kingdom</hi> they expected, claimed only a <hi>Spiritual;</hi> and inſtead of the outward Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Moſaical Law</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:35444:14"/>
which were all fulfill'd and done away in him, taught them only to worſhip <hi>God</hi> in ſpirit and in truth. And what could more diſpleaſe and alienate from him, Men ſo eager upon this World, and the glory and riches of it, than thus inſtead of conqueſt over enemies, extent of power, and a moſt flouriſhing ſtate of proſperity, which they dreamt of, to preach to them of Mortification, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Self-denial, and thoſe other <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Virtues, in the encreaſe of which the true proſperity of <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom</hi> only conſiſts; and inſtead of their <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and the outward pomp and ſplendour of the worſhip there performed, which they ſo much valued themſelves upon, and ſo zealouſly affected, thus to propoſe to them the Worſhipping of <hi>God</hi> without all this, only in that Spiritual manner, which under the numerous Rites of the <hi>Moſaical Law</hi> they had not been accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have any great regard unto? For this was to baulk them of the hopes they moſt delighted in, and put a baffle upon them in thoſe eager expectations and moſt earneſt deſires which their hearts had long dwelt upon. And how ill they were able to brook this, will appear by this inſtance in the <hi>Goſpel</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. c. 6.</note>, That thoſe very ſame Men
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35444:14"/>
who, on the ſeeing of his <hi>Miracles,</hi> were ſo firmly convinced of his being the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> that they would forthwith have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him by force, and declared him their <hi>King,</hi> the next day after, on his preaching to them of ſpiritual things, and offering thereby to withdraw their minds from the periſhable things of this World, to fix them on thoſe which endure to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, murmured againſt him, and would no more endure him. For their hearts were after a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that ſhould found them a <hi>Temporal Kingdom,</hi> and make them great and glorious, and powerfull therein; and to ſet up a <hi>Spiritual Kingdom</hi> inſtead here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, was not only to deprive himſelf of the grandure of the other, but them alſo of the portion which they expected therein. And no one certainly that intended a worldly intereſt by ſuch an undertaking, would ever have projected it in ſuch a method as this, which was ſo totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with it. For this would be to renounce in the very act the end which he propoſed, and make the attainment of it impracticable by the very means whereby he purſued it; It would be to wave the higheſt intereſt in this World to purſue after another, which no one can imagine what, and thereby totally
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35444:15"/>
alienate thoſe from him, by whom alone he could hope in ſuch a deſign as this to attain any at all. And therefore had a worldly end and a worldly intereſt been all that our <hi>Saviour</hi> aimed at in his taking upon him to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whom the <hi>Jews</hi> expected, he would never ſo much contrary to that intereſt, and ſo much contrary to that moſt obvious means of carrying on ſuch a deſign, have aſſumed that character in a manner ſo much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that, under which they expected him; Or could he by ſuch a method of procedure ever have made any thing of the attempt among them, had he not on his ſide the power of God, as well as his Miſſion, to make him ſucceſsfull there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?</p>
               <p>Had his buſineſs only been to deceive the People for the advancing of ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intereſt of his own, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have attempted it in ſo unlikely a way of ſucceeding, as that of aboliſhing the <hi>Moſaical Law,</hi> to which the whole nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> were then ſo zealouſly addicted, that they could not bear the leaſt word, which might ſeem to derogate either from the excellency, which they conceived of it, or that opinion which they then had, and ſtill retain, that it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35444:15"/>
was to be immutably obſerved by them to the end of the World. The caſe of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> with his Men of <hi>Mecca</hi> was quite otherwiſe, he found no ſuch zeal in them for their old <hi>Religion</hi> to ſtruggle with, they themſelves were then grown ſo weary of it, that the generality of them had in a manner totally exchanged it for no <hi>Religion</hi> at all at that time <hi>Mahomet</hi> firſt began to propagate his <hi>Impoſture</hi> among them, they having then for the moſt part given themſelves up to the opinions of the <hi>Zendikees,</hi> who in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and too many now-a-days among us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Being of a <hi>God,</hi> but deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Providence, the immortality of the ſoul, and a future ſtate, did at the ſame time deny all manner of neceſſity of paying any worſhip unto him. And no wonder then if ſuch Men, who placed their All in this World, were eaſily brought over to a <hi>Sect,</hi> whoſe chief aim was at worldly proſperity and worldly pleaſure in the <hi>Religion</hi> which they profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. This <hi>Mahomet</hi> was well enough aware of before he ſtarted his new <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> among them, and it ſeems to have been the greateſt encouragement which emboldned him to venture on that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35444:16"/>
However ſince they ſtill retained the outward form of their <hi>Religion</hi> after they had deſerted the ſubſtance of it, he found even from hence that oppoſition to his deſign, that to make it go down, he was forced to retain all thoſe Rites and Ceremonies in his new <hi>Religion,</hi> which they had been afore uſed to in their old; and in order hereto he choſe to make ſome dangerous alterations in his firſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as particularly in that of the <hi>Kebla</hi> rather than ruffle his <hi>Arabians</hi> by aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he found them through long uſage and cuſtom any way affected to. For his buſineſs being to deceive the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, his care was to offer at nothing, which might be difficult to go down with them, and ſo muſt it be of every other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver who takes upon him to act the like part. But in every particular it was quite otherwiſe with our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and thoſe whom he firſt preached his <hi>Goſpel</hi> unto. For the <hi>Jews</hi> having undergone ſeveral terrible ſcourges from the hand of <hi>God</hi> for the neglect of that <hi>Law</hi> which he had given them, were from their former too much diſregard of it then grown into the contrary extreme of being with exceeding ſuperſtition and bigottry too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to it. They then looked on it with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35444:16"/>
the ſame veneration, as they ſtill do, to be an immutable Law never to be altered, That the <hi>Meſſias</hi> himſelf on his coming ſhould not make the leaſt change therein, but that the glory of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſhould chiefly conſiſt in the perfection of its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance, and the exact performance of the worſhip it preſcrib'd, and for any one to advance any doctrine contrary hereto was reckoned no leſs than <note n="(*)" place="margin">Act: 6. v. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> among them. And therefore had our <hi>Saviour</hi> only conſulted fleſh and bloud in the <hi>Miſſion</hi> which he undertook, had he had no other deſign therein than a Secular intereſt and a worldly end, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have oppoſed himſelf againſt the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent current of ſuch predominant opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as he found then reigning among them, whom he firſt preached his <hi>Goſpel</hi> unto, or ever durſt have offered at the abolition of that <hi>Law,</hi> which they were ſo violently bigotted unto. Had he come to deceive them as a <hi>Seducer,</hi> the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing muſt neceſſarily have directed him to a quite contrary method; that is, to ſooth and collogue with them whom he came to impoſe upon; to have contradicted no opinion they were vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for, or oppoſed any doctrine which they were zealouſly affected to, but to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35444:17"/>
have ſtudied their humours, and learnt their notions, and ſo framed and ſuited all his doctrines according thereto, as might beſt take to draw them over to the end deſigned. To have done otherwiſe would have been to ſet Prieſt and People againſt him, as an enemy to their <hi>Religion,</hi> and a Blaſphemer of their <hi>Law.</hi> And, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> found it ſo in the reſult, ſo it muſt have been obvious to any one in his caſe to have forſeen it from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And therefore ſince notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this he took this method ſo contrary to the whole end and deſign of one that intends a cheat upon the people, and without having any regard to that zeal with which the <hi>Jews</hi> were then ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bigotted to their <hi>Law,</hi> or that rage of reſentment, which they were ready to expreſs againſt whatſoever in the leaſt ſhould derogate from it, did boldly preach unto them ſuch Doctrines, as totally diſannull'd it, this manifeſtly proves he could have no intereſt of his own to ſerve upon them in this undertaking, or that he had any other reaſon for his entering on it, but that he was ſent of <hi>God</hi> ſo to do.</p>
               <p>The grand and fundamental doctrine of the <hi>Religion,</hi> which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> left
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35444:17"/>
his <hi>Church,</hi> was that of his death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whereby he made atonement for our ſins and delivered us from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was due unto us for them. By this means only he propoſed to ſave us, that is from Sin, the Devil, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death, and by this conflict only did he undertake to ſubdue theſe our enemies for us, and on that conqueſt to found us a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which ſhould make us holy and righteous here, and for ever bleſſed with him in glory hereafter. This was the whole end and purpoſe of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>'s Miſſion; this he frequently foretold to his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and on this was founded the whole <hi>Religion</hi> which he taught them. And can any one ſay he could have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Secular intereſt for himſelf in ſuch a <hi>Religion</hi> as this, which could have no being, but by his dying for it, or any reaſon for its eſtabliſhment among men till he had laid down his life for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of it? To ſay there was any thing of worldly intereſt in this would be to charge it on his croſs, and place it in that bitter and ignominious death which he underwent thereon. Men ſometimes put their lives to great hazard for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of this World, but for a Man purpoſely to deſign death for ſuch an end
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35444:18"/>
and part with this World in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did for the ſake of any thing that this world hath, is a thing which was never yet heard of, and is in it ſelf ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the moſt obvious dictates both of reaſon and nature, that no one can be ſo abſurd as to imagine it poſſible for any man ſo to do.</p>
               <p>But that which I know you will ſay in this caſe is, That it was not <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but his Diſciples after his death, that made this a part of his <hi>Religion</hi>; That he intended no ſuch thing in the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king he entered on, that it ſhould end in his death, and be compleated by his Crucifixion; but that this hapning unto him, thoſe who kept up his Party, and propagated his Religion after him, foiſted this thereinto, to ſalve the ignominy of his Death, and ſerve themſelves of it, for the better carrying on of their deſigns thereby. And if ſo, then the <hi>Impoſture</hi> muſt be ſhifted from him to his <hi>Diſciples</hi>; and in this caſe the ſame inquiry muſt ſtill be made, What advantage could they propoſe to themſelves herefrom? For if <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s having no ſelf-deſign or worldly-intereſt in the <hi>Religion</hi> which he taught be of any force to acquit him of being guilty of <hi>Impoſture</hi> therein (as it muſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35444:18"/>
with every Man of unprejudiced reaſon,) it muſt alſo be of force to acquit them of the ſame charge who propagated it after him. And what worldly intereſt is it which they could poſſibly have in this matter? If you ſay <hi>Empire,</hi> how impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable is it, that a few poor <hi>Fiſhermen</hi> without any manner of foundation either of poor riches or intereſt with others, for the carrying on of ſuch a deſign, ſhould ever frame in their thoughts the leaſt imagination tending thereto, eſpecially at that time when the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its utmoſt heighth and vigour had the major part of the then known World united under its command to cruſh the greateſt attempts of this nature, which might be made againſt it? If riches and honour be alledged as their end, I muſt deſire you to tell me, how this could be a means to gain them? or whether any one of them ever attained to either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? If we examine into the accounts, which we have of their lives and actions we ſhall find them journeying about the world from place to place in great pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and under all the difficulties and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of it to diſcharge that <hi>Apoſtleſhip</hi> which was committed unto them, and in every place where they came to be load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35444:19"/>
with contempt, oppreſſion and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſake of that <hi>Religion</hi> which they taught. Had riches and honour been the end propoſed for all this, certainly after having experienced by the ill ſucceſs how improper means they had taken in order thereto, ſome of them would have deſiſted from the enterprize, and no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger have purſued a deſign, which could not anſwer its end. But you cannot bring us an inſtance of any one of them that did this. No, they ſtill went on in the work, which they had undertaken, and without being wearied by the pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they laboured under, or in the leaſt diſcouraged by that contempt ſcorn and perſecution, which they every-where met with, all conſtantly perſevered to preach that <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which they had received, even to their lives end; and not only ſo, but moſt of them laid down their lives for the ſake therefore, which they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have done, if they had not for that <hi>Miniſtry</hi> a much higher reaſon, than all the honour and riches of this world could ever amount unto. All that can be ſaid of any worldly intereſt for them in their preaching up that <hi>Religion</hi> which they propagated is, That they were thereby made Heads of the Party which they drew
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35444:19"/>
over thereto. But alas, what advantage could this be unto them to be thus made Heads of a contemned, oppreſſed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Party of Men, who were every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſought out for bonds, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and death. To head ſuch a Party what is it, but to expoſe a Man's ſelf to the greater danger, and ſet himſelf up to receive the firſt ſtrokes of every perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was levelled againſt it? For in this caſe, thoſe who head the Party are moſt ſought after, and the ring-leaders of it are ever made the firſt and the moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal examples of every ſeverity, which is deſigned for its oppreſſion. And this was all that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> got by heading that Party, which they converted to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi>; and what of worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt could be found therein? If the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Party be of any advantage to a Man, it muſt be then only when it brings him honour, or power, or riches, or ſome other worldly enjoyment. But to head ſuch a Party, as the firſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were, could bring neither of theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; but on the contrary, poverty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, oppreſſions, and perſecutions were all the fruits, as to this world, which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> reaped thereby. And certainly on theſe terms, to head a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35444:20"/>
Party, could never have been the reaſon to make them enter on that undertaking; or if it had, they could never under ſuch diſcouragements have long continued therein.</p>

               <p n="2">II. And thus far having examined the firſt mark of <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and I hope ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhown it cannot belong to that holy <hi>Religion</hi> which we profeſs. I ſhall now proceed to the ſecond; that is, that it muſt always have wicked men for the <hi>Authors</hi> of it. For thus to impoſe upon mankind a falſe <hi>Religion</hi> is the worſt of cheats, and the higheſt injuſtice which can be done either to <hi>God</hi> or Man: to God, becauſe it robs him of the worſhip of his Creatures, either by diverting it to a falſe object, or by directing it to him in ſuch a falſe way, as cannot be accepted of before him; And to Man, becauſe it deprives him of his <hi>God,</hi> by putting him upon ſuch a falſe <hi>Religion</hi> as muſt neceſſarily alienate both his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and his favour from him. And to do this, is ſuch a conſummate piece of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that it is impoſſible any one can arrive thereto without having firſt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf to a great degree in all things
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35444:20"/>
elſe. For ſuch an one muſt have caſt off all fear of God, as well as all regard of Man, before he could ever offer at ſo great a Wickedneſs againſt both. And when a Man is come to this, to be ſure he will ſtick at nothing, whereby his luſts may be gratified, or any carnal intereſt ſerv'd which he ſets his heart upon, but will make the corruptions of his mind appear in all the actions of his life, and be thoroughly wicked in every thing where his own intereſt, or his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns do not put a reſtraint upon him. And that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was ſuch an one, the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of his Life, which I have laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, ſufficiently ſhows. But whoever yet charged <note n="*" rend="inter">All that the bittereſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> have ever objected againſt our <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſave a fabulous ſtory of his Birth, amounts to no more than this, That he was a <hi>Magician,</hi> which was an invention, framed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſalve his working of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> (which they could not deny) in ſuch a manner as to make them give no reputation or authority to the doctrines which he taught.</note> 
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or his holy <hi>Apoſtles</hi> with any thing like this? not <hi>Celſus,</hi> not <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry,</hi> not <hi>Julian</hi> or any other of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> or the <hi>Jews</hi> who were the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt enemies of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> and the greateſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of it. And to be ſure could they have found any ſuch accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt any of them, they would never have ſpared to have made the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt uſe of it they could for the blaſting
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35444:21"/>
of that <hi>Religion,</hi> which they taught. For it is a popular <hi>Argument,</hi> which would have ſerved their purpoſe among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more than any other they could have offered unto them. And we ſee with what ſucceſs the various <hi>Sects</hi> among us ſerve themſelves of it every day, no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument being more prevalent amongſt the unthinking Multitude for the beating down the reputation of any profeſſion of <hi>Religion,</hi> than the ripping up of the faults of thoſe that teach it. To examine into all the Labyrinths and abſtruſe Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of reaſon and argument, which may be brought for or againſt any <hi>Religion,</hi> is an operoſe buſineſs, which all have not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities for, and few care to attend to. But of Good and Evil every Man is judge, and where they find the Teachers of any <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> to be wicked and naught, it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which they are all apt too preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitately to run into, that the <hi>Religion</hi> muſt be naught alſo, and without any further examining into it condemn it ſo to be. And I find there is nothing, which you your ſelves are more greedy to lay hold of for an argument againſt our holy <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion,</hi> than the faults which you obſerve in ſome of our <hi>Miniſters,</hi> whoſe buſineſs it is to promote it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35444:21"/>
if the faults of the preſent teachers of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> be apt thus to afford ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular and prevalent an argument againſt it, how much more would the faults of the firſt founders and propagaters of it have done ſo, had there been any ſuch to object againſt them? And had there been any ſuch, ſo keen and ſearching Adverſaries, would never have ſuffered the diſcovery to have eſcaped them, or ever fail'd to have objected it for the ſerving of their turn to the utmoſt they were able; and it can be owing to nothing, but their moſt unblamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble innocency, that they have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured herefrom. To ſay that they could not have that knowledge of their lives and actions, as was ſufficient for them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their faults, and obſerve their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, will not ſolve the matter. Though <hi>Mahomet</hi> acted his <hi>Impoſture</hi> ſo many hundred miles within the remoter parts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> among a people, who by vaſt deſarts were in a manner cut off from the converſe of the reſt of mankind, where very few or none of any other nation ever came to ſpy out his actions or obſerve his doings, and where he had none elſe to be witneſſes of them, but thoſe only who all imbraced his forgery, and became
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35444:22"/>
zealouſly addicted to it; yet all this could not ſerve to conceal his faults, or hide his monſtrous wickedneſſes from being obſerved and recorded againſt him. The foregoing <hi>Hiſtory</hi> gives you a large Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of them, and they are vouched by the authority of ſome of the moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick writers of his own <hi>Sect.</hi> But <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> had not its birth in ſuch an obſcure hole, nor did the firſt <hi>Founder</hi> of it, or thoſe who propagated it after him, make their firſt appearance among ſuch rude and illiterate <hi>Barbarians,</hi> as that <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor</hi> did: but on one of the openeſt ſtages in the world, at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and not in an age, when as formerly that <hi>Nation</hi> ſeparated it ſelf from all others, and had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with any but themſelves; but when they had ſcattered themſelves abroad and mingled with all other Nations, and alſo were forced to admit all other Nations to mingle with them by being made a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> which brought not only Souldiers and Merchants of other Nations among them, but alſo opened the gate to all others, as they ſhould think fit, to come and reſide among them: And the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being that, where all of the <hi>Jewiſh Religion</hi> worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:35444:22"/>
this conſtantly brought thither from all Nations thoſe who profeſſed it, which made a very great reſort thither from all Parts of the World, eſpecially at their three great <hi>Feſtivals.</hi> And therefore juſt after our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s ſufferings at the time of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> next following, we are told that there were then at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> 
                  <note n="(*)" place="margin">Acts 2. v. 9, 10, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, Medes,</hi> and <hi>Elamites,</hi> and the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of <hi>Meſopotamia, Cappadocia, Pontus, Aſia, Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, Libya,</hi> and <hi>Cyrene,</hi> with the Strangers of <hi>Rome, Cretes,</hi> and <hi>Arabians.</hi> So that to be ſure nothing could be hid or concealed, which was done on ſo open a ſtage of the World, and in the ſight of ſo many Nations as were then preſent upon it; nor is it poſſible if thoſe who then firſt delivered the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> to the World, had been ſuch wicked perſons, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> was, and all other <hi>Impoſtors</hi> muſt be, it could ever have eſcaped their obſervation. And if it had at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there were other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions enough given for a fuller diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very afterwards. For the holy <hi>Apoſtles</hi> after our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s death, did not confine themſelves to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Land of <hi>Judoea</hi> only, but diſperſed themſelves throughout the whole Earth, and at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> and in many other celebrated
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35444:23"/>
Cities appeared openly, teaching the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> which they had received, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Churches</hi> of thoſe whom they had converted thereto, and thereby expoſing their Lives and Actions publickly to the view of the whole World, made all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in a manner witneſſes of what they did. And <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was not ſuch an acceptable thing to the World, as to move the Men of it to be ſo candid and good-natur'd to the firſt Authors of it, as to conceal their faults and hide their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes, had there been any ſuch in them. No, it was that which was againſt the luſts and pleaſures, and the other evil courſes of this World, more, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Religion,</hi> which was ever taught therein; and this put the World as much againſt it, and all that adhered thereto; and therefore we find them to be a Party of Men not only every-where ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, but alſo every-where hated, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and perſecuted to the utmoſt. And when ſo general an Odium was riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> conſpired together therein, to be ſure there were not wanting abundance that made it their buſineſs to pry into their actions, and examine their practices with all that ſpight, unfairneſs, and ill inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35444:23"/>
of things, as is uſual in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And could they by all this ſearch, inquiry and ſtrict obſervation, have found any thing to charge upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which might caſt a blot upon the <hi>Religion</hi> which they taught, to be ſure we ſhould have heard enough of it. For thoſe, who propagated their Odium againſt this holy <hi>Religion</hi> to the next ſucceeding Ages, to that exceſſive degree, in which the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> experienced it in thoſe terrible Perſecutions which they underwent for three hundred years together, would certainly have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated therewith all the Accuſations they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble againſt thoſe who were the firſt Founders and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of it.

               <p n="3">III. And if they had been ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons, as thus to have impoſed upon us a falſe <hi>Religion</hi> for their own intereſt, both their wickedneſs and the intereſt which they drove at, muſt neceſſarily have appeared in the very contexture of the <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf, and the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi>; in which it is contained, would have as evidently proved both theſe againſt them, as the <hi>Alcoran</hi> doth againſt <hi>Mahomet</hi>? every Chapter of which yieldeth us manifeſt proofs both of the wicked affections of the Man, and the ſelf-ends which he drove at for the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of them.</p>
               <p>For, firſt, when a Man propoſeth an end of ſelf-intereſt, and invents a new <hi>Religion,</hi> and writes a new <hi>Law</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for the obtaining of it, it's impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that this End muſt appear in the Means, and the <hi>Impoſture,</hi> which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented of purpoſe to promote it, muſt diſcover what it is. For in this caſe the new <hi>Religion</hi> and the new <hi>Law</hi> muſt be calculated for this End, and be all formed and contrived in order thereto, otherwiſe it can have no efficiency for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35444:25"/>
of it, nor at all anſwer the purpoſe of the inventor for the compaſſing of what he propoſed; and if it be thus calculated, ordered and contrived for ſuch an End, that End cannot but be ſeen and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in thoſe Means. For the End and Means prove each other; that is, as the nature of the End propoſed ſhows us what Means muſt be made uſe of for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it, ſo do the nature of the Means which we uſe, diſcover what is the End which they drive at. And as far as the Means have a tendency to the End, ſo much muſt they have of that End in them; and it is not poſſible for him that uſeth the one, long to conceal the other. And therefore nothing is more obvious and common among us than by the courſes which a man takes to diſcern the end which he would have. As <hi>Mahomet</hi> invented his new <hi>Religion</hi> to promote his own ends, ſo the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in which it is contained ſufficiently proves it, there being ſcarce a leaf in that Book which doth not lay down ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which tend to the gratifying either of the ambition or the luſt of that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter who contrived it. And had the firſt Founder of our holy <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> or they who were the firſt propagators of it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35444:25"/>
any ſuch end therein, the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> in which it is written, would have as palpably ſhown it. But here we challenge all the enemies of our <hi>Faith</hi> to uſe their utmoſt skill to make any ſuch diſcovery in them. They have already gone through the ſtrict ſcrutiny of many ages, as well as of all manner of adverſaries, and none have ever yet been able to tax them herewith. For inſtead of being calculated for the intereſt of this World their whole deſign is to withdraw our hearts from it, and fix them upon the intereſt of that which is to come. And therefore the doctrines which they incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate are thoſe of mortification, repentance and ſelf-denial, which ſpeak not unto us of fighting, bloodſhed, and conqueſt, as the <hi>Alcoran</hi> doth, for the advancing of a temporal <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but that recouncing all the pomps, and vanities, and luſts of this preſent World, we live ſoberly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and godly in the preſence of him that made us, and inſtead of purſuing after the periſhable things of this life, we ſet our hearts only on thoſe Heavenly riches, which will make us great, and glorious and bleſſed for ever hereafter. For as the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not of this World, ſo neither do thoſe <hi>Books,</hi> in which are
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35444:26"/>
written the <hi>Laws</hi> of this Kingdom, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour any thing thereof. The <hi>Mammon</hi> of this World, and the Righteouſneſs which they preſcribe us, are declared in them to be totally inconſiſtent. The <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> indeed, as being under the Diſpenſation of carnal Ordinances, which were the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows only of thoſe things after to come under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> treated with Men ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thereto. And therefore we find much of this World both by way of promiſe as well as threat to be propoſed therein. But it is quite otherwiſe with the <hi>New</hi>: For in that Revelation being given to the perfecting of righteouſneſs, all things were advanced thereby from Earth to Heaven and from fleſh to ſpirit. And therefore as the whole end of it is to make men ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, ſo are we directed thereby to look only to ſpiritual and heavenly Bleſſings for the reward hereof. Had our <hi>Saviour</hi> propoſed victory, or riches, or carnal pleaſures to his followers, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> did, then indeed his <hi>Law</hi> would have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſavour'd of this World to make Men ſuſpect, that he aimed at nothing elſe thereby. But he was ſo far herefrom that inſtead of this the whole tenour of his doctrine runs the quite contrary way, we Being told of nothing elſe through the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35444:26"/>
whole <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> but of tribulations, afflictions, and perſecutions, which ſhall attend all ſuch as to this World who faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſet their hearts to become his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and the experience of all ages ſince hath ſufficiently verified the prediction. And indeed the very <hi>Religion,</hi> which he hath taught us, is of that holineſs, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of this wicked World it naturally leads us thereinto. And how then can it be ſaid, that any thing of worldly intereſt can be contained either in this <hi>Religion,</hi> or thoſe holy Books in which it is written?</p>
               <p>I cannot deny, that there are ſome Men ſo crafty and cunning in purſuing their intereſt, that it ſhall not eaſily be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Means what it is which they drive at for their End. But how great a compaſs ſoever ſuch may fetch about to the point which they aim at, or in what by and ſecret paths ſoever they make for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards it, yet if the Means, which they make uſe of, have any tendency thither, they can never be ſo totally blended, but there will always appear in them enough of the End to make the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to any accurate obſerver, and at length when the plot grows ripe for Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and the deſigner begins to offer at the putting himſelf in poſſeſſion of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35444:27"/>
what he propoſed (as all ſuch deſigners muſt at laſt) the whole ſcene muſt then be laid open, and every one will be able to ſee thereinto. And therefore if you will have it that the Holy <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> who were the firſt penners of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> were ſuch cunning and crafty men, as to be able thus art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to conceal their deſigns in thoſe Books, which you ſuppoſe they wrote of purpoſe to promote them (which cannot reaſonably be imagin'd of men of their education and condition in the World, they being all, except St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> of the meaneſt occupations among the people, and totally unlearned) yet if they contrived thoſe Books with any tendency towards thoſe deſigns (and it cannot be conceived how otherwiſe they could help forward to the obtaining of them) it is impoſſible, they could thus have paſſed thorough ſo many ages, and all the ſtrict examinations of <hi>Heathens, Jews, Atheiſts,</hi> and all other Adverſaries, who have ſo ſtrenuouſly endeavoured to overthrow their authority, and no diſcovery be made hereof. For ſuppoſing at firſt under the mask of renouncing the world they might a while conceal their deſigns for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of it (which is the utmoſt you can ſay in this caſe,) yet this could not laſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35444:27"/>
long: For if this were all they deſigned by teaching that holy <hi>Religion,</hi> and writing thoſe Books in which it is contained, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time or other they muſt have put thoſe deſigns in execution, otherwiſe they would have been in vain laid; ſometime or other they muſt have endeavoured by them to obtain what they aimed at, otherwiſe the whole projection of them would have been to no purpoſe; and if they ever did ſo (as to be ſure they would, had this been their end) then, as it happens in all other ſtratagems of the like nature, with how much artifice ſoever they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal what they intended in the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, all at laſt muſt have come out in the execution, and when they began to put them ſelves in poſſeſſion of the end they aimed at, or at leaſt made any offer towards it, the whole cheat muſt then have been unmask'd, and every one would have been able to ſee into the depth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But when did our <hi>Saviour,</hi> or any of his holy <hi>Apoſtles</hi> by vertue of any of thoſe doctrines delivered down unto us in the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> ever put themſelves in poſſeſſion of any ſuch worldly intereſt? or when did they ever make the leaſt offer in order thereto? Have any of the ancient enemies of our holy <hi>Religion</hi> (and it had bitter ones
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35444:28"/>
enough from the very beginning) ever recorded any ſuch againſt them? or have any other ever ſince from any good autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or any authority at all, ever been able to tax them herewith? or is it poſſible their names could have remained untainted of this charge amidſt ſo many Adverſaries, who have now for near Seventeen hundred years ſtood up in every age to oppoſe that holy <hi>Religion</hi> which they have delivered unto us? had they in the leaſt been guilty hereof? Nay, hath it been as much as ever ſaid of them, that they practiſed, as to this world, any otherwiſe than they taught, or ever dealt with the intereſts of it in any other manner, than totally to renounce them? or had they at all any other portion in this life, than that of perſecution, affliction, and tribulation as it is foretold in thoſe holy Books that they ſhould? And what then can be a greater madneſs, than to ſuppoſe that men ſhould lay ſuch a deep deſign, as that of inventing a new <hi>Religion,</hi> and undergo all that vaſt trouble and danger, which they did, to impoſe it on the world for the ſake of a worldly intereſt, and yet never put themſelves in poſſeſſion of that inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or ever make the leaſt offer towards it?</p>
               <p>If you ſay that the whole end of the <hi>Religion</hi> was only to gain the party, and

their turn for the gaining of a worldly intereſt would be to make their doctrine and their practice ſo monſtrouſly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere, as muſt neceſſarily have broken all into pieces, and deſtroyed the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Certainly, had they any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, they would never have thus poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Diſciples with ſuch principles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it by the <hi>Religion</hi> which they taught them; and in that they did ſo, I think nothing can be a more evident Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that they could never intend any ſuch end thereby. <hi>Mahomet</hi> knew well enough, this was not a way to carry what he deſigned, and therefore openly owned in his <hi>Religion,</hi> what he aimed at thereby, and made his <hi>Law</hi> to ſpeak for that <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Luſt,</hi> which he deſired to enjoy, and ſo when he had made his <hi>Religion</hi> to obtain, he gained by vertue thereof the whole which he projected by it, and became poſſeſſed of the <hi>Empire</hi> of all <hi>Arabia</hi> for the gratifying of his <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi> and as many Women as he pleaſed for the ſatisfying of his <hi>Luſt,</hi> which were the two Ends he drove at in the whole Impoſture. And had <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had any ſuch deſign in the <hi>Religion</hi> which they taught, they muſt in the ſame manner they made their <hi>Religion</hi> ſpeak
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35444:30"/>
for it, or elſe it could never have ſerved their purpoſe for the obtaining of it. And if their <hi>Religion</hi> had ever offer'd at any ſuch thing, it muſt neceſſarily have appeared in the Books in which it is written.</p>
               <p>And 2dly. if they had been ſo wicked, as thus to impoſe upon the World a falſe <hi>Religion</hi> for the promoting of their own intereſt, as that intereſt muſt have appear'd in the contexture of the <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf, and in thoſe Books in which it is written, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo muſt their wickedneſs. For Words and Writings being the outward expreſſions of our inward conceptions, there is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between them, that although the former may often diſguiſe the latter they can never ſo totally conceal them, but every accurate obſerver may ſtill be able through the one to penetrate into the other, and by what a man utters, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſpeech or writing, ſee what he is at the bottom, do what he can to prevent it. There are indeed ſome that can act the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> ſo cunningly, as to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the greateſt wickedneſs under words, writings and actions too that ſpeak the quite contrary. But this always is ſuch a force upon their inclinations, and ſo violent a bar upon their inward paſſions and deſires, that nature will frequently
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35444:30"/>
break through in ſpight of all art, and even ſpeak out the truth amidſt the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pretences to the contrary. And there is no <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> how cunningly ſoever he may act his part, but muſt this way very often betray himſelf. For wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being always uppermoſt in ſuch a Man's thoughts, and ever preſſing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to break forth into expreſſion, it will frequently have its vent in what that Man ſpeaks, and in what he writes, do what he can to the contrary; the care caution and cunning of no Man in this caſe being ſufficient totally to prevent it. Furthermore, there is no Man thus wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that can have that knowledge of Righteouſneſs, as thoroughly to act it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Mask with that exactneſs, as he who is truly righteous, lives and ſpeaks it in reality. His want of experience in the practice muſt in this caſe lead him into a great many miſtakes and blunders in the imitation. And this is a thing which generally happens to all that act a part, but never more than in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> in which are many Particulars ſo peculiar to the Righteous, as none are able to reach them, but thoſe only who are really ſuch. And ſuppoſing there were any that could, yet there will ever
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:35444:31"/>
be that difference between what is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and what is artificial, and between that which is true, real and ſincere, and that which is falſe, counterfeit and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical, that nothing is more eaſie than for any one, that will attend it, to diſcern the one from the other. And therefore were <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſuch perſons as this charge of <hi>Impoſture</hi> muſt ſuppoſe them to be, it's impoſſible, but that the Doctrines which they taught, and the Books which they wrote, muſt make the diſcovery; and the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> would, as a ſtanding <hi>Record</hi> againſt them in this caſe, afford a multitude of inſtances to convict them hereof. That the <hi>Alcoran</hi> doth ſo as to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more evident; a ſtrain of Rapine Bloodſhed and Luſt running thorough the whole Book, which plainly proves the <hi>Author</hi> of it to be altogether ſuch a Man, as the charge of <hi>Impoſture</hi> muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuppoſe him to be. And were the firſt Founder of our holy <hi>Religion,</hi> or the Writers of thoſe Books, in which its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are contained, ſuch Men as he, both their Doctrines and their Books would as evidently prove it againſt them. But here I muſt again challenge you, and all other the Adverſaries of our holy <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:35444:31"/>
to ſhew us any one particular in it, that can give the leaſt foundation to ſuch a charge, any one word in all the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that can afford the leaſt umbrage or pretence thereto. Let what is written in them be tried by that which is the Touchſtone of all <hi>Religions,</hi> I mean that <hi>Religion</hi> of Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which <hi>God</hi> hath written in the hearts of every one of us from the firſt Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if it varies from it in any one particular, if it preſcribes any one thing, which may in the minuteſt circumſtance thereof be contrary to its Righteouſneſs; I will then acknowledge this to be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt us, ſtrong enough to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the whole Cauſe, and make all things elſe that can be ſaid for it, totally ineffectual to its ſupport. But it is ſo far from having any ſuch flaw therein, that it is the perfecteſt <hi>Law</hi> of Righteouſneſs, which was ever yet given unto Mankind, and both in commanding of Good, as well as in forbidding of Evil, vaſtly exceeds all others that went before it, and preſcribes much more to our practice in both, than the wiſeſt and higheſt Moraliſt was ever able without it to reach in ſpeculation. For,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:35444:32"/>1ſt. As to the forbidding of Evil, it is ſo far from indulging, or in the leaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing us in any practice that ſavours hereof, that it is the only <hi>Law</hi> which is ſo perfectly broad in the prohibition, as adequately to reach whatſoever may be Evil in the practice, and without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, omiſſion, or defect, abſolutely, fully, and thoroughly forbids unto us, whatſoever may have but the leaſt taint of corruption therein; and therefore it not only reſtrains all the Overt-acts of iniquity, but alſo every imagination of the heart within, which in the leaſt tends thereto, and in its Precepts prohibits us not only the doing, or ſpeaking of Evil, but alſo the harbouring or receiving into our Minds the leaſt thought or deſire thereafter, whereby it ſo effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides againſt all manner of iniquity, that it plucks it up out of every one of us by the very roots, and ſo makes the Man pure, and clean, and holy altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out allowing the leaſt ſavour of Evil to be remaining in him; and every one of us would be thoroughly ſuch, could we be but as perfect in our Obedience to this <hi>Law,</hi> as it is perfectly given unto us. And,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:35444:32"/>2dly. As to the commanding of Good its preſcriptions are, That we imploy our Time, our Powers, and all other Talents intruſted with us to the beſt we are able, both to give Glory unto <hi>God,</hi> and alſo to ſhow Charity unto Men; and this laſt not only to our Friends, Relations, and Benefactors, but in general to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, even to our Enemies, and thoſe who deſpightfully uſe us and perſecute us; and hereby it advanceth us to that highth of perfection in all holineſs and goodneſs, as to render us like the <hi>Angels</hi> of Light in our Service unto <hi>God,</hi> and like <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in our Charity to Man. For it directs us in the ſame manner as the <hi>Angels</hi> to worſhip and ſerve our <hi>God</hi> to the utmoſt ability of out nature, and in the ſame manner as <hi>God</hi> to make our goodneſs to Men extend unto all without exception or reſerve, as far as they are capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it from us.</p>
               <p>And can any Man think it poſſible that a <hi>Religion,</hi> which ſo thoroughly and fully forbids all Evil, and in ſo high and perfect a manner preſcribes us all Good, could ever be the product of a wicked mind? The fruit is too good to proceed from ſo corrupt a root, and the effect vaſtly above the efficiency of ſuch a cauſe ever to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:35444:33"/>
it. For can it poſſibly be imagin'd, that a wicked Man could either have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to do ſo much for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that Righteouſneſs, which all his paſſions and deſires ſo violently run coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto, or if he would, that ſuch an one could ever be ſo well acquainted with all the ways thereof, as ſo exactly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them? If it be ſo difficult for ſuch an one to conceal his inclinations in his expreſſions; if it be ſo hard for him, when he vents himſelf into Words or Writings, not to let looſe ſomething in them of what he really is (as I have already ſhown) how can any copy be drawn from ſuch a Mind, but what muſt in ſome fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or other reſemble the Original, or any thing at all proceed from thence, but what muſt carry with it ſome ſavour of the iniquity thereof? Set but ſuch a one to write a Letter, and he will ſcarce be able to do it without putting ſo much of his paſſions and his temper into it, as that we may read from thence what he is, as every Man's experience may tell him, that correſponds with ſuch; and how much more then may we be aſſured will he lay himſelf open, when he hath the large ſcope of a Book to expreſs himſelf in, and eſpecially when that book is of ſuch
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35444:33"/>
a nature, as gives him the fulleſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the moſt inviting opportunity ſo to do? And what book can be more ſuch, than that which is to propoſe a new <hi>Law</hi> to Mankind? In the writing of ſuch a book, if ever, certainly the wicked Man will ſhow himſelf, and in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> did; conform his <hi>Laws</hi> to his own inclinations, and preſcribe ſuch rules of living to others, as may beſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie him in thoſe which he himſelf fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. And although he ſhould not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any ſuch thing, though he ſhould not deſign ſo to do (and it is hard to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of ſuch a Man, that he ſhould not,) yet at leaſt the prevailing bent of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the corruption of his judgment which always follows therefrom, muſt neceſſarily lead him thereinto, it being, morally ſpeaking, altogether impoſſible, but that the wicked Man muſt appear in what the wicked Man doth, and the deeds, words, and writings which proceed from ſuch an one, muſt in ſome meaſure ſavour of what he is. And therefore if there be nothing in the <hi>Law</hi> of our holy <hi>Religion</hi> (as I hope I have fully ſhown, that there is not) which can make the leaſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of any ſuch thing, nothing that can afford the leaſt pretence for ſuch a charge
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35444:34"/>
againſt it, where ſo large a ſcope is given for it; this ſufficiently proves, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the firſt <hi>Founder</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> nor thoſe who firſt wrote it in the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> in which we now have it, could poſſibly be wicked Men and conſequently not ſuch <hi>Impoſtors</hi> as you would have them to be.</p>
               <p>But here I know it will be objected, that there is no neceſſity, that all <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors</hi> ſhould be as wicked as <hi>Mahomet</hi>; and therefore though <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were no ſuch wicked Perſons, yet however they may be ſtill <hi>Impoſtors</hi> for all that. For, firſt, it hath hapned that very juſt and good Men have had recourſe to <hi>Impoſture</hi> to bring to paſs and eſtabliſh their moſt commendable deſigns, as we have an inſtance in <hi>Minos</hi> King of <hi>Crete</hi> and another in <hi>Numa</hi> King of <hi>Rome,</hi> both which, to give the greater authority to their <hi>Laws,</hi> pretended to have had them by <hi>divine Revelation.</hi> And, ſecondly, you will ſay, it's poſſible, a Man may be an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor</hi> by <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> and miſtake, and falſely impoſe things for <hi>divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> not out of a wicked deſign to deceive others, but that he is really deceived here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf. And if in theſe two Caſes a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:35444:34"/>
Man that is not wicked may be an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor,</hi> you will urge, That though <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were not wicked Men; yet this will not prove them not to have been <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> becauſe it's poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in one of theſe two Caſes they might have been ſuch.</p>
               <p>In order to the clearing of the firſt of theſe Objections, I deſire you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe Three following Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in every <hi>Religion</hi> there are theſe two Parts to be obſerved, very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from each other. 1. The <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf; And, 2. The Means whereby it is promoted, and propagated among Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the <hi>Impoſture</hi> is only in the former of theſe two, and a true <hi>Religion</hi>; or at leaſt one, that is really believed to be ſuch, is promoted by means of <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture</hi>; that is, by feigning a <hi>divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> where there is none, or by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting <hi>Miracles,</hi> or by any other ſuch means tending to deceive Men thereinto; this amounts to no higher than a <hi>pious fraud,</hi> which out of an over-hot and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate zeal ſome Men have made uſe of for the promoting of the beſt Ends.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:35444:35"/>
And ſuch Men, for the ſake of ſuch Ends, may ſtill be denominated good and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the main, how much ſoever they may have been out in making uſe of ſuch means to promote them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the <hi>Impoſture</hi> is in the End, as well as in the Means; and not only the <hi>Revelation</hi> pretended, but alſo the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> it ſelf is all falſe, counterfeit, and feigned; this amounts to ſuch an <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,</hi> as is totally wicked without any mixture of good therein. In the former Caſe, where the <hi>Impoſture</hi> is only in the Means, there is a good End deſigned, and therefore ſomething ſtill from whence the perſon uſing it may be denominated Good; but where the <hi>Impoſture</hi> is in both, it is Wickedneſs all over, without any thing at all in it to exempt him from being perfectly wicked, that maketh uſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Which Particulars being premiſed, my Anſwer to the Objection is as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I do acknowledge it to be related by <note n="(*)" rend="inter">Plato in Minoe &amp; in primo Dialogo de Legibus. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius Halicarnaſſaeus, lib. 1. Strabo, lib. 16. Valerius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, lib. 1. c. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> of good credit, that <hi>Minos</hi> King of <hi>Crete,</hi> when he firſt framed the <hi>Laws</hi> of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:35444:35"/>
his Country; to give them the greater authority, uſed to retire into a Cave on Mount <hi>Dicta,</hi> and from thence to bring them forth to his <hi>Cretans,</hi> as if they had been there delivered to him by <hi>Jupiter:</hi> And that <hi>Numa,</hi> when he founded the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> 
                  <note n="(†)" place="margin">Plutarchus in vita Numae &amp; Dionyſius Halicarnaſſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, lib. 1.</note>, practiſed the ſame art pretending to have received them from the Nymph <hi>Egeria,</hi> that ſo he might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them to be received by the <hi>Romans</hi> with the greater veneration. And by this device they both obtained there End in bringing very rude and barbarous People to ſubmit to thoſe good Orders and Rules which they preſcribed for their living civilly, peaceably, and juſtly together. But this, although it were a fraud in the Means, yet as far as it related only to a political End, belongs to another matter, and doth not at all fall within that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Religion,</hi> which we are now treating of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Numa,</hi> I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they reached not only Matters of State, but thoſe of Religion alſo, and that the whole method of the old <hi>Roman Religion</hi> was regulated and ſtated by them; but that <hi>Numa</hi> founded any new <hi>Religion,</hi> is what I utterly deny. For <hi>Numa</hi> left no other <hi>Religion</hi> behind him in <hi>Rome</hi> at
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:35444:36"/>
his death, than that very ſame <hi>Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> which he found there at his firſt coming thither to be <hi>King.</hi> For the City having been then but newly founded, and the People made up of a Collection of the refuſe and ſcum of divers Nations there gathered together, they were as much out of order in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> as in thoſe belonging to the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all that <hi>Numa</hi> did, when he came to reign over them, was to make <hi>Laws</hi> to regulate both; and therefore, as he founded ſeveral wholſome Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the orderly governing of the State, ſo alſo did he for the regular worſhipping of the <hi>Gods</hi> then acknowledged among them, without making any eſſential al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the <hi>Religion</hi> afore practiſed by them. For had he done ſo, then the <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> muſt have differed from the <hi>Religion</hi> of the other Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> which we find it did not. For they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with each other in their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as they did alſo with the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And in truth the old <hi>Roman Religion</hi> was no other, than the <hi>Greek Heatheniſm,</hi> the ſame which was practiſed in <hi>Greece,</hi> and in all thoſe Countries which were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Colonies from thence, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all <hi>Italy</hi> was at that time. And
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35444:36"/>
therefore the <hi>Romans,</hi> as well as the reſt of the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> looked on <hi>Delphos</hi> as a principal place of their worſhip with the ſame veneration that the <hi>Greeks</hi> did, and had frequent recourſe thither on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious accounts, as the <hi>Roman Hiſtories</hi> on many occaſions acquaint us. And this Religion <hi>Numa,</hi> while he lived among his <hi>Sabines,</hi> being accurately verſed in, and alſo a diligent practicer of it, on his coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> and finding the <hi>Romans</hi> all out of order in that little which they had of it (for during the Reign of <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> they minded little elſe but fighting, and therefore had not leaſure, or perchance any great regard, for this matter) he not only inſtructed them more fully in it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it was received in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations, but alſo framed ſeveral rules and conſtitutions for their more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and orderly practice of it, which did no more make the old <hi>Heatheniſm</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> to be a new <hi>Religion,</hi> than the body of <hi>Canons</hi> given us by King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, for the more orderly regulating of our Worſhip and Diſcipline, makes our <hi>Religion</hi> a new <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> Only <hi>Numa,</hi> the better to make his Conſtitutions to obtain among thoſe barbarous people for whom he made them, pretended to have
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35444:37"/>
been inſtructed in them by a divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and in this he practiſed a <hi>pious fraud,</hi> but was by no means guilty of ſuch an <hi>Impoſture</hi> as we are now treating of. For he taught them no new <hi>Religion,</hi> but only the very ſame <hi>Greek Heatheniſm,</hi> which he had received with the reſt of the People of <hi>Italy</hi> from their forefathers, and really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be that very <hi>true Religion,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>God</hi> was to be ſerved, and therefore notwithſtanding the deceit he made uſe of, he might from the end, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and which he really effected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to the civilizing of a very barbarous ſort of people, be ſtill reckoned a juſt and good Man; and to give him his due, he really was one of the moſt excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages of that age in which he lived, and firſt ſowed among the <hi>Romans</hi> the ſeeds of that vertue, with which they ſo eminently ſignalized themſelves for ſo many Ages after. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> took on them not only to be <hi>Meſſengers</hi> ſent of <hi>God,</hi> but alſo to teach a <hi>new Religion</hi> to the World; and therefore, if they were <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> they muſt be ſo in the largeſt and fulleſt ſenſe, both in reſpect of the <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf, as well as the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they promoted it. And in this caſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35444:37"/>
there could be nothing to excuſe them from being altogether as wicked as I have alledged. Where the <hi>Religion</hi> is true, or really believed ſo to be, there is a pious intention in the end, which may ſpeak ſome goodneſs in him that uſeth fraud to promote it; and ſuch a goodneſs, as great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceeds the obliquity of the fault which he committed about it; and therefore, although he cannot on the account of the Good be excuſed from the Evil (for it is always a ſcandal to <hi>Religion</hi> to be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Falſehood,) yet ſtill he muſt be reckoned more commendable from the one, than faulty from the other; and in this caſe there will ſtill be room enough left from the goodneſs of the End deſign'd, and the Piety of the intention, to denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Man good and righteous in the main, notwithſtanding the fault commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in uſing ſuch means to bring it to effect. But where the <hi>Religion</hi> is all <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery</hi> and <hi>Falſehood,</hi> as well as the means of promoting it <hi>deceit</hi> and <hi>fraud,</hi> the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture</hi> then becomes ſo totally and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly wicked without the leaſt mixture of good therein, as muſt neceſſarily denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the <hi>Authors</hi> and firſt <hi>Propagators</hi> of it to be perfectly wicked alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:35444:38"/>If you ſay, that ſuch a perfect <hi>Impoſture</hi> as this can have any good End, for the ſake whereof the <hi>Authors</hi> of it may be freed from that charge of Wickedneſs which I lay upon them, that good End muſt be either the honour of <hi>God,</hi> or the benefit of Men. But how can <hi>God</hi> be more diſhonoured, than by a <hi>falſe Religion</hi>? or how can Men be more miſchiev'd than by having the practice of it impoſed on them, whereby they muſt thus conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſhonour, and conſequently offend and loſe the favour of him that made them? An <hi>Impoſture</hi> in this caſe hath that aggravation from the object it is about, as well as from the perfection of iniquity which is in the act, that ſuppoſing it could be made productive of any good End, that good would be ſo vaſtly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balanced by the Wickedneſs of the Means that it would be of no weight in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon thereof, or at all avail to the render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe, that ſhall make uſe of it, leſs wicked than I have ſaid. But when a Man can thus far proceed in Wickedneſs towards <hi>God,</hi> as to be the Author of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant diſhonour unto him in a falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and towards Men, as to enſnare them into all that miſchief, which muſt be conſequential hereto; it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35444:38"/>
imply ſuch a thorough diſregard of both, as every good intention in reſpect of either muſt be inconſiſtent with. And therefore, if it be poſſible that ſuch a wicked <hi>Impoſture</hi> can ever be made the Means to a good End, it is ſcarce to be conceived, how they who are ſo wicked, as to be the Authors of it, could ever intend any ſuch good thereby.</p>
               <p>But further, If the <hi>Authors</hi> of ſuch an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> as we are now treating of, can be leſs wicked, than I have ſaid, on the account of any good, which you pretend they may deſign thereby, I deſire to know, among what ſort of Men you will place them, while you thus plead their excuſe. For they muſt be one of theſe three; that is, either <hi>Atheiſts, Deiſts,</hi> or <hi>Believers of an inſtituted Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. If you ſay they are <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> that word alone contains enough to prove them perfectly wicked, whatever can be ſaid to the contrary. It is indeed agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough to the Principes of this ſort of Men, that ſuch an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> as we are treating of, may laudably be made uſe of to a good End. For they hold, that all <hi>Religion</hi> is nothing elſe but a device of <hi>Politicians</hi> to keep the World in awe. But
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:35444:39"/>
if the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> be the deviſer, what inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Good can the device carry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with? None certainly towards <hi>God,</hi> ſince he utterly denies his Being; or can it in this caſe have any towards Men, ſince by denying him, for whoſe ſake it is that we are to do good to others, he caſts off there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all the reaſon and obligation, which he hath, abſtractive of his own intereſt, of doing any ſuch at all. All the good therefore that ſuch an one can aim at, muſt totally center in himſelf to advance his own enjoyments and gratifie his own luſts in all thoſe things which his corrupt affections carry him after; and to enjoy theſe without reſtraint of <hi>Laws</hi> or fear of puniſhment being that alone, which is the real and true cauſe that makes any Man deny that ſupreme and infinitely good and juſt Being, whom all things elſe prove; whoever is an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> muſt be perfectly wicked before he can be ſuch; and what is there which can, while in that impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ever give him a better character afterwards?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you ſay they are <hi>Deiſts,</hi> ſuch as you profeſs your ſelves to be, your main Principle is againſt all <hi>inſtituted Religion</hi> whatever, as if <hi>God</hi> were diſhonoured, and Man injured by every thing of this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35444:39"/>
nature practiſed among us; and can you then think, that any who are thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, can without being firſt corrupted to a great degree of Impiety, as well as Hypocriſie, ever become themſelves ſo contrary to their own Sentiments, on any pretence whatſoever, the Authors and Teachers of ſuch a <hi>Religion</hi> among us?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But if you place them among thoſe who are <hi>Believers of an inſtituted Religion,</hi> they muſt aboliſh that which they believe to be true, before they can introduce that by <hi>Impoſture</hi> which they know to be falſe. And this muſt be the caſe of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> if they were ſuch <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors</hi> as you hold them to be. For they were educated and brought up in the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Religion,</hi> which they believed to be from <hi>God,</hi> and the whole Tenour of the <hi>Religion</hi> which they taught ſuppoſeth it ſo to be; and that it was the only true way whereby <hi>God</hi> was to be worſhipped by them, till they delivered their new <hi>Revelations,</hi> which totally aboliſhed this <hi>Religion,</hi> and eſtabliſhed the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in its ſtead; and therefore if thoſe <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were not true and real, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they were, but all forged and counterfeited by them, as you ſay, they muſt aboliſh a <hi>Religion,</hi> which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35444:40"/>
to be true, to make way for that, which they knew to be falſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become wilfully and knowingly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own belief, the <hi>Authors</hi> of leading Men from ſaving Truths, into damning Errours, to the utter deſtruction of their Souls for ever; and alſo of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving <hi>God</hi> of that acceptable Worſhip, whereby he was truly honour'd according to his own appointment, to introduce in its ſtead a falſe ſuperſtition of their own deviſing, which muſt be conſtant diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto him as long as practiſed among us. And if <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were ſuch <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> as all this imports; and ſuch they muſt be, if they were <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors</hi> at all; they muſt be guilty of that impiety towards <hi>God,</hi> as well as that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice towards Men herein, as muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſuppoſe them the wickedeſt of Men before they could arrive hereto; and therefore if they were not ſuch wicked Men, this abundantly demonſtrates, they could not be ſuch <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> as you charge them to be.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond Objection, That a Man may be an <hi>Impoſtour</hi> through <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm</hi> and Miſtake, and falſely impoſe things for <hi>divine Revelations,</hi> not out of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35444:40"/>
a wicked deſign to deceive others, but that he is herein really deceived himſelf; and that therefore there is no neceſſity, that all <hi>Impoſtors</hi> ſhould be ſuch wicked perſons, as I have alledged; my Anſwer hereto is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I do acknowledge that <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> hath carried Men into very ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and extravagancies upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Religion</hi> already eſtabliſhed, as we have inſtances enough hereof in the <hi>Anabaptiſts of Germany,</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> here with us, the <note n="(*)" rend="inter">They were a ſort of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan Enthuſiaſts</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> who followed the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them in the ſame manner as the <hi>Quakers</hi> with us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were called <hi>Bateniſts</hi> from the <hi>Arabic</hi> word <hi>Baten, intus.</hi> And on this Principle did all the Villainies imaginable, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending an impulſe thereto from this Light <hi>within</hi> them.</note> 
                  <hi>Bateniſts</hi> among the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and in ſome of the <hi>Recluſes of the Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> But that <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> could ever go ſo far, as to fanſie a <hi>divine Revelation</hi> for the eſtabliſhing of a <hi>new Religion,</hi> and upon ſuch a fanſie propagate that <hi>Religion</hi> in the World, as if it came from <hi>God,</hi> is that which I cannot believe; and there is no inſtance, that I know of, that can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hereof. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. Allowing it poſſible, this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection then, as applied to the caſe in hand, muſt ſuppoſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to have been deceived by <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:35444:41"/>
into the <hi>Religion</hi> which they taught; and that therefore, although they were by no means ſuch wicked Men, as a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Impoſture</hi> muſt ſuppoſe them to be, yet ſtill they might be <hi>Impoſtors</hi> by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake; and being by <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, as to think that to come to them from <hi>God</hi> by divine Revelation, which had no other birth, but from their own wild fancies, might preach it to Men as ſuch, not out of a wicked deſign to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but that they were really herein deceived themſelves. But is it poſſible for any Man to conceive, that ſo grave, ſo ſerious, and ſo wiſely a framed <hi>Religion</hi> as <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is, could ever be the ſpawn of <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi>? Whatſoever is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of that, uſeth ever to be like the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, wild and extravagant in all its parts, often diſagreeing with all manner of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and often as much with it ſelf. But <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is in all its parts as rational as it is good, giving us the juſteſt Notions of <hi>God,</hi> the beſt Precepts of our duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Him, and the exacteſt Rules of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving honeſtly and righteouſly with each other, and hath a thorough conformity to it ſelf in every particular of it; on which account it hath been approved and admired for the excellency of its compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:35444:41"/>
and the wiſdom of its conſtitutions, even by the beſt and wiſeſt of thoſe who never ſubmitted thereto; and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways carries with it Marks and Evidences enough in the very Nature of it, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to prove it vaſtly above the power of ſuch a Cauſe ever to produce it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Founder</hi> and firſt <hi>Teachers</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> gave ſuch evidences for the truth thereof, as <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> could never produce. For can <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> raiſe the dead to life again, cure all manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and work ſuch other Miracles, as Chriſt and his Apoſtles did? Had they by <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> been miſtaken in the Doctrines which they taught, certainly <hi>God</hi> would never have wrought ſuch wonderfull Works by their hands, as give teſtimony thereto.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Several of the principal <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> depend upon ſuch matters of fact, as allow no Room for <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> to take place in them; as that of the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> from the dead, his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> into <hi>Heavem,</hi> and the <hi>deſcent</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the <hi>gift of Tongues.</hi> For in ſuch things as theſe, which Men ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and feel with their hands (as one of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did the very Wounds of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:35444:42"/>
after his <hi>Reſurrection</hi>) no <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> can ever lead Men into a miſtake. For can it poſſibly be ſaid that it was only by <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> that five hundred Men together ſaw <hi>Chriſt</hi> after he was riſen again from the dead? or that it was by <hi>Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm</hi> that his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſaw him aſcend up into <hi>Heaven</hi> from <hi>Mount Olivet</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of them all at noon-day? or that it was only by <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> that the ſame <hi>Apoſtles</hi> on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> received the <hi>gift of Tongues</hi> by the <hi>deſcent</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> upon them, ſo as to be able to converſe with all the ſeveral <hi>Nations</hi> then at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in their own Languages, without ever having learned any thing of them? To ſay that Men could any way be miſtaken in ſuch things as theſe, will be to deny the certainty of ſenſe, and overthrow the foundations of all manner of knowledge whatever. It muſt therefore be ſaid as to theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as it muſt alſo of all the <hi>Miracles</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> which give Teſtimony to the Doctrines which he taught, That his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who teſtified them unto the World, and upon the credit of them built up that <hi>Religion</hi> which they delivered unto us, did either ſee them really done as they relate, or they did not ſee them.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:35444:42"/>
If they did ſee them, no <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> could ever make them be miſtaken therein; and if they did not, they muſt be altogether as bad <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> as <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them unto us; and what but as great Wickedneſs as his could ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them ſo to do?</p>

               <p n="4">IV. The next Mark of an <hi>Impoſture</hi> is, That it muſt unavoidably contain in it ſeveral palpable falſities, whereby may be made appear the falſity of all the reſt. For whoever invents a Lye, can never do it ſo cunningly and knowingly, but ſtill there will be ſome flaw or other left in it, which will expoſe it to a diſcovery; and no Man who frames an invention, can ever ſecure it herefrom without two quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, which no Man can have; and they are, 1ſt. A thorough knowledge of all manner of Truths; And, 2dly. Such an exact memory, as can bring them all preſent to his Mind, whenever there ſhall be an occaſion. For to make the Lye paſs without contradiction, he muſt make it put on a ſeeming agreement with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Truths whatever. And how can any one do this without knowing all Truths,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35444:43"/>
and having them alſo all ready and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in his mind to conſider them in order thereto? And ſince no Man is ſufficient for this, no Man is ſufficient ſo to frame a Lye, but he will always put ſomething or other into it, which will palpably prove it to be ſo. For if there be but any one known Truth in the whole ſcheme of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with which it interferes, this muſt make the diſcovery; and there is no Man that forgeth an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> but makes himſelf liable this way to be convicted of it. This is the method whereby we diſtinguiſh ſuppoſititious <hi>Authors</hi> from thoſe which are genuine, and fabulous Writers from true <hi>Hiſtorians.</hi> For there is always ſomething in ſuch, which diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from known Truths to make the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, ſome flaw always left in ſpight of the utmoſt care and foreſight of the Forgerer, that betrays the cheat. Thus <hi>Annius</hi>'s <hi>Impoſture</hi> of his <hi>Beroſus, Manetho</hi> and <hi>Megaſthenes</hi> became detected, and ſo alſo we know the <hi>Tuſcan Antiquities</hi> of <hi>Inghiramius</hi> to be a cheat of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And by the ſame rule is it that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Salluſt, Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Suetonius</hi> for true <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> and reject others as Writers of Fables, and of no authority with us: And if we examine the <hi>Alcoran</hi> of <hi>Mahomet</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:35444:43"/>
by the ſame method, nothing can be more plainly convicted of <hi>Falſity</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture,</hi> than that muſt be by it. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in that Book he allows both the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> to be of divine authority, yet in a multitude of inſtances he differs from both: I mean not in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> for here his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is to differ; but in matters of fact and hiſtory, which if once true, muſt ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more be the ſame. They have a fetch indeed to bring him off, by ſaying that the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted thoſe holy Books, and therefore where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates things otherwiſe than they do, he doth there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore Truth, and not vary from it. But certainly this will not hold, where, by a very groſs blunder, he makes the <hi>Virgin</hi> 
                  <note n="(*)" rend="inter">
                     <hi>Alcoran, c.</hi> 3. where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that through all that <hi>Chapter</hi> in every place, where the <hi>French,</hi> and out of that the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> hath <hi>Joachim,</hi> in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Arabic</hi> it is <hi>Amran,</hi> and from thence this <hi>Chapter</hi> in the <hi>Original</hi> is called <hi>Surato'l Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Chapter of Amran.</hi> But in both theſe <hi>Tranſlations</hi> it is called the <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Joa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim.</hi> For <hi>Mahomet</hi> miſtaking the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> to be the ſame with <hi>Miriam,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Moſes,</hi> makes <hi>Amran</hi> to be her Father. But <hi>Ryer,</hi> the <hi>French Tranſlator</hi> very imprudently taking upon him to correct the <hi>Impoſtor's</hi> blunder, puts <hi>Joachim</hi> in the place of <hi>Amran,</hi> and thereby gives us a falſe Verſion, where it is very material in order to the expoſing of that <hi>Impoſture</hi> to know the true.

place of this latter, before it would have been totally aboliſhed by the former. But which moſt diſcovers his <hi>Impoſture,</hi> are the monſtrous Miſtakes, which he makes in the Moral part thereof. For he allows <hi>Fornication,</hi> and juſtifies <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> by his <hi>Law,</hi> and makes <hi>War, Rapine</hi> and <hi>Slaughter</hi> to be the main part of the <hi>Religion</hi> which he taught; which being contrary to the Nature of <hi>God,</hi> from whom he ſays he received it, and contrary to that <hi>Law</hi> of unalterable and eternal Truth, which he hath written in the hearts of all of us from the beginning; the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Principles of every Man's reaſon convict him of falſehood herein, and thereby manifeſtly prove all the reſt to be nothing elſe, but an abominable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of his own invention. And were the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as delivered to us in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> an <hi>Impoſture</hi> like this, it muſt have the ſame flaws therein, that is, many falſities in matter of fact, and more in doctrine, and all his <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> would be without Truth in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, or Verification in the Event. And when you can make out any one of theſe particulars againſt it, then we will be ready to ſay the ſame thereof that you do, That all is <hi>Cheat</hi> and <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:35444:44"/>
no credit or faith is any longer to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thereto.</p>
               <p>And 1ſt. as to the matters of fact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> whoever yet convicted any one of them of falſehood? or whoever as much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured it in the age when the Books were firſt written, when the falſehood might have been beſt proved, had there been any ſuch in them, and the doing hereof would have ſo much ſerved the deſigns of thoſe bitter enemies of the Chriſtian Cauſe, who from the firſt did the utmoſt they could to ſuppreſs it? What Relations of matters of fact paſs uncontra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and uncontroll'd in the Age in which they were tranſacted, and among thoſe who thought themſelves greatly concerned to have them believed falſe, this muſt be taken for an undeniable argument of their truth. And this Argument the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> hath on its ſide in its fulleſt ſtrength. For the Books were written and publiſhed in the very age in which the things related in them were done, yet no one then ever contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted or convicted of falſehood any one paſſage in them, though <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> had from the very beginning the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of all other <hi>Religions</hi> in moſt bitter enmity
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:35444:45"/>
againſt it, who would have been moſt ready and glad ſo to do, could they have found but the leaſt pretence for it. And had any of thoſe Relations been falſe, there were then means enough undeniably to have convicted them of it. For thoſe things, which are related of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> are not there ſaid to have been done in Corners where none where preſent to contradict them, but upon the open Stage of the World, and many of them in the ſight of thouſands; and therefore had they not been really done, or done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than related, there could not have wanted witneſſes enough to make proof hereof. And moſt certainly thoſe who ſo bitterly oppoſed <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> from the firſt would have found them out, and made uſe of their Teſtimonies to the utmoſt for the overthrowing of the Cauſe they ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently oppoſed, and had they done ſo to be ſure we ſhould have had thoſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the mouths of all its enemies ever ſince. For they would have yielded them the ſtrongeſt and the moſt prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing argument they could poſſibly have urged againſt it.

And that this was not done, when there was ſuch bitter oppoſition againſt the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> from the firſt propagating of it, and it would have been ſo ſtrong an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt it, can be aſſigned to no other cauſe, but that the things related were ſo evidently and manifeſtly true, as not to afford the leaſt pretence for the contradicting of them. But this is not all we have to ſay in the caſe. For it hath not only hapned that none of thoſe matters of fact have ever been contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,

or proved falſe by any of the firſt enemies of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> who were beſt able to have done ſo, had there been that <hi>Impoſture</hi> in them which you alledge; but on the contrary many of them have been allowed true, and atteſted by them. For two of the moſt ſurprizing particulars related in the Goſpels are confirmed by the Teſtimony of <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers, I mean the <hi>murder of the Innocents</hi> by <hi>Herod</hi> at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and the <hi>wonderfull Eclipſe of the Sun,</hi> which hapned at the death of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> contrary to the nature of a Solar <hi>Eclipſe,</hi> when the <hi>Moon</hi> was in the Full. <note n="(*)" place="margin">Saturnal, lib. 2. c. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Macrobius</hi> tells us of the former and <note n="(†)" place="margin">Vide Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicon Euſebii, &amp; Origenis contra Celſum librum ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, &amp; Tract. ad Matthaeum 35.</note> 
                  <hi>Phlegon Trallianus</hi> of the latter. And that which is the moſt important part of all, and bears the greateſt Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the truth of the whole was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and acknowledged on all hands both by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> even in their bittereſt oppoſition againſt the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Cauſe, I mean the account which is given in thoſe ſacred Books of the <hi>Miracles</hi> of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> For both of them have yielded to the truth hereof; only the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, that he wrought them by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> or the ſacred Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> ſtolen by him out of the <hi>Temple</hi> (which the ridiculouſneſs of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35444:46"/>
Fable they relate concerning it ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confutes) and the <hi>Heathens</hi> by <hi>Magic Art.</hi> And therefore <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> and <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles</hi> finding no other way to overthrow the authority, which thoſe Miracles gave his <hi>Religion,</hi> confronted againſt him the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Apollonius Tyanoeus,</hi> whom they pretend by the ſame Art of <hi>Magic</hi> to have done as wonderfull things, and by this means endeavoured at leaſt to invalidate thoſe miraculous Works of his, which they could not deny. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. As to the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> the truth of their event in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular proves the truth of him that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted them. For, did he not come from <hi>God,</hi> how could he have this wonderfull Knowledge, as thus to fore-tell things to come? Were he not of the Secrets of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> how could he ſo certainly have fore-ſhown, what in after-times he would bring to paſs? If it were only by gueſs that he did ſo, how poſſibly could all things ſo exactly fall out in the event, that nothing ſhould in the leaſt happen other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as he predicted, eſpecially ſince as to moſt of them it cannot be as much as ſaid, that there was any place for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſagacity, or the leaſt probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture to help him to any fore-ſight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:35444:47"/>
For how improbable was it that the <hi>Religion</hi> which he taught ſhould, againſt the bent of the whole World, have made ſo great and ſpeedy progreſs therein, as he fore-told that it ſhould? or that ſuch inſtruments, as he imployed in this work, a company of poor, ignorant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible <hi>Fiſhermen,</hi> ſhould ever have been able to have effected it? without the extraordinary Providence of <hi>God</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruling the hearts, as well as the power of Men; a thing in the ordinary courſe of humane affairs, ſo unlikely to ſucceed, could never have been brought to paſs; or could our <hi>Saviour</hi> have any manner of ground from the nature of the thing, ſo much as to gueſs at ſo ſtrange an event, and therefore could never have ſo punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally foretold it; but that being ſent of God to begin this work, he foreknew all that he would do for the perfecting of it. And the ſame is to be ſaid of what he further predicted of this <hi>holy Religion</hi> as to its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance among us to the end of the World, of the calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, and the rejecting of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of the great calamities which ſhould attend that people (as accordingly they have through all Ages ſince) and particularly of that great and terrible calamity, which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35444:47"/>
was to fall upon them in the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and accordingly hapned about forty years after; which he ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly fore-told, not only as to the time (for he ſaid it ſhould be before that <note n="(*)" place="margin">Matt. c. 24. v. 34:</note> generation ſhould paſs away) but alſo as to all other the moſt conſiderable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it, that nothing can be a more exact and perfect Comment on the 24th. Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſages in the <hi>Goſpels,</hi> where this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal deſtruction is fore-told, than that <hi>Hiſtory of Joſephus,</hi> which gives us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how it was brought to paſs. And that part of the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> which relates to the final deſtruction of the <hi>Temple,</hi> fore-telling, <hi>that one ſtone ſhould not be left upon another,</hi> hath been ſo exactly verified, that notwithſtanding ſeveral attempts, which have been made for the re-edifying of it, it could never be effected; no, not as far as the laying of one ſtone upon another in order thereto, even to this day. And when <hi>Julian the Apoſtate,</hi> out of deſign to confront this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and give the lie thereto, imployed both the Power and the Treaſure of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> for the rebuilding of it, <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in an extraordinary manner to make good what he had predicted to be the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed

For the truth whereof, I will not referr you to the Teſtimony of <hi>Socrates Scholaſticus, Sozomen, Chryſoſtom,</hi> or any other of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writers, who relate it, but to one whom you cannot ſuſpect of ſerving the intereſt of the <hi>Chriſtian Cauſe</hi> herein, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much an Adverſary thereto as any of you; I mean <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> who was an <hi>Heathen</hi> Writer, and then ſerved under <hi>Julian</hi> in his Wars in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> at the ſame time when this hapned. His Words concerning it (<hi>lib.</hi> 23. <hi>c.</hi> 1.) are as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth— <hi>Ambitioſum quondam apud Hieroſoly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam Templum, quod post multa &amp; interne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civa certamina, obſidente Veſpaſiano poſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Tito, oegre est expugnatum, inſtaurare ſumtibus excogitabat immodicis, negotium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que maturandum Alypio dederat Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chenſi, qui olim Britannos curaverat pro Proefectis.

                     <hi>Julian</hi> having a deſign to re-build with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary expence the Temple of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> formerly a very ſtately Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture (which, firſt <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and after <hi>Titus,</hi> laying ſiege thereto, was, after many bloody Conflicts, at length, with difficulty, taken and deſtroyed) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the care of the buſineſs to <hi>Aly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> the <hi>Antiochian,</hi> who formerly had been <hi>Proprefect</hi> of <hi>Britanny,</hi> to be with all ſpeed expedited by him. But while <hi>Alypius</hi> was diligently preſſing on the Work, and the Governour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince helping him therein, dreadfull Balls of Fire breaking forth from the Foundations of the Building, did by their frequent Eruptions make the Place unacceſſible, the Workmen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral times deſtroyed by the Fire, as they went to their Labour; and by this means the Element ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting as of purpoſe to obſtruct it, the Work ceaſed.</q> And it hath never ſince been again attempted, even to this day, nor is there now left the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of its Ruins, to ſhow ſo much as the Place where this Temple once ſtood? or have thoſe who Travel thither, any other Mark whereby to find it out, but the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35444:49"/>
                  <hi>Mahometan Moſque,</hi> erected on the ſame Plat by <hi>Omar,</hi> the ſecond Succeſſour of <hi>Mahomet</hi>; and which hath now continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for above a thouſand years to pollute with the worſt of Superſtitions, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ground on which it was formerly built. Had our <hi>Saviour</hi> been an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> and foretold all theſe things without any knowledge of the Counſels of him who was to bring them to paſs, ſomething certainly muſt have hapned in the event of ſo many particulars, as would have given the Lye to his Predictions, and you the opportunity of convicting him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by plain matters of fact falling out contrary to them. And although this could not have been done at firſt, but poſſibly ſuch Prophecies as theſe might have impoſed for a while on the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of many; yet we that have paſſed the time of their completion, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be deceived thereby; but by the Event muſt plainly know, Whether what he foretold be true or falſe, and from thence have enough to make a judgment alſo of the truth of him that predicted them. And therefore had our <hi>Saviour,</hi> like <hi>Mahomet,</hi> invented his <hi>Religion</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the World; if he intended it ſhould have continued, he muſt have taken the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35444:49"/>
ſame courſe that <hi>Mahomet</hi> did, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ventured at any <hi>Prophecy</hi> at all, that he might not be confuted by the Event, and ſo loſe his whole deſign. If you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That our <hi>Saviour</hi> fore-told future Events after the ſame manner, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſaid he wrought his <hi>Miracles</hi>; that is, by the <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Devils,</hi> you aſcribe that knowledge to the wicked one which is above his reach to attain unto. The <hi>Oracles,</hi> which he gave in the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Temples,</hi> only prove him able to cheat Mankind with dubious and dark Anſwers, but never clearly to inform them of the future Purpoſes of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</hi> And indeed, how ever can it be imagin'd, that ſuch an accurſed one, as he that is caſt off at the greateſt diſtance from <hi>God</hi> (who alone governs all the Works of his Creation, and by the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Providence orders every Event that attends them) ſhould ever be ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to his Counſels, as to be able to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know any thing that he determines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them; unleſs it be, where he himſelf is imployed as an Executioner of his Juſtice to bring it to paſs. But all our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Predictions</hi> were clear and full, fore-telling things to come, in the ſame manner as <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> relate them when
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35444:50"/>
paſt, without ambiguity in the words, or perplexity in the matter, or the leaſt room left for evaſion of deceit in them, and were all as exactly fulfill'd in their appointed time; and we have the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the ſpreading of it through all the <hi>Nations</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> the rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the calamities of thoſe people in a continued Exile, and the total deſtruction of their <hi>Temple,</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evidences hereof, even to this day. And how could all this have ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo exactly, according to his Word, but that he was that holy and bleſſed One, who had the <hi>Counſels</hi> of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> communicated unto him, and was ſent by Him on purpoſe to declare unto us as many of them, as were neceſſary for us to know, in order to the attaining of everlaſting life. And,</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. As to the <hi>Doctrinal part of his Religion</hi>; what can be more worthy of <hi>God,</hi> than the notions which he gives us of him, and the worſhip which he directs us to render upon him? and what more worthy of us and perfecting of our nature than that Law for the conduct of our lives which he hath delivered unto us? and what can be more holy, pure, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than the Precepts thereof? Here the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:35444:50"/>
ſublimity and vaſt extent of the matter give ſcope large enough for the wiſeſt of Men to bewilder and loſe themſelves in errour and miſtake, and yet convince us but of any one ſuch in the whole extent of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and that alone ſhall be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove the <hi>Impoſture,</hi> you would charge it with, and I will yield you all you would have for the ſake thereof. But it is ſo far herefrom, that I durſt make you your ſelves the judges, whether it delivers any thing elſe unto us of the nature and excellencies of God, but what the reaſon of every man (although barely that alone through that cloud of ignorance and errour which the Fall hath over-ſpread us with, could never clearly make the diſcovery) muſt now, when thus diſcover'd, ever juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy and admire? whether it preſcribes us any one particular relating to his worſhip, but what is moſt agreeable to thoſe his excellencies? and whether the Precepts and Laws therein laid down unto us for the governing of our lives and converſations be any other, than what do all correſpond ſo exactly with every thing which the rational dictates of our nature direct us to, that they take them all in without omiſſion or defect, and improve them to the utmoſt with errour or miſtake in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:35444:51"/>
the leaſt circumſtance that belongs unto them? If you ſay, that all this might be attained to by humane wiſdom and ſtudy; I anſwer, ſuppoſing it could, yet looking on our <hi>Saviour</hi> barely as a Man, and his holy <hi>Apoſtles</hi> without any other aſſiſtance, than that of their own natural endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, how poſſibly could they reach ſo high? To do this requires that vaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of knowledge in all the things of Nature, Law, and Morality, as it is not poſſible to conceive Men of their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and low imployments in the World could ever have arrived unto. If you examine what other Men have done by humane wiſdom and ſtudy only, you will find thoſe of the moſt elevated <hi>Genius</hi> and ſublimeſt Underſtanding could never with their utmoſt induſtry and ſearch attain unto what you ſuppoſe herein, or that the higheſt knowledge of Men could ever reach that perfection in any of the particulars above-mentioned, in which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> delivers them unto us. For what blunders and abſurdities do the wiſeſt of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> lay down concerning the <hi>Deity</hi>? what errours and follies have they taught and practiſed concerning his worſhip? and what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes have thoſe, who exalted <hi>Morality</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:35444:51"/>
to the higheſt pitch among Men, made therein? <hi>Plato</hi> in his Common-wealth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the common uſe of Women. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> aſſerts it to be natural and juſt for the <hi>Greeks</hi> to make War upon the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> for no other reaſon but that they are ſo, and both he and <hi>Tully</hi> place Revenge among their virtues. And whoever had vaſter capacities for humane knowledge, or ever went higher by the abilities of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon and underſtanding only in the ſearch thereof, than thoſe Men? Yet ſtill being no more than Men, they could not avoid putting ſomething of the infirmities of Man even into that, wherein they made appear their higheſt perfections, errour, miſtake and ignorance being ſo natural unto all of us, that neither the greateſt, the wiſeſt, nor the beſt among us can be totally free therefrom. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> no other help in the Doctrines which they taught, but that which is humane, they muſt alſo in like manner have put that which is humane thereinto, and the infirmities, miſtakes, and errours that attend humane nature would have appeared in all that they delivered unto us. But the doctrines, which they taught, and the Books in which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them unto us being ſo totally free from all ſuch errours and miſtakes, as
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35444:52"/>
I have already ſhown that they are, this directs us to look higher than Man for the <hi>Founder</hi> of this <hi>Holy Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Original Author</hi> of thoſe <hi>Books</hi> in which it is contained, and neceſſarily prove, that only he who is infinite in knowledge and infinite in all other perfections could thus give us a <hi>Law</hi> ſo exactly like himſelf, thoroughly perfect in the whole, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly true in every particular thereof.</p>

For the end of ſuch being to deceive, craft and fraud are the means whereby it is to be effected. In this caſe a <hi>Lye</hi> muſt be made to go for a Truth, and an appearance for a reality; and to compaſs this a great deal of Art muſt be made uſe of, both to dreſs up the Cheat, that it may appear to be what it pretends, and alſo to caſt ſuch a miſt before the eyes of Men, that they may not ſee it to be otherwiſe, and that eſpecially where the cheat is an <hi>Impoſture</hi> in <hi>Religion.</hi> For whoever comes with a <hi>new Religion</hi> to be propoſed to the World, muſt find all men ſo far prejudiced and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:35444:52"/>
pre-poſſeſſed againſt it, as they are affected to the <hi>old one</hi> they have before profeſſed, and therefore when Men are educated, or any otherwiſe fixed and ſetled in a <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (and all mankind are in ſome or other) they are not apt eaſily to forego it, but it muſt be ſomething more than ordinary that muſt bring them over to another contrary thereto. When the <hi>new Religion</hi> really comes from <hi>God</hi> (as the <hi>Jewiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> firſt, and after the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> did) it brings its <hi>Credentials</hi> with it, the power of <hi>Miracles</hi> to make way for its reception. For when Men find the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency of <hi>God</hi> working with it, they have from thence ſufficient evidence given them from whom it comes, and there is need of no other means to induce them to believe, but that the <hi>Religion,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> doth in ſuch a manner own and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, muſt be from him. But where there is no ſuch power accompanying the <hi>new Religion</hi> to gain credit thereto, the defect hereof muſt be made up by ſomewhat elſe to draw over the people to its belief, and this is that which muſt put all <hi>Impoſtors</hi> upon craft and fraud in order to the compaſſing of their ends. But that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> made uſe of no ſuch craft or fraud to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Men into the belief of that <hi>holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:35444:53"/>
which they taught, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could be no ſuch <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> will be beſt made appear by going over all thoſe ways of craft and fraud, which <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſerved himſelf of, and, by ſhowing you that none of them can poſſibly be ſaid to have been practiſed by any of them. For <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> being one of the craftieſt cheats that ever ſet up to impoſe a <hi>falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> on mankind, and the only perſon that ever carried on his wicked deſign with ſucceſs, you may be ſure he left no Art or Device unpractiſed, which could poſſibly be made uſe of with any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for the compaſſing of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by proving unto you that none of thoſe methods of craft and fraud, which were made uſe of for the firſt propagating of <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> were ever practiſed in the firſt preaching of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> I ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prove that no craft or fraud at all which is anyway practicable on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, can ever be charged thereupon. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Mahomet</hi> made uſe of all manner of inſinuation both with rich and poor for the gaining of their affection, thereby to gain them to his <hi>Impoſture</hi> alſo. But our <hi>Saviour Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did quite the contrary, freely convincing all Men of their ſins without having regard to any thing elſe but the faithfull diſcharge of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:35444:53"/>
the <hi>Miſſion</hi> on which they were ſent; which inſtead of reconciling men to their perſons, provoked the World againſt them, and they ſufficiently experienced it from the ill uſage which they found therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the eaſier to draw over the <hi>Arabians</hi> to his Party, indulged them by his <hi>Law</hi> in all thoſe paſſions and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections, which he found them ſtrongly addicted to, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Luſt</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> which thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> above all the <hi>Nations</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> were by their natural inclinations moſt violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried after, and therefore he allows them a plurality of wives, and a free uſe of their female ſlaves for the ſatisfying of their <hi>Luſt,</hi> and makes it a main part of his <hi>Religion</hi> for them to fight againſt, plunder, and deſtroy all that would not be of it. But <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> allowed no ſuch practices, but ſtrictly prohibited all manner of ſin, how much ſoever in reputation among men, even to the forbidding of many things till then allowed and held lawfull among thoſe who where called God's own people, and therefore inſtead of ſeeking the favour of Men by indulging them in their luſts and ſinfull practices, they laid a much ſtricter reſtraint upon them than was ever done before.</p>

But <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any regard to the pleaſing of Men, aboliſhed both the <hi>Temple</hi> and the <hi>Law,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo bigotted unto, and alſo the total worſhipping of <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> without being at all influenced to the contrary by that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant fondneſs, which he knew the whole World had then for them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> when he found any of his new <hi>Laws</hi> not ſo well to ſerve his return, craftily ſhifted the <hi>ſcene,</hi> and brought them about to his purpoſe by ſuch altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as would beſt ſuit therewith; and therefore when his making his <hi>Kebla</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did not ſo well pleaſe his Countrymen, he turned it about again towards <hi>Mecca,</hi> and order'd all his <hi>Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi> thither, as in the time of their <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi> And the like changes he made in many other particulars according as he found his intereſt required. And this is that which every <hi>Impoſtor</hi> muſt do. For intereſt being the end, which all ſuch
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35444:54"/>
aim at, it is impoſſible that they can ſo well lay their deſigns in order to it, but that emerging changes in the one will frequently require changes in the other alſo. But <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> never made the leaſt alteration in any of the doctrines or precepts which he delivered, but what he firſt taught both he and his Diſciples immutably perſiſted in without at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding how violently all the intereſts of the World ran counter againſt them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And what can be a more certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that none ſuch was the bottom which they were built upon.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Mahomet</hi> under pain of death forbad all manner of <hi>Diſputes</hi> about his <hi>Religion,</hi> and nothing could be a wiſer courſe to prevent its follies and abſurdities from being detected and expoſed. For they being ſuch as could never ſtand the trial of a rational Examination, they muſt all have ſoon been exploded, had every man been allowed the free uſe of his reaſon to inquire into them. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> direct the quite contrary courſe. For our <hi>Saviour</hi> bids the <hi>Jews</hi> ſearch the <hi>Scriptures</hi> for the trial of thoſe truths which he taught them, (<hi>John</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 39.) And the <hi>Noble Beroeans</hi> are commended, that they did ſo, before they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35444:55"/>
thoſe doctrines of the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> which were preached unto them, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 11. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us this general rule, firſt to prove or try all things, and then to hold faſt that only which we find to be good, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 21. It is only errour and falſehood that deſires to ſhelter it ſelf in the dark, and dares not expoſe it ſelf to an open view and trial. But Truth being always certain of its own ſtability, makes uſe of no art to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it ſelf, but dares venture it ſelf abroad on its own foundation only, and boldly offers it ſelf to every Man's ſearch; and the more it is ſifted and examined into, the more bright and refulgent will it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appear. And ſince <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> from the firſt ever took this courſe, (as it ſtill doth where-ever purely profeſſed) and inſtead of prohibiting <hi>Diſputes</hi> about it, invites all Men to ſearch and examine thereinto; this ſufficiently argues, how certain the firſt <hi>Teachers</hi> of it were of its Truth, and that no cheat or <hi>Impoſture</hi> could ever be intended thereby.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Mahomet</hi> made choice of a People firſt to propagate his <hi>Impoſture</hi> among, who were of all Men moſt fitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; and that on two accounts: 1. Becauſe of the indifferency which they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35444:55"/>
were then grown to as to any <hi>Religion</hi> at all; And, 2. Becauſe of the great ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance they were in of all manner of Learning at that time, when he firſt vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Forgeries among them, there being then but only one Man among all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Mecca</hi> that could either write or read. For who are more fit to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on, than the ignorant? and who can be more eaſie to receive a <hi>new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> than thoſe who are not prepoſſeſſed with any other to prejudice them againſt it? The <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who, next <hi>Mahomet,</hi> have the greateſt claim to <hi>Impoſture,</hi> as to thoſe errours which they teach, very well underſtand how ſuch a Cauſe is to be ſerved by both theſe Particulars; and therefore make it their buſineſs, as much as they can, to keep their own People in ignorance, and pervert all thoſe they call <hi>Hereticks</hi> to <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Infidelity,</hi> that ſo having no <hi>Religion</hi> at all, they may be the better prepared again to receive theirs. And that there are ſo many <hi>Atheiſts</hi> now among us, it is too well known, how much it is owing to this their <hi>Helliſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice</hi> againſt us. But all was quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as to thoſe whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> firſt preached our <hi>holy Religion</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> did not chuſe ſuch ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35444:56"/>
Times to come among us in, or a People ſo indifferent in <hi>Religion,</hi> firſt to manifeſt himſelf unto. For the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo far from being weary of that <hi>Religion,</hi> which they had ſo long profeſſed, when he firſt appeared in his <hi>Miſſion</hi> among them, that they were then grown into the contrary extreme; a very extravagant bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gottry and ſuperſtition concerning it; ſo that nothing was more difficult, than to withdraw them from it; nor could any thing be more offenſive to them, than an offer tending thereto; and ſo it continues with them, even to this day. And the caſe was not much otherwiſe as to all the reſt of Mankind; the <hi>Gentiles</hi> being then grown almoſt as tenacious of their <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> of their <hi>Law</hi>; and <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> was in that Age among both at the higheſt pitch, that ever it was in the World; and conſequently, Men were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leſs diſpoſed, than at that time, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a <hi>new Religion,</hi> or ever better able to defend their <hi>old.</hi> And therefore had <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> been an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> it could never have eſcaped in ſuch an Age as that a full detection, or ever have been able to have born up againſt it; ſuch inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Heads and piercing Wits, as were then in the World, would have ſifted it
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:35444:56"/>
to the bottom, dived into its deepeſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and unravell'd and laid open the whole Plot, and the prejudiced World would immediately have cruſhed it to pieces thereon, ſo that it ſhould never more have appeared among Mankind. But the truth of our <hi>holy Religion</hi> was ſuch, that it boldly offered it ſelf to this trial; and it ſeems to have choſen ſuch an Age as this, firſt to come into the World of purpoſe to undergo it, that ſo it might be the better juſtified there by. And juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it it was; for although it were oppoſed by the utmoſt Violence of the prejudiced World, they could get no ground of it; though it were through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined and diligently ſearched into by the acuteſt and ſubtileſt Wits of thoſe Ages in which it firſt appeared, they could never diſcover any fraud, or make out the leaſt flaw therein; but in ſpight of both it triumphed by its own naked Truth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over all manner of oppoſition, and by <hi>God</hi>'s Mercy continues ſtill ſo to do, even to this day. That a cheat and a fraud in a thing of this nature ſhould be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on Men totally ignorant and illiterate, or that ſuch as they, when void of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Religion, (as the Men of <hi>Mecca</hi> for the moſt part were when <hi>Mahomet</hi> began
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:35444:57"/>
his <hi>Impoſture</hi> among them) ſhould be eaſie to imbrace a new one, is no hard matter to conceive; but that an <hi>Impoſture</hi> ſhould be received, and obtain ſuch prevalency over Men in ſo learned and diſcerning an Age, as that wherein <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the World, or that they who where then ſo zealouſly addicted to the <hi>Religion,</hi> they had been educated in, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould ever have been induced to forſake it for a new one, founded only on a cheat and fraud, is what morally ſpeaking, we may very well rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Mahomet</hi> offered at no <hi>Prophecies,</hi> that he might not run the hazard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confuted by the Event. But <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> delivered many clear and plain <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,</hi> ſeveral of which reſpected that very Age in which he lived, and were all in their proper time as plainly verified by the completion of them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Mahomet</hi> offered at no <hi>Miracles</hi> in publick, although continually called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and provoked to it by his oppoſers. For not being able to work any true ones or would not hazard himſelf to a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by thoſe which were Counterfeit. And therefore all thoſe things which he would have go for <hi>Miracles</hi>; that is, his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35444:57"/>
Converſe with the <hi>Angel Gabriel,</hi> his <hi>Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Armies</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> that helped him in his <hi>Battles,</hi> are only related by him as things acted behind the Curtain, of which there was no other witneſs but himſelf alone, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there could be no witneſs on the other ſide ever to contradict them. But <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> having the real power of working <hi>Miracles</hi> did them openly in the ſight of thouſands, where all manner of opportunity was given to every ſpectator to examine into them, and try whether they were true or no; and therefore had there been any cheat or fraud in them, it is not poſſible to conceive how they ſhould have eſcaped a diſcovery. And yet no ſuch diſcovery could ever be made, which was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing an argument of their truth and reality, that even the bittereſt enemies of our <hi>holy Religion</hi> from the firſt yielded in this particular, and both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> allowed all thoſe miraculous Works, which are related of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> in the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> to have been really and truly wrought by them, as hath been afore-obſerved. And indeed the evidence was too manifeſt to be denied, ſince thoſe very blind that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:35444:58"/>
their ſight, thoſe dumb that were enabled to ſpeak, thoſe deaf that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to their hearing, thoſe lame that were made to walk, and thoſe dead that were raiſed again to life, lived many years after to be as ſtanding Monuments of the truth of thoſe things, which no one could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict. And therefore the Oppoſers of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> have all along rather choſen to invalidate the authority of thoſe <hi>Miracles,</hi> than deny the truth and reality of them.</p>
               <p>For they allowing the matters of fact object that there are other Powers lower than the divine, that are able to bring them to paſs; and therefore, although thoſe Works were wrought, they do not yet prove either the perſons or the doctrines which they taught to come from <hi>God,</hi> and conſequently can give no ſuch evidence, as that which we inſiſt upon from them for the truth of that <hi>Religion</hi> which we profeſs; That others by <hi>Magick Art</hi> have done the ſame things; That the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themſelves tell us ſo of <hi>Jannes,</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi>; and profane Writers of <hi>Apollonius Tyanoeus, Apuleius,</hi> and others; that both <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> knew this very well, and therefore forewarn'd their <hi>Diſciples</hi> againſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:35444:58"/>
it, telling them that <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> ſhould ariſe, who ſhould ſhow ſigns and wonders to deceive, if poſſible, the very Elect; and that they ſhould take care not to hearken to them. And therefore, ſay they, if ſigns and wonders can be wrought by <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> how can they be evidences for the true? Or how can we at all rely upon them for the verifying of any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which they deliver unto us? Or if thoſe <hi>Miracles,</hi> which were wrought by them who are ſent of God, be only true <hi>Miracles,</hi> and all others falſe ones, how ſhall we diſtinguiſh the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo as by them to diſcern, whether the doctrines be of <hi>God</hi> or no?</p>
               <p>But theſe Difficulties will be eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the <hi>Miracles</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as they are allowed to be truly wrought by them, ſo alſo will they as truly prove the Doctrines which they taught to come from <hi>God,</hi> if you will but conſider theſe following Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Miracles</hi> are works done, which are ſtrange and amazing to us, as being brought to paſs out of the ordinary road, and in a manner which we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; and theſe are of two ſorts:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:35444:59"/>
1. Such as exceed only the Power of Man to effect them; and theſe we call <hi>ſigns</hi> or <hi>wonders</hi>; And, 2. Such as exceed the Power of any created Being whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and theſe only are properly <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Where-ever ſuch <hi>Miracles</hi> are wrought, as are of this laſt ſort, <hi>God</hi> alone muſt be the <hi>Author</hi> of them; and therefore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſuch are found, they manifeſtly prove the Power of <hi>God</hi> co-operating with the Perſons, at whoſe word they are done; and with whomſoever it doth thus co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate, it neceſſarily demonſtrates their <hi>Miſſion</hi> from him, and puts ſuch an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Seal to the Truth of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which they teach, as cannot be denied.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Where-ever a creating Power is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the effect produced, or the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Laws of Nature are altered, there it is certain none but <hi>God</hi> himſelf can be the <hi>Author</hi> of the Work done. For he alone is able to create; and he having created all things according to his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and given to each their proper Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Operations, he allows none but himſelf to alter the Natures of them, or change that Courſe which he hath put them into.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:35444:59"/>4. But within the Laws and Powers of <hi>Nature,</hi> there are abundance of things, which exceed the Power of Man to effect, and therefore ſeem as <hi>Miracles</hi> to us, which may be produced by other created Beings, and theſe are <hi>evil ſpirits</hi> as well as <hi>good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. To the producing of theſe effects, <hi>evil ſpirits</hi> as well as <hi>good</hi> are enabled two manner of Ways: 1. By their greater Knowledge of the Powers of Nature; And, 2. By the greater Agency which they have to apply them to effect. For,</p>
               <p n="6">6. There are a multitude of things in <hi>Nature,</hi> that thoſe <hi>Spirits</hi> know the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of, which we do not. For their Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of knowing are vaſtly above ours, as not working by the dull Tools of Earth and Clay as we do, and their Experience exceedingly greater, as having known the Works of <hi>God</hi> from the beginning, and by long Obſervation pried deep into the Secrets of them. If a <hi>Chymiſt</hi> or a <hi>Mathematician,</hi> by his Skill in the Powers of <hi>Nature,</hi> can do many things, which to the ignorant and unlearned ſhall ſeem as <hi>Miracles,</hi> (as we often find) how much more can thoſe knowing <hi>Spirits</hi> do ſo, whoſe Knowledge of the Powers of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:35444:60"/>
is vaſtly more above all ours put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, than the higheſt and perfecteſt of ours is above that of the moſt ignorant that lives among us. But,</p>
               <p n="7">7. As thoſe <hi>Spirits</hi> have a vaſtly grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Knowledge of the Powers of <hi>Nature</hi> than we can have, ſo alſo have they a vaſtly greater Power to apply them to effect. For they are of a much greater agility in their motion, of a much finer ſubſtance to penetrate into things, and actuate them into operation; and alſo of a much ſtronger agency or power to work than we have, and which, no doubt, they are endowed more or leſs with, according to the different orders and degrees in which <hi>God</hi> hath created them; and by both theſe together, that is, their greater Knowledge of natural Cauſes, and their greater Power to apply them to effect, can they do a great many things within <hi>Nature</hi>'s limits, which exceed all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Men to effect, and ſeem as mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and wonderfull unto us, when ever brought to paſs.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Good Spirits</hi> never work thoſe <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> but in ſubſerviency to the divine Will, as they are neceſſary for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe things which <hi>God</hi> hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by their <hi>Miniſtry</hi> to bring to paſs.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:35444:60"/>
And to them thoſe <hi>Miracles</hi> mentioned in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which exceed not the Power of ſuch created Beings, may be referred as the immediate Authors of them; it not being likely that <hi>God</hi> would interpoſe his immediate Power, excepting only in ſuch caſes, as where there was need of it. For why ſhould the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf put his hand to that work, which may as well be diſcharged by the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>?</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> having in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the ſame Knowledge of Natural Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as the <hi>good,</hi> and the like Power to bring them to effect can alſo work the like <hi>wonders,</hi> and by <hi>God</hi> are often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo to do, both for the trial of Men, and alſo for other good Cauſes, which to him of his infinite Wiſdom ſeem fitting; and we have a plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it in the Caſe of <hi>Job.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> have not only this Power of working the like Wonders, which <hi>Good Spirits</hi> do, but alſo another, which <hi>Good Spirits</hi> will never make uſe of; that is, by juggle, deluſion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to imitate thoſe true and proper <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> which none but <hi>God</hi> himſelf can really effect. And thus by the deluſion of the <hi>Devil</hi> was a cheat put upon <hi>Saul</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:35444:61"/>
in the raiſing of <hi>Samuel</hi> to him from the dead. For really, to raiſe <hi>Samuel</hi> from the dead, none but <hi>God</hi> could, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that appearance, which <hi>Saul</hi> ſaw, was no more than a falſe appearance, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the <hi>Devil</hi> to put a cheat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion upon him. And of this ſame ſort may we reckon the <hi>Miracles</hi> which <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> wrought in imitation of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For to turn a Rod into a Serpent and Water into Blood, or to cauſe Frogs to come up upon the Land (in which three Particulars they did the ſame thing by their inchantments, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did by the hand of <hi>God</hi>) are Works, which, if really done, require the creating Power to bring them to effect, which none but <hi>God</hi> hath; and therefore in this caſe the <hi>Devil</hi> acted for them, not by his effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but only by his deluding Power. And ſuch <hi>Miracles</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; i. e. <hi>Lying or falſe Miracles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.9.</note> 
                  <hi>which are not really wrought, but only made ſo to appear by the juggle and deluſion of Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Thoſe cheats and deluſions of the <hi>Devil,</hi> whereby he imitates the true and real <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which he cannot work, are only in tranſient Effects, like thoſe of Jugglers upon a Stage, never in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:35444:61"/>
ſuch as are laſting and permanent. And where the Effect is totally tranſient, <hi>God</hi>'s Works are often ſo far above the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Imitation, that even in theſe there will be ſtill a multitude of Particulars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he can have no power, as much as by juggle or deluſion, to do any thing like unto them.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Whatſoever <hi>ſigns</hi> or <hi>wonders</hi> are wrought by <hi>Magicians</hi> or <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> muſt be referred to one of theſe two Heads; that is, that they are either the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Works, or the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Deluſions: and the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which tell us of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> working ſuch <hi>ſigns</hi> and <hi>wonders,</hi> do in many places re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr them hereto.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Thoſe <hi>ſigns</hi> or <hi>wonders</hi> which are really wrought by the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> are to be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe which are wrought by the Power of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> or <hi>Good Spirits,</hi> by theſe following Marks: 1. That <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Good Spirits</hi> never work thoſe <hi>Wonders,</hi> but in ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency to the Will of <hi>God,</hi> for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of Truth and Righteouſneſs; but the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> only for the promoting of Errour and Wickedneſs. 2. <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Good Spirits</hi> never co-operate in the production of thoſe <hi>Wonders</hi> with
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:35444:62"/>
any <hi>Prophet</hi> or <hi>Teacher,</hi> but ſuch only as being ſent of <hi>God,</hi> are good and righteous Perſons; but the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> only with ſuch, as not being ſent of <hi>God,</hi> are Evil like themſelves. 3. <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Good Spirits</hi> never exert their Power to work theſe <hi>Wonders,</hi> but in things ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and grave, whereby either the Good of Men or the Honour of <hi>God</hi> is promoted; but the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> do it moſtly in things miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous both to <hi>God</hi>'s Honour and Man's Good, or elſe in ſuch trivial and fooliſh matters, as are beneath <hi>God</hi> or his holy <hi>Angels</hi> to be concerned in. And by the ſame Marks alſo may we diſtinguiſh <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Miracles</hi> from the <hi>Devils Juggles,</hi> and thoſe wonderfull Works which the Hand of the <hi>Almighty</hi> really effecteth from thoſe falſe Appearances, which the <hi>Devil</hi> makes in imitation of them to put a cheat and a deluſion upon us. Which Particulars being premiſed, the Anſwer to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Objections will be as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We do acknowledge that abundance of very wonderfull Works may be effected by Powers lower than the divine, and that not only by <hi>Good Spirits,</hi> but alſo by <hi>Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:35444:62"/>2. That therefore ſuch Works alone are never ſufficient proof of a divine <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> unleſs corroborated by ſuch concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring circumſtances, as prove them not to be from <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> but only from <hi>Good.</hi>

For he proſecuted with War all that would not ſubmit thereto, and made it no leſs than Death for any to gain-ſay it, or as much as raiſe the leaſt diſpute againſt any of the Doctrines of it.

But <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of making uſe of any ſuch force to eſtabliſh the Religion which they taught, had all the force and powers of the World in oppoſition againſt it, and yet in ſpight of the World it at length prevailed over the World by the dint of its own truth only, and after having ſtood the aſſault of all manner of perſecutions, as well as other oppoſitions for three hundred years together carried the victory over the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt of its enemies, and made the greateſt of them, even the <hi>Roman Emperours</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſubmit thereto, and all this while it had ſharpned againſt it, not only the Sword of the Superiour Powers, but alſo the tongues of the ſlanderers, and the wits of all the learned of thoſe times. But how much ſoever it was oppreſſed by the firſt of theſe, blackned by the ſecond, and ſifted and ſearched into by the laſt, it ſtood all theſe Trials without loſing any thing thereby, but at laſt came out of them all, like Gold out of the Furnace, ſtill of the ſame weight, fineneſs, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35444:69"/>
purity, without receiving from that fire, which conſumeth all things elſe, the leaſt waſt or diminution thereof. Had it been falſe and owed its Original only to Deceit and <hi>Impoſture,</hi> it would have needed all thoſe means of Violence for its eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſupport, but ſince it thus ſtood not only without them, but alſo in ſpight of them; when all armed on the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſide for three Centuries together in bitter oppoſition againſt it, what greater argument can we have for the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? For can you think that <hi>Falſhood</hi> and <hi>Impoſture</hi> could ever have held out with ſuch ſteady and unſhaken conſtancy for ſo many years, as <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> thus did? or that it is poſſible for any ſort of Men ſo long to have born all this for the ſake of a <hi>Lye? Falſhood</hi> can have no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſuch a Conſtancy, or <hi>Impoſture</hi> any reaſon to engage Men thereto. The intereſt of this World is ever the bottom and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all ſuch <hi>Forgeries</hi>; and therefore, as ſoon as puniſhments, and perſecutions make it to be no Man's intereſt to be for them, they ever fall of themſelves for want of that foundation on which they afore-ſtood. But <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> having come into the World contrary to all the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of it, and in its very infancy thus ſtood
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:35444:69"/>
the ſhock of all the powers thereof engaged in perſecution againſt it, as I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; and not only ſo, but alſo proſpered and became eſtabliſhed in the midſt of the hotteſt aſſaults thereof, this plainly ſhows that it had another kind of founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on which it was built, a foundation of Truth and Righteouſneſs, and not only ſo, but a foundation that was laid and fix'd in ſuch a manner by the hand of <hi>God</hi> himſelf as never to be ſhaken. For what truth of it ſelf alone could ever have made its way into the World in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> did, or ever have gained againſt all the powers thereof ſuch a prevalency over it without ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary aſſiſtance conducting and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it therein? The ſtrongeſt Truths we know are cruſh'd by ſuch means of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as that encountred with, and even firſt principles themſelves have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by them. And therefore that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ſhould thus enter the World, and thus from its firſt Entry bear up againſt ſuch long and terrible Trials of perſecution and oppreſſion, as it met with, without the leaſt flinching under them, muſt be owing to ſomewhat more than its own bare truth. And what but the hand of <hi>God</hi> himſelf backing and ſtrengthening it
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:35444:70"/>
in the conflict, could be ſufficient to give it ſuch a victory therein? For that a few poor <hi>Fiſhermen,</hi> the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of a <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Maſter,</hi> ſhould without power, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or reputation, or any other of the intereſts, or favours of the world on their ſide, be able to introduce a <hi>new Religion</hi> into the World directly oppoſite to all the intereſts, pleaſures, and prevailing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of it, as <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> then was, and that this <hi>Religion</hi> in ſpight of all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, cunning, malice, and learning of the World joyned together in moſt fierce oppoſition, and bitter perſecution againſt it for three hundred years together ſhould not only bear up, but alſo at length pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over the World, and ſubject the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt powers therein to the obedience of its Laws is an event ſo ſtrange and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and morally ſpeaking ſo far above the poſſibility of all ordinary means to bring it to paſs, as plainly manifeſteth the extraordinary working of <hi>God</hi> himſelf therein. And for my part had <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> no other <hi>Miracle</hi> to bear witneſs thereto, this alone would be <hi>Miracle</hi> enough to me ſufficiently to convince me of the truth thereof. At leaſt ſince it thus entered into the World, and thus became eſtabliſhed in it, it muſt be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35444:70"/>
to be ſo far differing from an <hi>Impoſture</hi> in that method of violence which that needs for its eſtabliſhment, as to be totally oppoſite thereto, and in this particular (as I hope I have ſhown of all the reſt) not to have the leaſt mark or character thereof.</p>
               <p>And thus far having laid before you all the obvious marks of <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that none of them can belong to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> I hope what hath been ſaid will ſufficiently inferr the concluſion, which I have undertaken to make out unto you, That our <hi>Holy Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> cannot be ſuch an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> as you would have it to be, but really is that ſacred truth of <hi>God,</hi> which you are all bound to believe.</p>
               <p>It is too common with mankind to frame their judgments according to their inclinations, and upon very ſlight grounds haſtily to run away with Idea's of things, when they correſpond with the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bent of their affections, which, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever put into a true light before them, muſt all appear to be falſe and wrong taken. And this I reckon to be your caſe.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:35444:71"/>
on very weak grounds to believe it ſo to be. And that you may be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſo dangerous and deſtructive an errour, I have endeavoured in the eaſieſt and moſt familiar manner I could think of, to put this buſineſs in a true light before you. 1. By letting you ſee what an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture</hi> is in that true picture, which I have drawn of it in the Life of him who was really and truly ſuch an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> as you would have <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be; And, 2. By examining into the Marks and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties which naturally belong to every ſuch <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and ſhowing of each of them that they cannot belong to that <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religion</hi> which we profeſs. And I hope, when you have conſidered all this tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly, you will ſee how much you have been deceived in thoſe Opinions, which you have ſo precipitately given up your ſelves unto.</p>
               <p>You cannot but be ſenſible how great the ſtreſs is, which we lay on this matter, and how very ill your caſe muſt be, if we are in the right and you in the wrong; and therefore the thing is of ſufficient im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to deſerve your moſt ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and that in ſuch a manner as to make you lay aſide all thoſe ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs prejudices and wrong byaſſes which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:35444:71"/>
may obſtruct an impartial inquiry; and if you will be pleaſed, for the ſake of your own Souls, to do thus much, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to leave the ſucceſs of what I now offer unto you, to <hi>God</hi>'s grace, and your own judgments.</p>
               <p>As to the particular reaſons which you may alledge for your disbelief of our <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtian Religion,</hi> whether they be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections drawn againſt it either from <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, Philoſophy,</hi> or the <hi>inconſiſtencies</hi> which you imagine you find in the Books of holy Writ in which it is delivered down unto us, it is not my purpoſe now to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Diſputes with you about them. That which I at preſent purpoſe, is not ſo much to conſider thoſe <hi>premiſſes,</hi> as the <hi>concluſion</hi> which you pretend to draw here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, That <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> muſt therefore be an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and from the nature of ſuch an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and the nature of our <hi>holy Chriſtian Religion</hi> laid in a true light, and compared together with each other to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence unto you the inconſiſtency of this Charge; and if what I have now ſaid can be of any force to let you in to a clear ſight of this matter, it will be totally needleſs for me to meddle any further. For all thoſe Objections, which you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have been the particular Reaſons
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:35444:72"/>
of your Infidelity, have been already abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly anſwered and confuted by others. But the opinion which you have conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> having ſo far pre-poſſeſſed your judgment, as to influence it againſt all things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that can be propoſed unto you, it will be in vain to offer any thing farther as to thoſe particulars, till this prejudice be removed; and were it once removed, what hath already been ſaid in anſwer to them, will be abundantly ſufficient to give you full ſatisfaction. Although this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod may ſeem illogical thus to aſſault the <hi>Concluſion</hi> without medling with the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes</hi> from which you pretend to have deduced it; yet it is no other, than what you your ſelves have neceſſitated me unto by taking up the <hi>Concluſion</hi> firſt, and the <hi>Premiſſes</hi> afterward. Had you indeed firſt began with thoſe Reaſons which you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for your Infidelity, and been really by the conviction of them led into this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,</hi> That <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> it would then have been proper and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that I ſhould have begun there too, and no otherwiſe have endeavoured to overthrow the <hi>Concluſion,</hi> but by firſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the <hi>Premiſſes</hi> from whence you deduced it. But ſince it is well known
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:35444:72"/>
that the <hi>Concluſion</hi> hath been of greater force with the moſt of you to make you aſſent to the <hi>Premiſſes,</hi> than the <hi>Premiſſes</hi> to prove the <hi>Concluſion</hi>; and it is only the fond conceit you have taken up in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with ill-company or worſe inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> muſt be an <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,</hi> that hath made any of thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeem ſo concluſive with you, which are brought to prove it; this makes it neceſſary for me to begin my endeavours for your conviction at that ſame point, where you firſt began your Infidelity, and to attack the <hi>Concluſion</hi> in the firſt place, before any ſucceſs can be expected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſetting you right as to any thing elſe. For as long as you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bent out of a meer fondneſs for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity to hold <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to be an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture,</hi> this will make every Argument ſeem ſtrong to you that is brought to prove it, and every Solution inſufficient which is given thereto, and render all means for your Conviction utterly ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual unto you. And therefore this being in truth the firſt Errour which hath influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced your Mind to all the reſt, this muſt be firſt removed; and if what I have ſaid can be of any force in order hereto, by letting you ſee how much you have been
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:35444:73"/>
miſtaken herein, this I hope will remove that prejudice, which hath hindered you from ſeeing the ſtrength of thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which have been already offered for your Conviction as to all other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of that Infidelity which you have given up your ſelves unto, and make you clearly diſcern how much you have been miſtaken in them alſo, and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the means of delivering your Souls from that terrible danger, which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them unto; the accompliſhing of which is the whole End, Scope, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Diſcourſe, which I now offer unto you.</p>
               <p>But here perchance it may be asked, and I think it reaſonable to give you ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction herein, Why I have ſet forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you an <hi>Impoſture</hi> by ſo foul a picture as that of <hi>Mahomet?</hi> And to this I have theſe two Anſwers to return? 1. Becauſe I have none other to do it by, <hi>Mahomet</hi> being the only <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> who could ever prevail ſo far, as to eſtabliſh his <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and make it a ſtanding <hi>Religion</hi> in the World; and had it not gone ſo far, it could not have been ſuch an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> as you would have <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to be, or at all fit to be compared with it in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument now before us. And, 2dly. How
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:35444:73"/>
foul ſoever the Picture of <hi>Mahomet</hi> may be, we have no reaſon from the nature of the thing ever to imagine that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Impoſtor</hi> can have a fairer, till you bring us an inſtance thereof. And theſe two I hope may be ſufficient to clear me from acting any way unfairly in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as if I had made choice of the Life of ſo wicked a perſon as <hi>Mahomet</hi> therein to picture out an <hi>Impoſture</hi> unto you only to make it appear in the fouleſt dreſs it is capable of, the better to advantage thereby that Cauſe which I handle.</p>
               <p>But to the firſt of theſe Anſwers, I fore-ſee this Objection will be made: If <hi>Mahomet</hi> be the only <hi>Impoſtor</hi> that ever eſtabliſhed his <hi>Impoſture</hi> in the World, how then hath it come to paſs, that there have been ſo many falſe <hi>Religions</hi> among Mankind? To which I reply, Not by <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s was, and ſuch as <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> muſt be, if it be ſuch an <hi>Impoſture</hi> as your charge againſt it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, but by corruptions inſenſibly grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on from that <hi>Religion,</hi> which was firſt true. The firſt <hi>Religion</hi> which <hi>God</hi> gave unto Man was that <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> which he imprinted on his very Nature, when he firſt created him, and as much of that as eſcaped that ruin, with which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:35444:74"/>
the fall overwhelm'd him, was that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>God</hi> was worſhipped and ſerved by him afterwards; only with this addition, That whereas Man in his innocency ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to <hi>God</hi> immediately of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone, and in his own Name, he could never after his fall from it have any more acceſs unto him, but through a <hi>Mediator; God</hi>'s infinite purity and greatneſs on the one hand, and Man's infinite guilt and vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the other after that fatal miſcariage of our firſt parents did put them at ſo vaſt a diſtance the one from the other, that in the nature of the thing there could be no other way thenceforth of maintaining any Communion between them; and therefore had not this way been found out again to bring Man to God, he muſt totally have been eſtranged from him for ever after. But God of his infinite Mercy having reſolved not thus to caſt us off, he appointed us a <hi>Mediator</hi> as ſoon as we had fallen, and promiſed to ſend him in his appointed time to take our Nature upon him, and therein pay down that price of redemption for us; by virtue whereof, his <hi>Mediation</hi> ſhould always be ſufficient to obtain mercy, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and acceptance for us. And this is that which was meant by <hi>God</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s promiſing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:35444:74"/>
immediately after the Fall, that <hi>the ſeed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpent's head</hi>; which being farther explained by After-<hi>Revelations</hi>; the whole <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>God's people</hi> after that was to offer up their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip unto him through hope in this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> and all the <hi>Idolatry, Polytheiſm,</hi> and other <hi>falſe Worſhips</hi> which after aroſe in the <hi>Heathen World,</hi> were all by ſuch corrupt deviations therefrom, as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions of Men, the unfaithfull way of tranſmitting <hi>divine Revelations</hi> by <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> only, and the decay of all divine Knowledge, occaſioned thereby, in proceſs of time, introduced among them. For when Mankind began to encreaſe after the Flood, and they were taught from <hi>Noah</hi> their Forefather thus to worſhip <hi>God</hi> through hope in a <hi>Mediator,</hi> as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe divine Truths which he delivered to them began to decay, and Superſtition to encreaſe among them they began to determine themſelves to ſuch <hi>Mediators,</hi> as their own imaginations led them to phancy, and ſome choſe <hi>Angels</hi> and others Men deceaſed for this office; and in proceſs of time erected <hi>Temples</hi> and Images unto them, and honoured them with divine Worſhip in order to render them the more helpfull and beneficent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:35444:75"/>
them. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> or <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> who were the firſt formed State after the Flood, looked on <hi>Angels</hi> to have been the <hi>Mediator's God</hi> had appointed, through whom they were to come unto him; and for this reaſon directed their Worſhip to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Planets,</hi> which they fanſied to be the Habitations <note n="(a)" rend="inter">Hence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſeems to have had his Doctrine of the <hi>Intelligences</hi> moving the <hi>Spheres</hi>; and <hi>Plato</hi> that which he taught of the Stars being living Bodies. For it was the Opinion of the Ancient <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> as it is of the <hi>Sabii</hi> now, who are deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from them. That there was in each Star an <hi>Angel</hi> in the ſame manner as our Souls are in our Bodies, and that the Stars are animated by theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and hence have all their Motion, and alſo that influence which they are ſuppoſed to have over this World, and for this reaſon was it that they worſhipped them.</note>, where thoſe <hi>Angels</hi> dwelt; and alſo erected <hi>Images</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, into which they reckoned their influence and divine power did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, &amp; remain with them, when thoſe Luminaries themſelves were ſet and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared in their Horizon, ſo that their notion was to make their addreſſes thro' the <hi>Images</hi> to the <hi>Planets,</hi> and through the <hi>Planets</hi> to the <hi>Angels</hi> that dwelt in them, and thro' the <hi>Angels</hi> to <hi>God</hi> himſelf, whom they acknowledged to be the one ſupreme Being, who was the <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of all things. And this was the firſt <hi>Idolatrous Religion,</hi> which was eſtabliſhed in the World, and long prevailed over a great part of it, and is ſtill preſerved in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:35444:75"/>
the <hi>Eaſt</hi> among the <hi>Sect</hi> of the <hi>Sabians</hi> even to this day. But the <hi>Perſians</hi> not liking the Worſhip of the <hi>Planets</hi> by <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> would endure no other <hi>ſymbol</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent thoſe <hi>glorious Luminaries</hi> by, but <hi>fire</hi> only, of which they reckoned them to be Conſtituted; and therefore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they prevailed, they deſtroyed all <hi>Images</hi> out of the <hi>Temples,</hi> and placed fire in their ſtead: And from hence the <hi>Magi</hi> or the <hi>Worſhippers of Fire</hi> had their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. But from their having one <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol,</hi> they ſpeedily came to the aſſerting but of one <hi>Deity</hi> repreſented by it, which they would have to be <hi>Light,</hi> and that of the mixture of this and <hi>Darkneſs</hi> all things in this World were compounded; that <hi>Light</hi> was the cauſe or principle of all Good, and <hi>Darkneſs</hi> the cauſe or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all Evil; and therefore under the <hi>Symbol</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> they worſhipped <hi>Light</hi> as their <hi>God,</hi> but deteſted <hi>Darkneſs</hi> in the ſame manner as we do the <hi>Devil.</hi> And from hence <hi>Manes</hi> the <hi>Heretick</hi> had his two Principles, which he would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> But above both theſe they acknowledged a <hi>ſupreme God,</hi> in reſpect of whom their <hi>God Light,</hi> was but an inferior <hi>Deity,</hi> or a <hi>God Mediator,</hi> by whom they were to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:35444:76"/>
have acceſs unto him. And this <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> obtained through all <hi>Perſia,</hi> and other Parts on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> of it, and doth there remain even unto this day among the <hi>Perſees</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> and the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Kerman,</hi> on the <hi>Southern Coaſt</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> But the Practice of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> or <hi>Chaldeans</hi> in worſhipping their <hi>Gods Mediators</hi> by <hi>Images</hi> obtained in all the <hi>Weſtern Parts</hi> of the World. For they holding, that they were to have acceſs to <hi>God</hi> through <hi>Angels</hi> as their <hi>Mediators,</hi> and to the <hi>Angels</hi> through the <hi>Planets,</hi> and to the <hi>Planets</hi> through the <hi>Images</hi> which they erected to them, did give to thoſe <hi>Images</hi> the names of the <hi>Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ets,</hi> and under thoſe names paid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip unto them, which <hi>Idolatry</hi> paſſing from <hi>Babylon</hi> or <hi>Chaldea</hi> into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,</hi> and from thence to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians</hi> was by them carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Greece,</hi> and from thence ſpread it ſelf into all Parts on this <hi>Weſtern-ſide</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> as that of the <hi>Magi</hi> did on the <hi>Eaſtern.</hi> For the chief <hi>Gods</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> as well as the Names by which they were called, came from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and were no more than the <hi>Images,</hi> by which the <hi>Babylonians</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhipped the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and other <hi>Planet</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:35444:76"/>
with the Names of thoſe <hi>Planets</hi> given unto them. Afterward indeed they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their number other <hi>Deities</hi> alſo, which were originally either ſome of the fixed Stars, or elſe the Souls of Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, as of <hi>Bel</hi> or <hi>Belus</hi> among the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians, Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi> among the <hi>Arabians, Orus</hi> and <hi>Oſiris</hi> among the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, Aeſculapius</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi> among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romulus</hi> or <hi>Quirinus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans.</hi> For it early began a Cuſtom among all the Worſhippers of <hi>Images,</hi> as well <hi>Greeks</hi> as <hi>Barbarians</hi> to Deify Men departed, reckoning thoſe who lived juſtly and righteouſly, or had made themſelves eminent by any great and worthy Actions in this life, to have thoſe habitations allotted them in the <hi>Heavens</hi> above, where they were in a Capacity to be <hi>Mediators</hi> to <hi>God</hi> for them; and therefore they offered divine Worſhip to them as ſuch. And this was it that gave occaſion to ſo many <hi>Apotheo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s or <hi>Deifications</hi> among them, and ſo vaſtly encreaſed the number of their <hi>Gods</hi> in all the <hi>Idolatrous Parts</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and alſo the various Methods of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition whereby they paid their Worſhip unto them. Yet they all ſtill held to their notion of <hi>one ſupreme God,</hi> and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:35444:77"/>
all the others to be no more than <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Mediators</hi> under him. And this <hi>one God,</hi> whom they held to be made of none, and to be the Maker or Father of all things elſe that are, was among the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> of old (as ſtill among the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> who are the remainder of them) called <hi>Deus Deorum,</hi> and among the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabs, Allah Taal,</hi> i. e. <hi>the high or ſupreme God</hi>; and agreeable hereto, among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was there alſo their <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; i. e. <hi>One ſupreme God, who was the Father both of Gods and Men.</hi> And thus far in anſwer to your Queſtion have I given you an account how all the <hi>falſe Religions</hi> in the <hi>Heathen World</hi> had their Original; and herein I have been the longer for the ſake of two Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are obvious for you to make hereon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>Mediator</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> was that which did run through all the <hi>Religions</hi> that ever were in the World, to the Coming of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and was the Fundamental Principle which prevailed in every one of them as to all the Worſhip which was practiſed in them, which could no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe become ſo univerſal among Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind but by a <hi>Tradition</hi> as univerſally
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:35444:77"/>
delivered unto them. And what can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account both for this <hi>Tradition,</hi> and alſo the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality</hi> of it, than what is delivered unto us in <hi>Scripture</hi> of our being deſcended from one common Parent, who on his Fall from the favour of <hi>God</hi> having had this promiſe of a <hi>Mediator</hi> made unto him, through whom we might be again reconciled unto him, tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to all his poſterity.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> That the miſtakes and errours about the Worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice we owe unto him, which Men are apt to run into, when left to the conduct of their own light only, are monſtrous and endleſs, and therefore evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the neceſſity of <hi>divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> For if <hi>God</hi> doth expect from us an account of our Actions, it is neceſſary he ſhould give us a <hi>Law</hi> for the rule of them; and if the <hi>Law</hi> of our Reaſon alone be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient for this (as from the continual errours and endleſs abſurdities, which mankind, when left to themſelves, have ever hitherto run into, it doth evidently appear that it is:) this demonſtrably proves the neceſſity of another to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply its defect, and that in our caſe we muſt have a <hi>Revealed Religion</hi> as well as a <hi>Natural,</hi> or elſe we can have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:35444:78"/>
certain Knowledge of the Will of <hi>God,</hi> or any of thoſe duties of Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which we are to perform towards him. And if this proves the Neceſſity of ſuch a <hi>Revealed Religion</hi> (as I think it undeniably muſt to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves <hi>God</hi> will account with us for what we do;) all that I have farther to offer is, That you would thoroughly examine and conſider that holy <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> which we profeſs, and compare it with all the other <hi>Religions,</hi> that are in the World; and if it do not appear vaſtly above them all, the worthieſt of God for him to give unto us, and the worthieſt of us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and that not only in reſpect of the honour given to him, but alſo of the improvement and perfection brought to our own Nature thereby, I will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that you ſhall then perſiſt to believe it an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and, as ſuch, reject it for ever.</p>

He was for above ſixty Years a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Editor of learned and uſefull Books.
