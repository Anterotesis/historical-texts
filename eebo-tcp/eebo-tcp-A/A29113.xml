            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Apello Caeſarem</hi>: or an Appeal to Caeſar in the vindication of a little book printed ſome years ſince in the time our troubles: intiuled, <hi>A Preſent for CAESAR.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TRue it is there was ſuch a little book printed ſome years ſince; which I do own, in which I find no fault but in the Title, and ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementall language here &amp; there to mitigate the ferocity of that Tyrant with whom in it I had to do, but he was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious enough to diſcover the hook that lay hidden under that bait which then I offerd him, 'tis true the Title was <hi>A preſent for Caeſar</hi>: and we have no Caeſar but the King. but ſurely in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prudence, thus much you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to policy, that he which had a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to deal withall may give him good
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47233:4"/>
words. neither did the giving of him a better ſtyle then he deſerv'd make him really ſuch as that ſtyle did import, nor conclude him that gave it him (onely by way of alluſion) to eſteem him ſo. There are evidences enough to conclude the contrary in the judgment of all them that know me, for if ſervices or ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, by ſequeſtrations, plunderings, frequent impriſonments, menaces and threatnings reaching even to life it ſelfe may ſpeak a man loyall, there are enough that ſpeak loud enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare me ſuch. For my zeal in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Cauſe, and ſervice, it is well known I forſook all to follow him through thick and thin, and did ſo to the very laſt, and being a ſworn Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain was one of thoſe that did help to carry the Arke before him in the time of his greateſt troubles and dangers, and was afflicted in many of thoſe things wherein he was afflicted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:47233:4"/>But to paſſe by theſe praevious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations mentioned only for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of prejudice. I paſs from the title of the book to the book it ſelfe, and of that I ſhal give a very brief yet a full and clear account under theſe two heads.
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>By ſhowing what the very ſum, ſubject, &amp; ſubſtance of that book was.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>What my aymes, ends, &amp; reaches were in penning it at that time.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
The former of theſe is obvious to any man at the firſt view, which ſees or reads it, but in the latter I was more reſerved they were known only to my ſelfe, and very few more whom I acquainted with them, Dr. <hi>Healing</hi> for one which knew more of that which lay in the bottome of that deſign then any other, and with whom I had frequent conference about it. All theſe things I ſhall now unrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle &amp; unfold, which done &amp; rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, then <hi>Apello Caeſarem, Apello
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47233:5"/>
Eccleſiam, Apello Populum, Apello Omnes,</hi> I ſhall appeal to all the world whether that book or he that pen'd it, deſerves that blame which ſome imagine, nay I ſhall riſe ſo high in my vindication as not onely to free it from blame, but I challenge thanks for it from all <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially the Clergy which eſpecially blame me for it, and if his Majeſty ſhall be pleaſ'd to take hold of ſome diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that there I make, and which here in this vindication I muſt neceſſarily hint at, I hope his Majeſty will think I do him no diſſervice in it neither.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt then of theſe 2 heads, The very ſum and ſubſtance of the book lies in theſe 2 propoſals, and thoſe two concerning only Churchmen &amp; Church livings all which at that time were in the hands and poſſeſſion of the intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Clergy which had invaded and uſurped upon the Church as their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47233:5"/>
had done upon the civill State. concerning them therefore I made theſe two propoſals.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, I did propoſe that all thoſe that did poſſeſſe ſequeſtred livings, and had peaceably enjoyed them two years or above might be required to pay their firſt-fruits, the Tyrant having ſet forth a cruell Proclamation, that we ſhould never return to our livings more, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe our Miniſteriall Function elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My ſecond propoſall was this, I did propoſe that they and all others which ſhould hereafter be prefer'd to Eccleſiaſticall dignities or promotions might pay their firſt-fruits according to the ſtatute of the 26 of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth whereby it is required that they ſhould pay them in according to the full value of ſuch dignities, benefices, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, and not as they ſtand parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47233:6"/>
rated in the King's book by an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent inquiry made above 100 years ſince which gives them not in to the 5, 6, nor ſcarce to the 8 part of the true value throughout the land, this done, <hi>I</hi> did demonſtrate what a great improvement this would make of the firſt-fruit Office, for the firſt-fruits being thus improved the tenths likewiſe muſt improve pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, according to which the tenths would come to near as much as the firſt-fruits now come to, and the firſt-fruits to 6 or 8 times as much as they now are. This is the very ſum and ſubſtance of that little peice for which I am blamed, all the reſt is but as the mantling to the armes, or filling to the limbs, or comment upon the Text ſhewing the aequity, legality, reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, &amp; ſeaſonableneſs of ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall at that time.</p>
            <p>But there was much more lay at the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47233:6"/>
bottom which was not obvious to every eye, neither was it my deſire that he ſhould know them, therefore in the next place I will ſhew what were my ends, aymes, and reaches in thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, and they were theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt was (clear contrary to the apprehenſions of thoſe that charge me in this matter) the very preſervation of Tythes, Churches, Colledges, all which were now in a tottering condition, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly ſhaken, undermined, and near unto ruine. for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That grand Impoſtor had propoſ'd in the Houſe that they would conſider of ſome way whereby a Miniſtry might be maintained in <hi>England</hi> without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of tithes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Moſt of the Counties in <hi>England</hi> had petitioned againſt the payment of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The people did generally deny the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47233:7"/>
payment of them, inſomuch as one of the Judges returning homeward from his Circuit told me that in that circuit they had near 100 Cauſes came before them in the eaſe of non-payment of Tithes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s countrey-men, <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Vavaſor Powell</hi> had begun an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment tending hereunto in <hi>Wales,</hi> by ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering all the Tithes &amp; Church-profit<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> into a common treaſury, that is to ſay their own purſes &amp; their adhaerents, and inſtead of a ſtanding Clergy to ſet up an itinerant Miniſtry.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That muſhrum Parliament called together by Cromwel's Writ, or Letters, wherein <hi>Rowſe</hi> was the Speaker had made a praevious Act in order to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, whereby they made the Miniſtry uſeles throughout the Land, for as for preaching they tolerated a liberty to preach who would, for the Sacrament
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47233:7"/>
of Baptiſme, that there was no need of that till children were come to 14 or 15 years of age, and then they might make a Miniſter among themſelves to do that office, for the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, that was in a manner clear ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of the Church, for marrying that was committed to the Juſtices of peace, for burying let one pitt another, the dead bury the dead, not ſo much as the Regiſter book but it was taken out of our hands, and the Pariſh was to chuſe a Regiſter to keep it, ſo the Miniſtry was made uſeles throughout the land, and what was this but a praevious Act proceeding from Anabaptiſticall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in order to that ſacrilegious and wicked deſign of overthrowing the whole body of Tythes, the Churches an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient patrimony, and with it the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry it ſelfe, (for the perpetuity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were firſt ordeyned) together
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47233:8"/>
with the Schooles of the prophets, the Churches wherein God was worſhipped, and all that was ſacred, if I at ſuch a time as this ſtept in to ſtay &amp; to ſupport the ſhaking pillars of them all, by inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleing thoſe that were the actors in this tragedy to a conſiderable revenue out of them, that for the preſervation of their own intereſt they might protect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the whole bulke and body, out of which it did ariſe, forgive me this wrong, and who would think much in ſuch a dangerous ſtorm to throw out ſome of the wares &amp; fraught to preſerve the Ship and lading, and there are now living many (then Parliament men) to whom I had diſtributed ſome of thoſe books which confeſs that my propoſals therein were juſt and legall, aequall, reaſonable &amp; rationall, and that they did ſway much with them in voting for the tythes, and yet for all this when it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47233:8"/>
came to the vote, it was carried but by one voyce for the Chruch, for the Houſe was equally divided, and it ſtood meerly and only upon ſpeaker <hi>Lenthall's</hi> voyce whether tythes, or no tythes, and to his honour let me remember it in this great buſines (for other matters if he did amiſſe let him anſwer for himſelf) he caſt it for the Church. Now in this point of time when the Church and Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, Tythes, Colledges, and all lay at ſtake, tottering as it were upon the point of a needle, if I came in, and eaſt in but one grain, or ſcruple to caſt it the right way, will my brethren of the Church charge me &amp; ſay I did them wrong, no I was their benefactor, I did them all good ſervice, and I deſerve thanks at their hands. this was my firſt aym and I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it with ſucceſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My ſecond end that I aimed at was this, wherein I cannot ſo well juſtify my
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47233:9"/>
ſelf as in the former, becauſe there was ſomething of revenge in it, which (though I were never ſo great a ſufferer, and many more with me) yet I ſhould not have thought on, but this it was in a word, truly to puniſh the uſurping and intruding Clergy which by the power of their Committie of plundered Miniſters above, and their Country Committies here below ſubſervient to them, and the authority of one perſon more (whom I will not name) invaded our livings, caſt all the Orthodox Clergy out of the Churches, and put themſelves into the poſſeſſion of them from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſhebae</hi> throughout the land. Upon which by the help of their army they entred with ſuch cruelty that they ſeiſed upon all, Goods in the houſe, Corn on the ground, Croppe in the Barns, impriſoning the Husbands, throwing out the Wives &amp; children into the ſtreets without all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47233:9"/>
mercy, not one in ten of them ever allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them any fifths, or any other help out of them notwithſtanding a colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Act made to that purpoſe. So then <hi>diſtingue tempora</hi> diſtinguiſh but the times, do but conſider in whoſe poſſeſſion the Church was when I promoted that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and made thoſe propoſals, and you will ſoon free me from any intention of evill to the Orthodox Church or Church-men in whoſe behalf I writ it, but for theſe cruel, uſurping &amp; intruding Harpeys, God forgive me my revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thoughts againſt them, I did not care what burthen I laid upon them</p>
            <p n="3">3. My third end in thoſe propoſals, was the eaſe of the country &amp; Commons of <hi>England</hi> in reſpect of their contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, taxes &amp; aſſeſſments, by taking off from them and laying a great part of their burthen upon thoſe unto whom more properly it did belong, the Church
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47233:10"/>
and Church-men, whoſe warre this moſt properly was, and in whoſe quarrell it was begun, and this is expreſt <hi>in terminis</hi> in that book, for which they ſo much blame me, but let them and all others look back to the beginning of theſe wars and troubles, the cauſe, the quarrell, the incendiaries and promoters of it, and will it not fall upon the turbulent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Church-men, and where were the coals of it firſt kindled, was it not in the Pulpit, the rigid Presbite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Pulpit, witnes that text in <hi>Judges</hi> the 5<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> ſo frequently preached and printed on, and agreed on in <hi>Sion</hi> Colledge by a certain number of them there met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that it ſhould be ſo. <hi>Curſe ye Meroz, curſe him bitterly, becauſe he came not forth to help the Lord, to help the Lord, againſt the mighty,</hi> and although they did ſince that ſome of them ſalve the matter by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt the murther of the late King,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47233:10"/>
and ſince that by declaring for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty that now is, yet theſe plaiſters are to narrow to heal that head which before they had ſo ſore broken, they have great cauſe to be humbled under the ſence of thoſe grievious things which have fallen out as the conſequence of their deſperate beginnings, though they intended them not, their doctrines, and practiſes were then peſtilentiall, turbulent, &amp; ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and from their Spawn have riſen ſince al thoſe ſeditious Sects of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Anabaptiſts, Quakers, &amp;c. which now like locuſts coming out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomles pit cover the face of the earth, and have filled every corner of this land to the greivious corruption of the truth, and interuption of the peace both of the Church and Kingdome. If then they were the principall is the quarrell, the chiefeſt cauſers &amp; beginners of the warr, and now had their deſires in ſharing the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47233:11"/>
Biſhops and the Chapters lands among them for augmentations, and in putting themſelves into the poſſeſſion of the beſt livings in the land, and the revenue of the Church; was it unreaſonable that I ſhould move that they ſhould bear the greateſt burthen of them for the eaſe of others that were not ſo much concerned in the quarrell, but would willingly be at peace in the land, this was my third end and ayme in thoſe propoſals.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In my fourth end &amp; ayme in thoſe propoſals I had reſpect unto his Majeſty that now is, and then was our moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King and Soveraign, and to the augmentation of his Majeſties revenue: For I did aſſure my ſelfe his Majeſty would return to his Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with that honour which to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joy our eyes have ſeen, I did perſwade my ſelf that he would not himſelf take the advantage of this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47233:11"/>
but if it were done to his hand by another, then he might, either with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and juſtice enough continue it (as now the Excile) and ſo it would be a fair augmentation to his Majeſties revenue, or if not, that his Majeſty might reſtore it to the Church again, and ſo gain unto himſelf the glory of his bounty, and engage all Church-men throughout the land the faſter and cloſer to him, from whoſe gift and bounty, they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo great a benefit:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj:</hi> Oh but it will be objected, how ſhall we know you had any ſuch intentions toward his Majeſty, and not rather toward the Uſurper then in power?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solv:</hi> If I do not demonſtrate it, let me be ſeverely cenſured &amp; interpreted at the worſt you can immagine. For which purpoſe, Firſt it is notoriouſly known I did ever with great conſtancy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47233:12"/>
from time to time aſſert the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of his Majeſties return, and the neceſſity of it, and our certain miſery &amp; bondage till it was ſo, that it would be done by Parliament, not by tumult, that our diſtractions &amp; miſeries would be ſuch that rather then it ſhould not be ſo we ſhould all beg on our knees that it might be ſo, &amp; this not lately when things began to look this way, but 7, 8, 9, years agoe. To this I can call to witnes men of great account both friends and enemies to his Majeſties return, ear witneſſes of it. In the firſt ranke let me mention the Noble <hi>Thomas Stoner</hi> of <hi>Stoner</hi> Eſquire in Oxfordſhire, at whoſe Table I ſpake theſe words in the preſence and hearing of ſome perſons of Honour, and others of lower ranke, one of which anſwered me at that inſtant, that he durſt not hear what I ſaid without accuſing me, I call to witneſs the Gentlemen of the ancient
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47233:12"/>
Family of the Warcupps of the Mannour of Engliſh in the ſame County, and amongſt them one <hi>Robert Warcup</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Lievtenant Collonel of the County un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mr. <hi>James Whitlock,</hi> but who was in effect Coll: and much more, for he was the very right hand of the Lord <hi>Whitlock</hi> and of his Unckle <hi>Lenthall</hi> ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the Speaker, and a man of a vaſt power and authority in thoſe parts, he knowes well I did alwayes confidently aſſure him of his Majeſties return, and that all their tranſactions would come under the examination of that power which now they did deſpiſe &amp; oppoſe, &amp; therefore that he ſhould carry wiſely &amp; warily, with all aequity and moderation, as one that was ſure to give an account, and he took my counſel. Of the adverſe part I'le reckon but one, and that is one <hi>Henry Gooding</hi> a buffle-headed Baker in <hi>Henly</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> who from carrying
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47233:13"/>
the Bakers basket was exalted to a Juſtice-ſhip of the peace, as a man fit to be an inſtrument of miſchief, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to ſuch a Governour &amp; Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as we were under, who by abuſing his truſt &amp; power, and by cozening the Country, eſpecially the Kings friends, inſtead of bread fil'd his basket with money, and with it buying a Mannour near <hi>Hyworth</hi> in Wiltſhire, and having married his Maid there lives now, &amp; ſits as ſecurely as if he were as good a ſubject as any of us all. I mention none but ſuch as are living, and of ſuch I could men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion many more which know and can teſtify, and will if called, that not only now at the laſt but ever ſince his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties exile, I did conſtantly &amp; confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aſſert his return with Honour and Applauſe, the very deſire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the body of his people, in which caſe it were ſtrangely irrationall
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47233:13"/>
that I ſhould diſoblige his Majeſty by doing him any diſſervice either this or any other way: No in the mean time it was my ayme to ſerve him, and to ſettle 100000 pounds a year to his hand, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation to his Majeſties revenue, as due to him as any penny he doth receive upon any occaſion whatſoever. And though I have not done it to his hand, yet I have given his Majeſty, or the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or the great Officers of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury and Revenue light enough how to do it when they will, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I wiſh my Lord Chauncellor with the Maſter of the Rolls would look over that Act of the 26 of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. Cap: 4. repealed the 1 of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> revived again by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> wherein they ſhall find that they are required from time to time to ſend forh Commiſſions and Commiſſioners to make inquiry either by Oath, or by any other wayes and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47233:14"/>
means which they can in their diſcretion deviſe to find out the true value of all Spiritual or Eccleſiaſticall Dignities and Promotions, that ſo the firſt-fruits and Tenths may be paid in and received ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, that his Majeſty receive no dammage.</p>
            <p>And I would but ask, what is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that fourth and laſt Bond which we give into the firſt-fruit-Office, at our entrance upon our Eccleſiaſticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, call'd the <hi>Melius inquirendum,</hi> the condition whereof runs thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The condition of this preſent Obligation is ſuch that if the Rectory of</hi> A. <hi>in the county of</hi> B. <hi>ſhall be hereafter proved to be of more yearly value then</hi> 20l. <hi>as it now ſtands rated in the Kings book, then if</hi> T. B. <hi>incumbent there ſhall within one month after Certificate of due proof thereof had, and made, and given in unto him,) anſwer his Majeſty accordingly, then this preſent Obligation to be void and of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47233:14"/>
none effect, or elſe to ſtand, and remain in full force and vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remember that not many months ſince, a Praebend in a Cathedrall Church put in to be a Reſidentiary among the reſt, it was anſwered him, he could not except he had at leaſt 100l. a year <hi>in benificiis,</hi> he told them he had ſo, but it was replyed to him that 100l. a year then when that Statute was made was now 300l. a year at leaſt, &amp; therefore he could not be admitted unles he had 300l a year at leaſt, and ſo was ſet by: I leave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the application of this, or the concluſion to be deduced from it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſurely if this, Plea be good in the caſe of a Subject, it muſt needs be good much more in the behalf of the King on whoſe part all Statutes are to be interpreted, <hi>in favorem &amp; in meliorem partem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now after all this I do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade nor adviſe his Majeſty to take the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47233:15"/>
advantage of this diſcovery to himſelfe, yet though he do not ſo, there is this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in it that his Majeſty ſhal know what is his due, and what he may doe when he will, and others ſhall know how much they are obliged unto his Majeſty for his indulgence in forbearing it which hitherto have received the benefit of it in ſilence without acknowledgement.</p>
            <p>But certainly it deſerves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, and although his Majeſty do not take it, as by Law he may, yet if they ſhould at this exigent offer it up to him as a free-will offering, as at firſt the Church did to <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. when that Act was made, I think that therein they ſhould but do his Majeſty right, and themſelves no wrong. I am ſure his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty begun to them firſt, he hath given them a free-will offering, ſuch a one as the Church yet never ſaw, nor I hope never ſhall, (I mean the Cathedralls,) in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47233:15"/>
the renewing of Leaſes taking of fines, gathering of arrears, all theſe of 20 years growth now in this one years harveſt to be reap't and gathered in, which brings in ſuch incredible ſums of money into ſome private and particular purſes, that it is beyond beliefe to relate. But if the late Parliament (to whoſe prudence his Majeſty refer'd the conſideration of theſe things,) had ſo carried between his Majeſty and the Church, as that all theſe arrears and fines upon renewing of Leaſes, eſpecially of the Vacancies might have been gathered into a treaſury, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to have been diſpoſed of, and diſtributed as his Majeſty with advice of the Church-men in wiſdom and Juſtice ſhould have thought fit, &amp; the Churches and Church-Dignities might have been filled as at other times, ſo as to take the profits enſuing, only remitting to the perſons ſo preferred their firſt-fruits, it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47233:16"/>
would have brought into that treaſury above a Million of mony, &amp; the Church-men put into ſuch a condition as they would have been very wel ſatisfied with, and thankfull for.</p>
            <p>Whereas now neither his Majeſty, nor Community, nor the late ſuffering Clergy baniſhed out of thoſe Churches, (moſt of them deceas't) nor theirs, have any benefit out of them at all, but all is engroſt into the hands of a few Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall-men, a Biſhop, a Dean, and 2 or 3 Cardinall Praebendaries, which call themſelves Reſidentiaries, for as for the reſt of the Chapter though reſident as well as they, and by their inſtiſtutions have <hi>Stallum in Choro locum, &amp; vocem in Capitulo,</hi> yet as to the Dividends they are all ſet by as ſecluded Members, in the Church of <hi>Yorke</hi> are 36 Praebends, &amp; there are but 3 of all theſe that ſhare in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidend of thoſe vaſt revenues: and thoſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47233:16"/>
Reſidentiaries (methinks very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called,) for of all other they are the greateſt Non-Reſidents, for while they are Reſidentiaries in thoſe Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dralls where the harveſt lies, there are few of them but have 3.4.5. or more other Dignities or Eccleſiaſticall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions elſe-where which call for their reſidence &amp; preſence, and complain for the want of it. And if there were but an inquiry made into the ſeveral Cathedralls in the Land for Pluraliſts, and non-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, what ſtrange <hi>Smect ymniuſſes</hi> ſhould we finde amongſt them, Men of as many Names and Titles as the beaſt in the Revelations had heads, that we cannot tell how to write to them, nor of them, to give them their due Stiles but with an &amp;c. I read in the Counſell of <hi>Trent</hi> of a Biſhop there called <hi>Quinque Eccleſienſis,</hi> but amongſt theſe you ſhall find many that ſurpaſſe him, by almoſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47233:17"/>
double the number, for inſtance do but look upon that Chappell at Windſor, for that is the ſtyle of it, <hi>the free Chapp<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll of</hi> St. George, and there you ſhall ſee how <hi>Windſor,</hi> and <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and <hi>Eaton</hi>-Colledge, and the City and the Country, Deanaries, and Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends and Parſonages, and Viccaragies, and Donatives, and all meet together in a little roome, and ſo in other places.</p>
            <p>Let me give you an inſtance freſh in memorie, I knew a man to whom (not many months ſince) his Majeſty (being made acquainted with his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and ſervices,) had given the beſt Praebend in the Church of <hi>Yorke,</hi> it paſt the Signet and privy Seal, the fees of both were paid, it was carried to the Great Seal, and money laid down there in pledge for the charge of it, yet after all this came a Courtier, makes friends to his Majeſty for the ſame thing, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47233:17"/>
carries it for another that had but ſix Dignities &amp; Eccleſiaſticall promotions before: I confeſſe he was a Worthy Perſon, a great ſufferer, and one that deſerved a better Dignity then that, and I believe might have had it as eaſily as he had that (if his friend had laid out his intereſts for it) and I wiſh he had. Yet let me do his Majeſty this right too, although he had ſigned the Warrant for it, yet when they brought their Bill, his Majeſty remembred he had paſt it to another, and refuſed to ſign it, a ſignall evidence of his incomparable Goodneſs and juſtice, but the Praegrantee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they had prevailed with one of the greateſt Subjects in the King<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom to appear for them (ſo far as to write his Letter to Secretary <hi>Morrice</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw a Caveat which was entred in the Signet Office to prevent Competitors) well knew it was no conteſting in ſuch
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47233:18"/>
a caſe, and ſo was content to ſit down and let it paſs: well let this go for a digreſſion. In all this I would not be ſo interpreted as if I did utterly condemn all Pluralities in perſons rightly qualifyed for them, nor <hi>non</hi>-reſidence neither upon occaſion, there may be neceſſity for it, but that which is to be diſlik't in them both is, that they are ſo common and ordinary, <hi>privilegia ſunt paucorum,</hi> priviledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long but to few, and thoſe the choiceſt of men, and as a very learned and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Divine writ to me once in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of a caſe of conſcience which I offer'd him. <hi>We do in nothing more juggle with our owne conſciences, then in allowing our ſelves too much liberty in things that are not abſolutley unlawfull.</hi> It was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Dr. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> in the reſolution of this very caſe of Non-reſidency, occaſioned by an invitation from the right honourable
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47233:18"/>
               <hi>Nicholas</hi> Lord Viſcount <hi>Caſtleton,</hi> (Father to the Noble Lord <hi>George</hi> now living,) to leave my Parſonage in York-ſhire, and to come and live with his Lordſhip in his houſe, which I did civilly excuſe, my conſcience not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing my conſtant abſence from my charge at that diſtance. And there is another thing that makes theſe Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities ſo unreaſonable, and that is the inſatiablenes of greedy men in thoſe accumulations, that heap up mountain upon mountain, <hi>Pelion</hi> upon <hi>Oſſa</hi> Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity upon Dignity without either end or meaſure as long as mony or meanes, or intereſt, or friends will laſt to procure them, when as (God knowes) there are many hundreds of learned, Loyall, honeſt, Orthodoxe, ſuffering, ſequeſtred Miniſters unprovided for, unreſtored to their livings, which to this day want bread for them and theirs. And ſo are
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47233:19"/>
like to doe, for what with that indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Declaration of his Majeſty tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating ſo many irregularities in Church-miniſtrations, &amp; ſo much abuſed, and what with that late Act (pretended to be made for the reſtoring of ſequeſtred Miniſters, but intended doubtleſſe by ſome of the contrivers of it for the clear contrary, to keep us out while we are out, and to confirm thoſe in that are in the poſſeſſion of them, there they are ſtill, and there they will be, for firſt it puts us upon impoſſibilities in order to our reſtoring of getting five or more Juſtices together, which I am ſure I could not do with the expence of above twenty pound, and the riding, and ſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nding too &amp; fro of above three hudred miles, and yet at four meetings could never get above three Juſtices together, which for want of a full Quorum could not act, &amp; then if we cannot overcome
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47233:19"/>
theſe difficulties, and that within a time limited, it ſeems to praeclude from us all other remedy of Law or otherwiſe for our relief, as in the eleventh page of it, and what a ſtrange toleration is this that being in poſſeſſion, there they ſhall be, and keep it though without inſtitution, and orderly induction, by this meanes the Church is to this day full of thoſe notorious, ſeditious, ſchiſmaticall and violent intruders, which began all theſe troubles at the firſt, and caſt the Orthodoxe Clergy out, and now they ſtand upon better termes then ever they did, neither is there yet any one Biſhop in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that hath viſited his Dioceſſe to take cogniſance of theſe things, either by himſelfe or by his Commiſſioners, nor when they do, do I ſee what power they have yet to purge the Church of them, or to reſtrain them: this not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47233:20"/>
onely is a greivous oppreſſion (for the preſent) to the ſuffering and ſequeſtred Miniſters, the moſt of them very aged men, grown old in ſuffering, and a great advantage to thoſe factious and ſeditious Uſurpers to confirm the people in thoſe ſeditious and Haereticall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which before they had infuſed into them, but there is a greater miſchief then this, the conſequent of it, and that is this: That whereas his Majeſty hath graciouſly promiſed that there ſhall be a Synod called, theſe Heterodoxe men (with which the Church is now filled) ſhall be able to over-vote the Orthodoxe Clergy three to one in the choice of our Repreſentatives. The cure of all theſe things with the prevention of greater evills (which theſe things (if not cured) may introduce,) we muſt leave to the Wiſedome and Juſtice of the Parliament at hand, and of the higher powers, it
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47233:20"/>
was enough for me to hint at them, and that I have done impartially, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any malignity to either party, Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall or Presbiterian, though an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the abuſes in both, yet my ſelfe a friend to both, who will ever ſtyle my ſelfe An obedient Sonne of the Church, and an Epiſcopal-Presbiterian: <hi>Tho: Bradley.</hi>
