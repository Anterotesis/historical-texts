         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHom the Lord hath called out of the World's Ways and Manners, and choſen to himſelf, and found faithful according to the Proportion of Faith, and Meaſure of his Grace received, how to walk, Oh! let us hold faſt that which we have received, that none may take our Crown: Oh! let us keep to our firſt Love, let us do our firſt Works, and be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly zealous for the Lords Honour; and ſo with a good Conſcience towards God, and in the ſweet Spirit of Peace, ſeeking good one toward another, as good Examples and wholeſome Paterns in our Practices. Oh! let us keep our good Order in the Truth, and Unity of the Spirit, even as we received of Chriſt<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.7.</note> Jeſus in the beginning, that we ſhould walk in the Light, as he is in the Light (ſo ſhall we have fellowſhip one with another) which <hi>light</hi> is one in us all, &amp; the one only true &amp; living Way, leading to the Knowledge and living Obedience of the one, true and living God, that in his own living Spirit of Truth, we might Worſhip him, and in all wholeſome Service hold forth his Holy &amp; Reverend Name to be One in us all, who are gathered into it, ſerving the Lord with one Heart, one Soul, one Mind and one Conſent.—And in the beginning of our Day, you that were then born and brought forth in the Truth, you know the Harmony of our Unity was our Beauty and Comlineſs, yea, our Strength and Compleatneſs, ſo far as we had obtained then; and ſo 'tis now, bleſſed be the Lord, can we with one Heart ſay, who by his heavenly Power have been from

the beginning kept upon his Everlaſting Foundation of true Unity, held in his Spirit, which is the Bond of our Peace, to this very Day and Time, in which the Lord hath ſuffered Blindneſs, in part, to happen to ſome, through their own Neglect of Watchfulneſs, and declining their firſt Love by the Enemy's Subtilty prevailing, who came out amongſt us, and had a part in the Belief and Diſcovery of the Way of Truth; but now, ſome only have the Sheeps clothing, and others have loſt that too, who through a prejudiced Mind are alienated from that Unity of Spirit and Bond of Peace, in which we keep our wholeſome Practices, which we have received in the Unity and Order of the Goſpel of Peace, and Truth of Chriſt Jeſus, in the fellowſhip of the Spirit, in Bowels of Mercy, being<note place="margin">2 Phil. 1. 4.</note> like-minded, and of one accord, in whatſoever things are True, Juſt, Honeſt, and of good Report; not that we ſhould think of them only, but be in the Practice of them, (as we are) and feel the God of Peace with us therein, who are<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 6. &amp; 10.</note> confirmed in the Teſtimony of Chriſt Jeſus, the one Guide, Way and Rule we are to walk after, where all ſpeak one thing, that there be no Diſſention amongſt us, but to be knit together in one Mind and in one Judgment; this we have received of Chriſt Jeſus, one Lord, Ring and only Law-given, that we might walk ſo in ſubjection to his Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that all things might be done Decently and in Order; for our God is the God of Order, in all the Churches of his Saints, and not the God of Confuſion, bleſſed be his Name; but to our burden and grief, we find among ſome, a contrary Spirit that will not ſubject to Unity in wholeſome Practice, amongſt as, and that will needs interpole to deſtroy Unity in ſame places, and obtrude it ſelf to confound our wholeſome Order and Practices received amongſt us, as a Church and People.

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41159:3"/>Now that the Simple may not be enſhared, nor the Weak un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtable minded deceived, not the Unwatchful at unawares overtaken, through the crafty Inſinuations of this accuſing, oppoſing, dividing Spirit, that is at work in this our day, to confound Order, againſt the peaceable Government of Chriſt, amongſt his People; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Duty to the Lord, and to clear my Conſcience, for the ſake of thoſe before-mentioned, are theſe few Lines writ; Wherefore in Humility of Soul, as before the Lord, I beſeech you, tender Ones, in ſeriouſneſs, and fear towards God, weigh the Matter: This Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding, Accuſing, Prejudicial Worker, would introduce a Belief, <hi>That an</hi> Apoſtacy <hi>is entring, and we are gone from the Beginning, or firſt Principle, and the Power loſt; and new Forms are ſetting up, and Impoſition on Conſciences, and the like. And amongſt whom is all this,</hi> ſay they, <hi>but amongſt us who are in Unity of Spirit, both in Faith and Practices,</hi> with ſincere mind towards God, are preſerved in ſubjection, peaceably in Unity, and wholeſome comely Order that ſpeaks forth our God to be the God of Order; and 'tis amongſt theſe, and ſuch that they imagine this Fearful Impoſture, and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Rule, impoſing Preſcriprions and Laws on the tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the Weak, is now gotten up to Exerciſe, and ſo the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the tender Conſcience is loſt. And you ſay, They are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with a yoke of Bondage again, who would divide the Heritage of God at this day. Pray Friends, let us in this conſider whether theſe in this Blindneſs, which God hath ſuffered through their prejudiced Mind, juſtly to happen in them, by which are they not putting Darkneſs for Light and Light for Darkneſs, while they are ſtriving in the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="4 letters">

'tis ſenſibly felt to be a groſs Miſtake. And ſuch are (in Chriſtian Charity) to be pitied and better informed, and indeed much Travel hath been for that, ſo that the Miſ-led in a contrary Judgment might be helped and reduced back into Unity and our peaceable Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, in our wholeſome Practices, in the outward Affairs of Truth; but that which adds to our Sorrow, that though they ſtill ery, <hi>The tender Conſciences,</hi> yet woful Experience demonſtrates it far otherwiſe, where Prejudice hath ſo hardned, that there is not ſo much ſoftneſs left for the Reaſon of Truth to take Impreſſion, or to receive that which pertains to Love and good Works, which is one end and product of our Meetings, diſtinctly and reſpectively the Men Friends, who diſcharge their places, to whom the Godly Women always give the Pre-eminence, as Brethren and Women Friends in their places, not ſeeking Rule over one another, but that we may be Furtherers of one anothers Joy, and be each others Crown of rejoycing in the Lord, meets in the Fear of the Lord, as in the Light of Chriſt Jeſus in our Conſciences, we received, ſo to walk and do according to the Order of his Spirit, in which Chriſt is Preſent in our ſo meeting together; and the faithful can feal to the Teſtimony of it, to the Glory of his Name forever.</p>
            <p>But wherein doth this great and heavy Impoſition on tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences conſiſt? One thing is, ſay ſome, <hi>Womens Meetings are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: Why do you compel any contrary to their Freedom?</hi> No; all are left to the Meaſure of Truth in them, which is one and the ſame in all Conſciences; but Informing, Inſtructing and Exhorting, that every one be found in the Unity of our Duty, according to our Meaſure of the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, received to walk in it, as Members of his Body to diſcharge our Office, and Servants in Chriſt Family to do our Service, as the good Women of old were Helpers in the Work of the Goſpel, in ſuch things as are proper to us, as viſiting and Relieving the Sick, the Poor more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Deſtitute amongſt us, that they be helped, a alſo the Poor Widdows, and Fatherleſs Orphans, that the Diſtreſſed in all things be rightlyanſwered, the Children at Nurſe be rightly educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and well brought up, in order to a future well-being in the Creation. Again, we being met together, the Elder Women to inſtruct the Younger to all wholeſome things, Loving their own Huſbands and Children, to be Diſcreet, Chaſte, Sober, keeping at
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41159:4"/>
Home, that the Word of God we profeſs be not Blaſphemed, &amp;c. with many other Matters pertient to us, as a Meeting whom the Lord bleſſeth with his Power and Preſence, to ſuſtain and bear us up againſt all our Oppoſers.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>It is Impoſition</hi> (ſaith the Workers of Diſſention) <hi>for Marriages to offer their Intentions to the Conſideration of the Womens Meeting.</hi> But pray conſider, in the Reaſon of Truth, a Marriage hath an equal Concern in the Woman, as in the Man; and 'tis as reaſonable to conſider the Women may have as near a Concern in that matter with the Woman, as the Men on the other Part. And farther 'tis ſaid, '<hi>Tis Impoſition to go more than once to the Brethrens Meeting.</hi> But ſay we, that are in our wholeſome Practices in theſe Matters, and our Conſciences bear us witneſs in the ſight of God, our Eye is to the Honour of his Truth therein, therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not encourage or allow People we are concerned with, to haſten or run together in Marriage, without due Care and Weightineſs, and that we are ſatisfied they are clear in all things touching their Marriage, as they ought to be, and for which end there ought to be a ſpecial care over Young People, to whom the Aged had need to be Examples, both of Gravity and good Order, that Chriſt's Yoke be not caſt off by either, nor any falſe Liberty of the Fleſh ſet up, encouraged or ſoothed among us; wherefore when they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their Intentions to one Meeting, for them to conſider, 'tis but reaſonable they have time to make Inquiry and Search into the the Matter, ſo as they may be ſatisfied, that all things are ſweet &amp; ſavoury, that ſo far aswe can, we may be approved of by all in ſuch publick Affairs. <hi>Yea, But you will have ſuch to come the ſecond time, who are known to be clear.</hi> Yea, 'tis but reaſonable that ſuch ſhould manifeſt their Patience and Subjection, as good Examples to others, in theſe Needful and wholſome Practices, that are of good Report. And therefore we cannot approve ſuch in their willful Endeavours, to confound the Unity of our Order in this matter, under pretence of a burden to their Conſcience; for it was no burden to come once; for that Meeting in it ſelf being Good, Juſt, Honeſt, and of good Report, anſwering the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, which is one in all Conſciences, as well in the Ignorant, Blind, Miſ-guided and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, becauſe they will not be informed, the Light is the ſame there to reprove and inform, as it is in the Conſcience ruled and guided by the Light: Therefore pray conſider how that can contract a

burden, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the going twice to ſuch a Meeting, as before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, how it can cauſe a burden on the Conſcience that is rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, though it may be weak, but rather contradicts the Self-will that brings Bondage, and blinds the Conſciences: And are not ſuch rather by their oppoſing Will juſtly under the Reproof of the Church, and that Endeavours may be, that the Underſtanding of ſuch be opened, and brought to a better Information in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences? For from the beginning we believe God's Witneſs in all Conſciences is one, and its Reproofs of one Nature and Tendance, and its Inſtruction<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

Pray conſider, above tweny ſix Years ago, in the South Parts we were a very little handful of People, gathered into the Belief of the Light of Chriſt Jeſus; ſo as it is that very Principle of Life in us, that we through Obedience to it might come to know God, as it is Eternal Life to know him, and rightly to worſhip him in his Spirit, and to be led by him into all Truth, and in Teſtimony of his own Spirit, in theſe our Practices, which ſince the Lord hath called us to, as we are a People called and gathered by the Lord. Pray Conſider, I ſpeak the Truth of my Knowledge, and my Conſcience beareth me witneſs in what I have or ſhall ſay in this Matter, according to my ſmall Portion and Meaſure, in the Unity of the Grace received (I give God the Glory, in Humility of Soul before him, for my Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this Day) for pray conſider, through the ſmallneſs of Number, in the beginning, we were not ſo capable as now for Order in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Affairs, nor was there then ſuch occaſion as now, but then the Grace of God grew amongſt us, and the mighty Arm of his Power was manifeſted, by which many were gathered to believe in the Light of Jeſus Chriſt, it being that, and no other Name given under Heaven, by which men muſt be ſaved. Now in our little meaſure of Faith, in this One Way, One Name, One Truth, we were as in a threefold Cord of God's Love, joyned together; and as we encreaſed in Number, then occaſion begun of Services, of ſeveral kinds, which we were called in the Truth to conſider of, which are not ſo proper here to mention, but this one of Marriage.

Meeting: Upon the weight of the matter, a neceſſity did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that Friends in the Unity of the Spirit and Wiſdom of God ſhould conſider of a Way wherein this matter might be tranſacted among our ſelves, in wholeſome Savoury Order, as the Truth might in no wiſe be Scandalized, but the Teſtimony of Truth born in it to the World: The moſt convenient Method then ſeen, for Truth's ſake, was, that Perſons declared their Intentions in our publick Meeting; after Friends were ſatisfied in their Marrying, they took each other in the publick Meeting: But after our Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings grew more Numerous, and alſo diſorderly Spirits began to get up, which were not ſubject to the Truth, ſuch would intrude in to our Meetings, to take each other; ſo then a Neceſſity in Truth required a further Method, for a more particular and ſtrict Care in this caſe: In all which we are not gone from the Light and Power of God, and firſt Principle; but in theſe and other things we have been in our good Order and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and ſweet Fellowſhip managed by it; and I hope the tender in Conſcience will conſider, that are impartially Minded, that 'tis no Impoſition to inform and perſwade the Ignorant and Willful to ſubject in this or any other matter, that is Honeſt, Juſt, Savoury and of good Report, and lawful to conform to, in the Unity of Love to practiſe, being no other but what is conſonant to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſwayed and regulated by the Light of Jeſus Chriſt, in which is the true Liberty of the Conſcience, whether weak or ſtrong: For I hope all will conclude, that if the weak, in their little mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Light, be kept Conformable to the Truth, that by the Light they cannot be led in their little meaſure to oppoſe the ſtrong in their greater meaſure; and may ſee further, that 'tis not reaſonable in Truth; for the Light cannot contradict it ſelf, and 'tis the ſame in the ſtrong as in the weak; But 'tis greatly to be lamented at this day, that to any that have known the Lord, and at any time fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip among his People, the Croſs of Chriſt ſhould become ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, that ſuch Blindneſs is happened, that they ſhould put Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppoſing-will for a tender Conſcience: I do not ſay, they know it; but whether they do or no, I pray God open their Underſtandings, and ſubdue that perverſe wilful Spirit and croſs Selfiſh-humor, that works in oppoſition to a General Good and Peaceable Subjection amongſt the People of the Lord and Church of Chriſt.

theſe, though they may cry, <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and pretend for tender Conſciences too, yet they are not fit Subjects for that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty that Chriſt redeems to, and ſets free in, to ſerve him with a Conſcience purged from Dead Works; nay, they that ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in their wilful prejudiced Oppoſition, againſt our Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able practiſing in the Church of God; <hi>Whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things pertain to Love, whatſoever things are of good report,</hi> Phil. 4. 8. In which the God of Peace is with us now; that which is oppoſing our Unity therein, would affright the ſimple Ones with amazing expreſſions of Impoſition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on weak Conſciences, and going from the Spirit of Life and Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Form; but bleſſed be the Lord that we have kept our Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation in the Power, and held our Unity in that Spirit that gives us Life, thereby to live to God, and not to our ſelves, to ſerve him in that Form of Godlineſs, which the Power hath brought forth amongſt us, to live in the Unity of, and in his Spirit, the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Preſervation, in Peace and Conſolation to this very day; and the Faith of ſuch remains firm in God's everlaſting Power, even as we received in the beginning of the breaking forth of the Day of the Lord, in which his ancient Arm and excellent Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Name was revealed, which is above every Name, into which a Number was gathered to believe and meet in, and the Lord was there, and is to this very day in the midſt of them, as Thouſands, and ten Thouſands can ſpeak to the Teſtimony of it; Oh, Glory, Obedience, and everlaſting Dominion be aſcribed to his honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and everlaſting Name over all forever; For the Kingdom of our God and his Chriſt, on whoſe Shoulders the Government is laid, ſhall prevail through all Clouds of oppoſition, and Miſts of thick Darkneſs, that have riſen out of a miſguided underſtanding, through a Prejudiced mind, even to enſnare the weak and ſimple, and deceive the unſtable Soul, drawing from our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Unity, which is purely held in the Spirit.</p>
            <p>And ſo, inaſmuch as the Envious Worker is ſuffered to proceed, that would even raze out the Foundation of Chriſt's Kingdom and Government, under which his Subjects do only own their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Freedom and true Liberty of Conſcience; and whatſoever may be inſinuated to the contrary, by the Enemy of our Souls Well-fare

in the particular, and the Churches Peace in the general, which God may ſuffer, it is for the Tryal of our Patience, and Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Confirmation of our Faith and Love one to another, and that it is in the Election in Chriſt Jeſus which cannot be deceived, whereby we are ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his might is our confidence, that all ſhall work together for good to the Called, Choſen and Faithful, according to his purpoſe in Chriſt, and effectual working of his Grace; And that the Lord in his Power and due time, will ariſe to clear the Innocency of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Confound and lay Waſte all that which works in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Proſperity and Unity of his Truth, and peaceable Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt in his Church, which is formed in the Power of God.</p>

            <p>THus it was, after the Word of eternal Life and Salvation, and Light of Chriſt Jeſus in the Conſcience, had been Preached in this City, for ſome time, many there were that received the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and was Convinced of it, many Poor as well as Rich; and oft times Sickneſs and Weakneſs came upon many Poor Ones, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41159:7"/>
many Diſtreſſed and troubled in mind, when the Judgments of the Lord were upon them; and they would oftentimes deſire the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord to come unto them, ſuch that had a Word in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſpeak to them: And our dear Friend <hi>George Fox,</hi> that man of God, for ſo he is, the Lord has made him a Bleſſing in his Hand to many, praiſed be the Lord forever, he was many times ſent for to many that were Sick and Weak in this City, and when he came to behold their want of things needful for them, ſome ſcarcely Clothes to cover them, or Food to eat, or any one to look to them in their Diſtreſſes and Wants: The conſideration of it was weighty upon him, and he was moved of the Lord to adviſe to a Womans Meeting; and in order thereunto, he ſent for ſuch Women as he knew in this City; of which there are many living to this day, that can teſtifie to the ſame, who keep the Meeting in the Faith of that Power that gathered us together; Bleſſed be the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever who makes willing, and gives ſtrength to anſwer his Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in all things. And when dear <hi>G.

And there were found among us ſome that were unworthy, that we could not relieve out of that which was provided for the Faithful; and yet they were ſuch that frequented our publick Meetings, and looked unto us for Charity; and we could not ſend them empty away; So we

conſidered, and had a Weekly Gathering for them, that it might be fulfilled, as it is written, <hi>Do good unto all; but eſpecially to the Houſhold of Faith.</hi> And after ſome time of our meeting together, their came two of the Brethren from the Mens Meeting to us, when we were met together, expreſſing their Unity with us, and alſo did declare the mind of the Mens Meeting, (viz.) <hi>That they would be ready to help and aſſiſt us in any thing we ſhould deſire of them for Truth's Service:</hi> And ſo in ſome time it was agreed upon, in the Unity of the Truth, that the Men Friends ſhould pay the Poor Friends Rents, and find them Coles, (ſuch as we Relieve, that were faithful) and put out ſuch poor Friends Children, as we ſhould offer to them; And this has been done almoſt from the beginning of our Meeting to this Day; beſides many other Services that fall in by the way, that cannot be omitted by us: And thus the Work of the Lord has been carried on and proſpered by the Arm of his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Power, <hi>Magnified be his Name forever, who has found us worthy, and made us willing to anſwer whatſoever he requireth of us, according to the meaſure received of him.</hi> And this I do declare, that it was the ſame everlaſting quickning Power that firſt viſited us by the Spirit of Judgment and of Burning, and wrought in our inward parts mightily, even as the little Leaven in the three Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Meal, to purifie and to cleanſe, to purge out and put under all that was contrary to the Lord, and to make us Habitations fit to do his Will, that gathered us and made us a Meeting, and the ſame has been with us to this very day, bleſſed and magnified be his Name forever.</p>
