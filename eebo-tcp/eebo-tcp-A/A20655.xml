            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Barak</hi> sung after their great victory vpon <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sera;
Sisera</hi> who was <hi>Iabin</hi> the King of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>

will forget my Law; but this song they will
not forget; and whensoeuer they sing this
song, this song shall testifie against them,
what I haue done for them, how they haue
forsaken me. And to such a purpose hath
<hi>God</hi> left this Song of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak</hi> in
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that all <hi>Murmurers,</hi> and all
that stray into a diffidence of <hi>Gods</hi> power, or

and destroy his owne Enemies, might run

deliuerances that <hi>God</hi> hath giuen to his
people, by weake and vnexpected meanes.
This world begun with a Song, if the <hi>Chalde

so did the next world too, if wee count the
beginning of that (as it is a good computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

<hi>Deborah</hi> had a zeale to the cause, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

would effect his purpose by so weake an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
by a woman, but by a woman,
which had no such interest, nor zeale to the

ground, as he lay sleeping in her tent: And
then the end of all, was the end of all, <hi>not one
man of his army left aliue. O my Soule, why, art
thou so sad, why art thou so disquieted within me?</hi>
Sing vnto the Lord an old song, the song of
<hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> That God by weake

from beanen, the starres in their Order, fought

the Text, as the two <hi>Hemispheres</hi> of the
world, laid open in a flat, in a plaine Map.
All those parts of the world, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
haue vsed to consider, are in one of
those <hi>Hemispheres;</hi> All <hi>Europe</hi> is in that, and
in that is all <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Afrike</hi> too: So that
when we haue seene that <hi>Hemisphere,</hi> done
with that, we might seeme to haue seene all,
done with all the world; but yet the other
<hi>Hemisphere,</hi> that of <hi>America</hi> is as big as it;
though, but by occasion of new, and late
discoueries, we had had nothing to say of
<hi>America.</hi> So the first part of our Text, will
bee as that first <hi>Hemisphere;</hi> all which the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:25353:8"/>
ancient Expositors found occasion to note
out of these words, will be in that: but by
the new discoueries of some humors of
men, and rumors of men, we shall haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to say somewhat of a second part to.
The parts are, first, the Literall, the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall
sense of the words; And then an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent,
a collaterall, an occasionall sense
of them. The <hi>explication</hi> of the wordes,
and the <hi>Application, Quid tunc, Quid nunc,</hi>
How the words were spoken then, How
they may be applied now, will be our two
parts. And, in passing through our first,
wee shall make these steps. First, God can,
and sometimes doth effect his purposes by
himselfe; intirely, immediatly, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,
miraculously by himselfe: But yet,
in a second place, we shall see, by this
story, That he lookes for assistance, for
concurrence of second causes, and subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
meanes: And that therefore, <hi>God</hi>
in this Song of <hi>Deborah,</hi> hath prouided an
honourable commemoration of them, who
did assist his cause; for, the Princes haue
their place,<note place="margin">Verse 15,</note> 
                     <hi>The Princes of Issachar were
with her:</hi> And then, the <hi>Gouernours,</hi> The
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:25353:8"/>
great Persons, the great Officers of the
State, haue their place in this honour,
That <hi>they offered themselues willingly to that
seruice;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 9.</note> And after them,<note place="margin">Verse 10,</note> the <hi>Merchants,</hi>
for those who are said there, <hi>to ride vpon
white Asses,</hi> to be well mounted, according
to the manner of those <hi>Nations,</hi> are, by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Martyr,</hi> amongst our Expositors, and by
<hi>Serarius</hi> the <hi>Iesuite,</hi> amongst the others, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnderstood, to be intended of <hi>Merchants;</hi>
And in the same <hi>verse,</hi> the <hi>Iudges</hi> are honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
remembred, <hi>Those that fit in Iudgement;</hi>
And a farre vnlikelier sort of people, then
any of these, in the same verse too, <hi>Those
that walked by the way;</hi> Idle, and discoursing
men, that were not much affected, how
businesse went, so they might talke of them:
And lastly, the whole people in generall,<note place="margin">Verse 2.</note>
how poore soeuer, they haue euidence
from this record, That <hi>they offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues</hi>
(and what will they denie, that offer
themselues) and willingly, to this imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And then, <hi>God</hi> hauing here afforded
this honourable mention of them, who
did assist him, he layes also a heauy note
vpon such, who for collaterall respects pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaricated,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:25353:9"/>
or withdraw themselues from
his seruice: perticularly vpon <hi>Ruben,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 16.</note> who
was <hi>diuided by greatnesse of heart,</hi> And vpon
<hi>Dan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 17.</note> 
                     <hi>who remained in his ships.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the encouragement of those who
did assist him, in any proportion, though
their assistance were no wayes competent
against so potent an enemy, <hi>God</hi> fought for
himselfe too, <hi>They sought from Heauen, The
starres in their order fought against Sisera.</hi> And
these will be the branches, or circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of our first part: for the particulars of
the second, we shall open them more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously
for your memory and vse, then,
when we come to handle them, then now.
Now we proceed to those of the first part.</p>
                  <p>And into those I passe with this protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Part 1.</note>
That in all which I shall say this day,
beeing to speake often of <hi>God,</hi> in that <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as he is <hi>Lord of Hostes,</hi> and fights his
owne battailes, I am farre from giuing
fire to them that desire warre. <hi>Peace</hi> in this
world, is a pretious <hi>Earnest,</hi> and a faire and
louely <hi>Type</hi> of the euerlasting peace of the
world to come: And warre in this world, is
a shrewd and fearefull <hi>Embleme</hi> of the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:25353:9"/>
discord and tumult, and torment of
the world to come: And therefore, our <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God,</hi> blesse vs with this externall, and
this internall, and make that lead vs to an
eternall peace. But I speake of this subiect,
especially to establish and settle them, that
suspect Gods power, or Gods purpose, to
succour those, who in forraine parts, grone
vnder heauie pressures in matter of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
or to restore those, who in forraine
parts, are deuested of their lawfull posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and inheritance; and because <hi>God</hi>
hath not done these great workes yet, nor
yet raised vp meanes, in apparance, and in
their apprehension, likely to effect it, That
therefore <hi>God</hi> likes not the cause; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they begin to bee shaked in their owne
Religion at home, since they thinke that
God neglects it abroad. But, beloued, since
God made all this world of nothing, cannot
hee recouer any one peece thereof, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
any one peece, with a little? In the
Creation, his production of specifique
formes, and seuerall Creatures in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
dayes, was much, very much; but
not very much, compared with that, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:25353:10"/>
he had done immediatly before, when he
made Heauen and Earth of nothing. For,
for the particular Creatures, God had then
<hi>Praeiacentem Materiam,</hi> he had stuffe before
him; enough to cut out Creatures of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
sise, his <hi>Elephants</hi> of the Earth, his <hi>Whales</hi>
and <hi>Leuiathans</hi> in the Sea. In that matter
there was <hi>Semen Creaturarum,</hi> The Seed of
all Creatures in that stuffe. But for the stuffe
it selfe, the Heauen and Earth, God had not
<hi>Semen Coeli,</hi> any such seed of Heauen as that
he could say to it, doe thou hatch a Heauen;
he had not any such <hi>Semen terrae,</hi> as that hee
could bid that grow vp into an Earth:
There was nothing at all, and all, that is, was
produced from that; and then who shall
doubt of his proceeding, if by a little he will
doe much? He suffered his greater works
to be paraleld, or to be counterfeit by <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs
Magicians,</hi> but in his least, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Lice, hee brought them to confesse
<hi>Digitum Dei,</hi> the finger of God; and that
was enough; The arme of God, the hand of
God needs not; where he will worke, his
finger is enough, It was not that imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that dreame of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> that hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:25353:10"/>
the <hi>Magicians,</hi> who say, that the <hi>Deuill</hi>
cannot make any Creature, lesse then a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
corne; As it is with men, they miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it to be with the <hi>Deuill</hi> too; harder to
make a little clocke, a little picture, any
thing in a little, then in a larger forme. That
was no part of the reason in that case: but
since man ordinarily esteemes it so, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
admires great workes in little
forme, why will he not be content to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
<hi>God</hi> that way, in a faithfull confidence,
that hee can and will doe great workes by
weake meanes. Should God haue stayd to
leuie, and arme, and traine, and muster, and
present men enow to discomfit <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib?</hi>
Hee tooke a neerer way; he slew al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
two hundreth thousand of them, in
one night by an <hi>Angell.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esa. 37. 3</note> Should God haue
troubled an <hi>Angell</hi> to satisfie <hi>Elisha</hi> his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant?<note place="margin">2. Reg. 5. 1.</note>
Onely by apparition in the cloudes,
he brought him to acknowledge, that there
were more with them, then with the <hi>Enemy,</hi>
when there was none. He troubled not so
much as a cloud, he imployed no Creature
at all, against the <hi>Philistines,</hi> when they came
vp with thirty thousand <hi>Chariots;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 23</note> but hee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:25353:11"/>
breathed a dampe, an astonishment into
them, he imprinted a diuine terror in their
hearts, and they fought against one another.
<hi>God</hi> foresaw a diminution of his honour,<note place="margin">lud. 6.</note> in
the augmentation of <hi>Israels</hi> forces, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he reduced <hi>Gideons</hi> thirty two thousand
to three hundred persons. It was so in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
God does much with few, and it was so
in time, God does much, though late;
though God seeme a long time to haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
his people, yet in due time, that is, in his
time, he returnes to them againe. S. <hi>Augustine</hi>
makes a vsefull Historicall note, That that
land to which <hi>God</hi> brought the <hi>Children</hi> of
<hi>Israel,</hi> was their owne land before; they were
the right heires to it, lineally descended from
him, who was the first possessor of it, after
the floud: but they were so long out of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of it, as that they were neuer able to
set their title on foot; nay, they did scarce
know their own title, and yet <hi>God</hi> repossessed
them of it, reinuested them in it. It is so for
<hi>persons,</hi> and <hi>times</hi> in his wayes in this world,
Much with few, much though late, and it is
so in his wayes to the next world too: for <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
Elias</hi> knew of no more but himselfe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:25353:11"/>
that serued the right <hi>God</hi> aright: <hi>God</hi> makes
him know that there were seuen thousand
more; seuen thousand was much to one, but
it was little to all the world: and yet these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
thousand haue peopled heauen, and sent
vp all those <hi>Colonies</hi> thither; all those <hi>Armies</hi>
of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> those flockes of <hi>Lambes,</hi> inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
children, those <hi>Fathers,</hi> the Fathers of
the Church, and <hi>Mothers,</hi> holy Matrons, and
daughters, blessed <hi>Virgines,</hi> and learned and
laborious <hi>Doctors;</hi> these seuen thousand
haue filled vp the places of the fallen <hi>Angels,</hi>
and repeopled that Kingdome: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
we thinke them most worne out, <hi>God</hi>
at this time hath his remnant (as the <hi>Apostle</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 5.</note>
sayes) and <hi>God</hi> is able to make vp the whole
garment of that remnant. So he does much
with few, in the wayes to heauen; and that
he does much though late, in that way too,
thou mayest discerne in his working vpon
thy selfe. How often hast thou suffered thy
<hi>Soule,</hi> to grow cleane out of all reparations
into ruine, by thine inconsiderate and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
course of sinne, and neuer repaired it
by any good vse of hearing the word, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in a long time, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:25353:12"/>
when thou hast at any time, come to a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey
of thy conscience, how hast thou beene
affected with an inordinate apprehension of
<hi>Gods</hi> anger, and his inaccessiblenesse, his
inexorablenesse towards thee, and sunke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
into the iawes of desperation; And yet,
<hi>Quia manet semen dei,</hi> because the seed of
<hi>God</hi> hath remained in thee,<note place="margin">1. 10. 3. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Incubat Spiritus,</hi>
the Holy Ghost hath sat vpon that seed, and
hatched a new Creature in thee, a modest,
but yet infallible assurance of the Mercy of
thy God. Recollect all; in raysing of sieges,
and discomfiting of Armies, in restoring
possessions, and reinuesting right heires, in
repairing the ruines of the Kingdome of
heauen, depopulated in the fall of <hi>Angels,</hi> in
reestablishing peace of conscience; in a
presumptuous confidence, or ouer-timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
diffidence in <hi>God, God</hi> glorifies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
that way, to doe much with little.</p>
                  <p>He does so; but yet hee will haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<hi>God</hi> is a good <hi>Husband,</hi> a good <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
of Mans contributions, but contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he will haue: hee will haue a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
a cooperation of <hi>persons.</hi> Euen in
that great worke, which wee spake of at first,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:25353:12"/>
the first creation, which was so absolutely
of <hi>Nothing,</hi> yet there was a <hi>Faciamus,</hi> let <hi>vs,
vs,</hi> make Man; though but one <hi>God,</hi> yet
more <hi>Persons</hi> in that worke.<note place="margin">Matt. 43.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ</hi> had been
able to haue done as the Deuill would haue
had him doe, to haue made bread of stones,
when hee had so great a number to feed in
the Wildernesse; but hee does not so: Hee
askes his <hi>Disciples, Quot panes habetis;</hi> How
many loafes haue you? and though they
were but fiue, yet since they were some,
he multiplies them, and feeds aboue fiue
thousand with those fiue. Hee would haue
a remnant of <hi>Gedeons Armie</hi> to fight his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes:
A remnant of <hi>Israels beleeuers</hi> to make
vp his Kingdome; A remnant of thy <hi>Soule,</hi>
his seed wrapd vp somewhere, to saue thy
<hi>Soule;</hi> And a remnant of thy selfe, of thy
<hi>Mind,</hi> of thy <hi>Purse,</hi> of thy <hi>Person,</hi> for thy
temporall deliuerance. <hi>God</hi> goes lowe, and
accepts small Sacrifices; a Pigeon, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of Flower, a few eares of Corne; but
a Sacrifice he will haue. The <hi>Christian Church</hi>
implies a shrewd distresse, when shee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides
that reason, that clause in her prayer,
<hi>Quia non est alius, Giue Peace in our time, O
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:25353:13"/>
Lord, because there is no other that fighteth for
vs:</hi> If the bowels of compassion bee eaten
out, if the band of the Communion of Saints
be dissolued, we fight for none, none fights
for vs, at last ney ther we nor they shall fight
for <hi>Christ,</hi> nor <hi>Christ</hi> for them nor vs, but all
become a prey to the generall enemie of the
name of <hi>Christ;</hi> for <hi>God</hi> requires something,
some assistance, some concurrence, some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation,
though <hi>he can fight from heauen,
and the Starres, in their order, can fight against
Sisera.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, though God giue <hi>his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
to none, <hi>his glorie,</hi> that is to doe all with
<hi>Nothing,</hi> yet he giues them <hi>their glorie,</hi> that
doe any thing for him, or for themselues.
And as hee hath laid vp a record, for their
glorie and Memoriall, who were remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for Faith (for the eleuenth <hi>Chapter</hi> to
the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> is a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of them.) So in
this Song of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barake,</hi> hee hath
laide vp a Record for their glorie, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
their faith in <hi>Workes,</hi> and assisted his
seruice. That which is said in generall, <hi>The
Memorie of the iust is blessed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prou. 13. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>but the name of the

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:25353:13"/>
in particular, by him, who can performe
it, by <hi>Christ,</hi> to that woman, who anointed
him, That <hi>whersoeuer his Gospell should be Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in the whole world,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 13</note> ther should also this that
this woman had done, be told for a memoriall of
her.</hi> Shee assisted at his Funerall (as <hi>Christ</hi>
himselfe interprets her action, That <hi>shee
did it to burie him)</hi> and hath her glorie: how
shall he glorifie them, that aduance his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?
Shee hath her reward in his death; what
shall they haue, that keepe him, and his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
aliue? Not a verse in <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raks</hi>
song, and yet that is honourable eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
Not a commemoration at the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Gospell; and yet that is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
testimonie in this place, and at
these Exercises, of such as haue contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the conueniencies of these Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but they shall haue a place in the <hi>Booke
of life;</hi> indelibly in the Booke of life, if they
proceede in that deuotion of assisting <hi>Gods</hi>
cause, and doe not thinke, that they haue
done all, or done enough, if they haue
done something some one time. The <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man</hi> hath said well, and well applied it;
<hi>A Ship is a Ship for euer, if you repaire it.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plutar.</note> So,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:25353:14"/>
sayes hee, <hi>Honour is Honour,</hi> and so say wee,
<hi>A good Conscience is a good Conscience for euer,
if you repaire it:</hi> But, sayes he well, <hi>Aliquid
famae addendum, ne putrescat.</hi> Honour will
putrifie, and so will a good Conscience too,
if it be not repaired. He that hath done No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
must begin, and hee that hath done
something for <hi>Gods</hi> cause, must doe more,
if hee will continue his name in the Booke
of Life; though <hi>God</hi> leaue no one particular
action, done for his glorie, without glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
as those who assisted his glorie heere,
haue a glorious Commemoration in this
Song.</p>
                  <p>In the fifteenth verse, <hi>Princes</hi> haue their
place; <hi>The Princes of Issachar, were with Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah.</hi>
when the <hi>King</hi> goes to the field, Many,
who are in other cases Priuiledged, are by
their Tenures bound to goe. It is a high
<hi>Tenure</hi> to hold by a <hi>Crowne;</hi> And when <hi>God,</hi>
of whome, and whome onely they hold,
that hold so, goes into the field, it becomes
them to goe with him. But as <hi>God</hi> sits in
<hi>Heauen,</hi> and yet goes into the field, so they
of whome <hi>God</hi> hath said, <hi>Yee are Gods,</hi> the
<hi>Kings</hi> of the Earth, may stay at home, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:25353:14"/>
yet goe too. They goe in their assistance to
the <hi>Warre;</hi> They goe in their Mediation
for <hi>Peace;</hi> They goe in their <hi>Example,</hi> when
from their sweetnesse, and moderation in
their Gouernement at home, their flowes
out an instruction, a perswasion to Princes
abroad.<note place="margin">Verse 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Kings</hi> goe many times, and are not
thanked, because their wayes are not seene:
and <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe would not alwayes bee
seene; In the eight of <hi>Iohn,</hi> he would not be
seene. When they tooke vp stones to stone
him, he withdrew himselfe inuisibly, hee
would not be seene: When <hi>Princes</hi> find that
open actions exasperate,<note place="margin">Verse 17.</note> they doe best, if
they be not seene. In the sixth of <hi>Iohn, Christ</hi>
would not bee seene. When they would
haue put vpon him, that which was not fit
for him to take, when they would haue
made him <hi>King,</hi> he withdrew himselfe, and
was not seene. When <hi>Princes</hi> are tempted
to take Territories, or possessions in to their
hands, to which other <hi>Princes</hi> haue iust pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
they doe best, if they withdrawe
themselues from engagements in vnneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
Warres, for that, that onely was <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siahs</hi>
ruine. <hi>Kings</hi> cannot alwayes goe in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:25353:15"/>
the sight of Men, and so they lose their
thankes; but they cannot goe out of the
sight of <hi>God,</hi> and there they neuer lose
their reward: For <hi>the Lord that sees them in
secret, shall reward them openly,</hi> with peace
in their owne States, and Honour in their
owne <hi>Chronicles,</hi> as here, for assisting his
cause, hee gaue the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Issachar</hi> a
roome, a straine in <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barakes</hi>
Song.</p>
                  <p>And in the ninth verse, the <hi>Gouernors, the
great Officers,</hi> haue their place, in this praise,
<hi>My heart is towards the Gouernors of Israel that
offered themselues willingly.</hi> It is not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in person; Great <hi>Officers</hi> cannot doe
so; They are <hi>Intelligences</hi> that moue great
<hi>Spheares,</hi> but they must not bee mou'd out
of them. But their glorie here is their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse.
That before they were inquired
into, how they carried themselues in their
<hi>Offices,</hi> before they were intimidated, or
soupled with fines and ransomes, volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
they assisted the cause of <hi>God.</hi> Some in
the <hi>Romane Church</hi> write, that the <hi>Cardinalls</hi>
of that <hi>Church,</hi> are so incorporated into the
<hi>Pope,</hi> so much of his body, and so bloud of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:25353:15"/>
his bloud, that in a feuer they may not let
bloud without his leaue. Truly, the great
Persons and Gouernors in any state, are so
noble and neere parts of the <hi>King,</hi> as that
they may not bleed out in any subuentions
and assistances of such causes vnder-hand,
as are not auowd by the <hi>King;</hi> for, it is not
euident that that cause is <hi>Gods</hi> caufe; at least
not euident that that way is an assistance of
<hi>Gods</hi> cause, But a good, and tractable, and
ductile disposition, in all courses which
shall lawfully bee declared to bee for <hi>Gods</hi>
glorie, then, not <hi>Contra,</hi> but <hi>Praeter,</hi> not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
but besides, not in opposing, but in
preuenting the <hi>Kings</hi> will, before hee vrge,
before he presse, to be willing and forward
in such assistances, this giues great <hi>Persons,
Gouernors,</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> a verse in <hi>Baraks</hi> and
<hi>Deborahs</hi> Song, and <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Baraks</hi>
Song is the <hi>Word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Merchants</hi> haue their place in that
verse too. For, (as wee said before) <hi>those
who ride vpon white Asses,</hi> (which was as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
a transportation, as <hi>Coaches</hi> are now)
are by <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> amongst ours, and by
<hi>Serarius</hi> the <hi>Iesuit</hi> amongst others, well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:25353:16"/>
to be the <hi>Merchants.</hi> The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and the dignitie of the Merchants of
the <hi>East</hi> is sufficiently expressed in those of
<hi>Babylon, Thy Merchants were the great Men of
the Earth.</hi> And for the Merchants of the
<hi>West,</hi> we know that in diuers forraine parts,
their <hi>Nobilitie</hi> is in their <hi>Merchants,</hi> their
<hi>Merchants</hi> are their <hi>Gentlemen.</hi> And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
no place of the world, for Commodities
and Situation, better disposed then this
<hi>Kingdome,</hi> to make Merchants great. You
cannot shew your greatnesse more, then
in seruing <hi>God,</hi> with part of it; you did serue
before you were free; but here you do both
at once, for his seruice is perfect freedome.
I am not here to day, to beg a <hi>Beneuolence</hi> for
any particular cause on foot now: there is
none; but my Errand in this first part is, first
to remoue iealousies and suspitions of <hi>Gods</hi>
neglecting his businesse, because he does
it not at our appointment, and then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
and aduance a disposition, to assist
his cause and his glory, in all wayes, which
shall bee declar'd to conduce thereunto,
whether in his body, by relieuing the poore,
or in his house by repairing these walls, or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:25353:16"/>
in his honour in employments more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique:
And to assure you that you cannot
haue a better <hi>debter,</hi> a better <hi>pay-master</hi> then
<hi>Christ Iesus:</hi> for all your Entayles, and all
your perpetuities doe notso nayle, so hoope
in, so riuet an estate in your posteritie, as to
make the <hi>Sonne of God your Sonne too,</hi> and to
giue <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> a Childes part, with the rest
of your Children. It is noted (perchaunce
but out of leuity) that your Children doe
not keepe that which you get: It is but a
calumny, or but a fascination of ill wishers.
We haue many happy instances to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
many noble families deriued from
you; One, enough to enoble a World;
<hi>Queene</hi> ELIZABETH was the great gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child
of a <hi>Lord Maior of London.</hi> Our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>God</hi> blesse all your Estates, and blesse
your posteritie in a blessed enioying therof;
But truly it is a good way to that, amongst
all your purchases, to purchase a place in
<hi>Barak</hi> and <hi>Deborahs</hi> Song, a testimonie of
the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> that you were forward in
all due times in the assistance of <hi>Gods</hi> cause.</p>
                  <p>That testimonie, in this Seruice in our
Text, haue the <hi>Iudges</hi> of the Land, in the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:25353:17"/>
verse too, <hi>ye that sit in Iudgement.</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Men exercised in <hi>Iudgement,</hi> are likeliest
to thinke of the <hi>last Iudgement.</hi> Men accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to giue <hi>Iudgement,</hi> likeliest to thinke
of the <hi>Iudgement</hi> they are to receiue. And
at that last <hi>Iudgement</hi> the <hi>Malediction</hi> of the
left hand falls vpon them that haue not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored
<hi>Christ,</hi> not fed him, not clothed him,
And when <hi>Christ</hi> comes to want those things
in that degree, that his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> his <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
himselfe</hi> cannot subsist, where it did,
without such a sustentation, an omission in
such an assistance, is much more heauie.
All <hi>Iudgements</hi> end in this, <hi>Suum cui<expan>

euery one his owne.</hi> Giue <hi>God</hi> his owne, and
hee hath enough; giue him his owne, in his
owne place, and his cause will be preferred
before any Ciuill or Naturall obligation.
But <hi>God</hi> requires not that: pay euery other
Man first, <hi>owe nothing to any Man;</hi> pay your
<hi>Children,</hi> apportion them conuenient por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Pay your estimation, your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

ranke and calling calls for: when all this is
done, of your superfluities beginne to pay
<hi>God,</hi> and euen for that you shall haue your

<hi>Assistants,</hi> and <hi>Coadiutors</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>For a farre vnlikelier sort of people, then
any of these, haue that in the same verse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
<hi>Ambulantes super viam, They that walke vp
and downe</hi> idle, discourcing Men, Men of
no Calling, of no Profession, of no sense of
other Mens miseries, and yet they assist
this cause. Men that sucke the sweet of the
Earth, and the sweat of other Men: Men
that pay the State nothing in doing the
offices of mutuall societie, and embracing
particular vocations; Men that make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
but pipes to receiue and conuay, and
vent rumors, but spunges to sucke in, and
powre out foule water; Men that doe not
spend time, but weare time, they trade not,
they plough not, they preach not, they plead
not, but walke, and walke vpon the way,
till they haue walked out their sixe moneths
for the renuing of bands, euen these had
some remorse in <hi>Gods</hi> cause, euen these got
into <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Baraks</hi> Song for assisting
there.</p>
                  <p>And lesse; that is, <hi>Poorer</hi> then these: for
in the <hi>Second</hi> verse, the people are as forward
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:25353:18"/>
as the <hi>Gouernors,</hi> in the <hi>Ninth, They offered
themselues willingly.</hi> They might offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
their persons. It is likely they did;
and likely that many of them had nothing
to offer but themselues. And when Men
of that pouertie offer, part easily with that
which was hardly got, how acceptable to
<hi>God,</hi> that Sacrifice is, we see in <hi>Christs</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of that <hi>Widdow,</hi> who amongst many
great giuers gaue her Mite, <hi>That shee gaue
more then all they, because shee gaue all:</hi> which
testified not onely her <hi>Liberalitie</hi> to God, but
her <hi>Confidence</hi> in God, that though shee left
nothing, shee should not lacke: for that
right vse doth Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> make of that
example, <hi>Diuites largiuntur securi de diuitijs,
pauper securus de Domino: A rich man giues,
and feeles it not, feares no want, because hee is
sure of a full chest at home; A poore man giues,
and feeles it as little, because hee is sure of a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
God in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God</hi> then can worke alone; there wee set
out: yet he does require assistance; that way
wee went: And to those that doe assist, hee
giues glory here; so farre we are gone: but
yet this remaynes, that hee layes notes of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:25353:18"/>
blame, and reproach vpon them, whom
collaterall respects withdrew from this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.
For there is a kind of reproach
and increpation laide vpon <hi>Reuben</hi> in that
question, <hi>Why abodest thou amongst the sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds?
The diuisions of</hi> REVBEN <hi>were great
thoughts of heart.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 16.</note> Ambition of precedencie
in places of employment, greatnes of heart,
and a lothnesse to be vnder the commaund
of any other, and so an incoherence, not
concurring in Counsailes and Executions,
retard oftentimes euen the cause of God.
So is there also a reproach and increpation
vpon <hi>Dan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 17.</note> in that question, why did <hi>Dan</hi>
remaine in his ships; A confidence in their
owne strength, a sacrificing to their owne
Nets, an attributing of their securitie to
their owne wisedome or power, may also
retard the cause of God; that stayed <hi>Dan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde.</p>
                  <p>Thus then they haue their <hi>thankes</hi> that
doe, thus their <hi>markes</hi> that doe not assist in
<hi>Gods</hi> cause: though <hi>God</hi> to encourage them
that doe, accomplish his worke himselfe,
<hi>They fought from heauen, The Starres in their
order fought against Sisera. They fought,</hi> sayes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:25353:19"/>
the <hi>Text,</hi> but does not tell vs who; least men
should direct their thankes for that which is
past, or their prayers for future benefits, to
any other, euen in heauen, then to <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
The stars are nam'd; It could not be
feared that Men would pray to them, sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to them, <hi>Angels &amp; Saints</hi> are not named;
Men might come to ascribe to them, that
which appertained to <hi>God</hi> onely Now these
<hi>Stars,</hi> sayes the text, <hi>fought in their courses, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentes
in Ordine,</hi> they fought not disorderly.
It was no <hi>Enchantment,</hi> no <hi>Sorcery,</hi> no disord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the frame, or the powers, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of these heauenly bodies, in fauor
of the <hi>Israelites; God</hi> would not be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to the <hi>Deuill,</hi> or to <hi>Witches,</hi> for his best
friends. It was no disorderly Enchantment,
nor it was no <hi>Miracle,</hi> that disordered these
Starres; as in <hi>Iosuahs</hi> time, the <hi>Sunne</hi> and
<hi>Moone</hi> were disordred in their Motions; But
as <hi>Iosephus,</hi> who relates this battaile more
particularly, sayes, with whom all agree, <hi>The
natur all Influence of these heauenly bodies, at this
time, had created and gathered such stormes and
hayles, as blowing vehemently in the Enemies
face, was the cause of this defeate:</hi> for so wee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:25353:19"/>
might haue said, in that deliuerance, which
God gaue vs at Sea, <hi>They fought from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
The Starres in their order fought against
the Enemie.</hi> Without coniuring, without
<hi>Miracle,</hi> from heauen, but yet by naturall
meanes, God preserued vs. For that is the
force of that phrase, and of that maner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
it, <hi>Manentes in Ordine, The Starres,
containing themselues in their Order, fought.</hi>
And that phrase induces our second part,
the accommodation, the occasionall appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of these words: <hi>God will not fight, nor
be fought for disorderly;</hi> And therefore in illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
and confirmation of those words
of the <hi>Apostle, Let all things be done decently,
and in order, Aquinas,</hi> in his <hi>Commentaries</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that place, cites, and applies this Text,
as words to the same purpose, and of the
same signification. You, sayes Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
you who are Stars in the Church, must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
in your warfare, decently, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for the stars of heauen, when they fight
for the <hi>Lord,</hi> they doe their seruice, <hi>Manen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
in Ordine, containing themselues in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
And so inour order, we are come to our
second part. In which, we owe you by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:25353:20"/>
made at first, an <hi>Analysis,</hi> a distribution
of the steps and branches of this part, now
when wee are come to the handling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
And thus wee shall proceede; first, the
<hi>Warre,</hi> which wee are to speake of here, is
not as before, a <hi>Worldly warre,</hi> it is a <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
War:</hi> And then the <hi>Munition,</hi> the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for this warre, is not as before, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
assistance of <hi>Princes, Officers, Iudges,
Merchants,</hi> all sorts of <hi>People,</hi> but it is the
<hi>Gospell of Christ Iesus, and the preaching thereof.</hi>
Preaching is <hi>Gods</hi> ordinance, with that <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
hee fights from heauen, and batters
downe all errors. And thirdly, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this War, he hath made <hi>Preachers Stars;</hi>
and <hi>vae si non, woe be vnto them, if they doe not
fight, if they doe not preach:</hi> But yet in the last
place, they must fight, as the Stars in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
doe, <hi>In their order,</hi> in that Order, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to those directions, which, they, to
whom it appertaines, shall giue them: for
that is <hi>to fight in Order.</hi> And in these foure
branches, wee shall determine this second
part.</p>
                  <p>First then we are in Contemplation of
<hi>a Spirituall warre;</hi> now, though there be a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:25353:20"/>
                     <hi>Beatie Pacifici,</hi> a blessing reserued to <hi>Peace-makers,</hi>
to <hi>the Peace-maker, our Peace-maker,
who</hi> hath sometimes effected it in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and alwayes seriously and chargeably,
and honourably endeuoured it in all places,
yet there is a <hi>spirituall Warre,</hi> in which,
<hi>Maledicti Pacifici;</hi> Cursed bee they that goe
about to make Peace, and to make all one,
The warres betweene <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Beliall. Let
no man seuer those whom God hath ioyned,</hi> but
let no Man ioyne those whom <hi>God</hi> hath
seuered neyther; and <hi>God</hi> hath seuered <hi>Christ</hi>
and <hi>Belial:</hi> and that was <hi>Gods</hi> action, <hi>Ponam
inimicitias;</hi> The seed of the woman, and the
Seed of the Serpent, wee and the Deuill,
should neuer haue fallen out; wee agree
but too well; but God hath put an enmity
betweene vs. God hath put <hi>Truth</hi> and
<hi>Falshood, Idolatrie</hi> and <hi>Sinceritie</hi> so farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder,
and infused such an incompatibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and imprinted such an implacabilitie
betweene them, as that they cannot flow
into one another: And therefore, there,
<hi>Maledicti Pacifici,</hi> It is an opposition against
God, by any colourable Modifications, to
reconcile opinions diametrally contrary to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:25353:21"/>
one another, in fundamentall things. <hi>Day</hi>
and <hi>Night</hi> may ioyne and meet. <hi>In Diluculis</hi>
and in <hi>Crepusculis,</hi> The dawning of the day,
in the Morning, and the shutting in of the
day in the Euening, make day and night
so much one, as sometimes you cannot tell
which to call them: but <hi>Lux &amp; tenebrae,</hi> light
and darknes, <hi>Midnight</hi> and <hi>Noone</hi> neuer met,
neuer ioynd. There are points, which passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men, and vehemence of disputation,
haue carried farther a sunder then needed:
and these indeed haue made the greatest
noyse; because vpon these, for the most part,
depends the matter of profit: and <hi>Beati paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fics,</hi>
blessed were that labour, and that labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
that could reconcile those things; and of
that there might bee hope, because it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
but the Persons that fight, it is not the
thing, the matters are not so different. But
then there are matters so different, as that
a Man may sit at home, and weepe, and
wish, prayse God that hee is in the right,
and pray to God for them that are in the
wrong, but to thinke that they are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
and <hi>all one, Maledicti Pacifici,</hi>
hee that hath brought such a Peace, hath
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:25353:21"/>
brought a curse vpon his owne Conscience,
and layd, not a <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> but a <hi>Stupefaction</hi>
vpon it. A <hi>Turke</hi> might perchance say, in
scorne of vs both, They call you <hi>Heretiques,</hi>
you call them <hi>Idolaters,</hi> why might not <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi>
and <hi>Heretiques</hi> agree well enough to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?
But a true <hi>Christian</hi> will neuer
make <hi>Contrarieties in fundamentall things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi>
neuer make foundations, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peredifications,
the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and the
Traditions of Men, all one. Euery man is a
little world, sayes the <hi>Philosopher;</hi> Euery
man is a little <hi>Church</hi> too; and in euery man,
there are two sides, two armies: the flesh
fights against the Spirit. This is but a <hi>Ciuill
warre,</hi> nay it is but a <hi>Rebellion</hi> indeed; and
yet it can neuer be absolutely quenched. So
euery Man is also a Souldier in that great
and generall warre, betweene <hi>Christ,</hi> and
<hi>Beliall,</hi> the word of <hi>God,</hi> and the will of
man. Euery man is bound to hearken to a
peace, in such things as may admit peace, in
differences, where men differ from men; but
bound also to shut himselfe vp against all
ouertures of peace, in such things, as are in
their Nature irreconcileable, in differences
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:25353:22"/>
where men differ from <hi>God.</hi> That warre
<hi>God</hi> hath kindled, and that warre must bee
maintained, and maintained by his way; and
his way, and his <hi>Ordinance</hi> in this warre, is
Preaching.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>God</hi> had not said to <hi>Noah, Fac tibi Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam;</hi>
and when he had said so, if he had not
giuen him a <hi>Deseigne,</hi> a <hi>Modell,</hi> a <hi>Platforme</hi> of
that <hi>Arke,</hi> we may doubt credibly, whether
euer man would haue thought of a <hi>Ship,</hi>
or of any such way of trade &amp; Commerce.
Shipping was Gods owne Inuention, and
therein <hi>Laetentur Insulae,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> sayes, <hi>Let
the Ilands reioyce.</hi> So also, if <hi>Christ</hi> had not
said to his <hi>Apostles, Ite praedicate, Goe and
preach:</hi> and when hee had said so, said thus
much more, <hi>Qui non crediderit damnabitur,
Hee that beleeues not your Preaching shall bee
damned:</hi> certainly man would neuer haue
thought of such a way of establishing a
kingdome, as by Preaching. No other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had any such Institution, as Preaching.
In the <hi>Romane</hi> State, there was a publique
Officer, <hi>Conditor precum,</hi> who vpon great
emergent occasions, deprecations of immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
dangers, or Gratulations for euident
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:25353:22"/>
benefites, did make particular <hi>Collects</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to those occasions: And some
such occasionall <hi>Panegyriques,</hi> and gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
Orations for temporall benefites,
they had in that state. But a fixt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
course of conteyning Subiects in their
Religious and Ciuill duties, by preaching,
onely <hi>God</hi> ordain'd, onely his Children en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy'd.
Christ when he sent his <hi>Apostles,</hi> did
not giue them a particular command, <hi>Ite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi>
goe and pray in the publique Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
All Nations were accustomed to
that; Christ made no doubt of any mans
opposing, or questioning publique Prayer;
and therefore for that, he onely said, <hi>Sic ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitis,</hi>
Not go, and pray, but, <hi>when you pray,
pray thus,</hi> he instructed them in the forme;
the duty was well knowne to all before.
But, for Preaching, He himselfe was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for that, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is vpon me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esa. 61. 1</note>
                     <hi>because the Lord hath anointed mee to preach:</hi>
His vnction was his function. Hee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
with that power, and hee hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
vs with part of his owne vnction:
<hi>All power is giuen vnto me,</hi> sayes he, <hi>in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and in Earth;</hi> and therefore (as he adds
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:25353:23"/>
there) <hi>Go ye,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 28. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>and preach:</hi> Because I haue all
power, for preaching, take yee part of my
power, and preach too. For, Preaching is
<hi>the power of God vnto Saluation, and the sauor
of life vnto life.</hi> When therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi>
faies,<note place="margin">I. Thes. 5. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Quench not the Spirit, Nec in te, nec in alio,</hi>
sayes <hi>Aquinas;</hi> Quench it not in your selfe,
by forbearing to heare the Word preached,
quench it not in others, by discouraging
them that doe preach. For so Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi>
(and not he alone) vnderstood that
place, <hi>That they quench the spirit, who discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
preaching, and dishearten Preachers.</hi>
St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> tooke his example from the
<hi>Lampe</hi> that burnt by him, when hee was
preaching; (It seemes therefore hee did
preach in the afternoone) and he sayes, <hi>you
may quench this Lampe, by putting in water, and
you may quench it by taking out the oyle.</hi> So a
Man may quench the spirit in himselfe, if
hee smother it, suffocate it, with worldly
pleasures, or profits, and he may quench it
in others, if he withdraw that fauour, or
that helpe, which keepes that Man, who
hath the spirit of Prophesie, the vnction of
Preaching, in a cheerefull discharge of his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:25353:23"/>
duty. Preaching then being <hi>Gods Ordinance,</hi>
to beget Faith, to take away preaching, were
to disarme <hi>God,</hi> and to quench the spirit; for
by that <hi>Ordinance, he fights from heauen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to maintaine that fight, hee hath
made his <hi>Ministers Starrs;</hi> as they are called,
in the first of the <hi>Reuelation.</hi> And they fight
against <hi>Sisera,</hi> that is, they preach against
<hi>Error.</hi> They preach out of Necessitie; <hi>Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
is laid vpon me to preach,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 16.</note> saies the <hi>Apostle;</hi>
and vpon a heauy penalty, if they doe not;
<hi>Vaemihi si non, VVoe be vnto me if I doe not
preach the Gospell.</hi> Neither is that spoak there
with the case of a <hi>Future,</hi> as the <hi>Roman tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation</hi>
hath it, <hi>Si non Euangelizauero,</hi> If I do
not hereafter preach; If I preach not at one
time or other; If I preach not when I see
how things wil go, what kind of preaching
will be most acceptable: But it is <hi>Si non E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelizem,</hi>
If I preach not now; now,
though I had preached <hi>yesterday;</hi> for so
Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> preached his Sermon <hi>de sancto
Latrone,</hi> of the good Thiefe, <hi>Hesterno die,</hi>
yesterday I told you &amp;c. So Saint <hi>Augustin</hi>
preached his Sermon vpon <hi>All Saints day:</hi>
And so did Saint <hi>Bernard his twelfth Sermon</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:25353:24"/>
vpon the <hi>Psalm: Qui habitat.</hi> Now, though
I preachd but lately before; and now,
though I had but late warning to preach
now; So S. <hi>Basil</hi> preached his <hi>2. Sermon</hi> vpon
the <hi>Hexameron,</hi> the fixe daies worke, when
he had but that Morning for Meditation:
and more then so, in his <hi>2. Sermon de Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimo;</hi>
for, it seemes he preached that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any premeditation <hi>Prout suggerit spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
sanctus.</hi> Now, though I had not time
to labour a <hi>Sermon,</hi> and now, though I
preach in <hi>another mans place;</hi> for so Saint
<hi>Augustine preached</hi> his Sermon vpon the 95.
<hi>Psalm:</hi> where he saies, <hi>Frater noster Seuerus,
our brother Seuerus should by promise haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
here, but since he comes not, I will.</hi> Now,
that is whensoeuer <hi>Gods</hi> good people may
be edified by my preaching: <hi>Vaesi non,</hi> wo
be vnto me, if I doe not preach. <hi>The Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
drew a third part of the starrs from heauen.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 12. 3.</note>
                     <hi>Antichrist</hi> by his Persecutions, and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
Silenc'd many; all that would
not Magnifie him. And many amongst vs,
haue silenc'd themselues: Abundance silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
some, and lazines and Ignorance some,
and some their owne indiscretion, and then
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:25353:24"/>
they lay that vpon the <hi>Magistrate.</hi> But God
hath plac'd vs in a <hi>Church,</hi> and vnder <hi>a Head
of the Church,</hi> where none are Silenc'd, nor
discountenanc'd, if being <hi>starrs,</hi> called to
the <hi>Ministery</hi> of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and appointed to
<hi>fight,</hi> to preach there, they fight within the
discipline and limits of this Text, <hi>Manentes
in Ordine, conteining themselues in Order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this phrase, as we told you before, out
of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> the same thing is intended, as in
that place of Saint <hi>Paul, Let all things bee
done decently, and in Order.</hi> That the <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
edition</hi> reads, <hi>Fiant honeste;</hi> and then
saies Saint <hi>Ambrose, Honeste fit, quod cum pace
fit, That is done honestly, and decently, which is
done quietly, and peaceably.</hi> Not with a peace,
and indifferencie to contrary Opinions in
fundamentall doctrines, not to shuffle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
together, and make it all one which
you chufe, but a peace with persons, an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence
from contumelies, and reuilings.
It is true that wee must hate <hi>Gods</hi> enemies
with a <hi>perfect hatred,</hi> and it is true that <hi>Saint
Chrysostome</hi> sayes, <hi>Odium perfectum est, odium
consummatissimum,</hi> that is not a perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
that leaues out any of their Errors vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hated.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:25353:25"/>
But yet a perfect hatred is that too,
which may consist with perfection, and
Charitie is perfection: a perfect hatred is
that which a perfect, that is, a charitable
man may beare, which is still to hate <hi>Errors,</hi>
not <hi>Persons.</hi> When their insolencies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
vs to speake of them, we shall doe no
good therein, if therein we proceed not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently,
and in order. <hi>Christ</hi> sayes of his
<hi>Church: Terribilis vt Castrorum acies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 6. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>It is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull
as an Armie;</hi> but it is <hi>vt acies ordinata,
as an armie disciplin'd, and in order:</hi> for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
order, an armie is but a great Ryot; and
without this decencie, this peaceablenesse,
this discretion, this order, zeale is but fury,
and such preaching is but to the obduration
of ill, not to the edification of good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
<hi>Saint Paul</hi> in his absence from the
<hi>Colossians,</hi> reioyces as much in beholding
their <hi>Order,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 2. 5.</note> as in their stedfastnesse in the
faith of <hi>Christ Iesus:</hi> Nay, if wee consider
the wordes well, as <hi>Saint Chrysostome</hi> hath
done, we shall see that it is onely their <hi>Order</hi>
that he reioyces in: for <hi>Non dixit fidem, sed
firmamentum fidei,</hi> sayes that Father, <hi>It was not
their faith, but that which established their faith,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:25353:25"/>
that was their order, that occasioned his ioy.</hi> For
when there is not an vniforme, a comely,
an orderly presenting of matters of faith,
faith it selfe growes loose, and loses her esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
and preaching in the <hi>Church</hi> comes
to bee as pleading at the Barre, and not so
well: there the Counsell speakes not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but him that sent him, here wee shall
preach not him who sent vs, <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> but
our selues. <hi>Study to bee quiet, and to doe your

                     <note place="margin">I Thes. 4. 11.</note>
It seemes some amongst them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyd
that: and therefore hee writes no
more to particular persons, but to the whol
<hi>Church,</hi> in his other <hi>Epistle,</hi> and with more
vehemence, then a smal matter would haue

                     <hi>that you withdraw your selfe

                     <note place="margin">Psal. 51</note> but a <hi>troublesome spirit</hi>
is farre from it. I am glad that our <hi>Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>

and being met haue his further leaue, to

a <hi>Praebendo,</hi> then a <hi>Praebenda,</hi> rather for
giuing example of obedience to Orders,
then for any other respect. In the <hi>Remane
Church</hi> the most disorderly men, are their

men in <hi>Orders.</hi> I speake not of the vicious<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse
of their life, I am no Iudge of that, I
know not that: but they are so out of all
Order, that they are within Rule of no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

Magistrate, no secular Iudge. They
may kill <hi>Kings,</hi> and yet can be no <hi>Traytors;</hi>
they assigne their reason, <hi>Because they are no

shall be <hi>Metaphorically</hi> hang'd, he shall bee

vse modestly the Priuiledges which godly
Princes, out of their pietie haue affoorded
vs, and which their godly Successors haue
giuen vs againe by their gracious continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them to vs; but our Profession of it
selfe, naturally (though the very nature of
it dispose Princes to a gracious disposition
to vs) exempts vs not from the tye of their
Laws. All men are in deed, we are in <hi>Deed</hi>
and in name too, <hi>Men of Orders;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought to be most ready of all others

                  <p>Now, beloued,<note place="margin">Aquin.</note>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:25353:27"/>
implyes some by whom wee are to
be ordered, and it implyes our conformitie
to him. Who is that? <hi>God</hi> certainly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all question, <hi>God.</hi> But between <hi>God,</hi> and
<hi>Man,</hi> we consider a two-fold <hi>Order.</hi> One, as
all creatures depend vpon <hi>God,</hi> as vpon their
beginning, for their very <hi>Being;</hi> and so eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
creature is wrought vpon immediately
by <hi>God,</hi> and whether hee discerne it or no,
does obey <hi>Gods</hi> order, that is, that which
<hi>God</hi> hath ordained, his purpose, his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is executed vpon him, &amp; accomplishd
in him. But then the other <hi>Order</hi> is, not as
man depends vpon <hi>God,</hi> as vpon his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but as he is to be reduced and brought
back to <hi>God,</hi> as to his end: &amp; that is done by
meanes in this world. What is that meanes?
for those things which wee haue now in
consideration, the <hi>Church.</hi> But <hi>the body</hi> speaks
not, the <hi>head</hi> does. It is the <hi>Head of the Church</hi>
that declares to vs those things wherby we
are to be ordered.</p>
                  <p>This the <hi>Royall</hi> and <hi>religious Head</hi> of these
<hi>Churches</hi> within his Dominions hath lately
had occasion to do. And in doing this, doth
he innouate any thing, ofter to doe any new
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:25353:27"/>
thing? Do we repent that <hi>Canon, &amp; Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
in which at his <hi>Maiesties</hi> first comming
we declar'd with so much alacrity, as that it
was the second <hi>Canon</hi> we made, <hi>That the King
had the same authoritie in causes Ecclesiasticall,
that the godly Kings of Iudah, and the Christian
Emperors in the primitiue Church had?</hi> Or are
we ignorant what those <hi>Kings of Iuda,</hi> and
those <hi>Emperors</hi> did? We are not, wee know
them well. Take it where the power of the
<hi>Empire</hi> may seem somwhat declin'd in <hi>Charls
the great;</hi> we see by those <hi>Capitularies</hi> of his,
that remain yet, what <hi>orders</hi> he gaue in such
causes; there he saies in his entrance to them,
<hi>Nemo praesumptuosum dicat; Let no man call this
that I doe an vsurpation, to prescribe Orders in
these cases, Nam legimus quid Iosias fecerit, We
haue read what Iosiah did, and we know that wee
haue the same Authoritie that Iosiab had.</hi> But,
that <hi>Emperor</hi> consulted with his <hi>Cleargie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he published those <hi>Orders.</hi> It is true, he
sayes he did. But he, from whom we haue
receiued these <hi>Orders,</hi> did more then so; His
<hi>Maiesty</hi> forbore, till a representation of some
inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences by disorderly preaching, was
made to him, by those in the highest place
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:25353:28"/>
in our <hi>Clergie,</hi> and other graue and reuerend
<hi>Prelates</hi> of this <hi>Church;</hi> they presented it to
him, and thereupon he entred into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.
But that <hi>Emperour</hi> did but declare
things constituted by other Counsells be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
but yet the giuing the life of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to those Constitutions in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
was introductory, and many of the
things themselues were so. Amongst them,
his 70. <hi>Capitularie</hi> is appliable to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
case; there hee sayes, <hi>Episcopi videant,
That the Bishops take care, that all Preachers
preach to the people the Exposition of the Lords
Prayer:</hi> and he enioynes them too, <hi>Ne quid
nouum, ne quid non Canonicum, That no man
preach any new opinion of his owne;</hi> nay, though
it bee the opinion of other learned men in
other places, yet if it be <hi>Non Canonicum,</hi> not
declared in the <hi>vniuersall Church,</hi> not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in <hi>that Church,</hi> in which he hath his stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he may not preach it to the people: And
so he proceeds there to <hi>Catechistical Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is not new then, which the <hi>Kings
of Iudah</hi> did, and which the Christian <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi>
did. But it is new to vs, if the <hi>Kings</hi>
of this kingdome haue not done it. Haue
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:25353:28"/>
they not done it? How little the <hi>Kings</hi> of
this kingdome did in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> causes
then, when by their conniuence that power
was deuold into a forraine Prelates hand, it
is pitie to consider, pitie to remember, pitie
to bring into Contemplation; And yet tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
euen then our <hi>Kings</hi> did exercise more of
that power, then our aduersaries who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it, will confesse. But, since the true iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
was vindicated, and reapplyed to
the Crowne, in what iust heighth <hi>Henry the
eight,</hi> and those who gouerned his Sonnes
minoritie, <hi>Edward the sixt,</hi> exercised that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> causes, none, that
knowes their story, knowes not. And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
ordinarily, we settle our selues best in
the Actions, and Precedents of the late
<hi>Queene</hi> of blessed and euerlasting memory,
I may haue leaue to remember them that
know, and to tell them that know not, one
act of her power and her wisedome, to this
purpose. When some <hi>Articles</hi> concerning
the falling away from Iustifying grace, and
other poynts that beat vpon that haunt, had
been ventilated, in Conuenticles, and in
Pulpits too, and Preaching on both sides
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:25353:29"/>
past, and that some persons of great place
and estimation in our <hi>Church,</hi> together with
him who was the greatest of all, amongst
our Clergy, had vpon mature deliberation
established a resolution what should bee
thought, and taught, held and preached in
those poynts, and had thereupon sent down
that resolution to be published in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie,
not vulgarly neither, to the people,
but in a Sermon, <hi>Ad Clerum</hi> onely, yet her
<hi>Maiestie</hi> being informed thereof, declared
her displeasure so, as that, scarse any houres
before the Sermon was to haue been, there
was a Countermaund, an Inhibition to the
Preacher for medling with any of those
poynts. Not that her <hi>Maiestie</hi> made her selfe
<hi>Iudge of the Doctrines,</hi> but that nothing, not
formerly declared to be so, ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be the <hi>Tenet,</hi> and Doctrine of this
Church, her <hi>Maiestie</hi> not being acquainted,
nor supplicated to giue her gracious allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
for the publication thereof.</p>
                  <p>His sacred <hi>Maiestie</hi> then, is herein vpon
the steps of the <hi>Kings of Iudah,</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Emperours,</hi> of the <hi>Kings of England,</hi> of
all the <hi>Kings of England,</hi> that embraced the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:25353:29"/>
Reformation of <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> her selfe;
and he is vpon <hi>his owne</hi> steps too. For, it is a
seditious calumny to apply this which is
done now, to any occasion that rises but
now: as though the <hi>King</hi> had done this
now, for satisfaction of any persons at this
time, for some yeares since, when hee was
pleased to call the <hi>Heads of Houses</hi> from the
Vniuersity, and intimate to them the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences
that arose from the Preaching of
such men, as were not at all conuersant in
the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in the <hi>Schoole,</hi> nor in the <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
Storie,</hi> but had shut vp themselues in
a few later Writers; and gaue order to those
<hi>Gouernours</hi> for remedy herein. Then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
then he laid the foundation for that, in
which hee hath proceeded thus much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
now, to reduce Preaching neerer to the
manner of those Primitiue times, when <hi>God</hi>
gaue so euident, and so remarkable blessings
to mens Preaching.</p>
                  <p>Consider more particularly that which
hee hath done now; His <hi>Maiestie</hi> hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
his most gracious Letter to the
<hi>most Reueuerend Father in God, my Lords Grace
of Canterbury,</hi> with certaine <hi>Directions</hi> how
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:25353:30"/>
Preachers ought to behaue themselues in
the exercise of <hi>that part</hi> of their Ministerie.
These being deriued from his <hi>Grace,</hi> in due
course to his <hi>reuerend Brethren,</hi> the other <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
our <hi>Worthy Diocesan,</hi> euer vigilant for
the Peace and vnitie of the <hi>Church,</hi> gaue a
speedy, very speedy intimation thereof, to
the <hi>Clergie</hi> of his Iurisdiction; so did others,
to whom it appertain'd so to doe in theirs.
Since that, his <hi>Maiestie,</hi> who alwaies taking
good workes in hand, loues to perfect his
owne works, hath vouchsafed to giue some
<hi>Reasons</hi> of this his proceeding; which being
signified by him to whome the <hi>State</hi> and
<hi>Church</hi> owes much, <hi>The right Reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in God, the Bishop of Lincolne, Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the great Seale,</hi> and after by him also,
who began at first, his <hi>Maiesties</hi> pleasure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
thereby, (as he is too <hi>Great,</hi> and too
<hi>Good</hi> a <hi>King</hi> to seeke corners, or disguises, for
his actions) that these proceedings should
be made publique, I was not willing only,
but glad to haue my part therein, that as, in
the feare of God, I haue alwayes preached
to you the <hi>Gospell of Christ Iesus,</hi> who is the
<hi>God</hi> of your Saluation; So in the testimony
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:25353:30"/>
of a good conscience, I might now preach
to you, <hi>the Gospell of the Holy ghost,</hi> who is the
<hi>God of peace,</hi> of vnitie, and concord.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Directions</hi> then, and the <hi>Reasons</hi> of
them, by his <hi>Maiesties</hi> particular care, euery
man in the Ministery may see &amp; write out,
in the seuerall <hi>Registers Offices,</hi> with his
owne hand for nothing, and for very little,
if hee vse the hand of another. Perchance
you haue, at your conuenience, you may see
them. When you do, you shall see, That his
<hi>Maiesties</hi> generall intention therein is, to put
a difference, between graue, and solid, from
light and humerous preaching. <hi>Origen</hi> does
so, when vpon the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> he
sayes, <hi>There is a great difference, Inter praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care,
&amp; docere:</hi> A man may teach an Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
that is, make them know something
that they knew not before, and yet not
preach; for Preaching is to make them
knowthings appertaining to their saluation.
But when men doe neither, neither Teach,
nor Preach, but (as his <hi>Maiestie</hi> obserues the
manner to bee) <hi>To soare in poynts too deepe,
To muster vp their owne Reading, To display
their owne Wit, or Ignorance in medling with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:25353:31"/>
matters,</hi> or (as his <hi>Maiestie</hi> addes) <hi>in rude
and vndecent reuiling of persons:</hi> this is that
which hath drawen downe his <hi>Maiesties</hi>
piercing Eye to see it, and his Royall care to
correct it. Hee corrects it by <hi>Christs</hi> owne
way, <hi>Quid ab initio,</hi> by considering how it
was at first: for, (as himselfe to right pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
cites <hi>Tertullian) Id verum quod primum;
That is best, which was first.</hi> Hee would
therefore haue vs conuersant in <hi>Antiquitie:</hi>
For, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> askes that question with
some scorne, <hi>Quis est qui veritatis prepugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem,
vnius diei spatio, velut eluto statuam,
fingit.</hi> Can any man hope to make a good
Preacher, as soone as a good Picture? In
three or foure dayes, or with three or foure
Books? His <hi>Maiesty</hi> therfore cals vs to look,
<hi>Quid primum,</hi> what was first in the whole
<hi>Church?</hi> And againe, <hi>Quid primum,</hi> when we
receiued the Reformation in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi>
by what meanes, (as his <hi>Maiestie</hi> expresseth
it) <hi>Papistry was driuen out, and Puritanisme
kept out,</hi> and <hi>wee deliuered from the Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Papist, and the madnesse of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi>
as before hee expresseth it: and his
religious and iudicious eye sees clearly, That
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:25353:31"/>
all that Doctrine, which wrought this great
cure vpon vs, in the Reformation, is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the two <hi>Catechismes,</hi> in the 39. <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
and in the 2. <hi>Bookes of Homilies.</hi> And to
these, as to <hi>Heads,</hi> and <hi>Abunda<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ies,</hi> from
whence all knowledge necessary to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
may abundantly be deriu'd, hee directs
the meditations of Preachers.</p>
                  <p>Are these new wayes? No way new: for
they were <hi>our first</hi> way in <hi>receiuing Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi>
and our <hi>first</hi> way in <hi>receiuing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>
Take a short view of them all:
as it is in the <hi>Catechismes,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
as it is in the <hi>Homilies.</hi> First you are
called backe to the practise of <hi>Catechising:</hi>
Remember what <hi>Catechising</hi> is; it is <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutio
viua voce.</hi> And in the <hi>Primitiue Church,</hi>
when those persons, who comming from
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, might
haue beene scandalized with the outward
Ceremoniall, and Rituall worship of God
in the <hi>Church,</hi> (for Ceremonies are stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
blockes to them who looke vpon
them without their Signification, and
without the reason of their Institution) to
auoyd that daunger, though they were not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:25353:32"/>
admitted to fee the <hi>Sacraments</hi> administred,
nor the other Seruice of God performed in
the <hi>Church,</hi> yet in the <hi>Church,</hi> they receiued
<hi>Instruction, Institution,</hi> by word of mouth, in
the fundamentall Articles of the <hi>Christian
Religion,</hi> and that was <hi>Catechising.</hi> The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
had it from the beginning, and the
<hi>Iewes</hi> had it too: for their word <hi>Chanach,</hi> is
of that signification, <hi>Initiare,</hi> to enter. <hi>Traine
vp a child in the way he should goe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 22. 6</note> 
                     <hi>and when he
is olde, hee will not depart from it. Traine vp,</hi>
say our Translation in the Text; <hi>Catechise,</hi>
say our Translators in the Margin, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the naturall force of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
word. And <hi>Sepher Chinnuch,</hi> which is <hi>Liber
Institutionum,</hi> that is, of <hi>Catechisme,</hi> is a Book
well knowne amongst the <hi>Iewes,</hi> euery
where, where they are now: Their Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
is their Catechisme. And if wee
should tell some men, that <hi>Caluins Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
were a <hi>Catechisme,</hi> would they not loue
Catechising the better for that name? And
would they not loue it the better, if they
gaue mee leaue to tell them that of which I
had the experience. An Artificer of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
brought his Childe to mee, to admire (as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:25353:32"/>
truly there was much reason) the capacitie,
the memory, especially of the child. It was
but a Girle, and not aboue nine yeares of
age, her parents said lesse, some yeares lesse;
wee could scarse propose any Verse of any
Booke, or Chapter of the <hi>Bible,</hi> but that
that childe would goe forward without
Booke. I began to <hi>Catechise</hi> this childe; and
truly, shee vnderstood nothing of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
nothing of any of those fundamentall
poynts which must saue vs: and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was doubled, how she knew so much,
how so little.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Primitiue Church</hi> discerned this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
of <hi>Catechising:</hi> And therefore they
instituted a particular <hi>Office, a Calling</hi> in the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Catechisers.</hi> Which Office, as we
see in Saint <hi>Cyprians 42. Epistle,</hi> that great
man <hi>Optatus</hi> exercised at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> When St. <hi>Augustine</hi> tooke
the <hi>Epistle,</hi> and the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and the <hi>Psalme</hi> of
the day, for his Text to one Sermon, did
he, think you, much more then paraphrase,
then Catechise? When <hi>Athanasius</hi> makes
one Sermon, and, God knowes, a very short
one too, <hi>Contra omnes Haereses, To ouerthrow
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:25353:33"/>
all Heresies in one Sermon;</hi> did he, think you,
any more then propose fundamentall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
which is truly the way to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
all <hi>Heresies?</hi> When Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
enters into his Sermon vpon the 3. <hi>Chapter</hi>
to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> with that preparation, <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendite
diligenter, non enim rem vulgarem polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemur,
Now hearken diligently,</hi> sayes he, <hi>for it
is no ordinary matter that I propose.</hi> There he
proposes <hi>Catechisticall Doctrine</hi> of faith and
works. Come to lower times, when <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sologus</hi>
makes sixe or seuen Sermons vpon
the <hi>Creed,</hi> and not a seuerall Sermon vpon
euery seuerall Article, but takes the whole
<hi>Creed</hi> for his Text, in euery Sermon, and
scarse any of those Sermons a quarter of
an houre long, will you not allowe this
manner of Preaching to bee <hi>Catechising?</hi>
Goe as lowe as can bee gone, to the <hi>Iesuites;</hi>
and that great <hi>Catechizer</hi> amongst them, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisius</hi>
sayes, <hi>Nos hoc munus suscipimus:</hi> Wee,
wee Iesuites make Catechising our Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
I doubt not but they doe recreate
themselues sometimes in other matters too,
but that they glory in, that they are <hi>Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers.</hi>
And in that Profession, sayes hee, wee
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:25353:33"/>
haue <hi>Saint Basil, Saint Augustine, Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,
Saint Cyrill,</hi> in our Societie; and truly
as <hi>Catechizers,</hi> they haue; as <hi>State-Friers,</hi> as
<hi>Iesuits,</hi> they haue not. And in the first Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
they haue him, who is more then all;
for as hee sayes rightly, <hi>Ipse Christus Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta,
Christs owne Preaching was a Catechising.</hi>
I pray <hi>God</hi> that <hi>Iesuites</hi> conclusion of that
<hi>Epistle</hi> of his, be true still; There he sayes, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nihil
aliud, If nothing else, yet this alone should
prouoke vs to a greater diligence in Catechising;
Improbus labor, &amp; indefessa cura, That our
Aduersaries, the Protestants doe spend so much
time,</hi> as he sayes, <hi>day and night in catechizing.</hi>
Now, if it were so then, when he writ, and
bee not so still amongst vs, wee haue inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
one of our best aduantages: and
therefore <hi>God</hi> hath graciously raised a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and a Royall Instrument, to call vs back
to that, which aduantaged vs, and so much
offended the Enemy. That man may sleepe
with a good Conscience, of hauing dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his dutie in his Ministery, that hath
preached in the forenoone, and Catechised
after. <hi>Quaere,</hi> sayes <hi>Tertullian,</hi> (and he sayes
that with indignation) <hi>an Idolatriam com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittat,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:25353:34"/>
qui de Idolis catechizat:</hi> Will any
man doubt, sayes he, whether that man be
an Idolatrer, that catechises Children, and
Seruants in Idolatry? Will any man doubt,
whether hee bee painfull in his Ministerie,
that catechises children, and seruants in the
sincere Religion of <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> The <hi>Roman
Church</hi> hath still made her vse of vs; of our
fortunes, when she gouernd here, and of our
example, since she did not: They did, as
they saw vs doe; And thereupon they came
to that order, in the <hi>Councell of Trent, That
vpon Sundayes and Holydayes, they should
Preach in the forenoone, and Catechise in the
afternoone;</hi> till we did both, they did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 3</note>
                     <hi>Except yee become as little Children, yee

satisfaction of the expectation of great and
curious Auditories, you stopp theirs, you
loose your owne way to the kingdome of

determine our selues, in the knowledge of
Catechisticall rudiments, but to bee sure to

Not leaue at them; but yet not
leaue them out: endeauour to encrease in
knowledge, but first make sure of the
foundation. And that increase of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
is royally, and fatherly presented to
vs, in that, which is another limne of his
<hi>Maiesties directions,</hi> the 39. <hi>Articles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Foundation</hi> of nceessary knowledge,

of <hi>Inuocations:</hi> and these not in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

of <hi>Pardons,</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> of <hi>Inuocation.</hi> And
in the eight and twentieth Article against
<hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and in such tearmes, as
admit no meeting, no reconciliation; but
that it is <hi>repugnant to the plaine wordes of
Scripture, and hath giuen occasion to many
Superstitions.</hi> And in one word, we may
see the purpose and scope of these <hi>Articles,</hi>
as they were intended against the <hi>Romane
Church,</hi> in that <hi>Title</hi> which they had in
one Edition (in which though there were
some other things, that iustly gaue offence,
yet none was giuen nor taken in this) That
these Articles were conceiued and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
to condemne the <hi>Heresies of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees,
of the Arrians, of the Nestorians, of
the Papistes, and others.</hi> And therefore in
these reasons, which his <hi>Maiestie</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:25353:35"/>
to giue of his <hi>Directions,</hi> himselfe
is pleased to assigne this, <hi>That the people
might bee seasoned in all the Heads of the
Protestant Religion.</hi> Not onely of the
<hi>Christian</hi> against <hi>Iewes, Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi>
but of the <hi>Protestant</hi> against the <hi>Romane
Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Foundation</hi> is in the <hi>Catechisme;</hi> the
<hi>growth</hi> and <hi>extention</hi> in the <hi>Articles,</hi> and then
the <hi>Application</hi> of all to particular Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in the <hi>Homilies:</hi> which, if his <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie</hi>
had not named, yet had beene imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his recommendation of the <hi>Articles.</hi>
For the fiue and thirtieth <hi>Article</hi> appoynts
the reading of them: both those, which
were published in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the
sixth, and those which after. In the first
Booke, the very first <hi>Homilies</hi> are, of the
<hi>Sufficiencie of Scriptures, and of the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
necessitie of Reading them;</hi> sufficiently
opposed against that which hath been sayd
in that <hi>Church,</hi> both of the <hi>impertinencie,</hi>
of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as not absolutely necessarie,
and of the <hi>insufficiencie</hi> of these <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
if <hi>Scriptures</hi> were necessarie. And in the
second Booke, the second <hi>Homily</hi> is against
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:25353:36"/>
                     <hi>Idolatrie;</hi> and so farre against all approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
towards it, by hauing any <hi>Images</hi> in
<hi>Churches,</hi> as that perchance Moderat Men,
would rather thinke that <hi>Homilie</hi> to seuere
in that kind, then suspect the <hi>Homilies</hi> of
declination towards <hi>Papistrie.</hi> Is it the
name of <hi>Homelies</hi> that Scandalizes them?
would they haue none? Saint <hi>Cyrills</hi> 30.
<hi>Paschall Sermons,</hi> which he preached in so
many seuerall <hi>Easter daies,</hi> at his <hi>Arch-bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike
of Alexandria,</hi> and his <hi>Christmas dayes
Sermons</hi> too, were ordinarily exscrib'd, and
rehearsed ouer againe, by the most part
of the Clergie of those parts: and in their
Mouthes they were but <hi>Homilies.</hi> And
<hi>Caluins Homilies</hi> vpon <hi>Iob</hi> (as <hi>Beza</hi> in his
Preface before them, calls them) were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
repeated ouer againe in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> and in their mouthes they
were but <hi>Homilies.</hi> It is but the name, that
scandalizes; and yet the name of <hi>Homilia</hi>
and <hi>Concio,</hi> a <hi>Homily</hi> and a <hi>Sermon,</hi> is all
one. And if some of these were spoken,
and not reade, and so exhibited in the name
of a Sermon, they would like them well
inough. Certainely his <hi>Maiestie</hi> mistooke it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:25353:36"/>
not, that in our <hi>Catechismes,</hi> In our <hi>Articles,</hi>
in our <hi>Homilies,</hi> there is inough for <hi>Posttiue,</hi>
inough for <hi>Controuerted Diuinitie;</hi> For that
<hi>Iesuit,</hi> that intended to bring in the whole
body of Controuerted Diuinitie into his
booke, (whom we named before) desired
no other Subiect, no other occasion to doe
that, but the <hi>Catechisme</hi> of that Church;
neither need any sober Man, that intends to
handle Controuersies aske more, or go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Maiestie</hi> therefore, who as he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
his duty to <hi>God,</hi> so doth he his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
duties to him, might iustly thinke, <hi>That
these so well grounded Directions, might,</hi> (as
himselfe sayes) <hi>bee receiu'd vpon implicite obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
Yet hee vouchsafes to communicate
to all, who desire satisfaction, the <hi>Reasons</hi>
that mou'd him. Some of which I haue
related, and all which, all may, when they
will see, and haue. Of all which the Summ
is, His <hi>Royall</hi> and his <hi>Pastorall</hi> care, that <hi>by
that Primitiue way of Preaching, his Subiects
might be arm'd against all kind of Aduersaries,
in fundamentall truthes.</hi> And when he takes
knowledge, <hi>That some few Church-men, but
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:25353:37"/>
many of the people, haue made sinister constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his sincere intentions, As hee is grieued at
the heart,</hi> (to giue you his owne wordes) <hi>to
see euery day so many d fections from our religion
to Popery and Anabaptisme;</hi> So without doubt
he is grieued with much bitternes, that any
should so peruert his meaning, as to thinke,
that these <hi>Directions</hi> either <hi>restraind the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Preaching, or abated the number of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
or made a breach to Ignorance and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,</hi>
of which three scandals he hath been
pleased to take knowledge. What could any
<hi>Calumniator,</hi> any <hi>Libeller</hi> on the other side,
haue imagin'd more opposit, more contrary
to him, then approaches towards <hi>Ignorance,</hi>
or <hi>Superstition?</hi> Let vs say for him, Can so
learned, so abundantly learned a <hi>prince</hi> be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
to plot for <hi>Ignorance?</hi> And let vs blesse
<hi>God,</hi> that we heare him say now, <hi>That he doth
constantly professe himselfe an open aduersary to
the Superstition of the Papist</hi> (without any
milder Modification) and <hi>to the madnesse of
the Anabaptist:</hi> And that <hi>the preaching against
either of their Doctrines is not only approued, but
much commended by his royall Maiestie, if it bee
done without rude and vndecent reuiling.</hi> If he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:25353:37"/>
had affected <hi>Ignorance</hi> in himselfe, he would
neuer haue read so much; and if he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<hi>Ignorance</hi> in vs, hee would neuer haue
writ so much, and made vs so much the
more learned by his Books. And if hee had
had any declination towards <hi>Superstition,</hi> he
would not haue gone so much farther, then
his rank and qualitie pressed him to doe, in
declaring his opinion concerning <hi>Antichrist,</hi>
as out of <hi>Zeale,</hi> and <hi>zeale with knowledge</hi> hee
hath done. We haue him now, (and long,
long, O eternall <hi>God,</hi> continue him to vs,)
we haue him now for a <hi>father</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
a <hi>Foster-father;</hi> such a father as <hi>Constantine,</hi> as
<hi>Theodosius</hi> was; our posterity shall haue him
for a <hi>Father, a Classique father;</hi> such a father as
<hi>Ambrose,</hi> as <hi>Austin</hi> was. And when his works
shall stand in the <hi>Libraries</hi> of our Posteritie,
amongst the <hi>Fathers,</hi> euen these <hi>Papers,</hi> these
<hi>Directions,</hi> &amp; these <hi>Reasons</hi> shal be pregnant
euidences for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stant zeale to <hi>Gods</hi> truth,
and in the meane time, as arrowes shot in
their eyes, that imagine so vaine a thing, as a
defection in him, to their superstition. Thus
far he is from admitting <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and from
<hi>Superstition</hi> thus far, which seemes to be one
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:25353:38"/>
                     <hi>of their feares. And for the other two,
(which concurre in one)</hi> That these Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
should restraine the Exercise of Preaching, or
abate the number of Sermons, <hi>his</hi> Maiestie <hi>hath
declar'd himselfe to those</hi> Reuerend Fathers,
To be so far from giuing the least discouragement
to solid Preaching, or to discreet and religious
Preachers, or from abating the number of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
that hee expects at their hands, that this
should increase their number, by renuing vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Sunday in the afternoon, in all Parish Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
throughout the kingdome, that primitiue, and
most profitable exposition of the Catechisme. <hi>So
that heere is no abating of Sermons, but a
direction of the Preacher to preach vsefully,
and to edification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therfore, to end all, you, you whom
<hi>God</hi> hath made <hi>Starres</hi> in this <hi>Firmament,
Preachers</hi> in this <hi>Church,</hi> deliuer your selues
from that imputation,<note place="margin">Iob 25. 5</note> 
                     <hi>The Starres were not
pure in his sight;</hi> The Preachers were not obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to him in the voice of his <hi>Lieutenant.</hi>
And you, you who are <hi>Gods</hi> holy people,
and zealous of his glory, as you know from
St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

                     <hi>that Stars differ from Stars in glory,</hi>
but all conduce to the benefit of man: So,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:25353:38"/>
when you see these <hi>Stars,</hi> Preachers to differ
in gifts; yet, since all their ends are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
your saluation, encourage the <hi>Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi>
as well as the curious Preacher. Looke
so farre towards your way to Heauen, as to
the Firmament, and consider there, that that
starre by which wee saile, and make great
voyages, is none of the starres of the greatest
magnitude; but yet it is none of the least nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but a middle starre. Those Preachers
which must saue your soules, are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
vnlearned, extemporall men; but they
are not ouer curious men neither. Your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are you, and your seruants are you; and
you doe not prouide for your saluation, if
you prouide not for them, who are so
much yours, as that they are you. No man is
sau'd as a <hi>good man,</hi> if he be not sau'd as a <hi>good
Father,</hi> and as a <hi>good Master</hi> too, if <hi>God</hi> haue
giuen him a family. That so, <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
the whole Congregation, may by their
religious obedience, and fighting in this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
warfare in their <hi>Order,</hi> minister occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:25353:43"/>
of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and to propagate his

the vttermonst part of the Earth are

When man was fallen, <hi>God</hi> clothed
him; made him a Leather Garment;
there <hi>God</hi> descended to one occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
when the time of mans redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was come, then <hi>God,</hi> as it were, to
house him, became a <hi>Carpenters Sonne;</hi>
there <hi>God</hi> descended to another occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.
Naturally, without doubt,
man would haue beene his own Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
and his owne Carpenter; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in these two kinds man would
haue done of himselfe, though hee
had had no patterne from <hi>God:</hi> but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:25353:43"/>
in preseruing man who was fallen, to
this redemption, by which he was to
be raisd, in preseruing man from peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing,
in the Flood, <hi>God</hi> descended to
a third occupation, to be his <hi>Shipwright</hi>
to giue him the modell of a ship, an
<hi>Arke,</hi> and so to be the author of that,
which man himselfe in likelihood,
would neuer haue thought of, a means
to passe from <hi>Nation</hi> to <hi>Nation.</hi> Now,
as <hi>GOD</hi> taught vs to make cloathes,
not onely to cloath our selues, but
to cloath him in his poore and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

vs to build houses, not to house our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues,
but to house him, in erecting

vs to make Ships, not to transport our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues,

when wee haue receiued power, after that
the Holy Ghost is come vpon vs, we might

                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:25353:44"/>As I speake now principally to them
who are concernd in this <hi>Plantation</hi> of
<hi>Virginia,</hi> yet there may be diuers in this
Congregation, who, though they haue
no interest in this <hi>Plantation,</hi> yet they
may haue benefit and edification, by
that which they heare me say, so <hi>Christ</hi>
spoke the words of this <hi>Text,</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who were present
and questioned him at his <hi>Ascention,</hi>
but they are in their iust extention, and
due accomodation, appliable to our
present occation of meeting heere: As
<hi>Christ</hi> himselfe is <hi>Alpha,</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> so
first, as that hee is last too, so these
words which he spoke in the <hi>East,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to vs, who are to glorifie him in
the <hi>VVest; That we hauing receiued pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
after that the</hi> Holy Ghost <hi>is come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs, might be witnesses vnto him, both
in</hi> Ierusalem, <hi>and in all</hi> Iudea, <hi>and in</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,
<hi>and vnto the vttermost parts of the
Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first word of the Text is the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25353:44"/>
                     <hi>Cardinall</hi> word, the word the <hi>hinge</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the whole <hi>Text</hi> turnes; The
first word, <hi>But,</hi> is the <hi>But,</hi> that all the
rest shoots at. First it is an <hi>exclusiue</hi>
word; something the <hi>Apostles</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
which might not bee had;
not that; And it is an <hi>inclusiue</hi> word;
something <hi>Christ</hi> was pleasd to affoord
to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> which they thought not
of; not that, not that which you beat
vpon, <hi>But,</hi> but yet, something else,
something better then that, you shall
haue. That which this but, <hi>excludes,</hi>
is that which the <hi>Apostles</hi> expresse in
the <hi>Verse</hi> immediatly before the <hi>Text,
a Temporall Kingdome; VVilt thou restore
againe the kingdome of Israel?</hi> No; not
a temporall Kingdome; let not the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and commodities of this World,
be in your contemplation in your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures.
Or, because they aske more,
<hi>VVilt thou now restore that?</hi> not yet: If
I will giue you riches, and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this world, yet if I doe it not at
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:25353:45"/>
first, if I doe it not yet, be not you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged;
you shall not haue <hi>that,</hi> that
is not <hi>Gods</hi> first intention; and though
that be in Gods intention, to giue it you
hereafter, you shall not haue it yet;
thats the <hi>exclusiue</hi> part; <hi>But;</hi> there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the <hi>inclusiue, You shall receiue power,
after that the Holy Ghost is come vpon you,
and you shall bee witnesses vnto mee, both
in</hi> Ierusalem, <hi>and in all</hi> Iudaea, <hi>and in</hi>
Samaria, <hi>and vnto the vttermost parts
of the Earth.</hi> In which second part, we
shall passe by these steps; <hi>Superueniet
Spiritus,</hi> The <hi>holy Ghost</hi> shall come vpon
you, <hi>The Spirit</hi> shall witnesse to <hi>your
Spirit,</hi> and rectifie your Conscience;
And then, by that, you shall receiue
<hi>power;</hi> A new power besides the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
you haue from the <hi>State,</hi> and that
power shall enable you, to be witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of <hi>Christ,</hi> that is; to make his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
the more credible, by your testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
when you conforme you selnes
to him, and doe as hee did; and this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:25353:45"/>
witnesse you shall beare, this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
you shall declare, first in <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
in this <hi>Citie;</hi> And in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> in all
the parts of the <hi>Kingdome;</hi> and in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi>
euen amongst them who are
departed from the true worship of
<hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Papists;</hi> and to the vttermost
part of the Earth, to those poore <hi>Soules,</hi>
to whom you are continually sending.
Summarily, If from the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> you
haue a good testimony in your owne
Conscience, you shall be witnesses for
<hi>Christ,</hi> that is; as he did, you shall giue
satisfaction to all, to the <hi>Citie,</hi> to the
<hi>Countrey,</hi> to the <hi>Calumniating Aduersary,</hi>
and the <hi>Naturals</hi> of the place, to whom
you shall present both <hi>Spirituall</hi> and
<hi>Temporall</hi> benefit to. And so you haue
the <hi>Modell</hi> of the whole frame, and of
the partitions; we proceede now to
the furnishing of the particular

                     <p>FIrst then, this first word, <hi>But,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
a temporall Kingdome; the
<hi>Apostles</hi> had filld themselues with an
expectation, with an ambition of it;
but that was not intended them. It
was no wonder, that a woman could
conceiue such an expectation, and such
an ambition, as to haue her two sonnes
sit at <hi>Christs</hi> right hand,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 20</note> and at his left,
in his Kingdome, when the <hi>Apostles</hi>
expected such a Kingdome, as might
affoord them honours and preferment
vpon Earth. More then once they
were in that disputation, in which
<hi>Christ</hi> deprehended them, <hi>Which of them
should bee the greatest in his Kingdome.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 1. 81.</note>
Neither hath the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> any
thing, wherein he may so properly call
himselfe <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> as this error of the
<hi>Apostles,</hi> this their infirmitie, that he is
euermore to conuersant vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:25353:46"/>
of temporall Kingdomes.
They did it all the way, when <hi>Christ</hi>
was with them, and now at his last
step, <hi>Cum actu ascendisset,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Athanaz.</note> when <hi>Christ</hi>
was not <hi>Ascending,</hi> but in part <hi>ascended,</hi>
when one foot was vpon the Earth,
and the other in the cloud that tooke
him vp, they aske him now, wilt thou
at this time, restore the Kingdome? so
women put their husbands, and men
their fathers, and friends, vpon their
torture, at their last gaspe, and make
their death-bed a racke to make them
stretch and encrease ioyntures, and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and legacies, and signe Scedules
and Codicils, with their hand, when
his hand that presents them, is ready to
close his eyes, that should signe them:
And when they are vpon the wing for
heauen, men tye lead to their feet, and
when they are laying hand-fast vpon
<hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, they must pull their
hand out of his bosome againe, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
importunities of men, and signe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:25353:47"/>
their papers: so vnderminable is the
loue of this World, which determines
euery minute. <hi>GOD,</hi> as hee is three
persons, hath three Kingdomes; There
is <hi>Regnum potentiae,</hi> The Kingdome of
power; and this wee attribute to the
<hi>Father;</hi> it is power and prouidence:
There is <hi>Regnum gloriae,</hi> the Kingdome
of glorie; this we attribute to the <hi>Sonn</hi>
and to his purchase; for he is <hi>the King</hi>
that shall say,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 34</note> 
                        <hi>Come ye blessed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
inherit the Kingdome prepared for
you, from the foundation of the VVorld.</hi>
And then betweene these three is <hi>Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
gratiae,</hi> The kingdome of Grace,
and this we attribute to the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi>
he takes them, whom the king of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
Almighty <hi>God</hi> hath rescued from
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and as the king of grace,
<hi>Hee giues them the knowledge of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
of the kingdome of</hi> GOD,<note place="margin">Mar. 4. 11.</note> that is,
of <hi>future glory,</hi> by sactifying them with
his grace, in his <hi>Church.</hi> The two
first kingdomes are in this world, but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:25353:47"/>
yet neither of them, are of this world;
because both they referre co the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of glory. The kingdome of the
<hi>Father,</hi> which is the prouidence of
<hi>God,</hi> does but preserue vs; The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> which is the
grace of <hi>God,</hi> does but prepare vs to
the kingdome of the <hi>Sonne,</hi> which is
the glory of <hi>GOD;</hi> and thats in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
And therefore, though to good
men, this world be the way to that
kingdome, yet this kingdome is not
of this world, sayes Christ himselfe:
Though the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselues,<note place="margin">Ioh 18. 36.</note> as
good a <hi>Schoole</hi> as they were bred in,
could neuer take out that lesson, yet
that lesson <hi>Christ</hi> giues, and repeates to
all, you seeke a Temporall kingdome,
<hi>But,</hi> sayes the Text, stop there, A king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
you must not haue.</p>
                     <p>Beloued in him, whose kingdome,
and Ghospell you seeke to aduance, in
this Plantation, our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Sauiour
Christ Iesus,</hi> if you seeke to establish a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:25353:48"/>
temporall kingdome there, you are not
rectified, if you seeke to bee <hi>Kings</hi> in
either acceptation of the word; To
be a <hi>King</hi> signifies <hi>Libertie</hi> and <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pency,</hi>
and <hi>Supremacie,</hi> to bee vnder no
man, and to be a <hi>King</hi> signifies <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi>
and <hi>Omnisufficiencie,</hi> to neede
no man. If those that gouerne there,
would establish such a gouernment,
as should not depend vpon this, or if
those that goe thither, propose to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
an exemption from Lawes, to
liue at their libertie, this is to be <hi>Kings,</hi>
to deuest <hi>Allegeance,</hi> to bee vnder no
man: and if those that aduenture thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
propose to themselues present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
and profit, a sodaine way to bee
rich, and an aboundance of all desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
commodities from thence, this is
to be sufficient of themselues, and to
need no man: and to bee vnder no
man and to need no man, are the two
acceptations of being <hi>Kings.</hi> Whom li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
drawes to goe, or present profit
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:25353:48"/>
drawes to aduenture, are not yet in the
right way. O, if you could once bring
a <hi>Catechisme</hi> to bee as good ware a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them as a Bugle, as a knife, as
a hatchet: O, if you would be as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to hearken at the returne of a <hi>Ship,</hi>
how many <hi>Indians</hi> were conuerted to
<hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> as what Trees, or druggs,
or Dyes that Ship had brought, then
you were in your right way, and not
till then; <hi>Libertie</hi> and <hi>Abundance,</hi> are
Characters of kingdomes, and a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is excluded in the <hi>Text;</hi> The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>
were not to looke for it, in their
employment, nor you in this your
Plantation.</p>
                     <p>At least CHRIST expresses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
thus farre, in this answer, that if
he would giue them a kingdome,<note place="margin">Non adbuc.</note> hee
would not giue it them yet. They
aske him, <hi>VVilt thou at this time, restore
the kingdome?</hi> and hee answers, <hi>It is
not for you to know the times:</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
<hi>God</hi> will doe, Man must not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:25353:49"/>
appoint him his time. The <hi>Apostles</hi>
thought of a <hi>kingdome</hi> presently after
<hi>Christs</hi> departure; the comming of
the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who ledd them into
all truthes, soone deliuer'd them of that
error. Other men in fauour of the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> interpreting all the prophesies,
which are of a <hi>Spirituall kingdome,</hi> the
kingdome of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> (into which,
the <hi>Iewes</hi> shall be admitted) in a literall
sense, haue thought that the <hi>Iewes</hi> shall
haue, not onely a temporall kingdome
in the same place, in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> againe,
but because they find that kingdome
which is promised, (that is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the <hi>Gospell)</hi> to bee expressed
in large phrases, and in an abundant
manner, applying all that largenesse to
a temporall kingdome, they thinke,
that the <hi>Iewes</hi> shall haue such a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as shall swallowe and annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
all other kingdomes, and bee the
sole <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the world.
After this, very great men in the <hi>Church</hi>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:25353:49"/>
vpon these words, of One thousand
yeares after the Resurrection, haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin'd
a <hi>Temporall Kingdome</hi> of the
<hi>Saints</hi> of <hi>God</hi> heere vpon Earth,<note place="margin">Apo. 20,</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they entred the ioyes of Heauen:
and Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> himselfe,<note place="margin">De Ciuitat. Dei 20. 7.</note> had at
first some declinations towards that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
though he dispute powerfully
against it, after: That there should
bee <hi>Sabatismus in terris;</hi> that as the
world was to last Sixe thousand yeares
in troubles, there should be a Seuenth
thousand, in such ioyes as this world
could giue.</p>
                     <p>And some others, who haue auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
both the <hi>Temporall kingdome</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> presently after
the <hi>Ascention,</hi> And the <hi>Emperiall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> before the <hi>Refurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
And the <hi>Carnall kingdome</hi> of the
<hi>Chiliasts,</hi> the <hi>Millenarians,</hi> after the
<hi>Refurrection,</hi> though they speake of no
kingdome, but the true kingdome, the
kingdome of glory, yet they erre as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:25353:50"/>
much in assigning a certaine time
when that kingdome shall beginne,
when the ende of this world, when
the Refurrection, when the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall be. <hi>Non est vestrum nosse
tempora,</hi> sayes <hi>Christ</hi> to his <hi>Apostles</hi> then;
and lest it might be thought, that they
might know these things, when the
<hi>Holy Ghost</hi> came vpon them, <hi>Christ</hi>
denies that he himselfe knew that, as
<hi>Man;</hi> and as <hi>Man, Christ</hi> knew more,

<hi>Christ</hi> left the <hi>Ninteie and nine</hi> for one
Sheepe; populous <hi>Cities</hi> are for the

most part best prouided; remoter parts
need our labour more, and we should
not make such differences. <hi>Yeoman,</hi> and
<hi>Labourer,</hi> and <hi>Spinster,</hi> are distinctions
vpon Earth; in the Earth, in the graue
there is no distinction. The <hi>Angell</hi> that

Sheet; In that one day of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
there is not a forenoone for
Lords to rise first, and an afternoone
for meaner persons to rise after. <hi>Christ</hi>
was not whip'd to saue Beggars, and
crown'd with Thornes to saue Kings:
he dyed, he suffered all, for all; and we

who the <hi>Samaritans</hi> were, Men that

other <hi>Gods</hi> with him, Men that had
not burnt the Law of GOD, but made
Traditions of Men equall to it, you
will easily guesse to whom I apply the
name of <hi>Samaritans</hi> now. A <hi>Iesuit</hi> hath
told vs (an ill Intelligencer I confesse,
but euen his Intelligencer, the <hi>Deuill</hi>

sayes, the <hi>Samaritans</hi> were odious

<hi>Heretiques</hi> and <hi>Scismatiques</hi> to vs; and
they, we know were odious to them
for mingling false <hi>Gods,</hi> and false wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships

you work in <hi>Virginia;</hi> &amp; what peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
you haue conuerted to the <hi>Christian

miracles, or Magical illusions, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
as they do, to make a miraculous

when he was conuerted to them; that
he was miraculously cur'd of the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi>

If we would pile vp Miracles so fast, as

questiones,</hi> he wrought as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
miracles, as he resolu'd questions, we
might find Miracles too. In truth, their
greatest Miracle to me, is, that they find
men to beleeue their miracles. If they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:25353:61"/>
rely vpon miracles, they imply a confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that they induce new doctrines;
that that is old &amp; receiu'd, needs no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;
If they require miracles, because,
though that be ancient Doctrine, it is
newlybroght into those parts, we haue
the confession of their <hi>Iesuit, Acosta,</hi> that
they doe no miracle in those <hi>Indies,</hi> and
he assignes very good reasons, why they
are not necessary, nor to bee expected
there. But yet, yet beare witnesse to
these <hi>Samaritans,</hi> in the other point; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to giue them satisfaction in the
other point of their chardge, What
Heathens you haue conuerted to the

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:25353:62"/>
that it is not hard to multiply places of

that the <hi>Apostles</hi> did actually,

                        <note place="margin">Mark. 13. 9.</note> but the <hi>Gospell</hi> must first be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished

this world which hath been discouer'd
since, into which, wee dispute with

how any men came at first, or how
any beastes, especially such beastes

                     <p>To end all, as the <hi>Orators</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimd
in the presence of the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perors,</hi>
in their <hi>Panegyriques,</hi> tooke that

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:25353:64"/>
they were bound to doe, to say in those
publique Orations, that those <hi>Emporors</hi>
had done so, (for that increased the loue
of the Subiect to the Prince, to bee so
tolde, that hee had done those great
things, and then it conuayd a Counsell
into the Prince to doe them after.) As
their way was to procure things to bee
done, by saying they were done, so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
I haue taken a contrary way:
for when I, by way of exhortation, all
this while haue seem'd to tell you what
should be done by you, I haue, indeed,
but told the Congregation, what hath
beene done already: neither do I speake
to moue a wheele that stood still, but
to keepe the wheele in due motion;
nor perswade you to begin, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
a good worke, nor propose for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne,
but your own Examples, to do
still, as you haue done hitherto. For,
for that, that which is especially in my
contemplation, the conuersion of the
people, as I haue receiu'd, so I can giue
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:25353:65"/>
this Testimony, that of those persons,
who haue sent in moneys, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
their names, the greatest part, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all, haue limited their deuotion,
and contribution vpon that point, the
propagation of Religion, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
of the people; for the building
and beautifying of the house of GOD,
and for the instruction and education
of their young Children. <hi>Christ Iesus</hi>
himselfe <hi>is yesterday, and to day, and the
same for euer.</hi> In the aduancing of his
glory, be you so to, yesterday, and to
day, and the same for euer; here; and
hereafter, when time shall be no more,
no more yesterday, no more to day, yet
for euer and euer, you shall enioy that

vs together now,
The consecration of
a Church, makes this the reason and
the excuse of his late comming thither
to doe that Seruice, that he stayd by the
way, to consecrate another Church:
I hope euery person heere hath done
so; consecrated himselfe, who is a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:25353:71"/>
                     <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> before hee
came to assist, or to testifie the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
of this place of the Seruice of
<hi>God.<note place="margin">Bern. Ser. 1.</note> Nostra festiuitas hec est, quia de Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia
nostra;</hi> sayes <hi>Saint Bernard.</hi> This
Festiuall belongs to vs, because it is the
consecration of that place, which is
ours, <hi>Magis autem nostra, quia de nobis
ipsis:</hi> But it is more properly our Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall,
because it is the consecration of
our selues to <hi>Gods</hi> seruice. For, <hi>Sanctae
Animae propter inhabitantem Spiritum;</hi>
your <hi>Soules</hi> are holy, by the inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Gods</hi> holy spirit, who dwells
in them. <hi>Sancta corpor a propter inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantem
animam;</hi> Your <hi>Bodies</hi> are holy,
by the inhabitation of those sanctified
<hi>Soules. Sancti parietes, propter Corpora
Sanctorum.</hi> These walles are holy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Saints</hi> of <hi>God</hi> meet here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
these walls to glorifie him. But yet
these places are not onely consecrated
&amp; sanctified by your comming; but to
bee sanctified also for your comming;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:25353:71"/>
that so, as the Congregation sanctifies
the place, the place may sanctifie the
Congregation too. They must accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
one another; holy persons and
holy places; If men would wash sheep
in the <hi>Baptisterie,</hi> in the <hi>Font,</hi> those
sheep were not christned. If prophane
men, or idolatrous men, pray here after
their way, their prayers are not sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the place. Neither if it be after
polluted, doth the place retain that san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie,
which is this day to be deriued
vpon it, and to bee imprinted in it.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Text</hi> settles vs vpon both these
considerations,<note place="margin">Diuisie.</note> The holy place, and
the holy person. It was the <hi>Feast of the
Dedication:</hi> there's the holinesse of the
place; And the holy person, was holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it selfe in the person of <hi>Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
who <hi>walked in the Temple in Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
Porch.</hi> These two will bee our
two parts: And the first of these wee
shall make vp of these pieces. First, we
shall see a lawfull vse of <hi>Feasts,</hi> of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:25353:72"/>
dayes.</hi> And then of other <hi>Feasts,</hi>
then were instituted by <hi>God himselfe;</hi>
diuers were so; this was not. And
thirdly, not only a <hi>festiuall</hi> solemnizing
of some one thing, at some one time,
for the present, but an <hi>Anniuersary</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to that folemnitie euery yeare;
And lastly, in that first part, this <hi>Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall</hi>
in particular, The Feast of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>
of the <hi>Temple:</hi> that fanctified
the place, that shall determine that
part. In the second part, <hi>The holinesse of
the person,</hi> we shall carry your thoughts
no farther, but vpon this, That euen
this holy person <hi>Iesus</hi> himselfe, would
haue recourse to this place, thus dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
thus sanctified: And vpon this,
that hee would doe that especially at
such times, as hee might countenance
and authorise the Ordinances and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of the Church, which had
appointed this <hi>Festiuall.</hi> And this, sayes
the <hi>Text,</hi> he did in the <hi>Winter:</hi> First, <hi>Etsi
Hiems,</hi> though it were Winter, hee
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25353:72"/>
came, and walked in the <hi>Porch,</hi> a little
inconuenience kept him not off: And,
<hi>Quia Hiems,</hi> because it was Winter, he
walked in the <hi>Porch</hi> which was coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
not in the Temple which was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
So that heere with modestie, and
without scandall he condemned not
the fauouring of a mans health, euen
in the <hi>Temple, And it was at Ierusalem,
the Feast of the Dedication; and it was
Winter; and Iesus walked in the Temple in
Salomons Porch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In our first part,<note place="margin">1. Part. Festa.</note> 
                     <hi>Holy places,</hi> wee
looke first vpon the times of our mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
there, <hi>Holy dayes.</hi> The root of all
those is the <hi>Sabboth,</hi> that God planted
himselfe, euen in himselfe, in his owne
rest, from the Creation. But the root,
and those branches which grow from
that root, are of the same nature, and
the same name: And therefore as well
of the flower, as of the root of a Rose,
or of a Violet, we would say, This is a
Violet, this is a Rose, so as well to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:25353:73"/>
Feasts of <hi>Gods</hi> institution, as to the
first <hi>Sabboth, God</hi> giues that name; hee
cals those seuerall Feasts which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
<hi>Sabboths;</hi> enioynes the same
things to be done vpon them, inflicts
the same punishments vpon them that
breake them.<note place="margin">Leuit. 23.</note> So that there is one <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie,</hi>
that is the soule of all <hi>Sabboths,</hi>
of all <hi>Festiualls;</hi> howsoeuer all <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths</hi>
haue a ceremoniall part in them,
yet there is a <hi>Morall</hi> part that inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
them all; they are elemented of
<hi>Ceremonie,</hi> but they animated with
<hi>Moralitie.</hi> And that <hi>Moralitie</hi> is in them
all, <hi>Rest:</hi> for if <hi>Adam</hi> could name crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
according to their nature, <hi>God</hi>
could name his <hi>Sabboth</hi> according to
the nature of it, and <hi>Sabboth</hi> is <hi>Rest.</hi> It
is a <hi>Rest</hi> of two kindes; our rest, and
<hi>Gods</hi> rest. Our rest is the cessation from
labour on those dayes; <hi>Gods</hi> rest, is our
sanctifying of the day: for so in the
religious sacrifice of <hi>Noah,</hi> when hee
was come out of the <hi>Arke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Genes. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>God</hi> is said
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:25353:73"/>
to haue smelt, <hi>Odorem quietis,</hi> the sauour
of rest: vpon those dayes we rest from
seruing the world, and <hi>God</hi> rests in our
seruing of him. And as <hi>God</hi> takes a
tenth part of our goods, in <hi>Tythes,</hi> but
yet he takes more too, he takes <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
so though he take a seuenth part
of our time in the <hi>Sabboth,</hi> yet he takes
more too, he appoints other <hi>Sabboths,</hi>
other <hi>Festiualls,</hi> that he may haue more
glory, and we more Rest: for all wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
those two concurre, are <hi>Sabboths
Vacate &amp; videte quoniam ego sum Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
sayes <hi>God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 46. 10</note> First <hi>vacate,</hi> rest from
your bodily labours, distinguish the
day, and then <hi>videte,</hi> come hither into
the <hi>Lords</hi> presence, and worship the
<hi>Lord</hi> your <hi>God,</hi> sanctifie the day: And
in all the <hi>Sabboths</hi> there is still a <hi>Cessate,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Leuit. 23.</note>
and a <hi>Humiliate animas,</hi> bodily rest, and
spirituall sanctifying of the day. <hi>Holy
dayes</hi> then, that is, dayes seposed for
<hi>holy vses,</hi> and for the outward &amp; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
seruice of <hi>God,</hi> are in <hi>Nature,</hi> and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:25353:74"/>
in that <hi>Morall Law</hi> which is written in
the heart of man. That such dayes
there must be is <hi>Morall;</hi> and this is <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi>
too, that all things in the seruice of
God bee done in order; and this also,
that obedience be giuen to Superiours,
in those things wherein they are Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors.
And therfore it was to the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
as well <hi>Morall,</hi> to obserue the certaine
dayes which <hi>God</hi> had determined, as to
obserue any at all. Not that Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
limitting the dayes, infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a <hi>Moralitie</hi> into those particular
dayes: for <hi>Moralitie</hi> is perpetuall; and if
that had been <hi>Morall,</hi> it must haue been
so before, and it must bee so still; <hi>Gods</hi>
determining the dayes did not infuse,
not induce a <hi>Moralitie</hi> there, but it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened
a former <hi>Moralitie,</hi> that is, an
obedience to the commandement, for
that time, which <hi>God</hi> had appoynted
that for them; for this <hi>Obedience,</hi> and
<hi>Order</hi> is perpetuall, and so, <hi>Morall.</hi> We
depart therfore from that error, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:25353:74"/>
those ancient <hi>Heretiques,</hi> the <hi>Ebionites</hi>
begun, and some laboured to refresh in
<hi>Saint Gregories</hi> time, and which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
in practise in some places of the
world still; To obserue both the <hi>Iewes
Sabbath,</hi> and the <hi>Christians, Satterday,</hi>
and <hi>Sunday</hi> too; because the <hi>Sabboth</hi> is
called <hi>Pactum sempiternum:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 31.</note> for to that
any of <hi>Saint Augustines</hi> Answeres will
serue; either that it is called euerlasting,
because it signified an euerlasting rest;
(where be pleased to note by the way,
that <hi>Holy dayes, Sabbaths,</hi> are not onely
instituted for <hi>Order,</hi> but they haue their
<hi>Mystery,</hi> and their <hi>Signification;</hi> for <hi>Holy
dayes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 2. 16.</note> (as the Text calls them there)
and <hi>New Moones,</hi> and the <hi>Sabboth,</hi> were
but shadowes of things to come:) or
else the <hi>Sabboth</hi> was called euerlasting
to them, because it bound them euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly,
and they might neuer inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it, as some other ceremonies they
might. But their <hi>Sabboths</hi> bind not vs;
we depart from them who thinke so;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:25353:75"/>
and so we doe from them, who think
we are bound to no <hi>Festiualls</hi> at all, or
at least to none but the <hi>Sabboth.</hi> For
<hi>God</hi> requires as much seruice from vs,
as from the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and to them hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
his <hi>Sabboths,</hi> and made them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.
But those were of <hi>Gods</hi> immediat
institution: but all that the <hi>Iewes</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
were not so; and thats our next
consideration, <hi>Festiualls</hi> instituted by
the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At first,<note place="margin">Sine Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dato.</note> when <hi>God</hi> was alone, it is
but <hi>Faciamus,</hi> let <hi>vs, vs</hi> the <hi>Trinity</hi> make
man. This was, when <hi>God</hi> was, as we
may say, <hi>in Coelibatu.</hi> But after <hi>God</hi> hath
taken his <hi>spouse,</hi> maried the <hi>Church,</hi> then
it is <hi>Capite nobis vulpes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 15</note> doe <hi>you</hi> take the

therfore do you looke to them, as well
as I. The Tables of the law <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:25353:75"/>
a power to make other Lawes like

which concern'd the <hi>outward</hi> worship
of <hi>God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 25. 9.</note> that was to be made by <hi>Moses,
Iuxta similitudinem,</hi> according to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne

hath giuen the <hi>Church</hi> a paterne of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

himselfe instituted, and according to
the paterne, the <hi>Church</hi> hath instituted
more:<note place="margin">Aug.</note> and <hi>Recte festa Ecclesiae colunt quise
Ecclesiae filios recognoscunt:</hi> They who
disdaine not the name of <hi>sonnes</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> refuse not to celebrate the daies
which are of the <hi>Churches</hi> institution.
There was no immediate commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>God</hi> for that <hi>Holy day,</hi> which
<hi>Mor dechai,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ester 9. 23</note> by his letters establish'd; but
yet the <hi>Iewes</hi> vndertooke to do as <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dechai</hi>
had written to them. There was
no such commandement for this <hi>Holy
day,</hi> in the Text; and yet that was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferued,
as long as they had any beeing.
And where the reason remaines, the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:25353:76"/>
practise may; The <hi>Iewes</hi> did, we may
institute new <hi>Holy dayes.</hi> And not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
transitory daies, for a present thanks
giuing for a present benefit, but <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,</hi>
perpetuall memorials of <hi>Gods</hi>
deliuerances. And thats our next step.</p>
                  <p>Both the <hi>Holy dayes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Anniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saria.</note> which we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

Maccabeus</hi> commanded to be kept
yearely for eight dayes, which was
more then was appoynted to any of
the <hi>Holy dayes,</hi> instituted by <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
for the Festiuall alone. According
to which paterne,<note place="margin">Felix.</note> one <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
ordained that the Festiuals of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication

celebrated in those places;<note place="margin">Greg.</note> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
extended the Festiuall to eight
dayes; at least at the first dedication
thereof, if not euery yeare: that <hi>God</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:25353:76"/>
might not onely be put into the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the place, but setled in it. <hi>God</hi>
by <hi>Moses</hi> made the children of <hi>Israel</hi> a
<hi>Song,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 31. 19</note> because, as hee sayes, howsoeuer
they did by the Law, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

that if when those dayes come

Euery fift of <hi>August,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> rises vp,

haue made this roome your Hall, if

who is pleased to dwell thus amongst

before it was begun, is such a summe,
as certainly, if all the <hi>Christian Kings</hi>
that are, would send in all that they
haue, at once, to any one seruice, all
would not equall that summe. They
gaue there, till they who had the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing

I, I say, can truly testifie, that you (spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the whole Societie together of

the publike reuenue) you gaue more
then the widow, who gaue all, for you
gaue more then all. <hi>A stranger shall not

we haue wrastled in the way; but
strangers shall know to <hi>Gods</hi> glory,
that you haue perfected a work of full

to his glory, with enlarging

Kings are begotten &amp; conceiu'd
the naturall way; but that body which
is so begotten of the blood of Kings, is

a <hi>Child</hi> conceiu'd (wee may say borne)
of <hi>Christian parents,</hi> of persons religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
disposed to <hi>Gods</hi> glory; but yet,
that was to receiue another influence,
an inanimation, a quickening, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

denuo dari,</hi> it must be giuen againe to
<hi>God,</hi> by him, who receiues it of you. It
must; there seems a necessitie to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
because euen in <hi>Nature,</hi> there was
a consecration of holy places; <hi>Iacob</hi> in
his iourney,<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 20.</note> before the <hi>Law,</hi> consecrated
euen that stone, which he set vp, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to build <hi>God</hi> a House there. In
the time of the <hi>Law,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 7. 1.</note> this Feast of Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
was in practise; first in the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle;</hi>
that and all that appertain'd to
it, was annointed, and sanctified: So
was <hi>Salomons Temple</hi> after; so was that
which was reedified after their return
from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and so was this in the
<hi>Text,</hi> after the Heathen had defiled and
profan'd the <hi>Altar</hi> thereof, and a new
one was erected by <hi>Iudas Maccabeus.</hi>
Thus in <hi>Nature,</hi> thus in <hi>Law,</hi> and thus
far thus in the <hi>Gospell</hi> too: that as sure
as wee are that the people of <hi>God</hi> had
<hi>materiall Churches</hi> in the <hi>Apostles</hi> first
times, so sure we are, that those places
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:25353:82"/>
had a Sanctitie in them. If that place
of <hi>Saint Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 22</note> 
                     <hi>Despise yee the Church of
God?</hi> be to be vnderstood of the locall,
of the materiall <hi>Church,</hi> and not of the
<hi>Congregation,</hi> you see there is a rebuke
for the prophanation of the place, and
consequently a sanctity in the place. But
assoone as the <hi>Church</hi> came euidently
by the fauour of <hi>Princes,</hi> to haue liberty
to make lawes, and power to see them
practised, it was neuer pretermitted to
consecrate the places. Before that, we
find an ordinance by Pope <hi>Hyginus</hi> (he
was within 150. after <hi>Christ,</hi> and the
eighth <hi>Bishop</hi> of that <hi>See</hi> after <hi>Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>)
euen of particulars in the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations.
But after,<note place="margin">Athanas.</note> 
                     <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie</hi>
to <hi>Constantius,</hi> makes that prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
for all <hi>Christians, That they neuer
meet in any Church, till it bee consecrated:</hi>
And <hi>Constantine</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> least hee
should be at any time vnprouided of
such a place, (as we read in the <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall</hi>
story) in all his warres, carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:25353:83"/>
bout with him a <hi>Tabernacle</hi> which was
consecrated: In <hi>Nature,</hi> in the <hi>Law,</hi> in
the <hi>Gospell,</hi> in <hi>Precept,</hi> in <hi>Practise,</hi> these
Consecrations are established.</p>
                  <p>This they did.<note place="margin">Vsus.</note> But to what vse did
they consecrate them? not to one vse
only; and therefore it is a friuolous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
whether <hi>Churches</hi> be for <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,</hi>
or for <hi>praying.</hi> But if <hi>Consecration</hi>
be a king of <hi>Christning</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
&amp; that at the <hi>Christning</hi> it haue a name,
wee know what name <hi>God</hi> hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
for his House, <hi>Domus mea, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
orationis vocabitur. My House shall
bee called the House of Prayer.</hi> And how
impudent and inexcusable a falshood
is that in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> That the <hi>Lutherans</hi>
and <hi>Caluinistes</hi> doe admit <hi>Churches</hi> for
<hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Sacraments, Sed reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt

that they should be for <hi>Prayer:</hi> when
as <hi>Caluin</hi> himselfe, (who may seeme to
bee more subiect to this reprehension
then <hi>Luther</hi>) (for there is no such <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:25353:83"/>
in the <hi>Caluinists Churches,</hi> as in the
<hi>Lutheran</hi>) yet in that very place which
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> cites, sayes <hi>Conceptae preces in
Ecclesia Deo gratae;</hi> and for singing in
<hi>Churches,</hi> (which in that place of <hi>Caluin</hi>
cannot be only meant of <hi>Psalmes,</hi> for it
was of that manner of singing, which
being formerly in vse in the <hi>Easterne
churches, S. Ambrose,</hi> in his time, brought
into the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Millan,</hi> and so it was
deriud ouer the <hi>Western churches,</hi> which
was the modulation and singing of
<hi>Versicles</hi> and <hi>Antiphons</hi> and the like)
this singing, sayes <hi>Caluin,</hi> was in vse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselues, <hi>Et san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctissimum

                     <hi>It was a most holy and most profitable Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi>
Still consider Consecration to
be a <hi>Christning</hi> of the place; and though
we find them often called <hi>Templa prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sacrificia,</hi> for our sacrifices of praier,
and of praise, &amp; of the merits of <hi>Christ,</hi>
and often called <hi>Ecclesiae ad conciones,</hi>
Churches, in respect of congregations,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:25353:84"/>
for preaching, and often call'd <hi>Martyria,</hi>
for preseruing with respect, and honor
the bodies of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and other <hi>Saints</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> there buried, &amp; often, often, by
other names, <hi>Dominica, Basilica,</hi> and the
like, yet the name that <hi>God</hi> gaue to his
house, is not <hi>Concionatorium,</hi> nor <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarium,</hi>
but <hi>Oratorium,</hi> the House of
Prayer. And therefore without preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to the other functions too, (for as
there is a <hi>vae</hi> vpon me, <hi>Si non Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zauero,</hi>
If I preach not my selfe, so may
that <hi>vae</hi> be multiplied vpon any, who
would draw that holy ordinance of
<hi>God</hi> into a dis-estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or into a slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,)
let vs neuer intermit that dutie,
to present our selues to <hi>God</hi> in these
places, though in these places there bee
then, no other Seruice, but Common
prayer. For then doth the House an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
to that name, which <hi>God</hi> hath
giuen it, if it be a house of Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Thus then were these places to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
a double Dedication;<note place="margin">Modus.</note> a Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:25353:84"/>
which was a Donation from the
<hi>Patron,</hi> a Dedication which was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
from the <hi>Bishop,</hi> for to his
person, and to that ranke in the <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> the most ancient
Canons limited it; and to those purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which wee haue spoken of; of
which, Prayer is so farre from being
none, as that there is none aboue it. A
little should be said, (before wee shut
vp this part) of the manner, the forme
of Consecrations. In which, in the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
Church,</hi> assoone as Consecrations
came into free vse, they were full of
<hi>Ceremonies.</hi> And many of those <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>
deriu'd from the <hi>Iewes:</hi> and not
vnlawfull, for that. The <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of
the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which had their foundation
in the prefiguration of <hi>Christ,</hi> and were
types of him, were vnlawfull after
<hi>Christ</hi> was come; because the vse of
them, then, implyed a deniall or a
doubt of his being come. But those
<hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which, though the <hi>Iewes</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:25353:85"/>
vsed them, had their foundation in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
as bowing of the knee, lifting vp
the eyes, and hands, and many, very
many others, which either testified
their deuotion that did them, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
their deuotion that sawe them
done, are not therefore excluded the
<hi>Church,</hi> because they were in vse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Iewes.</hi> That <hi>Pope</hi> whom
we named before, <hi>Hyginus,</hi> the eighth
after <hi>Saint Peter,</hi> he instituted, <hi>Ne Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silica
sine Missa consecretur. That no
Church bee consecrated without a Masse.</hi>
If this must binde vs, to a <hi>Masse</hi> of the
present <hi>Romane Church,</hi> it were hard;
and yet not very hard truely; for they
are easily had. But that word, <hi>Masse,</hi>
is in <hi>Saint Ambrose,</hi> in <hi>Saint Augustine</hi>
in some very ancient <hi>Councels;</hi> and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intends nothing, to this purpose, but
the Seruice, the Common Prayer of
the <hi>Church,</hi> then in vse, there. And
when the Bishop <hi>Panigarola</hi> sayes in
his Sermon vpon <hi>Whitsunday,</hi> that the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:25353:85"/>
                     <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> found the blessed <hi>Virgin</hi>
and the <hi>Apostles</hi> at <hi>Masse,</hi> I presume hee
meanes no more, then that they were
mett at such publique Prayer, as at
those times they might make. Sure
<hi>Pope Clemens,</hi> and <hi>Pope Hyginus</hi> meane
the same thing, when one sayes <hi>Missa
consecretur,</hi> and the other <hi>Diuinis Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus:</hi>
One sayes, <hi>Let the Consecration bee
with a Masse,</hi> the other, <hi>with Diuine
Seruice;</hi> the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> the Diuine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
was then the <hi>Masse.</hi> In a word, a
constant forme of Consecrations, wee
finde none that goes through our <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualls:</hi>
the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were still more
or lesse, as they were more or lesse ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious,
or might bee subiect to scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize,
or to be mis-interpreted. And
therefore I am not heere either to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
or so much as to remember, that
which appertaines to the manner of
these Consecrations; onely in concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in that, which is the Soule of all,
humble and heartie prayer, that <hi>God</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:25353:86"/>
will heare his Seruants in this place, I
shall not offend to say, that I am sure
my zeale is inferiour to none. And
more I say not of the first Part, The
Holy place; and but a little more, of
the other; though at first it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
for an equall part, <hi>The Holy
Person,</hi> That at the Feast of the Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>Iesus walked in the Temple in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons
Porch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this second part,<note place="margin">2. Part.</note> wee did not
spread the words, not shed our consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
vpon many particulars: the
first was, that euen <hi>Iesus</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iesus in Templo.</note> himselfe had
recourse to this <hi>Holy place.</hi> In the new
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in <hi>Heauen,</hi> there is no <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apo. 21. 22</note> 
                     <hi>I saw no Temple there</hi> sayes <hi>Saint
Iohn: for the Lord God Almightie, and the
Lambe are the Temple of it.</hi> In Heauen,
where there is no danger of falling,
there is no need of assistance. Heere
the <hi>Temple</hi> is called <hi>Gnazar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Paral. 4. 9</note> that is <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xilium:</hi>
A Helper: the strongest that
is, needs the helpe of the Church: And
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:25353:86"/>
it is called <hi>Sanctificium,</hi> by <hi>Saint Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 78. 69.</note>
a place that is not onely made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Consecration, but that makes
others holy by GOD in it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, whose person and
presence might consecrate the <hi>Sanctum
Sanctorum,</hi> would yet make his often
repayre to this <hi>Holy place;</hi> not that hee
needed this subsidie of <hi>Locall holinesse</hi>
in himselfe, but that his example might
bring others who did neede it; and
those who did not; and, that euen his
owne Preaching might haue the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
and the blessing of <hi>Gods</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in that place, hee sayes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,<note place="margin">Math. 26.</note>
                     <hi>Quotidie apud vos sedebam do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens
in Templo,</hi> and <hi>Semper docui in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoga,
&amp; in Templo;</hi> as in the <hi>Actes,</hi>
the <hi>Angell</hi> that had deliuered the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>
out of prison, sends them to
<hi>Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Actes 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Stantes in Templo loquimini ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi.</hi>
The Apostles were sent to preach,
but to preach in the <hi>Temple,</hi> in the place
appropriated and consecrated for that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:25353:87"/>
holy vse and employment.</p>
                  <p>He came to this place,<note place="margin">Tempus.</note> and he came
at those times, which no immediate
command of <hi>God,</hi> but the <hi>Church</hi> had
instituted. <hi>Facta sunt Encaenia,</hi> sayes the
Text; It was the Feast of the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Wee know what Dedication
this was; That of <hi>Salomon</hi> was much
greater; A Temple built where none
was before; That of <hi>Esdras</hi> at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
was much greater then this, An
intire reedification of that demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
Temple, where it was before.
This was but a zealous restoring of
an Altar in the <hi>Temple:</hi> which hauing
beene prophaned by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the
<hi>Iewes</hi> themselues threw downe, and
erected a new, and dedicated that.
<hi>Salomons</hi> Dedication is called a <hi>Feast,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chr. 5. 3.</note>
a <hi>Holy day:</hi> by the very same name that
the <hi>Feast</hi> of vnleauened bread, and the
Feast of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> is called so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is <hi>Kag.</hi> The
Dedication of <hi>Ezra</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezra 6. 16.</note> is sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:25353:87"/>
to bee a solemne <hi>Feast</hi> too. But
neither of these <hi>Feastes,</hi> though of
farre greater Dedications, were <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersarie;</hi>
neither commanded to be
kept euery yeare; and yet this, which
was so much lesser then the others, the
<hi>Church</hi> had put vnder that Obligation,
to bee kept euery yeare; and <hi>Christ</hi>
himselfe contemnes not, condemnes
not, disputes not the institution of the
<hi>Church.</hi> But as for matter of doctrine
hee sends euen his owne <hi>Disciples,</hi> to
them who sate in <hi>Moses</hi> Chayre, so for
matter of Ceremony, he brings euen
his owne person, to the celebrating, to
the authorizing, to the countenancing
of the Institutions of the <hi>Church,</hi> and
rests in that.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>it was Winter,</hi> sayes the <hi>Text:
Christ</hi> came <hi>etsi Hyems,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Etsi Hyems</note> though it were
Winter; so small an inconuenience
kept him not off. Beloued, it is not
alway colder vpon <hi>Sunday,</hi> then vpon
<hi>Satterday;</hi> nor at any time colder in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:25353:88"/>
the <hi>Chappell;</hi> then in <hi>Westminster Hall.</hi>
A thrust keepes some off in <hi>Summer;</hi>
and colde in <hi>Winter:</hi> and there are
more of both these in other places,
where for all that, they are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to be. Remember that <hi>Peter</hi> was
warming himselfe, and hee denyed
<hi>Christ.</hi> They who loue a warme bed,
let it bee a warme Studie, let it bee a
warme profit, better then this place,
they deny CHRIST in his Institution.
That therefore which CHRIST sayes,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 20.</note>
                     <hi>Pray that your flight bee not in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor vpon the Sabboth;</hi> we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
thus, Pray that vpon the <hi>Sabboth</hi>
(I tolde you at first, what were <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths,</hi>)
the Winter make you not flie,
not abstaine from this place. <hi>Put off
thy shooes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 35.</note> sayes <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> for the
place is holy ground. When <hi>Gods</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
by his <hi>Church</hi> call you to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
place, put off those shoes, all those
earthly respects, of <hi>ease</hi> or <hi>profit, Christ</hi>
came, <hi>Etsi Hyems.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:25353:88"/>But then, <hi>Quia Hyems,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quia Hyems</note> Because it
was Winter, Hee did walke in <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
Porch,</hi> which was couered, not in
<hi>Atrio,</hi> in that part of the <hi>Temple,</hi> which
was open, and expos'd to the weather.
We doe not say, that infirme and weak
men, may not fauour themselues, in a
due care of their health, in these places.
That he who is not able to raise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
must alwayes stand at the <hi>Gospell,</hi>
or bow the knee at the name of <hi>Iesus,</hi>
or stay some whole houres, altogether
vncouered heere, if that increase infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of that kinde. And yet Courts
of <hi>Princes,</hi> are strange <hi>Bethesdaes;</hi> how
quickly they recouer any man that is
brought into that Poole? How much
a little change of ayre does? and how
well they can stand, and stand bare
many houres, in the Priuy Chamber,
that would melt and flowe out into
Rhumes, and Catarrs, in a long <hi>Gospell</hi>
heere? But, <hi>Citra Scandalum,</hi> a man
may fauour himselfe in these places:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:25353:89"/>
but yet this excuses not the irreuerent
manner which hath ouertaken vs in
all these places; That any <hi>Master</hi> may
thinke himselfe to haue the same li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
heere, as in his owne house, or
that that <hi>Seruant,</hi> that neuer puts on
his hat in his <hi>Masters</hi> presence all the
weeke, on <hi>Sunday,</hi> when hee and his
<hi>Master</hi> are in <hi>Gods</hi> presence, should
haue his hat on perchance before his
<hi>Masters. Christ</hi> shall make <hi>Master</hi> and
<hi>Seruant</hi> equall; but not yet; not heere;
nor euer, equall to himselfe, how euer
they become equall to one another.
<hi>Gods</hi> seruice is not a continuall <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
that a man must bee heere, and
here in such a posture, and such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
though hee dye for it; but <hi>Gods</hi>
House is no <hi>Ordinary</hi> neither; where
any man may pretend to doe what he
will, and euery man may doe, what
any man does. <hi>Christ</hi> slept in a storme;
I dare not make that generall; let all
doe so. <hi>Christ</hi> fauoured himselfe in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:25353:89"/>
the <hi>Church;</hi> I dare not make that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
neither: to make all places e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall,
or all persons equall in any
place.</p>
                  <p>Tis time to end. <hi>Saint Basill</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Basil.</note> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
as acceptable as hee was to his
Auditory, in his second Sermon vpon
the 14. <hi>Psalme,</hi> takes knowledge that
hee had preached an houre, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
broke off: I see it is a Compasse,
that all Ages haue thought sufficient.
But as we haue contracted the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of great <hi>Temples,</hi> to this lesser
<hi>Chappell,</hi> so let vs contract the <hi>Chappell</hi>
to our selues: <hi>Et facta sint Encaenia no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra,</hi>
let this be the Feast of the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our selues to <hi>God. Christ</hi> calls
himselfe a <hi>Temple,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 2. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Soluite templum hoc:</hi>
Destroy this <hi>Temple.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 16. &amp; 6. 19.</note> And <hi>Saint Paul</hi>
calls vs so twice; <hi>Know ye not that ye are
the Temples of the Holy Ghost? Facta sint
Encaenia nostra: Encaenia</hi> signifies <hi>Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uationem,</hi>
a renewing: and <hi>Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug.</note>
sayes that in his time, <hi>Si quis noua
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:25353:90"/>
tunica indueretur, Encaeniare diceretur. If
any man put on a new garment, hee called it
by that name, Encaenia sua.</hi> Much more
is it so, if wee renew in our selues the
<hi>Image of God,</hi> and put off <hi>the Olde man,</hi>
and put on the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> This
is truly <hi>Encaeniare,</hi> to dedicate, to renew
our selues: and so <hi>Nazian.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nazian.</note> in a <hi>Sermon,</hi>
or <hi>Oration,</hi> vpon the like occasion as
this, calls, <hi>Conuersionem nostram, Encaenia,</hi>
our turning to <hi>God,</hi> in a true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
or renewing, our dedication. Let
mee charge your memories, but with
this note more, That when <hi>God</hi> forbad
<hi>Dauid</hi> the building of an House, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee was a man of blood,</hi> at that time
<hi>Dauid</hi> had not embrued his hands in
<hi>Vriahs</hi> blood; nor shed any blood, but
lawfully in iust warres; yet euen that
made him vncapable of this fauour to
prouide <hi>God</hi> a house. Some callings are
in their nature more obnoxious, and
more exposed to sinne, then others are:
accompanied with more tentations; &amp;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:25353:90"/>
so retard vs more in holy duties. And
therefore as there are particular sinnes
that attend certaine <hi>places,</hi> certaine <hi>ages,</hi>
certaine <hi>complexions,</hi> and certaine <hi>voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
let vs watch our selues in all those,
and remember that not only the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degrees of those sinns, but any thing
that conduces therunto, prophanes the
Consecration, and Dedication of this
<hi>Temple,</hi> our selues, to the seruice of <hi>God;</hi>
it annihilates our repentance, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
our former reconciliations to
him. <hi>Almighty God worke in you a perfit
dedication of your selues at this time; that so,
receiuing it from hands dedicated to God,
hee whose holy Office this is, may present ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably
this House to God in your behalfes,
and establish an assurance to you, that
God will be alwayes present with
you and your Succession
in this place.</hi>
