            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The Opinion of the moſt Learned and Judicious</hi> HUGO GROTIUS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THere are ſome, I do obſerve, amongſt the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who ſeem very much concerned for the late King's Intereſt, and diſſatisfied with the Management and Diſpoſure of Affairs relating thereto, by this Great and Honorable Convention of the Lords and Commons now aſſembled in Parliament. All who cheriſh Reſentments of this kind I dare not indiſtinguiſhably condemn, becauſe they may poſſibly be directed in ſome by a Principle of Honor and Honeſty: But thoſe whoſe Intentions are honeſt, and do not principally deſign thereby to betray their Country into Popery and Vaſſalage (for ſuch will be the natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, tho not the Inducements to their Wiſhes) I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they would ſeriouſly weigh this Right they ſo much contend for, in the Ballance of Law and Reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they paſs a Cenſure, or ground an Opinion.</p>
            <p>There can be no <hi>Right</hi> pretended either to Property or Dominion, but by the Laws of Nature, Nations, or the Municipal Laws of the Country where ſuch Right is claimed, and altho the latter of theſe are grounded upon and derived from the two former, yet do they notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding take place in the deciding of all Difficulties, ſo far as their Statutes or Preſidents do extend: But where the municipal Laws are ſilent or defective, there Recourſe is to be had to the Laws of Nature and Nations. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it was, that the Grave and Learned Serjeant <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> being applyed unto, as the fitteſt perſon, in reſpect of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48480:4"/>
his great Age and Learning, to ſignifie what the Laws of the Land did direct in ſuch an Exigence as this, replyed, <hi>That it was true, he was the most ancient of all thoſe who attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Proſeſſion, that he had outlived ſeveral Kings, and ſeveral Sets of Judges, but now he had alſo outlived the Law it ſelf.</hi> Intimating thereby, that the Caſe was ſo unuſual and extraordinary, that it went beyond the Direction of the municipal Laws, and therefore muſt appeal to a more remote Tribunal.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon why I do more particularly ſingle out the Opinions of this famous Civilian upon this Occaſion, is becauſe of the great Credit and Authority he has obtained in the World, eſpecially amongſt the Clergy, and is above all other of his Faculty, moſt tender of the Rights and Prerogatives of Crowned Heads. Upon this account there can nothing reaſonably be objected to his Senſe of thoſe Scruples and Difficulties which ſome at preſent labor under. Therefore I deſire they would hear him in his own Words, with the moſt fair and genuine Tranſlation they will admit.</p>

            <p>I know but of three ways whereby <hi>Empire</hi> can be ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally acquired. The firſt is by <hi>Nature,</hi> and the Governor a <hi>Patriarch,</hi> who immediately preſides over a Family or City of his own natural Generation, or claims the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by a Lineal Deſcent from him who was the common natural <hi>Anceſtor</hi> of all his Subjects. To this <hi>Title</hi> I think there is no Prince now in the World lays claim: if there be, let him produce his Pedegree, and prove himſelf the <hi>Primogenitus</hi> by an Hereditary Line from the natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his People, and I will not farther contend it with him.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort of <hi>Empire</hi> is by <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> of which you ſee what <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays. But put the caſe the Conqueror had a Right <hi>prior</hi> to his <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> ſo that the War cannot be called <hi>unjuſt,</hi> yet after he has acquired the Government, he cannot at <hi>once</hi> be <hi>in,</hi> by two <hi>Titles,</hi> ſo as to exerciſe the reſpective powers given by both; becauſe if he holds by <hi>Conqueſt</hi> his power is <hi>Abſolute;</hi> if by <hi>Contract,</hi> then limited and directed by the People; and he cannot be both <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>limited</hi> at the ſame time. From hence it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow, that by every Act wherein he tranſgreſſes his limited power, in uſurping what he had no manner of Right to, he renounces his lawful Title, and rules by force and violence only, and thereby the Conquerors unjuſt War, and the Peoples juſt Right to vindicate themſelves from this unjuſt uſurpation, is ſtill continued.</p>
            <p>As the Caſe ſtands now with us in <hi>England,</hi> if the late King could have claimed by Conqueſt, as many have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he might, from <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, only to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48480:5"/>
palliate ſome illegal Proceedings; what has been done againſt him, and much more, in the Opinion of this learned Man, had been both lawful and juſtifiable. But if he claims neither as a Patriarch, nor by Conqueſt, then there is only left for him to claim by <hi>Compact,</hi> under which Qualification I deſire you would farther conſider him by the Rules which our learned Author lays down.</p>
