            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT
HONORABLE ROBERT
Lord RICH, Baron of
Leeze, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honorable; Among
al the Societies &amp; States,
wherof the whole world
of mankinde from the
first calling of <hi>Adam</hi> in
Paradise, vnto this day, hath consisted,
the first and most ancient is the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
For if we looke into the Scriptures;
The writings of <hi>Moses,</hi> which in time
goe beyond all the Histories and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of men, doe euidently declare, it
was the will of God, to sanctifie that
first coniunction of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> as
the roote wherein mans whole posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
was <hi>virtually</hi> contained, and whence
in the ages succeeding, both Church
and Common-weale should spring


<pb facs="tcp:2719:5"/>
and grow to their perfection. And all
those nations and Countries before the
Flood, the Heads whereof lineally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the two first houses of <hi>Seth</hi>
and <hi>Cain,</hi> had no outward forme of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
gouernment, by which they were
ruled, nor any visible face of a Church
whereto they had relation, but the
whole frame of their policie both Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
and Ecclesiasticall was confined
within the precincts of priuate fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
And from the flood, the house of
<hi>Noah</hi> became the common Mother, in
which the other two states were inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and out of whose bowels they is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
afterward in the multiplication of
posteritie, for number, equall to the
starres of the skie, and the sands by the
sea shore.</p>
            <p>Answerable to the voice of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

               <hi>the first societie in nature, and the
ground</hi> of all the rest. Some againe haue

places of abode, where they may bee
framed as members, to liue in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the lawes of their Head.</p>
            <p>Vpon this condition of the Familie,
being the Seminarie of all other Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
it followeth, that the holie and
righteous gouernment thereof, is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
meane for the good ordering, both
of Church and Common-wealth; yea
that the lawes thereof being rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
and religiously obserued, are
auaileable to prepare and dispose men
to the keeping of order in other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernements.
Hence it is, that the Holie
Ghost in the booke of the Scriptures,
hath in great wisedome commended
both Rules for direction, and examples
for imitation, to Husbands and Wiues,
to Parents and Children, to Masters
and Seruants in euerie point of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian


<pb facs="tcp:2719:6"/>
carriage touching God and man.
For this first Societie, is as it were the
Schoole, wherein are taught and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the principles of authoritie and
subiection. And look as the Superiour
that faileth in his priuate charge, will
proue vncapable of publike employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 5</note>
so the Inferiour, who is not fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to a course of Oeconomicall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,
will hardly vndergoe the yoke
of ciuill obedience.</p>
            <p>Againe, the corruption or declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this first gouernment, must of
necessitie giue way to the ruinating of
the rest. For an error in the foundation,
puts the bodie and parts of the whole
building in apparent hazard. In the old
world,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 12.</note> before the flood, though <hi>all flesh
had corrupted their waies;</hi> yet the first
ground of that vniuersall ouerflow of
sinne, issued out of the state Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall,
and thence was deriued into
the whole earth. It was the fault of the
priuate gouernment of <hi>Eli</hi> the Priest,
that made his sonnes <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 12. 23, 24, 25.</note> of vngratious children, vngodlie
Church-men. It was the error of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:2719:6"/>
in the administration and guidance
of his owne house,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 14 33.</note> which incouraged
<hi>Absalom</hi> and <hi>Adoniah</hi> his sonnes,<note place="margin">1. King. 5. 6.</note> vpon
presumption of their Fathers indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 15</note>
to become ill Common-wealths
men,<note place="margin">1. King. 1.</note> to aspire, and vsurpe the kingdom
by plots and practises of Rebellion.</p>
            <p>To forbeare further matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in this kinde; by the due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the premisses, I hold it a
thing both necessarie and behoofefull
for al estates, to be throughly informed
of the right manner of erecting and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the priuate condition of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie,
whereby they may be furnished
with fit grounds for the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good
in more publike and open courses. For
which end this present Discourse of
Christian Oeconomie, was first contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the Author, and now thought
fit to be set foorth, for the instruction
and edification of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> multitude. Which
as it commendeth it selfe by the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and perspicuitie, both which being
applied to vnderstanding and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
may giue contentment to euerie
well-disposed Reader; so it carrieth a


<pb facs="tcp:2719:7"/>
kinde of eminencie aboue other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises
of this nature before published, in
sundrie regards.</p>
            <p>First, whereas Experience teacheth,
that the Questions of conscience in
matrimoniall affaires, are very many in
number, and difficult in nature; here
we shall finde either direct answeres to
some of them, or at least the grounds of
resolution in diuers cases, warranted by
the word, in such sort, as little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will appeare, vpon the triall, to
be vntouched, making for the Readers
satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, the maine scope of the
Author in the seuerall branches here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is, to make plaine this truth in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
That no Familie can bee interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the blessing and fauour of God,
which is not founded in his feare, and
ordered according to his reuealed will.
For though the Heathen in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the like Argument,<note place="margin">Aristot. Politic. Xenoph. in Oecon.</note> doe shew,
that Nature by her dimme light may
affoord some good directions to this
purpose, and that men meerely natural,
haue prospered in the practise of Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomicall


<pb facs="tcp:2719:7"/>
vertues; yet the true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
of houses and inhabitants whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dependeth vpon the speciall grace
of God, and issueth out of his promise;
and that is directed onely <hi>to them that
feare him and walke in his waies;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 128. 1</note> it being
<hi>godlinesse alone which hath the promises of
this life and the life to come.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 8</note> Therefore to
dreame of a blessing in any other state,
which is not seasoned with godlinesse,
and ordered by direction of diuine
lawe, is but a witlesse presumption;
considering that the familie it selfe
from whence they grow, hath no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
assurance of blessednesse, then
it hath right and title in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it containeth here and there,
some speciall grounds of trueth, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the discouerie of diuers er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of Popish doctrine in points ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to Mariage; as namely these;
I. That this estate is free to all men,
euen to such as haue the gift of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and for those who haue not the
power to abstaine, it is expressely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
by God as necessarie.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 1. 2. 8. 9.</note> Which


<pb facs="tcp:2719:8"/>
discouereth that error of absolute inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
thereof to some sorts of men,
without the least exception of abilitie
to forbeare. And in this case, though
the Church of Rome prescribeth an
helpe by prayer and indeuour, where
the gift is wanting; yet herein, she ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
two more absurdities to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
imposing a necessitie of contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
by her lawes, where God hath
giuen libertie, by his word; and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to flee from that onely Remedie
which himselfe hath sanctified, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whereunto hee neither giueth
charge by his will, nor incouragement
by promise. II. That Marriages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate
without the free and aduised
consent of Parents, either <hi>explicite</hi> in
tearmes, or <hi>implicite</hi> by conniuence, are
in the court of conscience, meere nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
A doctrine cleered in this Booke,
both by Scriptures, and by consent of
Antiquitie. Wherein is challenged the
Iesuites proposition, That the sole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the parties is sufficient,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Matrim. Sacram. libr. c. 19.</note> 
               <hi>ad Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonium
firmum ac ratum efficiendum.</hi>
As also that decree of the Councell of


<pb facs="tcp:2719:8"/>
Trent,<note place="margin">Concil. Trident. Sess. 24. Decreto de clandest. Matrim.</note> which professeth a detestation
of clandestine contracts, and yet with
the same breath pronounceth the curse
of Anathema vpon them, who affirme
that Parents may ratifie or make voide
Mariages contracted by their children,
without their allowance. III. That
Matrimonie lawfullie begun and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate,
is made voide onely by way
of diuorce in the case of Adulterie. So
saith our Sauiour;<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Whosoeuer shall put
away his wife, (except it be for fornication,</hi>
&amp;c.) And this liberty granted by Christ
both to dissolue, and to marrie againe,
cannot be restrained or cut off by any
humane ordinance. A point directlie
impugned by two other Rules of that
Councell. One, that the Church of
Rome erreth not, when she teacheth
(as they professe,<note place="margin">Concil. Trid. Sess. 24. Can. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Iuxta Euangelicam &amp;
Apostolicam doctrinam,</hi> but in truth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
contradictory thereunto) That
the knot of mariage cannot be broken
because of adulterie, and that neither
partie may vndertake to be maried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
during the life of the other, after
the dismission. The other, that the vow


<pb facs="tcp:2719:9"/>
of Chastitie and entring into holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
is of force to loose the bond of
Mariage. And in this case, separation is
made and allowed <hi>de facto,</hi> by the sole
authoritie of the Pope, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the refusall of the setled partie to
yeeld consent. IV. That the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and determination of causes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall,
as of Contracts and their
impediments, of degrees of kinred, of
diuorces, &amp;c. resteth <hi>originally</hi> in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
Magistrate, in whose power it is, to
ordaine and establish lawes touching
them, agreeable to Gods word, and to
cause them to be put in execution. For
this purpose, in doubtfull and difficult
cases, the<note n="a" place="margin">

Whereas the<note n="b" place="margin">Concil. Trid. sess. 24. can. 12.</note> Church of Rome hath
determined, that these causes doe sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
and only appertaine to Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Iudges; and therefore hath conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Mariage to be a Sacrament; that


<pb facs="tcp:2719:9"/>
the definition of cases coniugall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming,
vpon this ground, an action
of a spirituall nature, might be transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the Ciuill to their spirituall
Courts. The soueraigntie whereof; in
these affaires, by their owne constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is greatly inlarged. For though
they admit, that politike Princes haue
some interest in them; yet they must
hold it,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Matrim. Sacram. cap. 32.</note> 
               <hi>with subordination to the autoritie

Rector of the Prouince maketh a law
hereof, hee must doe it <hi>approbante Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe
Ecclesiastico,</hi> by the allowance of
the Pope; otherwise his lawes are
meere nullities. And among their
reasons of policie, this is one of the
principall, that they might by this
meanes raise a commoditie to the Sea
of Rome, by the sale of their dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                  <hi>The household seruice of God hath
two parts; the first is a conference vpon
the word of God, for the edification of

The morning, in which the familie
comming together in one place, is to
call vpon the name of the Lord, before
they begin the workes of their callings.</p>
               <p>The euening also is another time to
be vsed in prayer, because the familie
hath seene the blessing of God vpon
their labours the day before, and now
the time or rest draweth on, in which
euery one is to commend his body and
soule into the protection of the Lord;
for no man knoweth what shall befall
him before he rise again, neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
any whether euer he shal rise againe
or not, it is therefore a desperate bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
without praying to go to rest.</p>
               <p>Besides this, there be other times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
wherein to performe this dutie, as
before and after meales; For meats and
drinkes are blessed to the receiuers, by
the word and prayer. 1. Tim. 4. 4. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
God hath created is good, neither is
any thing to be refused, if it be taken with
thankesgiuing, for it is sanctified by the
word of God and prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now these times, the word of God
approueth. Deut.</hi> 6. 6. Thou shalt talke of


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2719:14"/>
them, when thou liest downe, aud when thou
risest vp. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 55. 18. Euening and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and at noone, I will pray and make a
noise, and he wil heare my voice. <hi>Psa.</hi> 127. 1.
It is in vaine to rise earely, and to lie downe
late, and eate the bread of sorrow, <hi>except
the Lord vouchsafe a blessing,</hi> who will
surely giue rest to his beloued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To these may sometimes be added
the exercise of fasting, which is (as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
serueth) to be vsed both publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; priuately, especially when they of
the familie be therunto called by some
present or imminent calamitie. Hest. 4.
16.</hi> Go and assemble all the Iewes that are
found in Shusan, and fast yee for mee, and
eate not, nor drinke in three daies, day nor
night: I also and my maids will fast like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and so will I go in to the King, which is
not according to the law; and if I perish, I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.
<hi>Zachar.</hi> 12. 11. And in that day shall
there be a great mourning in Ierusalem, and
the land shall bewaile, euery familie apart,
the family of the house of <hi>Dauid</hi> apart, and
their wiues apart, the family of the house of
<hi>Nathan</hi> apart, and their wiues apart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, those families wherein


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2719:15"/>
this seruice of God is performed, are, as
it were, little Churches, yea euen a kind
of paradise vpon earth. And for this
purpose S. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Philemon,
greeteth the Church that is in his house,</hi>
Philem. 1. 2. And in like manner, he sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
salutations to the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
from <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> and <hi>the
Church which was in their house,</hi> 1. Cor.
16. 19. On the otherside, where this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Gods seruice is not vsed, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the most part, or altogether
neglected, a man may tearme those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
no better then companies of
prophane and gracelesse Atheists, who
as they deny God in their harts, so they
are knowne by this note, that <hi>they doe
not call vpon the name of the Lord,</hi> Psalm.
14. 4. Yea such families are fitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to an heard of swine, which are
alwaies feeding vpon the maste with
greedinesse, but neuer looke vp to the
hand that beateth it downe, nor to the
tree from whence it falleth.</p>
               <p>The other dutie concerning the
house it selfe, is, That euery member in
the familie, according to their abilitie,


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2719:15"/>
employ themselues in some honest and
profitable businesse, to maintaine the
temporall estate and life of the whole.
Gen. 3. 19. <hi>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou
eat bread, till thou returne to the earth, for
out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art,
and to dust shalt thou returne.</hi> 1. Cor. 7. 20.
<hi>Let euery man abide in the same vocation
wherein he was called.</hi> Now if any one in
the familie starteth aside out of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and inticeth another to idolatrie,
he is to be reuealed, Deut. 13. 6. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
their case is very fearefull that do
nothing in their houses, but go finely
and faire daintily from day to day. This
is the blacke marke that the Scripture
sets vpon the rich glutton, Luk. 16. 19.
<hi>There was a certaine rich man, which was
cloathed in purple aud fine linen, and fared

the fathers, who had many wiues and

make man in our image, according to our
likenesse, and let them rule ouer,</hi> &amp;c. Gen.
2. 18. <hi>Iehouah Elohim said, It is not good
that the man should be himselfe alone, I will
make him an helpe meete for him.</hi> Thirdly,
the manner of this coniunction was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
for God ioyned our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> together immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.
Fourthly, God gaue a large bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vnto the estate of mariage, saying,
<hi>Increase and multiplie and fill the earth.</hi>
Lastly, mariage was made &amp; appointed


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2719:17"/>
by God himselfe, to be the fountaine
and seminarie of all other sorts &amp; kinds
of life, in the Common-wealth and in
the Church.</p>
               <p>Now if mankind had continued in
that vprightnes and integritie which it
had by creation, the state of single life
had been of no price and estimation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men, neither should it haue
had any place in the world, without
great contempt of Gods ordinance and
blessing.</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse, since the fall, to some
men who haue the gift of continencie,
it is in many respects farre better then
mariage, yet not simplie, but only by
accident, in regard of sundrie calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which came into the world by sin.
For, first it freeth a man from many and
great cares of houshold affaires. Againe,
it maketh him much more fit &amp; dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to meditate of heauenly things,
without distraction of mind. Besides
that, when dangers are either present,
or imminent, in matters belonging to
this life, the single person is in this case
happie, because he and his are more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2719:17"/>
and safe, then others be who are
in maried state. 1. Cor. 7. 8. <hi>Therefore I
say to the vnmaried and widowes, It is good
for them if they abide euen as I do.</hi> vers. 26.
<hi>I suppose then this to be good for the present
necessitie, I meane, that it is good for a man
so to be,</hi> vers. 28. <hi>But if thou takest a wife
thou sinnest not, and if a virgin marrie she
sinneth not; neuerthelesse such shall haue
trouble in the flesh,</hi> vers. 32. <hi>And I would
haue you without care.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The end of mariage is fourefold.</p>
               <p>The first is, procreation of children,
for the propagation and continuance of
the seed and posteritie of man vpon the
earth, Gen. 1. 28. <hi>Bringforth fruit multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie,
fill the earth, and subdue it,</hi> Genes. 9. 1.
1. Tim. 5. 14.</p>
               <p>The second is the procreation of an
holy seed, wherby the Church of God
may be kept holy and chaste, and there
may alwaies be a holy company of men,
that may worship and serue God in the
Church from age to age, Malach. 2. 15.
<hi>And did not he make one? yet had hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of spirit; and wherefore one? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he sought a godly seed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:2719:18"/>
The third is, that after the fall of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
it might be a soueraigne meanes
to auoid fornication, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to subdue and slake the burning lusts
of the flesh, 1. Cor. 7. 2. <hi>Neuerthelesse for
the auoiding of fornication, let euery man
haue his wife, and euery woman haue her
husband.</hi> vers. 9. <hi>But if they cannot abstaine,
let them marrie; for it is better to marrie,
then to burne.</hi> And for this cause, some
Schoolemen doe erre, who hold that
the secret comming together of man
and wife, cannot be without sinne, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be done for procreation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<hi>Lombard</hi> the master of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
saith the contrarie, namely, <hi>that
mariage before the fall was only a dutie, but
now since the fall it is also remedie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth end is, that the parties
married may thereby performe the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of their callings, in better and more
comfortable manner. Prou.</hi> 31. 11. The
heart of her husband trusteth her, and hee
shall haue no need of spoile. <hi>vers.</hi> 13. She see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
wooll, and flaxe, and laboureth cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with her hands.</p>
               <p>Mariage is free to al orders, and sorts


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2719:18"/>
of men without exception, euen to
those that haue the gift of contimencie;
but for them which cannot abstaine, it

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, by the expresse commandement of
God, necessarie. Hebr. 13. 4. <hi>Mariage
is honorable amongst all men, and the bed
vndefiled.</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 9. <hi>But if they cannot
abstaine, let them marrie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which it appeareth to be a cleare
case, that the commandement of the
Pope of Rome, whereby he forbiddeth
mariage of certaine persons, as namely,
of Clergie men, is meerely diabolicall;
for so writeth the Apostle, 1. Tim. 4. 1.
<hi>The spirit speaketh euidently, that in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times some shall depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith, and
shall giue heed vnto spirits of error, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of diuels,</hi> vers. 3. <hi>forbidding to
marrie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But against this doctrine sundrie
things are alleaged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1. The Apostle commandeth
the married among the Corinthes, <hi>to
abstaine with consent for a time, that they
might giue themselues to fasting and praier,</hi>
1. Cor. 7. 5. I answere, that <hi>Paul</hi> speakes
not in that place of daily and common


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2719:19"/>
seruice of God in prayer, but of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
and extraordinarie exercise ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which was ioyned with fasting and
abstinence, in common dangers and
calamities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2. 1. Cor. 7. 32. <hi>He that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married
careth for the things of the Lord,
how he may please the Lord; but the married
person careth for the things of the world.</hi>
Answ. The place is not generally to be
vnderstood of all, but indefinitely of
those married persons that are carnall
and fleshly. And he that is married, is to
bee so carefull for the things of the
world, as that he ought, and may haue
also a special regard of those things that
concerne God and his kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> 3. 1. Tim. 5. 11. <hi>The yonger wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes</hi>
(saith the Apostle) <hi>will marrie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
damnation because they haue broken
the first faith.</hi> Answ. By <hi>the first faith, Paul</hi>
vnderstandeth that promise and vow
which they made vnto Christ, when
they were baptised; and they are there
said <hi>to begin to waxe wanton against Christ,</hi>
by denying or renouncing that faith,
and not otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:2719:19"/>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> 4. He that doth earnestly and
from his heart, craue the gift of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie,
God will giue it him, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he need not marrie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The gifts of God are of two
sorts, some are Generall, some are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Generall gifts are such as God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
generally to all, and these may be
obtained, if they be asked according to
Gods word, lawfully, Iam. 1. 5. <hi>If any of
you lacke wisedome, let him aske it of God,
who giueth to all men liberally, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
no man, and it shall bee giuen him.</hi>
vers. 6. <hi>But let him aske in faith, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
not.</hi> Proper gifts, are those which
are giuen only to some certaine men;
of which sort is the gift of continencie
and such like, which though they bee
often and earnestly asked, yet they are
seldome or neuer granted vnto some
men; as appeareth in <hi>Pauls</hi> example,
who being <hi>buffetted by Satan,</hi> saith of
himselfe, <hi>For this thing I besought the
Lord thrice, that it might depart from me;
but he said vnto me, My grace is sufficient
for thee,</hi> 2. Cor. 12. 8. 9.</p>

               <p>The Beginning, is the Contract or

is the solemne Manifestation of the
Contract, by that which properly we
call Mariage. Deut. 20. 7. <hi>What man is

               <p>First, a businesse of so great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
as this is, would not be rashly or


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2719:20"/>

                  <hi>Actions of weight, before

That during such a space, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie
may be made, whether there be
any iust cause, which may hinder the
consummation of Marriage: conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that before the parties come and
conuerse together, what is amisse may
be remedied and amended, which to
do afterward will be too late. Thirdly,
In these cases, persons espoused must
haue regard of honestie, as well as of
necessitie; not presently vpon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
seeking to satisfie their own flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>The Contract is a mention or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
promise of future mariage, before
fit and competent Iudges and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
               <p>The best manner of giuing this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
is, to make it<note n="*" place="margin">In ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2719:21"/>
exception or condition expressed or
conceiued. For by this meanes it comes
to passe, that the bond is made the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
and the ground or foundation of
future mariage the better laid. And
hence alone it is, that the persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed
in Scripture are termed man
and wife. <hi>Iacob</hi> speaking of <hi>Rahel,</hi> who
was only betrothed vnto him, saith to
<hi>Laban, Giue me my wife,</hi> Genes. 29. 21.
Deut. 22. 23. <hi>If a maid bee betrothed to a
husband, and a man find her in the towne,
and lie with her, then shall yee bring them
both out vnto the gates of the citie, and shall
stone them with stones to death, the maid,
because she cried not being in the citie, and
the man, because hee hath humbled his
neighbours wife.</hi> Matth. 1. 20. <hi>Ioseph feare
not to take Mary thy wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if the promise bee vttered in
words,<note n="*" place="margin">In futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> 
                  <hi>for time to come,</hi> it doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
bind the parties to performance.
For example, if one of them saith to the
other; <hi>N. I will take thee,</hi> &amp;c. and not,
<hi>N. I do take thee,</hi> &amp;c. by this forme of
speech the match is <hi>not made, but only
promised</hi> to bee made afterward. But if


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2719:21"/>
on the other side it be said, <hi>N. I do take
thee,</hi> and not, <hi>I will take thee;</hi> by these
termes, the mariage at that very instant
is begun,<note n="*" place="margin">Non de facto, de <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ure.</note> not in regard of fact,
yet in regard of right and intrest, which
the parties haue each in another in
deed and in truth. And this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
opinion of the learned. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
if the parties contracting
shall say each to other, <hi>I will take thee to,</hi>
&amp;c. with intention to bind themselues
at the present; the bond is in conscience
precisely made before God, and so the
Contract is indeed made<note n="*" place="margin">De prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senti.</note> 
                  <hi>for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
time before God. True it is, that he
which standeth to his promise made, as
much as in him lieth, doth well: yet if
the promise hath or conceiueth some
iust cause, why hee should afterward
change his purpose, the Contract ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in termes for time to come,
though it were formerly made, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by oath, must notwithstanding
giue place to the Contract made for
time present.</p>
               <p>Those espousals, which are made
vpon condition, which is honest, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2719:22"/>
and belonging to Mariage, doe
cease or depend: so far forth as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
annexed ceaseth or dependeth.
For example; If the one partie promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to marry the other vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition,
that his or her kinsman will yeeld con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the match; or vpon condition
of a dowrie that shee shall bring vnto
him, sutable to her education, and the
familie whereof she commeth: these
conditions being kept or not kept, the
promise doth likewise stand, or not
stand.</p>
               <p>But those conditions which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
vnderstood, or which may
certainly be kept and come to passe, do
neither hinder nor suspend Marriage.
As this: <hi>I promise thee mariage, if I liue;</hi>
or, <hi>I promise to marie thee, if the Sunne rise
to morrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, conditions that are either
impossible or dishonest, are not to bee
accounted as promises annexed<note n="*" place="margin">Jn sauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.</note> in
way of Marriage. Of which sort are
these, <hi>I will be thy wife, if thou willt take vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee wings and flie,</hi> or, <hi>If thou wilt bring
an vntimely birth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:2719:22"/>
Furthermore, if the parties betrothed,
do lie together before the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(though honest &amp; appertaining to
mariage) be performed; then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
for time to come is, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
controuersie, sure and certaine.
For where there hath been a carnall vse
of each others bodie, it is alwaies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed,
that a mutuall consent, as
touching Mariage, hath gone before.</p>

               <p>Choice is an enquirie after persons
mariageable.</p>
               <p>Persons mariageable, are such as be
fit and able for the maried state.</p>
               <p>This fitnes or abilitie is knowne and

either essentiall to the contract, or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:2719:23"/>
An essentiall signe is that, without
which the contract in hand becomes a
meere nullitie. And of this sort there
are principally fiue.</p>
               <p>The first is the distinction of the sex,
which is either male, or female. The
male is man of a superiour sexe, fit for
procreation. The female is woman of
an inferiour sexe, fit to conceiue and
beare children. 1. Cor. 11. 7. <hi>The man
ought not to couer his head; for as much as
he is the Image and glorie of God; but the
woman is the glorie of the man.</hi> 1. Tim. 2.
12. <hi>I permit not the woman to teach, neither
to vsurpe authoritie ouer the man, but to be
in silence.</hi> By this distinction is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that vnnatural and monstrous sin
of vncleannes betweene parties of the
same sexe,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 26</note> commonly termed Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie;
as also the confusion of the<note n="*" place="margin">Species.</note> 
                  <hi>kinds</hi>
of creatures, when one kind commits
filthinesse and abomination with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">Leuit. 18 22. 23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The second signe, is, the iust &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Distance of blood is then iust and
lawfull, when neither of the persons


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2719:23"/>
that are to be married, do come neare
to the kindred of their flesh, or to the
flesh of their flesh, for so the Scripture
speaketh, Leuit 18. 6. <hi>No man shall come

                  <hi>kindred of his flesh.</hi> Where it is to be

that substance which is of himselfe, or
whereof himselfe consisteth. And by
the <hi>flesh of his flesh,</hi> that which next and
immediately issueth out of that flesh
whereof he consisteth. Whereupon it
followeth, that the touching or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
neare of flesh to flesh, is not <hi>spoken
of strangers,</hi> but <hi>of those</hi> only that are of
kindred.</p>
               <p>Kindred is of two sorts, consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
or affinitie.</p>
               <p>Kindred in consanguinitie, are those
which issue from out, &amp; the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
blood or stocke. And there be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
degrees, whereby kinsmen of this
sort are distinguished one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>A degree is a generation or descent
betweene two persons that are of the
same blood. For one person cannot


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2719:24"/>

relatiuely in regard of generation.</p>
               <p>Now many degrees continued or
deriued from one and the same head,
do make a Line; And a Line is twofold,
the Right line, or the Ouerthwart, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

persons there are, so many degrees
there be, that only excepted, which vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

from which we begin the account.</p>

               <p>The Right line is either ascending
or descending.</p>
               <p>The right line ascending, is the race
of all the ancestors; and it hath sundrie

and the grand-mother, that is to say,
my fathers and my mothers mother.
Of the third, is, the great grand-father,
or the father of my grand-father; and
the great grand-mother, or the mother
of my grand-father. Of the fourth, is
the great grand-fathers father, and the

               <p>The right line descending, is the race

               <p>Now in this right line, whether
ascending or descending, the person, of
whom the case or question is moued,
commeth neere to the kindred of his

line are prohibited infinitly, without
any limitation; so as if <hi>Adam</hi> himselfe
were now aliue, he could not marry by
the law of God, because hee should
come neare to the kindred of his owne
flesh, as <hi>Moses</hi> speaketh. The reason
hereof is, because in the right line, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
and inferiours are to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as parents and children; and the
kindred betweene parents &amp; children,
being the first and nearest of all other,
their coniuction in marriage must

               <p>The collaterall or crooked line, is

that, which walketh by the sides of the
right line, whether ascending or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending,
in the row of the kindred.
And it is either vnequall or equall.</p>
               <p>The vnequall is that, whereby the
person in question and his kinsman, are
vnequally distant from the common
stocke, or head of the kindred.</p>
               <p>And in this line, looke how many
degrees the kinsman that is furthest off
from the common stock, is distant from
the same, so many is he and his kinsman

               <p>Superiours are such, as are a kinne to

of this line, comes neare to the kindred

and forbidden.</p>
               <p>But against this, sundrie things are
alledged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1. The sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> who
were the first brethren in the world,
married their sisters; marriages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this degree may seeme to bee
lawfull. <hi>Answ.</hi> The case of those persons
in those times, was a case of necessitie,
which could not be auoided, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
was warranted by diuine dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
For God had giuen them his


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2719:30"/>
owne expresse commandement in this
behalfe; <hi>Beare fruits and multiplie, Gen.
1.</hi> 28. Besides that, there were then no
other women in the world, by whom
they might haue issue and posteritie,
but only by their sisters. Whereupon it
is manifest, that Gods will was, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them to take euen their sisters to
their wiues. But now out of this speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
dispensation from God, such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
is vtterly vnlawfull, being an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
breach of another expresse com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandement
giuen afterward by God
himselfe, Leuit. 18. 9. 11. To this purpose
saith <hi>Augustine</hi> in way of answere to the

                  <hi>Obiect. 2. Sarah</hi> was <hi>Abrahams</hi> sister,
and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> tooke her to wife.
Gen. 20. 12. <hi>Yet in very deed she is my sister,
for she is the daughter of my father, but not

tooke them wiues, and the name of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2719:30"/>
wife was Sarah. Answ.</hi> Touching
this instance, there are sundrie opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The Iewes doe grant thus much,
that she was called by a name common
to all kinsfolke of that sexe, to wit, <hi>a
Sister;</hi> yet indeed shee was <hi>Abrahams</hi>
neece, the sister of <hi>Lot,</hi> and the daughter
of <hi>Haran, Abrahams</hi> brother, which
<hi>Moses</hi> elsewhere calleth <hi>Iischa,</hi> Genes.
11. 29. Others thinke, that shee was
daughter in law to <hi>Thare, Abrahams</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
because <hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe saith,
<hi>She is the daughter of my father, not of my
mother.</hi> Others are of opinion, that she
was <hi>Harans</hi> daughter in law, and after
his death was translated into the family
of <hi>Terah,</hi> her grand-father; who was al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so
in ste<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d of her father being dead, and
thence shee was termed his daughter
Now howsoeuer in this varietie of
iudgements, it is hard to find certaintie
of truth, yet this is out of doubt, that
God in those daies tolerated many
things, which notwithstanding he did
not altogether approue.</p>
               <p>Obiect. 3. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 13. Thamar <hi>saies
to her brother</hi> Amnon; Speake I pray thee


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2719:31"/>
                  <hi>to the King, and he will not denie mee vnto
thee. Ans.</hi> The speech of <hi>Thamar</hi> is not
simplie to be taken, as if she desired that
which she said, or as if it were lawfull to
be done, which she wished him to do;
but only that she sought to put him off,
by giuing him this counsell, in respect
of her owne deliuerance from that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
danger; wherein shee was. Or at
least it way be said, that she erroniously
supposed it was lawfull for the King to
grant such a sute, if it had bin made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him by her brother <hi>Amnon.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way soeuer this speech bee taken,
there can no such thing bee gathered
thence, as is pretended.</p>
               <p>Now out of the second degree of
the equal collateral line, it should seeme
that those who are ioyned one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in mariage, do not touch the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of their flesh; and therefore the
law of God forbiddeth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sobrines
or cousin-germans, that is, brothers and
sisters children to marrie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea if examples be of force for this
purpose, the Scripture approueth such
mariages. For thus it is written, that</hi> Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob

                  <hi>married</hi> Rahel <hi>the daughter of</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,
<hi>his mothers brother, Genes. 28. 2.
Againe, that</hi> Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah,
Milcah and Noah the daughters of

Othniel the sonne of Kenaz, the cousin of
Caleb, tooke Kiriath-sepher; and hee gaue

               <p>
                  <hi>Howbeit in this case, the rule of the

be done, euen in <hi>things that are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
lawfull,</hi> whereby a mans brother may
stumble, or bee offended, or made weake,
<hi>Rom. 14. 21. Wherefore it is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
that such mariages should not be,
because sometimes they may giue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
in regard of the law of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate;
and because they come some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
neare to the bonds and termes of
blood and stocke, which God hath set
downe in his word.</hi> Augustine <hi>in his 15.
booke,</hi> De ciuitate Dei, <hi>chap. 16. saith to
this purpose,</hi> Experti autem sumus, <hi>&amp;c.
that is,</hi> We haue found by experience, that
in regard of that neerenesse of blood, which
cousin-germans haue vnto the degrees of


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2719:32"/>
brothers and sisters, how rarely custome
hath admitted those mariages, which were
warrantable by lawes, because the law of
God hath not forbidden them, nor as yet the
law of man. Neuerthelesse the practise law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in it selfe, was forborne the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it came neare to that which was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
and therfore mariage with the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin-german,
seemed in a manner to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with a mans own brother or sister, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Howbeit, there is no question, but in these
times it hath been well prouided by lawes,
that such mariages should not be vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
For as the multiplication of alliance is
hindered thereby, so this inconuenience also
groweth from them, that friendship and loue
which is procured by affinitie, betweene men
that are strangers; cannot be enlarged and
encreased, where men goe not out of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
and termes of their owne blood; Yea,
there is naturally in man a commendable
measure of shamefastnesse, whereby vpon
consideration of nearenesse in blo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
a due debt of modestie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
to his next kindred, and consequently

he occasions and actions of concupiscence,


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2719:32"/>
whereunto hee is inclinable in respect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And hence it is, that generally the
modestie that ought to be in those which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
mariage, auoideth as much as may be,
these and such like coniunctions. <hi>The same
is the iudgement of</hi> Ambrose <hi>in one of

<hi>adding this withall, that though it were

               <p>But it is auouched to the contrarie,

mother, much lesse may he marrie the
daughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The argument is faultie, and
concludes nothing to the purpose. For
there is not the same reason of both. In
the right line of consanguinitie, those
which are sisters to father and mother,
stand in the place and stead of parents;
and their nephewes and neeces are to
them as children, therefore mariages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them can stand by no law, either
of God, of nature, or by the positiue
lawes of nations. It is not so with cousin
germans. For hauing no such relation,
there is not in their mariages, by the
law of <hi>Moses,</hi> any discouerie of shame,
or breach of ciuil honestie. The blessing
of God vpon some of them mentioned
in Scripture, as vpon <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Rahel,</hi>
and such like, doe euidently shew that
they were lawfull in themselues, and
pleasing vnto him. And thus much
touching kindred by blood or consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinitie.</p>
               <p>Kindred in affinitie, is that, whereby
the termes of two kindreds, are brought
into the societie of one and the same


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2719:33"/>
familie; or whereby persons that are
not of blood, are by marriage allied
each to other. Hence it is termed affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
because it maketh an vnitie of
termes in kindred, which before were
distant.</p>
               <p>Affinity or alliance groweth by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or participation of blood, in the
coupling of man and wife together in
lawfull mariage. For a bare and simple
contract, maketh not alliance betweene
partie and partie properly, but mariage
after the contract finished and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate.</p>
               <p>Againe, the same alliance ceaseth
and determineth vpon the death of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
partie espoused or maried; yet so
as the prohibition of coniunction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,
and stands in force, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
of publike honestie.</p>
               <p>Now there is a kind of resemblance
and proportion betweene kindred of
blood, and kindred by mariage, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in regard of degrees and line, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in respect of the prohibition of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>

the degrees, both of the right and
collaterall line, doe come neere to the
kindred of their flesh, in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that cousins by bloud doe, in the
same lines; and the like degrees in both
are forbidden. Therefore in the right
line of affinitie, it is as well vnlawful for
the father in law to marrie the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in law, or the sonne in law to marry
the mother in law; as it is for the father
to marrie the daughter, or the sonne the
mother. Againe, in the collaterall, it is
as vnlawful for the vncle by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
side, to marrie the wife of his
sisters son, and so in other degrees, as it
is for him to match in the same degrees
of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sanguinitie. The reason is, because
in these lines, as well as in those of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinitie,


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2719:35"/>
superiours and inferiours,
are each to other as parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From hence amongst other things,
it may bee gathered, that it is in no sort
lawful for a man, when his wife is dead,
to marrie her sister, Leuit.</hi> 18. 16. Thou
shalt not discouer the shame of thy brothers
wife; for it is thy brothers shame. <hi>And Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit.
20.</hi> 21. The man that taketh his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wife, committeth filthines, because he
hath vncouered his brothers shame.</p>
               <p>Against this doctrine it is obiected.
First, that God commandeth not to
take a wife with her sister, during her
life, Leuit. 18. 18. in which place, hee
doth not simplie forbid a man to marry
two sisters one after another, but to
marrie them both together, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
after the wife is dead, a man may
marrie her sister.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The place is a flat prohibition of
the sin of <hi>Polygamie.</hi> For to take a wife
to her sister in the Hebrew phrase, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but to take two wiues one to
another. The like forme of speech is
vsed otherwhere by <hi>Moses,</hi> as Exo. 26. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:2719:36"/>
                  <hi>Fiue curtaines shall bee coupled together,</hi>
[the woman to her sister] that is, one to
another; <hi>and the other fiue curtaines shall
be coupled</hi> [the woman to her sister] that
is, the one to the other. Ezech. 1. 9. <hi>The
foure beasts were ioyned with their wings,</hi>
[the woman to her sister] that is, the
one to the other. Againe, <hi>Moses</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
there alledgeth two reasons against
<hi>Polygamie:</hi> the one is, because the man
is to loue, cherish and comfort this wife;
whereas, if he should take vnto him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
besides her, he should greatly vex
his first lawfull wife. The other, because
by that meanes he should vncouer the
shame of his wife; that is, he should play
a very dishonest part with her, to whom
he was before lawfully married.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2 The Lord commanded by
a speciall law, that the brother, in case
his brother died without issue, should
take his wife, and raise vp seede vnto
him, Deut. 25. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The words of <hi>Moses</hi> are a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
exception of a generall law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
in Leuit. 18. 16. <hi>Thou shalt not
discouer the shame of thy brothers wife; for


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2719:36"/>
it is thy brothers shame.</hi> And they are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
directed to the Israelites, vpon
speciall cause; that, when the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
died without seed the name of the
first borne might not be extinct, but the
familie might bee preserued in that
name, by raising vp of seed vnto him,
which being a priuiledge proper to the
Israelites, vpon that speciall considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it must not bee enlarged to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sort of men whatsoeuer. Neither
is the text to be vnderstood of cousins
remoued only, as some thinke, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of the next of the kindred by blood;
as appeareth plainly by the historie of
<hi>Ruth,</hi> chap. I. vers. II. in these words of
<hi>Naomi</hi> to her daughters in law, <hi>Turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
my daughters; for what cause will
you go with me? Are there any moe sonnes
in my wombe, that they may bee your hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands?
Turne againe, my daughters, go
your way, for I am too old to haue a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Rule.</hi> The wiues kinsman by
blood, is of affinitie to her husband on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but vnto his kindred by blood, the
said kinsman hath no affinitie at all. So


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2719:37"/>
on the contrarie it is true, that though
the husbands kinsman by blood, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
to his wife, yet he hath no alliance
to those that are kinsmen of blood vnto
her. The reason is, because betweene
the kindred of blood on the mans side,
and the kindred of blood on the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
side, there is no affinitie. For the
prohibition of the degrees of affinitie,
hath force in those only which are the
cause thereof, and goeth no further.
Now the cause being only in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
persons themselues, the effect may
not in reason be enlarged, to them that
are of the same blood with either of
them.</p>
               <p>From this rule it followeth, that the
kindred of both married persons by
blood, may lawfully match together.
The sonne in law, may match with the
daughter of his mother in law. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the son by another wife, may
marrie the mother and the daughter.
Two brothers may lawfully match
with two sisters.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Rule.</hi> Kindred of affinitie to the
wife,<note place="margin">Beza de repudijs. 82.</note> are also kindred of affinitie to her


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2719:37"/>
husband; but how? not properly, but
only after a sort, and as it were, of affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
So on the contrarie. Kindred of
alliance to the husband, are, as it were,
of alliance to his wife. For example.
The wife of my father in law, which is
not my wiues owne mother, but her
step-mother, is, as it were, my mother
in law, for she is (as it were) of affinitie
to me, because she is indeed of affinitie
to my wife.</p>
               <p>Those which are of affinitie only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a sort, cannot conueniently match
one with another. And therefore the
sonne in law may not marrie with his
wiues step-mother; because being of
affinitie to his wife, shee is in stead of a
mother in law to him. Neither may the
daughter in law match with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
step-father, because hee is (as it
were) a step-father to her. Againe, my
sisters husband may not marry my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wife; for they are after a sort, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and sister each to other. The reason
hereof is, because the wife is holden
in law a<note n="*" place="margin">Cuius nuptias in<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

if affinitie hinders mariage with


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2719:38"/>
one of the married couples, it hindreth
as well in the like case and respect, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with the other.</p>
               <p>And thus much touching the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of blood, which in the choice of
persons fit for mariage, is most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to be obserued. For in the 18. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> there are sixteene seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
sorts of persons with whom mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
is forbidden. The first is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The second is the step-mother.
The thid, the sister by the same father
and mother. The fourth, the half-sister,
by one of the parents only. The fifth is
the neece by the sonne. The sixth, the
neece by the daughter. The seuenth,
the fathers sister. The eight, the vncles,
that is, the fathers brothers wife. The
ninth, the mothers sister. The tenth, the
daughter in law, or sons wife. The ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth,
the brothers wife. The twelfth,
the wiues mother. The thirteenth, the
step-daughter, or the wiues daughter
by another husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by a former wife. The fourteenth, is
the step-sonnes daughter, that is, his
daughter who was the wiues sonne by


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2719:38"/>
another husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. The fifteenth, the step-daughters
daughter. The sixteenth, is
the wiues sister. And not only these,
but all other answerable to them, either
in the same or like degree, are by equall
proportion forbidden to be had in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>It is alledged, that the prohibitions
mentioned in that chapter, are meerely
Mosaicall, that is, Ceremoniall, and
therefore doe not bind vs now in the
new Testament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is a flat vntruth; as shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by these reasons.</p>
               <p>First, the Cananites long before these
lawes were giuen by <hi>Moses</hi> to the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,
were grieuously afflicted for
the breach and contempt of the same,
as may bee gathered by that which is
written in the same chapter of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 18.</note>
vers. 3. <hi>According to the workes of the land
of Canaan, yee shall not do, neither walke in
their ordinances.</hi> And vers. 24. <hi>You shall
not defile your selues in any of these things:
for in all these the nations are defiled, which
I will cast out before you.</hi> vers. 25. <hi>And the
land is defiled; therefore I will visite the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2719:39"/>
thereof vpon it, and the land shall
vomit out her inhabitants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, the Prophets themselues
after</hi> Moses, <hi>are wont to account these
prohibitions not Ceremonial, but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
Ezech.</hi> 22. 10. In thee, haue they disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
their fathers shame; in thee haue they
vexed her, that was polluted in her flowers.
<hi>Amos</hi> 2. 7. A man and his father will go
in to a maid, to prophane the name of my
holinesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, the same lawes are also vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the new Testament, wherin Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Ceremonies were determined, and
had their end. Mark.</hi> 6. 18. Iohn <hi>said to</hi>
Herod, It is not lawfull for thee to haue thy
brothers wife. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. It is heard cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
that there is Fornication among you,
and such Fornication, as is not once named
among the Gentiles, that one should haue his
fathers wife.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Nature it selfe by proper
instinct, abhorreth such kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions,
&amp; the prohibitions of them,
haue sufficient ground, euen from her
principles. For to this purpose it is, that
not only the lawes of the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2719:39"/>
but also the ciuill Canons and
constitutions of men, very skilfull in
that kind, haue in all ages expresly bin
made against such persons, as haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
in those societies forbidden by
the law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly, The Lord himselfe hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
many and great punishments
to be inflicted vpon the breach of the
same lawes. Leuit.</hi> 20. 11. The man that
lieth with his fathers wife, because hee hath
vncouered his fathers shame, they shall both
die; their blood shal be vpon them. <hi>vers.</hi> 12.
The man that lieth with his daughter in
law, they both shall die the death; they haue
wrought abomination; their blood shall bee
vpon them. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. He that takes a wife
and her mother, committeth wickednesse;
they shall burne him and them with fire.
<hi>vers.</hi> 16. The man that taketh his sister, his
fathers daughter, or his mothers daughter,
and seeth her shame, and she seeth his shame;
it is villanie: therefore they shall be cut off
in the sight of their people. <hi>vers.</hi> 20. The

               <p>The third essential Signe of a person
mariageable, is abilitie and fitnesse for
procreation. And this in an holy and
modest sort is alwaies supposed to bee
in the partie contracted, vnlesse the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
be manifestly knowne, &amp; discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by some apparent infirmitie in the
bodie.</p>
               <p>Hence I gather, that it is vnlawful to
make a contract with such a person, as is
vnfit for the vse of mariage, either by
naturall constitution of bodie, or by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.
For example; in regard of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or of frigiditie, or of the palsie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable,
or lastly of the depriuation of
the parts belonging to generation.
These and such like impediments are
of force, though a contract should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
be made, yet to make it a meere
nullitie, considering that God maketh
knowne his will in them, that hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth
not of such espousals, but
would haue them to be dissolued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:2719:40"/>
Againe, that which is made betweene
two persons that are<note n="*" place="margin">Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beres.</note> vnder age, is to
bee holden and accounted as vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
And though it should be done by
consent, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of Parents,
yet it is of no moment. This alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred;
except it bee ratified by a
new consent of the parties after they be
come to age; or that they in the meane
time haue had priuate and carnall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
one with another.</p>
               <p>Againe, put the case two be espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
whereof the one is vnder age, the
other of full age; the partie that is of
full age, ought to tarrie and expect the
time, wherein the issue of the espousals
formerly made, may bee manifested.
And the vnder-aged may not break off
consent, either before, or when they be
come to perfect yeares, but must rest in
expectation of the accomplishment of
the contract, when hee or she shall be
out of their minoritie.</p>
               <p>The fourth essential Signe, is a sound
and healthfull constitution of bodie,
free from diseases incurablie conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.

Whereupon it followeth, that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of mariage made betweene those,
whereof the one hath a disease so loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
as that the other vpon good
ground cannot possiblie endure fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
societie and companie with him;
though it do not wholly hinder the vse
of the bodie, is vtterly vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>Of this sort is the Leprosie, the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch
poxe and such like. For seeing there
cannot be any matrimonial vse of them
that are tainted with such contagious
diseases, without apparent danger of
infecting each other, and those also,
which haue societie with them, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
yea and by this meanes the issue
of their bodies, growing of a corrupted
seed, are euen borne to perpetual mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie,
and to the great hurt and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Common-wealth; the case
is plaine, that such mariages cannot be
vndertaken with good conscience.</p>
               <p>Now if the one party haue a disease,
though not contagious, yet either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable,
or so<note n="*" place="margin">Turpi.</note> lothsome, as the other
hath iust cause to abhor his companie;
for example, if he be sicke of a Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2719:42"/>
of the falling sicknes, or such like
diseases; then, though it be lawfull to
match with him, because such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
is not expressely forbidden, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it apparantly hurtfull to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
yet is it not expedient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the disease being lothsome to the
sound partie, the mariage also will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
vnprofitable, and the partie in
danger of breaking the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of the Morall law, wherein God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
to commit adulterie.</p>
               <p>The fifth essentiall Signe of a person
mariageable, is freedome from mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
whereby both the parties which
enter contract, are so at libertie, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the man hath in present another
wife, or is promised to another; nor the
woman hath another husband, or is
promised to another. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God himselfe esteemeth that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
only lawfull, wherein one man is
ioyned to one woman, and they both
into one flesh; &amp; consequently iudgeth
it vnlawfull, as for one man to haue
more wiues; so for one woman at the
same time to haue more husbands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:2719:43"/>
Hence it followeth, that it is against
the law of God, and the first institution
of mariage, that a contract should bee
made betweene such persons, whereof
the one is formerly betrothed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For so long as the first promise
stands in force, the man can no more be
betrothed to two women, then he may
be the husband of two wiues; because
the spouse by the bond of her promise
to the man, becomes a wife; and the
man by the bond of his promise to the
woman, becomes an husband, Deut.
22. 23. 24.</p>
               <p>Againe, there can bee no sure-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and consequently no mariage
with such a one, as either hath been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorced
without a sufficient cause, or
hath wrongfully forsaken and reiected
a lawfull mate before. To this purpose
saith our Sauiour Christ, Matth. 19. 9.
<hi>I say vnto you, that whosoeuer shall put away
his wife, except it be for whoredome, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
another, committeth adulterie; and
whosoeuer marrieth her which is diuorced,
committeth adulterie.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
1. Cor. 7. 11. <hi>But &amp; if she depart, let her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2719:43"/>
vnmarried, or be reconciled vnto her
husband, and let not the husband put away
his wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto I haue treated of essentiall
markes, which belong to the being of
mariage. Now I come to those that are
accidentall.</p>
               <p>An accidentall marke of a person fit
for mariage, is that, which belongeth
not to the being, but to the well being,
that is, to the holines and puritie of that
estate. And of this sort, there be three
that are the principall.</p>
               <p>The first is paritie or equality, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of Christian religion; For in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
there is a speciall care to be had,
that belieuers be matched with belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
and Christians with Christians;
not belieuers with Infidels, or Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
with Pagans. For the former sort
are only and alwaies to be made and
kept, and the latter to be auoided, yea
inhibited by positiue lawes and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
the breach whereof in such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
is seuerely to be punished. The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of this point was one principall
cause of the destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the old world


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2719:44"/>
by the floud. Gen. 6. 2. <hi>The sons of God
saw the daughters of men, that they were
faire, and they tooke them wiues of all that
they liked. Abraham</hi> obserued it in the
mariage of <hi>Isaac</hi> his sonne, and for that
purpose tooke an oath of his seruant.
Gen. 24. 3. <hi>I will make thee sweare by the
Lord God of heauen, and God of the earth,
that thou shalt not take a wife vnto my son,
of the daughters of the Cananites among
whom I dwell.</hi> And in imitation of that
holy example, <hi>Isaac</hi> also giues a charge
vnto <hi>Iacob</hi> his son, that he should <hi>not
take a wife of the daughters of Canaan,</hi>
Gen. 28. 1. Afterward there was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
law of God giuen by <hi>Moses,</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Gentiles that liued in that
land. Exod. 34. 15. <hi>Beware that thou make
not a couenant with the inhabitants of the
land,</hi> &amp;c. vers. 16. <hi>And take of their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
vnto thy sonnes, and their daughters go
a whoring after their gods; and make thy
sonnes goe a whoring after their gods.</hi>
And the same law was vrged by <hi>Ezra</hi>
the Priest in his time. Ezra 10. 11. <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
your selues from the people of the land,
and from the strange wiues.</hi> Lastly, S. <hi>Paul</hi>


                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:2719:44"/>
exhorteth the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, 2. Cor. 6. 14.
<hi>Be not vnequally yoked with the Infidels.</hi>
And Titus 3. 10. <hi>Reiect him that is an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike,
after once or twice admonition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But suppose it falleth out, that the
espousals be past, and that both parties
at the first were belieuers, or one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
only; or that at first both were vnbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
and yet afterward one of them is
conuerted to the faith; or further, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that both were belieuers at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
yet within some time after, the
one becomes an Infidell, that is to say,
a Iew, a Turke, or an obstinate Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike,
that denies the faith, and razeth
euen the very foundation of Religion;
in this case what is to be done? Surely
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such espousals once made and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
if there be no other impediments
but these, are to stand &amp; continue firme
and vnchangeable; so long as the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belieuing
partie doth willingly yeeld,
and submit him or her selfe to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of mariage duties, properly
belonging to man and wife. My reason
is, the speech of <hi>Paul,</hi> who saith; <hi>If any
brother haue a wife, that beleeueth not, if</hi>

                  <hi>she be content to dwell with him, let him not
forsake her.</hi> Againe, <hi>The woman which
hath an husband that belieueth not, if he
be content to dwell with her, let her not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
him,</hi> 1. Cor. 7. 12. 13.</p>
               <p>If it be heere alledged, that the sin of
adulterie dissolues the bond both of
contract and mariage, and therefore
much more doth idolatrie or infidelity,
which is a sinne farre more detestable
then adulterie: I answere, that the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is not, whether of these is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sin, or more hainous in the sight of
God; for Infidelitie in both respects far
exceedeth the other; but whether of
them is more repugnant to the nature
and condition of wedlocke. Now the
sinne of adulterie is that alone, which
breakes the bond, and renounceth the
troth plighted in mariage, and is the
proper cause of a diuorce, and not Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie
or Infidelitie.</p>
               <p>The second note, is parity or equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in regard of age and condition.</p>
               <p>First of Age; because though the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of persons, whose yeares are farre
vnequall, is not expresly forbidden in


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2719:47"/>
the word; yet is it agreeable to the rules
of expediencie and decencie, that the
aged should match with the aged, the
yonger with the yonger.</p>
               <p>Reasons are these. First, because the
comforts of this societie in likelihood
will by this meanes alwaies be equall,
and consequently bring the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
to either partie. Secondly,
these vnequall mariages are often times
offensiue to others. Thirdly, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but in some cases proue offensiue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to themselues. For when a man of
great yeares matcheth with a woman
very yong, or a yong stripling marrieth
an aged woman; the elder partie grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weake and impotent, may the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
come to be vnfit for mariage duties;
and the yonger being of greater stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
and abilitie,, the more in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
exposed to incontinencie, and that
in the highest degree, vnlesse he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
by Gods speciall grace. For
this cause it was a great fault, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
one <hi>Apuleius</hi> was iustly charged,
that being but a very yong man, he was
married to a wife of 60. yeares of age.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:2719:48"/>
Secondly, of condition and estate.
For this also is answerable vnto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
rule, who exhorteth men to
thinke of, and to do those things which
are <hi>true, iust, commendable, and of good
report,</hi> Philip. 4. 8. Thus it is a seemely
and commendable practise, that, the
Prince, the Noble man, the free-man,
the gentleman, the yeoman, &amp;c. should
be ioyned in societie with them, that
are of the same or like condition with
themselues, and not otherwise. For this
cause are the auncient Romans greatly
to be commended, who (as we reade
in their stories) had such a carefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their mariages in this behalfe,
that they made lawes and constitutions
for the restraining of inequalitie of
worldly estate in such societies, by this
meanes preuenting much confusion
and disturbance in families, and other
orders of men. Whereunto agrees that
of <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tertul. ad vxor. li. 2.</note> who saith, <hi>That if a free wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
had affianced her selfe to him that was
a bond-man to another, and being thrice ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
thereof, by him that had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
ouer her, did notwithstanding perseuere


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2719:48"/>
in her purpose; she should, according to the
law, lose her freedome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third note is publike honestie
and credit, whereby the contract made
becomes a matter of good report, well
thought and spoken of abroad. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
things are of good report, thinke on
them.</hi> Philip. 4. 8. From hence I gather,</p>
               <p>I. That it is an vnseemely thing for a
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make promise of mariage to such
a woman, as hath bin formerly deflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
or hath and is, or may beconuinced
of adulterie &amp; vncleannes. Nay I adde
further, that a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract made with such a
one, as himself hath before deflowred,
is by the law of God vnlawfull. For the
adulterer and the adulteresse, by diuine
law should be put to death, and be cut
off from humane societie, Leuit. 20. 10.</p>
               <p>II. It is altogether inexpedient, that
a woman should be married to such a
man, as hath a Concubine, vnlesse hee
formerly renounce her, and testifie the
same by true and vnfeined repentance.
The reason is plaine. Such a mariage
cannot be vndertaken in the Lord. And
the partie himselfe, being before pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2719:49"/>
with his Concubine, becomes now
by mariage to another, an adulterer;
and she that is maried vnto him, by this
her act yeelds consent vnto his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie.</p>
               <p>III. That no man professing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
religion, much lesse a Minister of
the word, ought to take to himselfe in
mariage a harlot, a defamed woman, or
one that comes of infamous parents,
though she be repentant. Leuit. 21. 7.
<hi>The Priest shall not take to wife one that is a
whore, or prophaned,</hi> that is to say, which
hath an euill name, or comes of ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
parents. Which law, though it
was in part Ceremonial and Leuitical,
and so far forth abrogate; yet hauing in
it some Moralitie, in as much as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
therof (to wit, because it is reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to a Christian, but specially to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister)
is still in force, it is to be holden
perpetuall. For Christian profession,
and the Ecclesiasticall Ministrie is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
to be respected, and whatsoeuer
may preiudice the dignitie and credit
thereof, to be auoided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1. The Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> was


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2719:49"/>
commanded to take vnto him <hi>a wife of
fornication,</hi> that is, an harlot, Hosea 1. 2.
<hi>Answ. Hosea</hi> did it not in deed, but in
type and resemblance. For God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him in his prophecie, to take
vpon him (as it were) the person of a
fornicator, that by this meanes hee
might the more effectually charge and
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince the Israelites of their vncleane
and vnchast conuersation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2. The Lord also forbiddeth
the Priest to marrie a widow, Leuit. 21.
14. it may seeme therefore vnexpedient
for a Minister so to do. <hi>Answ.</hi> The law
concerning the mariage of a virgin, and
not a widow, was not enioyned to all
Priests, but only to the chiefe Priest, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit.
21. 10. And hee also might marrie a
widow, but such a one only, as had bin
the widow of a Priest, and not any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Ezech. 44. 22. Now this was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them vpon speciall considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For the High Priest was a type of
Christ, and Christ was in time to come
to call his Church, the elect, among the
Gentiles, and to marrie them as a virgin
espoused vnto himselfe. Yea he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2719:50"/>
to marrie his Church as a widow, but
the widow of a Priest only, because he
was to gather to himselfe the remnant
of the Church of the Iewes; howbeit
not all of them, but such only as came
of the holy Fathers, and were Israelites,
not according to the flesh, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the promise.</p>
               <p>IV. That it is not meete for a man to
be contracted to the sister of her that is
alreadie affianced vnto him.</p>
               <p>And so much of the first point, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to the making of a contract,
namely, the choice of a person fit for

               <p>Touching the first; That the man
and the woman may yeeld free consent
each to other, it is necessarie that, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of vnderstanding, their iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
should be sound; and in regard of will,
their choice should be free. And here
sundrie cases are to be resolued.</p>
               <p>I. Case. When the contract flowes
not from the wil and good liking of the
parties, but is forced and compelled,
what is then to be done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If the espousals haue bin made
through force, or feare; I meane, such
as may befall a constant, and resolute
man, and which hath bin wrought, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
good knowledge, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration;
then are they of no moment, &amp; in truth
meere nullities; because there is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to them the free and voluntarie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and assent of both parties. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
if afterward they shall grow to
a new consent, or both yeeld to an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-acceptation


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2719:51"/>
of that which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
made, the espousals shall then
stand in force; without further excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or contradiction.</p>
               <p>II. Case. But how if consent bee
past, and in processe of time it appeares
to the espoused persons, that they haue
erred, either in choice, or consent, or
both?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a three-fold error in
consent; the one of the person, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the abilitie, or estate of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
the third of the qualitie.</p>
               <p>Error in respect of the person, is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
one person is taken for another; or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the contract is made betweene two,
whereof the one was taken to be such a
partie, as afterwards he proued not to
be. Now where this error is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it is a plaine case, there was no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
and therefore the contract, vpon
certaine knowledge therof, is quite fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.
For the knowledge of the partie
is the ground of consent, and belongs
consequently to the very substance of
mariage.</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse, if, the error being


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2719:51"/>
once knowne, the parties haue had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
societie one with another; &amp; haue
either againe consented, or growen to
an after-acceptation of the consent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made, the contract may and doth
stand in full force. For example: <hi>Iacob,</hi>
by the deceit of <hi>Laban,</hi> had taken <hi>Leah</hi>
for <hi>Rachel,</hi> to his wife; so saith the text,
<hi>When the euening was come, Laban tooke
Leah his daughter, and brought her to him,
and he went in vnto her,</hi> Gen. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23. <hi>But
when the morning was come, behold it was
Leah,</hi> 25. Now by the iudgement of the
best Diuines, <hi>Iacob</hi> might iustly haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<hi>Leah,</hi> if he would, because <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>
had giuen her vnto him for <hi>Rachel,</hi>
and so deceiued him; yet hee would
not vse extremitie, but kept her as his
wife.</p>
               <p>If it be said, there was an error in the
person, therefore no consent, and so
<hi>Leah</hi> was not his lawfull wife, but <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel.</hi>
I answere, that <hi>Iacob</hi> did renue his
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent afterward, &amp; that renued co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent
following vpon their knowing one of
another, made her his wife, though in
extremity &amp; rigor she was not. Againe,


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2719:52"/>
                  <hi>Rachel</hi> was indeed the partie to whom
he was espoused, by the former co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract;
and therfore, vpon their mutuall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
afterward, she also became his
wife. So saith the holy Ghost, vers. 27.
<hi>Fulfill seuen yeares for her, and we will also
giue thee Rachel for thy seruice,</hi> &amp;c. v. 28.
<hi>Then Iacob did so, and Laban gaue him
Rachel his daughter to be his wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Error of the ability or estate is, when
one of the parties to whom co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent was
giuen by the other, being taken for
rich and wealthie, in the issue proues to
haue been very poore, and not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to maintaine that state of life.</p>
               <p>Touching this error, it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
whether the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract was made
absolute, for the time present, &amp; so for
euer afterward, or conditional for time
to come only. If it were absolute, that
is, conceiued in termes of the present
time, then though the deceit bee verie
offensiue to the partie deluded, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his complaint ought in equitie to
be punished by the Magistrate; yet it is
not of force to breake off the contract;
because the abilitie of either or both


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2719:52"/>
parties belongs not to the essence of
mariage. But if it were for time to
come and conditionate, then he or she
that made promise vpon this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is free and not bound in conscience
to fulfill the promise; vnlesse the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
expressed aforehand be kept, and
performed.</p>
               <p>Error of the qualitie of the person,
is, when she which was in the espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
taken to bee a virgin, is afterward
found to be with child by another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they come together. By this error
the Couenant is made void, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a meere nullitie; so as the man
cannot be compelled, vpon true and
certaine knowledge thereof, to marrie
the woman; but may renounce her, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
both parties come to a new agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or haue priuately knowne each
other vpon mutuall consent. For first,
God did in expresse tearmes command
the Iewes, that such a woman should
be stoned to death: Deut. 22. 20. <hi>If the
maid (that was giuen to wife) be not found
a virgin,</hi> vers. 21. <hi>then shall they bring the
maid to the doore of her fathers house, and


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2719:53"/>
the men of her citie shal stone her with stones
to death, because she hath wrought folly in
Israel, by playing the whore in her fathers
house.</hi> Therefore it was not the will of
God, that she should be retained as a
wife, but vtterly reiected and forsaken.
Againe, this was so vsual a practise in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
vpon Gods commandement, that
godly and righteous men, vpon the
discouerie of this error, would not in
conscience be perswaded, to marry the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to whom they had been betrothed,
Matth. 1. 18. <hi>Ioseph her husband</hi> (hauing
found, before <hi>Marie</hi> and <hi>he</hi> came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that she was with child) <hi>being a iust
man, and not willing to make her a publike
example, was minded to put her away se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Case. What shall we thinke of
the espousals of such, as are furious, and
franticke?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We must distinguish of these
diseases. For Madnes is, either perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
or by fits only with intermission.</p>
               <p>If it be perpetuall, the case is cleere,
that whether one of the parties only, or
both be franticke, the contract made


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2719:53"/>
betweene them, is altogether vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
&amp; vaine. For such know not what
they do whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they make a promise, and
the consent which passeth betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
cannot be free, full and perfect, but must
needs be hindred and preiudiced by
the heate and violence of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.</p>
               <p>Now although perpetuall madnesse
be a iust impediment of mariage, and a
sufficient cause to dissolue a contract,
yet it is meet that there be a conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
space of time agreed vpon, wherein
all meanes may be vsed for the curing
of this disease, to the end that Gods wil
touching their amendment may be the
more euidently knowne; and both the
parties themselues, and their friends
may giue testimonie to the world, that
they haue had a carefull respect of the
contract before made.</p>
               <p>Againe, if it be not continuall, but
<hi>by</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Dilucida interual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</note> 
                  <hi>fits,</hi> so as they haue some good daies,
and quiet intermissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the case is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
For the contract shall be ratified,
and stand in force: prouided, that it was
manifestly knowne, that the said parties


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2719:54"/>
were both in their right wits, before
they plight their troth each to other;
and themselues be willing afterwards
to confirme their promise forme<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly
made, by renuing their consent.</p>
               <p>Consent of the Parents, is that act
whereby they giue their word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
to bestow their children in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and in regard of right, doe indeed
presently bestow them.</p>
               <p>Therefore priuate contracts, that are
made without free and lawfull consent
of parents, are not only vnprofitable
and vnlawfull, but euen by the law of
God meere nullities. Reasons. I. They
are contrarie to the expresse will and
commandement of God: Exod. 20. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
thy father and thy mother.</hi> II. They
are flat repugnant to naturall equitie;
which teacheth, that he who hath not
power, nor right ouer himselfe, cannot
bind himselfe by promise to another.
Now children haue not power ouer
themselues,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 1.</note> but are vnder the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp; at the disposition of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
therefore the couenants which
they make, are not made and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2719:54"/>
of God, and those which God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not, are in deed and truth none

parties immediately after the contract
made?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Those diseases which take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the vse of the bodie, and altogether
disable the partie from the performance
of the promise made, in respect of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2719:55"/>
duties, are very iust impediments
of mariage, and consequently do break
off the Contract. Of which sort are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
palsies, frigiditie, and such like,
whereof I haue spoken before.</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse a couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t once made,
is not suddenly to bee renounced, for
feare of breeding offence. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
some longer respite is to be taken
from the time of the contract, in which
they are to rest in expectation of ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
before the said diseases be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
and solemnely declared to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable,
and consequently that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
made is become void.</p>
               <p>Now, if the disease do not for the
present take away the vse of the body,
and yet in time proues incurablie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious,
and so lothsome, that the one
may iustly feare to keepe and conuerse
with the other; as it falleth out when
one is tainted with leprosie; then the
contract is vtterly to be dissolued, as if
God himself should haue commanded
it, though the promise was formerlie
made, &amp; the parties themselues should
be vnwilling. God hath ordained Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2719:55"/>
to helpe, not to hurt either the
persons themselues, or others. Where
therefore these diseases be, which may
infect, hurt, or destroy others, there
God hath, as it were, testified from hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen,
that the act done is not pleasing
vnto him, and that presently it ought to
be frustrate.</p>
               <p>The contract being thus once dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
the sounder partie shall be at his,
or her libertie to marrie againe. But the
diseased is by the Magistrates authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to be forbidden societie with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in way of mariage, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to lead his life, where he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently
from companie, for feare of
infection. And withal he is for his owne
part, to sue vnto God by prayer in faith
for the gift of continencie. For certaine
it is, that he to whom God hath denied
the power of vsing mariage with good
conscience, is thereby euen called to
continencie and single life.</p>
               <p>But if the disease be not contagious,
yet either incurable, or so nastie, that
either of the espoused hath iust cause to
be afraid of the others companie; then


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2719:56"/>
both are to be aduised, not to claime
their right, but willingly to surrender it
each to other by mutuall consent, that
they may be free againe, &amp; not bound
by any former promise to liue together
as man and wife. Considering that they
haue no hope mutually to conuerse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
with comfort &amp; contentment,
while they so remaine.</p>
               <p>Vpon this aduice giuen by their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Pastor, or some in his stead; if they
both yeeld, or one of them at the least
desires to be at his owne libertie, the
espousals are forthwith to be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off.
But if neither will consent to a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but rather proceed as they haue
begun, and in probability the one haue
no iust cause to hold the other in suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in respect of contagion; they are
not to be hindered from the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of their mariage.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, though one of them
should haue a disease, which is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
without intermission, &amp; yet cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or any other inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience should

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2719:56"/>
or dumbe, &amp;c. yet this is not a sufficient
cause to moue them to renounce, and
dissolue the contract.</p>
               <p>A second Case. What if it falleth
out, that after the finishing of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
one of the espoused persons bee
long absent from the other, so as the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
bee preiudiciall to the mariage,
that should ensue vpon the contract?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Inquirie must be made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this absence be voluntarie, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the will of the partie.</p>
               <p>If it be voluntarie. For example; if
the man vpon an honest and iust cause,
the woman also being priuie thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
shall go beyond seas, and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
of his dutie before hand, shal
notwithstanding stay a whole yeare or
more, and will not returne, but further
wilfully absent himselfe; then may it be
lawfull to the woman, to craue of the
publike Magistrate a dissolution of the
couenant made, &amp; consequently marry
another man, vnlesse the former, to
whom she was contracted, be heard of.
If he be, then shall it be lawfull for him
to pleade for himselfe, and tendring no


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2719:57"/>
iust cause of his refusall, he shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the Magistrates authoritie to
stand to his promise, and take the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
for his wife. And the same order
is to be taken in the wilfull absence of
the woman, after she is contracted.</p>
               <p>If againe, the man or woman shall
vpon an euill mind, and with purpose
to deceiue each other, absent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues,
and depart; meanes must be vsed, that
they may be admonished of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
That being done, or at least vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
and yet the partie offending will
not appeare, if the other that is present,
vpon certaine knowledge of his, or her
want in respect of continencie, shall sue
to the Magistrate; after publike and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
notice giuen, the contract may
be broken.</p>
               <p>But if on the other side, either of
them be absent against their wil, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
no fraud or deceit, but is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
detained, by captiuitie, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
sicknes, force, banishment, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
or such like; then the partie
present being desirous of the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the mariage, ought either to


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2719:57"/>
make meanes vnto him, and expect his
returne, or haue certaine notice of his
death, before she promise, or haue to do
with any other in way of mariage.</p>
               <p>A third Case. What if after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
one of the parties becomes furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or madde?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If the disease be continuall,
without intermission, in all equitie and
likelihood, the espousals are to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued,
vnlesse both parties after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and experience of the disease,
haue knowne one another: yet in this,
and all such like cases, it is fit that all
good meanes be tried and vsed, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
time be giuen for the restoring
of the diseased, to their former good
estate, and for the accomplishment of
the mariage lawfully begun, as before.</p>

parent, though it be not taken away, yet
it is lessened, when it is either transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to another person, or in part resteth
in the child alreadie bestowed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by parents consent, I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that which they giue, not


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2719:59"/>
rashly, vnaduisedlie, or foolishlie, but
out of good &amp; wise consideration, and
vpon true and sound iudgement, of the
businesse in hand: For otherwise, as
much as in them lieth, they make the
mariage void and of none effect. And
they are then thought to carrie a right
iudgement of the thing, when they be
able to yeeld a iust cause of yeelding, or
denying their consent. For example;
if a father denies to bestow his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Iulia</hi> vpon <hi>Sempronius,</hi> because hee
knowes him to be an Arrian, a Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
or of any other sort of Heretikes; he
withholdeth his consent vpon a good
ground, &amp; he doth that which he doth,
of iudgement.</p>
               <p>Yet further I adde, that where the
parents do dissent, and can yeeld no
probable cause thereof; the mariage
consummate without their consent,
ought to be confirmed and ratified by
the authoritie of the Magistrate, who is
<hi>Pater patriae.</hi> And this seemes to be the
most equall course, both for the auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of greater scandals, &amp; for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting
of wrong, that may otherwise


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2719:59"/>
be done in some particular case, as to a
woman that is defloured and reiected.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, consent of parents is either
expressed, or implied; Expressed, when
it is giuen by words; Implied, when it
is yeelded by silence. For it standeth
with most equitie and indifferencie, to
thinke that those parents do giue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
who do not by word expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
the same.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, children are either subiect
to the authoritie of their parents in the
familie; or at their owne libertie, &amp; out
of their parents subiection. Those that
are at liberty, are tied necessarily to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
in respect of mariage; but the
other being still of the familie, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
iurisdiction, are bound to be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
by their parents in the bestowing
of themselues.</p>
               <p>This is briefly the meaning of the
question in hand. Now, for proofe of
this point, I will propound three sorts
of arguments, wherof some are drawne
from the law of God, some from the
light of nature, and some from the
iudgement of the ancient Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:2719:60"/>
For the first sort. According to the
law of God, mariage is not only a ciuill
and politike, but also a diuine and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
coniunction, the author and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer
whereof, vpon speciall cause,
was God himselfe: This our Sauiour
Christ witnesseth, when he saith, <hi>Those
whom God hath ioyned together, let no man
separate,</hi> Matth. 19. 6. That therefore
mariages may be soundly ratified and
confirmed, the authoritie and power of
God himselfe is necessarily to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, How God that is in
heauen, should bring and ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man and wife vpon the earth?</p>
               <p>I answere, that he doth it not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by himselfe, as he brought <hi>Euah</hi>
vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> but in &amp; by some solemne
and lawful meanes. And this meane, is
that great and ancient power and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue
of pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. And the law of God
hath giuen them this power, not in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
contracts and compositions alone,
but euen in the beginning and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing
of mariages. Deut. 7. 3. <hi>Thou
shalt not giue thy daughter vnto his sonne,


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2719:60"/>
nor take his daughter vnto thy son.</hi> Ierem.
29. 6. <hi>Take wiues for your sonnes, and giue
your daughters vnto husbands, that they
may beare sonnes and daughters.</hi> 1. Cor. 7.
36. <hi>But if any man thinke that it is vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
for his virgin, if shee passe the flower of
her age, and need so require, let him doe
what he will, he sinneth not, let them be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it was, that <hi>Abraham</hi> by right
of this authoritie, gaue order what wife
his seruant should prouide for his son;
<hi>Thou shalt not take a wife to my sonne of the
daughters of the Canaanites; But thou shalt
go vnto my countrie, and to my kindred, and
take a wife vnto my sonne Isaac,</hi> Gen. 24.
3. 4. <hi>Sampson,</hi> though he was inflamed
with the loue of the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Timnath,</hi>
whom he saw to be beautifull in his
eyes, yet hee durst not take her to his
wife, till she was giuen him of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
Iudg. 14. It was an expresse law
of God, that <hi>if a man intised a maid that
was not betrothed, and lay with her, hee
should endow her, and take her to his wife:</hi>
But how? marke in what manner the
holy Ghost proceedeth, <hi>If her father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2719:61"/>
to giue her to him, he shall pay money ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the dowrie of virgins,</hi> Exod. 22.
16. 17. Deut. 22. 28. 29. In which text,
<hi>Moses</hi> plainly teacheth, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the two parties is not sufficient,
no not though they haue had societie
together, vnlesse they haue the free co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of their parents also. In like maner
it was ordained by God, Numb. 30.
4. 5. 6. <hi>That if a woman vowed a vow vnto
the Lord, being in her fathers house, &amp; her
father hearing it, holdeth his peace concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
her,</hi> that is, approueth her vow by
winking at it, <hi>her vow shall stand. But if
her father disallow her,</hi> that is, giueth no
approbation or consent vnto the vow
made, <hi>it shall be of no value, and the Lord
wil forgiue her, because her father consented
not.</hi> Now, if the vow of children made
vnto God, and pertaining to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
cannot be ratified without the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
approbation; of how much lesse
force shall any priuate contract or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
be, without their allowance?</p>
               <p>The second argument is taken from
the light of nature, and it is gathered by
proportion on this manner: A son pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilie


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2719:61"/>
alienateth and selleth away his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
lands, either in whole or in part.
The question is, whether this alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be good in law, yea or no? Answere
is, No. And why? Because the land did
not belong to the son, but was part of
his fathers substance. In like manner, a
son alienates himselfe, and is betrothed
to a woman, to marrie her without his
parents knowledge: Is this act of the son
warrantable and sound? By no meanes;
for the son in respect of his body, is part
of the fathers goods, and may not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated
from him without consent. A
notable reason hereof we find in Iob 1.
For when God had giuen Satan power
to destroy and spoile all <hi>Iobs</hi> goods, and
whatsoeuer he had, the diuell doth not
only touch the wealth of <hi>Iob,</hi> but his
children also, as a part of his substance.
In this respect the Iewes were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God to sell their children. Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
21. 7.</p>
               <p>Againe, for the accomplishment of
mariage, there must needs be a mutuall
donation, betweene the spouse and the
espoused. And what is that which is


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2719:62"/>
mutually giuen? Surely their persons,
or rather their bodies each to other, for
so <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1. Cor. 7. 2. <hi>Let euery man
haue his wife, and let euery woman haue her
owne husband.</hi> But by whom is this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to be made? by sons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that are in the familie, vnder the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
of their parents? It may not
be; For nature her selfe taketh it for
granted, that he which is not at his own
libertie, cannot yeeld to the giuing of
himselfe. The donation therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
in the right of the parent, in as
much as the wil &amp; consent of the child,
ought to depend vpon his wil and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
to whom God hath giuen power
and authoritie in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>In the third place, let the iudgement
of the ancient Church be obserued.
<hi>Ambrose,</hi> in his first booke of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
<hi>Abraham,</hi> chap. 9. requires this
consent in mariages, which he saith is
so equall and agreeable to nature, that
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Poets acknowledged the same.
For which purpose he reciteth two ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
out of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Poet <hi>Euripides,</hi> in
his Tragedie called <hi>Andromacha,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2719:62"/>
in when <hi>Orestes</hi> desired to marrie <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mion,</hi>
she frames him this answere, That
the matter of her mariage wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
vpon the pleasure and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of her father, &amp; was not in her owne
power or libertie. <hi>Innocentius,</hi> who was
both a Pope and Martyr, in his decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
epistles, so strictly requireth consent
of parents,<note place="margin">Sub Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. 3. canon. 51.</note> 
                  <hi>as where it is wanting, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the mariage to be void.</hi> In the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Lateran, it was decreed that
Clandestine contracts &amp; <hi>secret mariages,
made and vndertaken betweene partie and
partie, should be holden as vnlawfull as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
in those degrees of consanguinitie and
affinitie, which are forbidden by God. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
saith,<note place="margin">Tertul. lib. ad vx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem, 2. ad finem.</note> That <hi>in this world the sonne
cannot</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ritè &amp; Iure. Basil. epist. 1. ad Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philoch. Canon, 42.</note> 
                  <hi>rightly and lawfully marrie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the allowance of his father. Basil</hi> in an
Epistle to <hi>Amphilochius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Iconi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
affirmeth; <hi>That mariages which are
made without them which haue power ouer
the parties, are fornications, and therefore
that they which are ioyned together in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
while their parents</hi> or <hi>masters liue, are
in no sort free from imputation of sin, vntill
they haue approbation from them, for then


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2719:63"/>
mariage is ratified &amp; confirmed, when they
haue yeelded allowance thereunto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second Action touching the
consummation of mariage, is the action
of the Minister. And that is the blessing
or sanctification thereof, which is a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
worke, wherby the Minister pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the parties contracted to be
man and wife before the whole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
commendeth them and their
estate vnto God by solemne prayer.</p>
               <p>This solemne sanctification is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon the practise of God himselfe,
who hauing giuen <hi>Euah</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them, saying, <hi>Increase and multiplie,</hi>
Gen. 2. 22. and 1. 27. For that which God
then gaue, the Minister standing in his
roome, now prayeth may be giuen to
the man and wife. Yea it is agreeable to
the generall rule of the Apostle, <hi>Let all
things bee done decently and in order,</hi>
1. Cor. 14. 40.</p>
               <p>Now that this action is to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and vsed in the Church, appeares
by these reasons. I. Mariage as it is a
publike action, so it is after a sort a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and diuine ordinance, whereby it


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2719:63"/>
differeth from the contract: For the
contract being meerely ciuill, as it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
by consent of men, so by the same
consent, it may bee broken and dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
but with mariage it is otherwise.
II. Marriage is the Seminarie of the
Church and Common-wealth. III. It
was the practise of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Primitiue Church.
<hi>Tertullian</hi> speaking of the marriage of
Christians with Christians,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. ad vxorem.</note> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
himselfe not to bee able suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
to declare the happines <hi>of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
which is made by the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
by prayers &amp;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Oblatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem sic exponit Beatus Rhenanus. Niceph. lib. 14. cap. 55. Ambros. epistolar. lib. 9. epist. 70. ad Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilium.</note> 
                  <hi>solemne seruice, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed
by the Angels, and ratified by God
himselfe. Nicephorus</hi> reporteth of one
<hi>Synesius,</hi> who auouched that <hi>God &amp; the
lawes, and the holy hand of Thesphylus had
giuen him a wife. Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>That
mariage ought to be sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified, with the vaile
wherewith the Priest was wont to couer the
Bride and the Bride-groome in the publike
congregation, and with his blessing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third and last action belonging
to the accomplishment of this estate, is,
that of the parties themselues, whereby
the Bride is in decent and modest man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2719:64"/>
brought vnto the house and home
of the Bride-groome. It is the law of this
estate published by God himselfe in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
that the man, euen in respect of
habitation, <hi>should leaue father and mother
and cleaue to his wife,</hi> Gen. 2. 24,</p>
               <p>Heere question is moued, whether
mariage is to be solemnized with mirth
and feasting. <hi>Answ.</hi> I. It is lawfull and
warrantable to vse feasting and mirth at
mariages, because these be things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
and wee haue examples thereof
in the Scriptures. <hi>Laban</hi> made a feast at
the wedding of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> and
inuited all the men of the place to it,
Gen. 29. 22. Christ himselfe did approue
the resort of people to the mariage at
Cana in Galilee, both by his presence,
and by that honorable gift of sixe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pots
of the best wine, Ioh. 2. 2. 7. 8.
II. It is not only lawfull, but conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and fit to be done, if there be abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
according to the commendable
custome of the place &amp; countrie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
men do dwell; so as in the vse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
these cautions bee obserued. First,
that in mirth and merry-making, there


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2719:64"/>
be care had that nothing be done which
is dishonest, prophane, or of ill report.
Philip. 4. 8. <hi>Whatsoeuer things are honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
of good report, thinke on these things.</hi>
Secondly, That ioy in them be mixed
and moderated with the feare of God,
without which <hi>Laughter</hi> and reioycing
is meere madnesse, Eccles. 2. 2. Thirdly,
That it bee performed in a moderate
and sober vse of the creatures, without
riot &amp; excesse. Thus we reade that at the
great feast of <hi>Ahashuerosh,</hi> it was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the King himself, <hi>that they should
drink orderly,</hi> &amp; none might compel an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
to drinke more then he thought
conuenient, Ester 1. 8. And where wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
are kept contrary to these directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they are not feasts celebrated vnto
God, but vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuell; which also may
be said of all other festiuall meetings.</p>
               <p>And so much touching the point of
mariage, in which this is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion, That where there
is generally a nullitie in the contract, or
a separation following vpon it, there is
also a nullity in regard of the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of mariage.</p>

               <p>This dutie must bee kept especiallie
the first yeare of mariage, Deut. 24. 5.

to continue firme and sure notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:

               <p>Desertion is, when one of the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
folkes, vpon a wilfull, and obstinate
mind of their owne head, departeth
from the other, without a iust, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
cause.</p>
               <p>Touching this point, there bee sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
Cases expounded.</p>
               <p>I. Case. Suppose that an husband
which is an vnbeleeuer, or an heretike
in the foundation, of his owne accord,
vpon detestation of true religion, quite
forsakes the beleeuing wife, and denies
any more to dwell with her; what is to
be done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> All good meanes must bee


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2719:68"/>
first vsed to bring the infected partie to
repentance; and when none will suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
but the case remaineth despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
then mariage is dissolued on his
part, and the beleeuing wife is free to
marrie another. So saith the Apostle,
1. Cor. 7. 15. <hi>If the vnbeleeuing partie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
let him depart; a brother or a sister
is not in subiection in such things; but God
hath called vs vnto peace.</hi> In which words
obserue a twofold reason: I. He that
is at libertie may marrie another; now
the beleeuing partie forsaken, is at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
because hee is not in subiection in
such things: therefore he may marrie
another. II. God hath called vs vnto
peace, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> and this peace cannot
be kept, if the beleeuing partie forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
cannot containe, vnlesse he marrie.
<hi>Ambrose</hi> vpon the place saith,<note place="margin">Ambros. in 1. Cor. 7. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
cannot stand firme, which is separated
from the worship and seruice of God; and
therefore it is no sinne in the partie that is
for saken for Gods cause, to be married to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
and the vnbeleeuer departing, sinneth
both against God, and against the law of
wedlock, because he denies to remain in that


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2719:68"/>
estate, in regard of religion. Therefore hee
breakes the couenant of mariage, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is not bound in this case to keepe touch
with him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Libr. 4. dist. 39.</note> the master of the
sentences, saith, <hi>That the beleeuing partie
in this case, is not bound to follow the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuer
when hee departeth, but while hee
liues may marrie another.</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> Augustine <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
that euen the wife which is ioyned
to her husband in lawfull societie, if shee will
not abide with her Christian husband, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is a Christian, may be forsaken and
left, without sin.</hi> And it is far better that
the couenant should be dissolued, that
man and wife haue made each with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then that the Couenant which
man hath made with God. The people
of Israel being in affliction, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to break the former made with
strange women, that they might keepe
the latter, Ezra 10. 11. 19.</p>
               <p>It is alledged, that the vnbeleeuing
partie may haply repent, and then to
make a dissolution is in vaine. But I say,
that it is as likely that he will neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and therefore there is cause that
the knot should be dissolued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:2719:69"/>
Againe, it is lawfull (say some) to
make a diuorce out of the case of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie.
<hi>Answ.</hi> The belieuing partie
which is forsaken, is not the cause of
the diuorce, but is a patient of the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
wrongfully made by the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer.
And Christ where he mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the Case of Adulterie, Matth. 19.
speaketh of an equall mariage, whereas
<hi>Paul</hi> speakes of an vnequall.</p>
               <p>II. Case. What if there fall out a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
betweene two married folkes,
which are both beleeuers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The faultie person, who is the
cause of this desertion, is to be forced
by course of Ciuill, and Ecclesiasticall
censure, to performe his, or her dutie.
Vpon which proceeding, if he remaine
obstinate and peruerse in will; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must in patience, &amp; earnest prayer
vnto God, waite the time, vntill his
mind may be changed, and he made to
relent by the order of the Magistrate.
But if the one of them, by iust occasion
of feare, be compelled to depart from
the other; and cannot returne againe
without apparent danger of life; in this


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2719:69"/>
case they are not bound to returne; but
the delinquent partie is to remaine so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie,
till they be instructed and made
willing to doe their duties: and in the
meane while, the partie innocent must
be resolued that God hath called him
or her to single life.</p>
               <p>Againe, be it that the one is resolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnwilling to dwell with the other,
and thereupon flies away without any
fault of the other; if the thing after a
long space bee sufficiently knowne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand,
and all possible meanes haue
been vsed, to reclaime the guiltie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
yea being called, he doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally
appeare before the Iudge, to
yeeld a reason of the fact; after publike
and solemne declaration made, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
vpon such desertion, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the mariage to be dissolued. For
he that vpon malice flieth away from
his mate, is to bee holden in the same
termes with an vnbelieuer, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
vpon detestation of religion, and
the seruice of God, 1. Tim. 5. 8.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, if the place whither he is
fled, be vnknowne, and vpon his flight


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2719:70"/>
there be found some fault in the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe,
she is not to be heard, or set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
by the Iudge in this case, though
shee pretend want of the gift of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie.</p>
               <p>But suppose he that fled come againe
vnlooked for, and requires his spouse;
then in case the former course hath not
bin taken, nor iudgement giuen against
him, they may be reconciled and come
together againe. If it hath, and matters
be concluded, hee is not vpon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to bee heard, but rather seuerely
punished.</p>
               <p>Like vnto <hi>Desertion,</hi> is malicious and
spitefull dealing of married folkes one
with the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Malicious dealing</hi> is, when dwelling
together, they require each of other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
conditions: and when the one
doth not regard nor relieue the other,
being in danger or extremity, as is meet.
For this is as much as to betray one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others
estate and life to their vtter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Heere it may be demanded, what a
belieuer should do, who is in certaine


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2719:70"/>
and imminent danger, either of losse
of life, or breach of conscience, if they
both abide together?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I. This certaine danger hath
his originall, either from one that is a
stranger, or from one of the parties: If
from a stranger, then the husband ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
takes vpon him the defence of his
belieuing wife, or not; if he doth, then
she ought to abide with him. If not, she
may depart and prouide for her owne
safetie. II. Againe, if the husband
threatneth hurt, the belieuing wife may
flie in this case; and it is all one, as if the
vnbelieuing man should depart. For to
depart from one, and driue one away
by threats, are aequipollent.</p>
               <p>Neither may this seeme strange vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any, that the belieuer in such case is
allowed to depart. For a husband that
is a Christian is married two waies: First
with Christ, and secondly with his wife.
The former mariage is made in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
and is a more holy coniunction,
then is the latter. Therfore when these
two cannot stand together, but one of
them must needs be dissolued; the latter


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2719:71"/>
must rather be left then the former. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
if the belieuer should remaine
with the vnbelieuer, she should haplie
be vrged sometimes, in case of danger
vpon infirmitie, to deny Christ, &amp; make
ship wracke of faith and good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
which may in no sort be done of
either partie: and therefore separation
is to be made rather in this society, then
that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction with Christ should
not stand firme, and continue.</p>
               <p>It is alledged, that if this be so, then
the belieuing wife forsakes the vnbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
husband, which she may not do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> She forsakes him not finally,
but leaues him for a time. Againe, the
desertion is not made by the person,
which giueth place for the time, but by
him in whom is the cause of the deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
euen as he is not to be termed a
Schismatike, which separateth himself,
but hee in whom is the cause of the
Schisme.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is obiected, that he which
flieth leaues his calling; and euery man
must abide in his calling; according to
the rule of the Apostle, 1. Cor. 7. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:2719:71"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a double calling; The
generall, standing in the worship of
God; The particular, as the calling of
mariage, or of single life. When these
two callings cannot stand together, the
latter must giue place to the former,
Luk. 14. 26. <hi>If any man come to me, &amp; hate
not his father, and mother, and wife, and
children, and brethren, and sisters; yea and
his owne life also, he cannot be my disciple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Case. When the husband is
perpetually absent from the wife, what
is to be done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If he be absent either because
he is in captiuitie, or vpon malice, or
feare, or any such like cause; the wife
must rest in expectation of his returne,
till she hath notice of his death, either
by sufficient testimonie, or by apparant
likelihoods. Now in the want of testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and coniectures in this behalfe,
if the partie forsaken cannot certainly
determine, that the absence was made
vpon an euill mind; some haue thought
that it behoueth her to expect his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
again for the space of foure years;
others of fiue; some of seuen, some of


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2719:72"/>
ten yeares; after which time, she is free,
and may marrie another man. And if
the partie do haplie returne againe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some long space of time, who was
probablie thought to haue been dead,
the latter ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iage vndertaken vpon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
ignorance of such an euent, may
be dissolued; and it shall not be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to either partie, considering it fell
out not by their fault, but only by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>Now if the question bee of wilfull
and affected absence, the same is to be
determined concerning that, which
hath bin said before touching the point
of Desertion.</p>

               <p>First, by the right and lawfull vse of

action of it, to be of the owne nature
good. Secondly, in that they prohibite
mariage of certaine parties, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

this; that they thinke this secret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
together of man and wife to be

abused the words of the Apostle,
Rom. 8. 8. affirming, that they which
are in the flesh, that is, in the estate of
Matrimonie, <hi>cannot please God.</hi> Yea and
after that mariage was condemned by
them, some began to detest and hate
women,<note place="margin">Sozomen. lib. 3. cap. 16.</note> as <hi>Ephraim</hi> the Syrian,<note place="margin">Sess. 8. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. 9. 10.</note> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

that in mariage there is no

               <p>This comming together of man and
wife, although it be indifferent, yet by


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2719:73"/>
the holy vsage thereof, it is made a holy
and vndefiled action, Hebr. 13. 4. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is honorable among all, and the bedde
vndefiled.</hi> And it is (as all other creatures
and ordinances of God are) sanctified
by the word &amp; praier, 1. Tim. 4. 3.—<hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding

the word of God, &amp; praier.</hi> In which place
it is to be obserued, how the Apostle
applieth the point of sanctification di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to mariage.</p>
               <p>The word of God giueth direction
to married folkes two wayes. First, by
giuing them warrant, that they may
lawfully do this action; because what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
is not done of faith (which faith
must be grounded on Gods word) is a
sin. Secondly, by prescribing the right
and holy manner of doing the same.</p>
               <p>The holy maner stands in these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>First, that it be done in moderation.
For euen in wedlocke excesse in lusts is
no better then plaine adulterie before
God.<note place="margin">Ambros. lib. de Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losoph. ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. ab Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. contr. Iulianum. lib. 2.</note> This is the iudgement of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Church, that Intemperance, that


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2719:74"/>
is, immoderate desire euen betweene
man and wife, is fornication.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that it be vsed in an holy
abstinence.</p>
               <p>Abstinence from this secret societie,
must be vsed in two cases.</p>
               <p>First, while the woman is in her
flowers, Leuit. 18. 19. <hi>Thou shalt not go
to a woman to vncouer her shame, as long as
shee is put apart for her disease.</hi> And it is
made one of the properties of a good
man, not to lie with a menstruous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Ezek. 18. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, in the time of a solemne
fast, when some grieuous calamitie is
imminent. Then they are to giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
(by mutuall consent) to fasting
and prayer, 1. Cor.</hi> 7. 5. Defraud not one
another, except it be with consent for a time,
that you may giue your selues to fasting and
prayer: and againe come together, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
tempt you not for your incontinencie.
2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 11. Then <hi>Vriah</hi> answered <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
The Arke, and Israel, and Iudah dwell
intents: and my Lord <hi>Ioab,</hi> and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of my Lord abide in the open fields:
shall I then go into mine house to eate and


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2719:74"/>
drinke, and lie with my wife? By thy life,
and by the life of thy soule, I will not do this
thing. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 12. The familie of the house
of <hi>Dauid</hi> shall mourne apart, and their
wiues apart; the familie of the house of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
apart, and their wiues apart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next vnto the word, this action may
be sanctified by prayer, for a blessing
vpon it. Children are the gift of God,
and therfore married folkes are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to vse the meanes, but also to pray
for the obtaining of them, Psal.</hi> 113. 9.
He maketh the barren woman to dwell with
a familie, and to be a ioyfull mother of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 127. 3. Behold children are the
inheritance of the Lord, and the fruit of the
wombe his reward. <hi>Examples for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
are these, Gen. 25. 21. Isaac</hi> prayed
vnto the Lord for his wife, because shee was
barren, and the Lord was intreated of him;
and <hi>Rebekah</hi> his wife conceiued. 1. <hi>Sam. 1.
26.</hi> 27. And she said, Oh my Lord, as thy
soule liueth, my Lord, I am the woman that
stood with thee here, praying vnto the Lord.
<hi>vers.</hi> 27. I prayed for this child, and the
Lord hath giuen me my desire, which I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:2719:75"/>
                  <hi>Now the fruits, which are reaped
and inioyed by this holy vsage of the
mariage bed, are three. I. The hauing of
a blessed seed. Deut. 28. 1. If thou shalt
obey diligently the</hi> voice of the Lord thy
God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Blessed shall be the fruit of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and the fruit of thy ground. <hi>Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
is called</hi> the seed of God, <hi>being begot
in an holy maner, Mal.</hi> 2. 15. And did not
he make one? yet had he abundance of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
And wherefore one? because he sought
a seed of God: therefore keepe your selues in
your spirit, and let none trespasse against the
wife of his youth. <hi>II. The preseruation
of the bodie in cleannesse, that it may
be a fit Temple for the holy Ghost to
dwell in, 1. Thess.</hi> 4. 3. 4. This is the will of
God, euen your sanctification, that euery
one of you should know how to possesse his
vessell in holines and honor, and not in the
lust of concupiscence, euen as the Gentiles
that know not God. <hi>III. The holy estate
of marriage is a liuely type of Christ
and his Church, and this communion
of married persons, is also a figure of
the coniunction that is betweene him,
and the faithfull, Hos.</hi> 2. 19. I will marrie


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2719:75"/>
thee vnto me, for euer; yea I will marrie
the vnto me in righteousnes, in iudgement,
in mercie and in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passion: I will euen mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
thee vnto me in faithfulnes, and thou
shalt know the Lord. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 23. For the
husband is the wiues head, euen as Christ is
the head of the Church, and the same is the

               <p>
                  <hi>Case.</hi> I. Whether may mariage be
dissolued in the case of barrennesse?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No. For barrennesse is an
hidden infirmitie for the most part, and
which God hath many times cured, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
when it seemed to be desperate, as
in <hi>Sarah.</hi> Again, the fruit of the wombe
is Gods blessing; and wholly depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vpon him. Hee therefore that in
want of children, reiecteth his wife,
whom he hath receiued at the hands of
God, offereth wrong euen to God
himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Case</hi> II. What if either of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
folkes commit fornication, or any
sinne of the same kind greater then
fornication, as Incest, Sodomie, lying


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2719:76"/>
with beasts, or such like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Adulterie and fornication
are most grieuous and open crimes,
which do breake the very bond and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
of mariage, Prou. 2. 17. and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when they are certainly knowne
by such persons, they are at no hand to
be winked at, but the Magistrate is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to be informed of them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
if the innocent partie be willing
to receiue the adulterer againe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his repentance; lest hee should
seeme to fauour and maintaine sin, and
to bee himselfe a practiser of vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
he is to repaire to the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and declare the whole matter to
the Minister, that he may vnderstand
the parties repentance, and desire of
forgiuenesse.</p>
               <p>And if the adulteresse hath concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and is in trauell, the husband to
auoid the imputation of hauing an
heire in bastardie, is to make relation to
the Church of the repentance of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteresse;
or to acquaint some certaine
persons therewith, not to the end that
she should be punished for the fact, but


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2719:76"/>
that they may take notice of a child
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued in adultery, whom afterward
he may lawfully put off, as none of his.</p>
               <p>The matter being knowne, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
partie may require a diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For adulterie is such a sin, as doth
quite break off not only the vse, but the
bond and couenant of mariage, Matth.
19. 9. <hi>I say therefore vnto you, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
shall put away his wife, except it be for
whoredome, and marrie another, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
adulterie,</hi> &amp;c. And yet the same
bond may be continued, and grow vp
againe by the good will and consent of
the partie innocent, and consequently
they may be reconciled, and dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
still. 1. Sam. 25. 44. <hi>Now</hi> Saul <hi>had
giuen</hi> Michal <hi>his daughter</hi> Dauids <hi>wife,
to</hi> Phalti <hi>the sonne of</hi> Laish, <hi>which was of
Gallim.</hi> 2. Sam. 3. 14. <hi>Then</hi> Dauid <hi>sent
messengers to</hi> Ishbosheth Sauls <hi>sonne, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Deliuer me my wife</hi> Michal, <hi>which I
married for an hundred foreskins of the
Philistims.</hi> The same course may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in like cases by the innocent, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
vpon the repentance of the guiltie
person. But yet euery man must be left


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2719:77"/>
to his owne conscience, and none is to
bee compelled to take another, from
whom hee may iustly bee separated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his will.</p>
               <p>Now in requiring of a diuorce, there
is an equall right and power in both
parties, so as the woman may require it
as well as the man; and he as wel as she.
The reason is, because they are equally
bound each to other, and haue also the
same interest in one anothers bodie;
prouided alwaies, that the man is to
maintaine his superioritie, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to obserue that modestie which
beseemeth her towards the man.</p>
               <p>After the diuorcement made, it shal
be lawful for the harmelesse partie, not
hauing the gift of continencie, vpon
leaue obtained of the Church, and the
Christian Magistrate, to marrie againe.</p>
               <p>But what then shall become of the
partie offending?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If vpon the hazard of his
Conscience in want of the remedie,
any libertie of second mariage, bee to
bee granted vnto him by the Church
or Ciuill Magistrate; (as indeed here in


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2719:77"/>
England there is not;) diuers restraints,
in this Case, must be obserued.</p>
               <p>First, no such libertie is to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
so long as the matter remaines vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine,
whether they may be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,
specially while the partie inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
liueth in single life. Secondly, it
must euidently appeare, that the said
offending partie hath earnestly rpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him of his sin, before he can either
be receiued into the Church, or admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a second mariage. Thirdly, this
liberty is not to be granted him either
presently, or vnaduisedly; but vpon fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and serious admonition, rather
to giue himselfe to mourning and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
and still to remaine alone,
then to desire againe to enioy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of that state, which he hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
so shamefully abused.</p>
               <p>So much of the first way of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of due beneuolence.</p>
               <p>The second way is, by cherishing one
another: Ephes. 5. 29. <hi>No man euer hated
his owne flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth
it, as Christ also doth the Church.</hi> This
cherishing is the performing of any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2719:78"/>
that tend to the preseruing of the
liues one of another. Wherefore they
are freely to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate their goods,
their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel, their labors each to other;
for the good of themselues and theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third way is, by an holy kind of
reioicing and solacing themselues each
with other, in a mutuall declaration of
the signes and tokens of loue and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Prou.</hi> 5. 18. Reioyce with the wife of

the wife, are these:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I. To loue her as himselfe: Eph.</hi> 5. 33.

                  <hi>He is to shew this loue in two things:
First in protecting her from danger,
Gen.</hi> 20. 16. And vnto <hi>Sarah</hi> he said, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I haue giuen 1000. shekels of siluer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy brother: behold he is the couering of
thine eies amongst all that are with thee. Let
it be knowne amongst all, &amp; be thou instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.

as he may, for time to come after his

art thou? which said; I am <hi>Ruth</hi> thine
handmaid, spread therefore the wing of thy
garment ouer thine handmaid; for thou art
the kinsman.</p>
               <p>II. To honor his wife: 1. Pet. 3. 7.
<hi>Giuing honor to the woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This honor stands in three things:
First, in making account of her, as his
companion, or yoke-fellow. For this
cause, the woman, when she was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
was not take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the mans head,
because she was not made to rule ouer
him; nor out of his feet, because God
did not make her subiect to him as a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant;
but out of his side, to the end that
man should take her as his mate. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly,
in a wise &amp; patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t bearing or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
of her infirmities, as anger, way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes
and such like, in respect of the
weaknes of her sexe, 1. Pet. 3. 7. <hi>Giuing
honor to the woman, as vnto the weaker
vessell, seeing yee are heires together of the
grace of life, that your prayers bee not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</hi>
Thirdly, by suffering himselfe
sometimes to be admonished or adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by her. It was Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning <hi>Sarah</hi> his


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2719:80"/>
wife; <hi>Let it not be grieuous in thy sight for
the child, and for thy bond-woman: in all
that</hi> Sarah <hi>shall say vnto thee, heare her
voice; For in</hi> Isaak <hi>shall thy seed be called,</hi>
Gen. 21. 12. Thus <hi>Elkanah</hi> was willing
to subscribe vnto his wife <hi>Annaes</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
for her tarrying at home till the
child was weaned, 1. Sam. 1. 23. <hi>And</hi> El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kanah
<hi>her husband said vnto her, do what
seemeth thee best: tarrie vntill thou hast
weaned him: only the Lord accomplish his
word.</hi> Hereupon the Heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
said,<note place="margin">Arist. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic. lib. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>That the master of the familie
exerciseth (after a sort) a power Tyrannical
ouer his seruants, a power Regall ouer his
children; because Kings are fathers of their
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weales: but in respect of his wife, he
exerciseth a power Aristocraticall, not after
his owne will, but agreeable to the honor and
dignitie of the married estate;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that he ought not in modestie
to challenge the priuiledge of prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
and aduertising his wife in al mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
domesticall, but in some to leaue
her, to her owne will and iudgement.</p>
               <p>Heere question is moued, whether
the husband may correct the wife?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:2719:80"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though the husband be the
wiues head, yet it seemeth he hath no
power nor libertie granted him in this
regard. For we reade not in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
any precept or example to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
such practise of his authoritie. He
may reproue &amp; admonish her in word
only, if he seeth her in fault. For, thus
we reade, that <hi>Iacob</hi> censured his wife,
being impatient, euen in anger, Gen.
30. 2. <hi>Am I in Gods stead, which hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
from thee, the fruit of the wombe?</hi>
And <hi>Iob</hi> reproued his wife, Iob 2. 10.
<hi>Thou speakest like a foolish woman. What?
Shall we receiue good at the hand of God,
and not receiue euill?</hi> But hee may not
chastise her either with stripes, or stroks.
The reason is plaine; Wiues are their
husbands mates; and they two be one
flesh. And no man will hate, much lesse
beat his owne flesh, but nourisheth and
cherisheth it, Ephes. 5. 29. Againe, it is
the commandement of God, that man
should not <hi>trespasse against the wife of
his youth,</hi> Malac. 2. 15. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith,<note place="margin">In 1. Cor. 11. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 26.</note>
                  <hi>It is the greatest reproch for any man, that
can bee, to beate his wife. Plutarch</hi> in the


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2719:81"/>
life of <hi>Cato</hi> the Censor, affirmeth, that
<hi>he which smiteth his wife,</hi> doth all one, <hi>as
if he should lay violent hands vpon the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
images of the gods,</hi> which was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
an high degree of offence among
the Heathen.</p>
               <p>It is alledged, Husbands are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
so to loue their wiues, as Christ
doth his Church; now Christ chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his Church, with strokes; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
so may the husband his wife.
<hi>Answ.</hi> As Christ doth entirely loue his
Church, so hee may also chastise the
same, because hee is not only the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
but also absolute Lord and King
of his Church: so is not the husband
absolute ouer the wife.</p>
               <p>But his authority ouer the wife, is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a sort ciuill, as is the authoritie of
the Magistrate ouer his people. <hi>Ans.</hi> It
is not so. For the Magistrate hath in his
hand the power of the sword, by which
power he inflicteth punishment in case
of offence. But the husband can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to himselfe no such power:<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> yea it
is flatly forbidden in the Ciuil law, that
he should scourge or strike his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:2719:81"/>
Neuerthelesse, if she grow to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and be desperately peruerse, so as
there be no hope of amendment; then
the Magistrate may be informed, who
to preuent scandals, and to prouide for
publike peace, both ought and may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
vnto her necessary correction, and
punishment according to her desert.
Now the husband that hath a wife so
stubborne and peeuish, must beare it, if
it may be borne, as the portion of his
crosse laid vpon him by God. And in
this case, if he be impatient, he may in
some sort be pardoned and pitied, but
he is not wholly to be excused.</p>

               <p>Now the duties of the wife, are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
two.</p>
               <p>The first is, to submit her selfe to her
husband; and to acknowledge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
him as her head in all things.
Gen. 20. 16. <hi>Likewise</hi> Abimelech <hi>said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
Sarah; <hi>Behold thy brother,</hi> that is, thy


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2719:82"/>
husband, whom thou callest thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>is the vaile of thine eyes to all that are
with thee.</hi> As if he should say, <hi>Thy hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
is thy head, and hath power ouer thee,
and thou oughtest to reuerence him.</hi> For of
ancient times, the wife was couered
with a vaile in the presence of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
in token of subiection to him.
Thus <hi>Rebekah</hi> at the sight of <hi>Isaak</hi> tooke
a vaile, <hi>and couered her head therewith,</hi>
Gen. 24. 65. 1. Cor. 11. 3. <hi>The man is the
womans head.</hi> Ephes. 5. 22. <hi>Wiues submit
your selues vnto your husbands, as vnto the
Lord; for the husband is the wiues head, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as Christ is the head of his Church.</hi> The
reason hereof is good. For the wife en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth
the priuiledges of her husband,
and is graced by his honor and estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amongst men. His Nobilitie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
her noble, though otherwise shee
is base and meane; as contrariwise, his
basenesse and low degree, causeth her,
though shee bee by birth noble and
honorable, to bee by estate base and
meane.</p>
               <p>The second dutie is, to be obedient
vnto her husband in all things; that is,


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2719:83"/>
wholly to depend vpon him, both in
iudgement and will. For looke as the
Church yeelds obedience to Christ her
head, and yeelds her selfe to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
gouerned, and directed by
him, so ought the woman to the man.
So <hi>Sarah</hi> is said <hi>to obey Abraham,</hi> and to
giue him the termes of obedience, <hi>Shee
called him Lord, or Sir,</hi> 1. Pet. 3. 6. Hence
it followeth, that the woman is not to
take libertie of wandring, and straying
abroad from her owne house, without
the mans knowledge &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent. 2. King.

said, Send with me, I pray thee, one of the
yong men, and one of the asses; for I will
haste to the man of God, and come againe.</hi>
Againe, that shee is to follow her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
when hee flitteth or departeth
from place to place, vnlesse hee forsake
either her or Christ. To this purpose
<hi>Paul</hi> saith hee <hi>had power to lead about a
wife, being a sister, as well as the rest of the
Apostles,</hi> 1. Cor. 9. 5. Thus <hi>Sarah</hi> went
with <hi>Abraham</hi> into Egypt, Gen. 12. 11.
and out of Egypt, Gen. 13. 1. and to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rar
to soiourne there,</hi> Gen. 20. 1. 2. 3. Thus


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2719:83"/>
the wiues of <hi>Iacob</hi> departed with him,
from their father <hi>Laban,</hi> Gen. 31. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contrary to these duties, are the sins
of wiues; To be proud, to be vnwilling
to beare the authority of their husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds;
to chide and braule with bitternes; to
forsake their houses, &amp;c. Prou.</hi> 27. 15.
A continuall dropping in the day of raine,

follow the other; and they are of two
sorts; either such as, whereby the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

as are helpes thereunto.</p>
               <p>Those whereby the familie is inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
are also of two sorts; Parents and
Children.</p>
               <p>Parents are they which haue power
and authoritie ouer children.</p>
               <p>The duties of parents are especially
two; One to bring vp their children;
The other to bestow them, when they
haue brought them vp.</p>
               <p>Touching Education or bringing vp
of children, the parents care must bee,
both that they may liue, and also that
they may liue well, Ephes. 6. 4.</p>
               <p>Touching the preseruation of the
life of the child, there are many duties


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2719:84"/>
required of the Parents, specially foure.
First, the mother is her selfe to giue the
infant sucke, and to wrap it vp in swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
clothes. <hi>Paul</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mends it for a note
of a good wife, <hi>to nurse her owne children,</hi>
1. Tim. 5. 10. Thus <hi>Sarah</hi> gaue sucke to
<hi>Isaak,</hi> Gen. 21. 7. <hi>Anna</hi> nursed <hi>Samuel,</hi>
1. Sam. 1. 22. <hi>Dauid</hi> in likelihood was
nursed by his mother, Psal. 22. 9. <hi>Thou
gauest me hope euen at my mothers breasts.</hi>
And our Sauiour Christ was also nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by <hi>Marie</hi> his mother, Luk. 11. 27.
and swadled, Luk. 2. 7. Now the reason
hereof is plaine. God hath giuen milke
to women that beare children, &amp; hath
so appointed, that no meat is more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
to the child, then the mothers
milke. And nature it selfe teacheth this
in the course of other creatures. The
earth nourisheth that which it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth. The fruit which the tree bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
is fed by the sap that comes from
the root therof. Yea amongst the bruit
beasts, euen those that be most sauage,
as the Tigres, do giue sucke vnto the
yong ones which they bring forth.</p>
               <p>Yet in case of want of health, or abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2719:85"/>
or any other iust impediment, the
mother may in equity beforborne, and
the child committed vnto a nurse. And
so we reade that <hi>Rebekah</hi> the daughter
of <hi>Bethuel,</hi> and afterward the wife of
<hi>Isaak</hi> had a nurse, Genes. 24. 59. whose
name was <hi>Deborah,</hi> Gen. 35. 8. And <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>
daughter in a case of necessitie,
committed <hi>Moses</hi> to be nursed of an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
woman, whom she tooke not to
be his mother, but a stranger; and her
fact was allowed by God, Exod. 2. 7. 9.</p>
               <p>The second dutie of the Parent is, to
prouide for his child meate, drinke, and
clothing. Our Sauiour Christ saith, that
Parents euen by the light of nature,
though they be euill, will not denie or
withhold necessarie food from their
children: Mat. 7. 9. 10. <hi>What man is there
among you, that if his son aske him bread,
will giue him a stone, or if he aske a fish, will
giue him a scorpion?</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>If
there be any that prouideth not for his owne,
and namely for them of his houshold, hee
denieth the faith, and is worse then an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell,</hi>
1. Tim. 5. 8.</p>
               <p>The third dutie is, when God giueth


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2719:85"/>
abilitie &amp; meanes, to lay vp some thing
for the future maintenance of the child.
2. Cor. 12. 14.—<hi>for the children ought
not to lay vp for the fathers, but the fathers
for the children.</hi> Prou. 19. 14. <hi>House and
riches are the inheritance of the fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth is, to obserue both the
inclination, and the naturall gifts of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and mind that are in the child, and
accordingly to bestow it in some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
calling &amp; course of life. Prou. 20. 11.
<hi>A child is knowne by his actions, whether
his worke be pure and right.</hi> In the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
historie,<note place="margin">Ruffin. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. hist. lib. 1. c. 14.</note> written by <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> it
is recorded, that <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> saw a far off, in a place neare
to the sea, a companie of children play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, and in their play imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himselfe in sundrie Ministeriall
actions. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had a while view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, he perceiued that they exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
&amp; baptised one another, according
to the solemne order vsed in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:
which thing, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had made
some of his Clergie acquainted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and taken order that the children
should be sent for, and brought before


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2719:86"/>
him, he demanded of them, what sport
they vsed, and in what manner they
played one with another. The children
at first, for feare, denied what they had
done, yet vpon further examination
they confessed, that they had made <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi>
(who afterward became Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of the place) their Bishop, and that
hee instructed and baptised sundrie of
their companie. He further asked both
<hi>Athanasius</hi> himselfe, and those which
were said to haue been baptised, what
questions he asked them, and what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres
they gaue; and perceiuing by
their speeches, that they had framed
themselues, though in sporting maner,
to the Church-proceedings in those
actions; vpon conference had with his
Clergie, hee determined, that those
which had first been asked, and had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
answere fully, according to the
forme vsed in that Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
baptised, should not be rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
And for <hi>Athanasius</hi> and the other
children, which had done the part of
Ministers in their kind, he sent for their
parents, and gaue them great charge


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2719:86"/>
that they should be brought vp in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and religion, that so they might in
time be fit for the publike Ministerie.
The like course we reade to haue been
taken by the Heathen, for iudgement
of the inclination and towardnesse of
their children.<note place="margin">Nazianz. epist. ad Eudoxam.</note> The Athenians made a
law, that before children were bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in any calling, they should bee first
brought into a publike place, where In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
belonging to all sorts of
trades were laid; and look in what kind
of Instrument any of them tooke most
delight, the child was thought to bee
most fit for the trade, whereunto that
Instrument belonged, and afterward
applied to the same with good successe.</p>
               <p>Now the Parents first and principall
care must be for the Church; that those
of their children which haue the most
pregnant wit, and be indued with the
best gifts, be consecrated vnto God, and
brought vp in the studie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to serue afterward in the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the Church. Thus <hi>Anna</hi> dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Samuel</hi> her son vnto God by vow,
1. Sam. 1. 11. <hi>And shee vowed a vow, and


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2719:87"/>
said, O Lord of Hostes, if thou wilt—giue
vnto thine handmaid a man-child, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I wil
giue him vnto the Lord all the daies of his
life.</hi> And she did according to her vow,
and the Lord blessed <hi>Samuel</hi> her sonne,
who in processe of time became a great
Prophet.</p>
               <p>The next point of Education of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
is to prouide that they may liue
well, and lead a godly life. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Parents must do three things.</p>
               <p>First, they are to be carefull, that the
child, so soone as may bee, after it is
borne, bee admitted into the true
Church of God by Baptisme, and haue
a fit name giuen vnto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, they are to endeuour to
sow the seeds of godlinesse and religion
in the heart of the child, so soone as it
comes to the vse of reason and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
and as it growes in yeares, so
care must be had that it grow in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and grace. To this purpose is the
vow and promise made in Baptisme,
which parents are bound to call vpon
the child to remember, when it comes
to yeares. It was the godly care of</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothies


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2719:87"/>
                  <hi>parents, 2. Tim.</hi> 3. 14. But conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
thou in the things which thou hast lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
knowing of whom thou hast learned
them, <hi>vers.</hi> 15. And that thou hast knowne
the holy Scriptures of a child, which are able
to make thee wise vnto saluation, through
the faith which is in Christ Iesus. <hi>This was
the commandement of God to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of his people, Deut.</hi> 6. 7. Thou shalt
rehearse these words which I command thee
continually to thy children, and shalt talke
of them whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou tarriest in the house. <hi>And
vers.</hi> 20. When thy sonne shall aske thee in
time to come, saying; What meane these Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies,
and Ordinances, and Lawes,
which the Lord our God hath commanded
you? Then thou shalt say vnto thy sonne; We
were Pharaohs bondmen in Egypt, <hi>&amp;c.
This was obserued by the Israelites in
the ages <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cceeding: Psal.</hi> 44. 1. We haue
heard with our eares, O God: our fathers
haue told vs the workes that thou hast done
in their daies in old time.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the first instruction of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in learning &amp; religion, must be so
ordered, that they may take it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
For which purpose, they may be


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2719:88"/>
sometimes allowed in moderate maner
to play, and solace themselues in recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
fitting for their yeares. And if they
do amisse in either, they are to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
by the bridle of discipline. First
by reproofe in word, and when that wil
not helpe, by the rodde of correction.
Zach. 8. 5. <hi>The streets of the citie shall bee
full of boyes and girles, playing in the streets
thereof.</hi> Prou. 29. 15. <hi>The rod and correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

makes his mother ashamed.</hi> vers. 17. <hi>Correct
thy son, and he will giue thee rest, and giue
pleasures to thy soule.</hi> Hebr. 12. 9. <hi>We haue
had the fathers of our bodies which correct
vs, and we gaue them reuerence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet in this point, two extreames are
carefully to be auoided; That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
be not either too seuere, or too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
to the child. For seue<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itie <hi>Paul</hi>
giues his rule, Ephes. 6. 3. <hi>Parents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
not your children to anger,</hi> that is, by
too much austeritie in gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For
lenitie, we haue old <hi>Eli</hi> his example,
1. Sam. 2. 23. <hi>And he said vnto them, Why
do yee such things? for of all this people, I
heare euill reports of you. Doe no more my


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2719:88"/>
sonnes,</hi> &amp;c. So much for Education.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The second general dutie of parents,
is the bestowing of their children; This
bestowing is, when they knowing their
children fit for mariage, not to haue the
gift of continencie, do vse their best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
to prouide matches for them
in time, or at least, do aduise them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by themselues or by their friends:
1. Cor.</hi> 7. 36. If any man thinke it vncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
for his virgin to passe the flower of her
age, and need so require—let them bee
married. <hi>vers.</hi> 38. he that giueth her to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
doth well. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 26. 6. Take yee
wiues—and take wiues for your sonnes,
and giue your daughters to husbands, <hi>&amp;c.
Gen.</hi> 28. 1. Isaak called Iacob and blessed
him, and charged him and said vnto him;
Take not a wife of the daughters of Canaan:
Arise, get thee to Padan Aram—and
thence take thee a wife of the daughters of
Laban thy mothers brother. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 14. 2.
Sampson came and told his father and his
mother, and said, I haue seene a woman in
Timnah of the daughters of the Philistims;
now therefore giue me her to wife.</p>
               <p>This dutie is now adaies carelessely


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2719:89"/>
neglected of Parents; and the fruit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is dangerous. For hence it comes to
passe, that their children oftentimes do
either commit whoredome, or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
wicked and vngodly mariages.</p>
               <p>In the choice of a husband or wife,
the Parents ought to haue a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
vnto pietie and wisedome, then
vnto beautie and riches, or any other
outward blessings. Yet where they all
concurre, the partie so qualified is the
more thankfully to be entertained. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these grounds the Priest of Prince
of Midian, gaue his daughter <hi>Zipporah</hi>
to <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> agreed to take her,
Exod. 2. 19. <hi>A man of Egypt deliuered vs
from the Philistims, and also drew vs wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enough, &amp; watered the sheepe—And
Moses agreed to dwell with the man, who
gaue vnto Moses Zipporah his daughter.</hi>
Iosu. 15. 16. <hi>Then Caleb said, He that smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, euen to
him will I giue Achsah my daughter to wife.</hi>
Yea it is a sinne to marrie only for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
without consideration of the better
things. Thus the old world sinned, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <hi>the sonnes of God saw the daughters of men


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2719:89"/>
that they were faire, and tooke them wiues of
all that they liked,</hi> Gen. 6. 2. and <hi>Sampson,</hi>
who only vpon the sight of the woman
in Timnah, of the daughters of the
Philistims, without further inquirie,
desired that she might be giuen him for
his wife, Iudg. 14. 2.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is meet that pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts should
deale moderately with their children
in this case, and not vndertake at any
hand to force and compel them to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
this or that partie. This was the iust
commendation of <hi>Rebekahs</hi> parents,
who though they were Idolaters, yet
had that regard of equity, that they first
called her and asked her consent, before
they sent her away with <hi>Abrahams</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
to be maried to <hi>Isaak,</hi> Gen. 24. 58.
Now in case the Parents faile in their
dutie in this regard, the son or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may lawfully declare the matter
first to their kinsfolke, and afterward (if
need be) to the Minister, or Magistrate,
and sue for redresse by their means and
direction.</p>

two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First to yeeld them obedience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be his naturall parents or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
as his step-father &amp; step-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that while he liueth. Eph.</hi> 6. 1.
Children obey your parents in the Lord; for
this is right. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 51. Then hee went
downe with them, and came to Nazareth,
and was subiect to them. <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 19. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<hi>father in law said vnto him,</hi> Heare

that thou biddest me, I wil do. <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 5. And
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the daies of their ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quetting were gone
about, Iob sent and sanctified them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:2719:90"/>
This obedience must shew it selfe in
two things.</p>
               <p>First in the choyce of a lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
wherein the child is to be ordered
and appointed at the discretion of the
parent.</p>
               <p>Secondly in mariage: For in that, the
parent is the principall agent and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser
of the child. Now although his
authoritie be not so great, as that the
child is to be forced and compelled by
him; yet the reuerent and dutifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
which the child ought to beare
towards him, ought to be a strong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement,
not to dissent, or renounce
his aduice, without great and waightie
cause. Yea the child must endeuour by
all manner of dutifull cariage to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
or at least to mitigate his parents
seueritie in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>Now for the daughters: They must
yeeld obedience to their parents in all
Domesticall labours, that they may be
skilfull in houshold affaires. Thus did
the seuen daughters of the Priest of

water, and fill the troughes to <hi>water

               <p>The second dutie of the sonne, is to
recompence his fathers loue, and care
ouer him, by relieuing him in case of
want, if God giue abilitie, with food
and rayment, and other necessaries.
Herein children must deale with their
parents, as the brood of the Storke is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to do with her, by feeding her
when she is old; wherein they doe no
more but what shee before hath done
vnto them. It is <hi>Pauls</hi> counsell, that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
&amp; nephewes should recompence
the kindnes of their kindred in the first
place, 1. Tim. 5. 4. and therefore to their
parents, the head &amp; fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of their
kindred. When <hi>Ioseph</hi> was in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and his father <hi>Iacob</hi> in want, he first
gaue him corne freely; and afterwards
sent for him to Egypt, and there proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for him; in so much as the text saith
of him, that he nourished his father and


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2719:91"/>
his brethren, and all his fathers house-hold
with bread, <hi>Euen as the mother puts
meat into the childs mouth,</hi> Gen. 47. 12.
When <hi>Naomi</hi> the step-mother of <hi>Ruth</hi>
was of great yeares, and her strength
spent, <hi>Ruth</hi> gathered corne in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
for reliefe of them both. Yea when
<hi>Boaz</hi> gaue her to eate and to drinke, she
reserued part of her victuals, &amp; brought
it home with her gleanes to refresh her
mother, Ruth 2. 14. 18.</p>
               <p>The necessitie of the performance of
these duties is so great, that if the sonne
neglecteth them, and doth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
by ill vsage of his parent, either in
word or deed, he is worthie of death,
euen by <hi>Moses</hi> law: Exod. 21. 15. <hi>He that
smiteth his father or his mother, shall die the
death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The law of the first borne of a mans
children, that he should haue a greater
portion of his fathers goods, then any
of the rest of his brethren, is perpetuall,
and admits no exception, but only in
the case of notorious wickednes. Deut.
21. 17. <hi>He shall acknowledge the son of the
hated for the first borne, &amp; giue him a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2719:92"/>
portion of all that he hath, for he is the
first of his strength, and to him belongeth
the right of the first borne.</hi> This was the
law; yet we reade that <hi>Ruben</hi> lost this
prerogatiue, by reason of his incest, and
<hi>Iudah</hi> the fourth sonne of <hi>Iacob</hi> had the
dignitie of the first borne, Gen. 49. 8.
<hi>Thou Iudah, thy brethren shall prayse
thee—thy fathers sonnes shall bow downe
vnto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Church of the old Testament,
the priuiledge of the first borne was
three-fold; the first of gouernment and
royaltie, the second of Priesthood, the
third of the double portion. And it is
probable that this was for the most part
Ceremoniall, and was accomplished
and determined in Christ, who <hi>was the
Image of the inuisible God, &amp; the first borne
of euery creature,</hi> Colos. 1. 15.</p>

               <p>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2719:92"/>

void. For it is a ruled case, that he which
is not his owne man, that is to say, at his
owne libertie, but vnder the power of
another, cannot bind himselfe. Againe,
the authoritie of the parent by the law
of God is great; For it alloweth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>The Master is a member in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie,
which hath power and beareth
rule ouer the seruant. And his dutie
stands principally in three things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:2719:93"/>
First, To make a good choice of his
seruants; which is then done, when he
inquireth first after such as feare God,
and be willing to serue him. <hi>Paul</hi> makes
the seruice and feare of God the maine
ground of true obedience in seruants,
Ephes. 6. 5. 6. 7. Colos. 3. 22. It was the
rule of <hi>Dauids</hi> choice, Psal. 101. 6. <hi>Hee
that walketh in the perfect way, he shall serue
me. Abrahams</hi> chiefe serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his house,
was a man that feared God, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
in that he made conscience of his
oath, Gen. 24. 2. 3. and prayed also for
successe in the busines whereabout he
was sent. Gen. 24. 12. <hi>O Lord God of my
Master Abraham, I beseech thee send mee
good speed this day, and shew mercie to my
Master Abraham. Cornelius</hi> of <hi>Caesarea,</hi>
the Captaine of the Italian band, had a
souldier that daily attended on him,
<hi>who feared God,</hi> and seruants also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
him, to whom hee made knowne
the heauenly vision which hee saw,
Act. 10. 7.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To enioyne them labour,
and not to require more of them, then
their strength will beare. The master is


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:2719:94"/>
to rule ouer the seruant <hi>in iustice.</hi> And
then is his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement vniust, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it
will not sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with the course of nature,
with the abilitie of his seruant, or with
the word of God. Therefore he is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
labour at their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their strength, &amp; yeeld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
intercession &amp; rest. Leuit. 25. 46.
<hi>Ouer your brethen the children of Israel, ye
shall not rule ouer one another with crueltie.</hi>
1. Pet. 3. 8. <hi>Bee pitifull, bee courteous, one
beare with another.</hi> And for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of busines, it is conuenient that
the master be oftentimes present with
the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in their works. Prou. 27. 23.
<hi>Be diligent to know the state of thy flock, and
take heed to thy heards.</hi> The good matron
<hi>ouerseeth the waies of her houshold,</hi> Prou.
31. 27.<note place="margin">Arist. Oeconom. 7.</note> A man of Libya being asked,
what it was that might make a horse
fat; he answered, <hi>The masters eye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, To recompence the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and paines of his seruant, and
that three waies.</p>
               <p>First, by giuing him his due of meat
and drinke for the present. The good
matron <hi>giueth the portion to her houshold,


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2719:94"/>
and the ordinary to her maids,</hi> Prou. 31. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, by paying him his hire in
the end of his seruice:</hi> The labourer is
worthie of his wages. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 7. Well done,
good seruant and faithfull; thou hast been
faithfull in little, I will make thee ruler ouer
much; enter into thy masters ioy. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heere three caueats are to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
I. That the wages be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to the work. II. That it be paid
in due time, without deferring. So the
Master of the vine-yard,</hi> when euen was
come, <hi>called his seruants together, to</hi>
giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hire, <hi>Mat. 20. 8. III. That
the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be not defrauded of any part
of his due. For this is a crying sin; Deut.
24.</hi> 15. Thou shalt giue him his hire for his
day, neither shall the Sunne go downe vpon
it—lest hee crie against thee vnto the
Lord, and it bee sinne vnto thee. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 4.
Behold, the hire of the labourers which haue
reaped your fields, which is kept backe by
fraud, crieth, and the cries of them which
haue reaped, are entred into the eares of the
Lord of hosts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the seruant in time of his
seruice be sicke, the masters care must


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2719:95"/>
be by all means possible to procure his
recouery. Equitie must be the rule in
these cases; and masters are to <hi>do to their
seruants that which is iust and equall.</hi> Col.
4. 1. Now the seruant haplie falles sicke
by and in his seruice, and his health
yeelds not only profit to his master, but
incouragement also to himselfe. The
good Centurion in case of his seruants
sicknesse, tooke the best course to haue
him restored, Matth. 8. 6.</p>

vnto his master.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The dutie of a serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
is, faithfully and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
to demeane him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in the affaires of his master, and to
doe seruice vnto him as vnto Christ,
though he be froward and hard-harted.
Titus</hi> 2. 9. Let seruants be subiect to their
masters, and please them in all things, not
answering againe. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 5. Seruants, be


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2719:95"/>
obedient to them that are your masters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the flesh, with feare &amp; trembling,
in singlenes of your hearts, as vnto Christ.
<hi>Col. 3. 22. Thus</hi> Iacob <hi>serued</hi> Laban,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 38. This twentie yeares haue I bin
with thee; thine ewes and thy goates haue
not cast their yong, and the rammes of the
flocke haue I not eaten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contrariwise, the seruant must take
heed that he doe not his masters busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
negligently, or for fashion sake, or
with eye-seruice as a man-pleaser; that
in case of rebuke or controlement, he
answere not againe; lastly, that hee be
trustie &amp; withhold his hands from pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and his heart from deceiuing his
master.</p>
               <p>Seruants are of two sorts; either free,
or bond-seruants.</p>
               <p>A free-seruant is he, whom his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
hireth for wages to do him seruice.
To him belongs the iust paiment of his
hire, and in case of offence, them master
hath authoritie to censure and correct
him, prouided that in the execution
thereof, respect bee had vnto his age,
and the correction be vsed with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2719:96"/>
as if hee were his sonne.</p>
               <p>A bond-seruant, is a seruant bought
for money, and is commonly called a
slaue. Touching this sort, a question is
moued, whether a Christian may with
safe conscience, haue and vse a man as
his slaue?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The power &amp; right of hauing
bond-men, in those countries where it
is established by positiue lawes, may
stand with good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, if it be vsed
with moderation. That authoritie in
this behalfe is moderate, wherein these
seuen caueats be obserued.</p>
               <p>I. That the master haue not ouer his
seruant the power of life and death; for
this takes away the lawful power of the
Magistrate, to whom only the Lord
hath committed the sword of iustice.</p>
               <p>II. That there be not libertie gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, to vse his seruant at his owne
will and pleasure in all things; for this
was not granted by the law of God to
his owne people: Exod. 21. 26. <hi>If a man
smite his seruant or his maid in the eye, and
hath perished it, he shall let him go free for
his eye: Also if he smite out his seruants or


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2719:96"/>
his maids tooth, he shall let him go out free
for his tooth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. That the power be not enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to the commanding of things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
piety or iustice; for in these cases
a man must rather obey God then
man, Act. 4. 19.</p>
               <p>IV. That masters do not take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to make separation of those their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
that be married, the one from the
other, or of those that be parents from
their children; considering that God
himselfe hath made these societies, and
ioyned such persons together, and
therefore man may not separate them.</p>
               <p>V. That the masters do not take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
to put ouer their seruants to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
and vnbelieuing masters, for that
is an vnkind and cruell libertie, &amp; may
be an appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t occasion to make the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
fall away from religion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the true God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VI. That they do not bind them to
perpetuall slauery, &amp; neuer make them
free. Exo.</hi> 21. 5. But if the seruant say thus,
I loue my master, my wife and my children,
I will not go out free.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:2719:97"/>
VII. That the seruitude be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
and retained by force; for it is a
more grieuous crime to spoile a man of
his libertie, then of his riches.</p>
               <p>Now y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the same power limited with
these cautions, is lawfull &amp; warrantable
in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, it appears by these reasons.</p>
               <p>I. God hath ordained &amp; allowed it,
euen by warrant of his owne law: The
posteritie of <hi>Cham</hi> was cursed by <hi>Noah,</hi>
and condemned to slauerie, Gen. 9. 25.
<hi>And he said, Cursed be Cham, a seruant of
seruants shal he be to his brethren.</hi> So were
the Gibeonites by <hi>Ioshua,</hi> Ios. 9. 23. <hi>Now
therefore yee are cursed, and there shall none
of you be freed from being bond-men, and
hewers of wood, &amp; drawers of water, for the
house of my God.</hi> So was the theefe, Exo.
22. 3. <hi>If he had not wherewith to make resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
then hee should bee sold for his theft.</hi>
Again, those that are ouercome in war
may be held captiue, and it is lawful for
the conquerer to kill them, &amp; therefore
to make them slaues: and if being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
they be saued from death, they owe all
that they haue to them by whom they
are saued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:2719:97"/>
                  <hi>II. The law of God gaue libertie to
any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that would, to make sale of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to another. Leuit.</hi> 25. 45. Of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the strangers that are soiourners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, of them shal ye buy, &amp; of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
that are with you, which they begat in
your land, these shall be your possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Deut.
15.</hi> 12. If thy brother an Hebrew sell himself
to thee, or an Hebrewesse, and serue thee six
yeares, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the seuenth yeare thou shalt let
him go free from thee: <hi>and vers.</hi> 17. Thou
shalt take an aule, &amp; pierce his eare through
against the doore, and he shall be thy seruant
for euer.</p>
               <p>III. The ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is ransommed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his enemie, is bound to serue as a slaue
in liew of thankfulnesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV. The examples of the godly in
the Scriptures.</hi> Abraham <hi>had seruants
whom he bought for siluer, Gen.</hi> 17. 12.
Euerie manchild of eight daies old among
you, shal be circumcised in your generations,
as well he that is borne in thine house, as he
that is bough with money of any stranger,
which is not of thy seed. <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 35. The
Lord hath blessed my master Abraham wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully—
for he hath giuen him sheep and


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2719:98"/>
beeues, and siluer and gold, &amp; men-seruants
and maid-seruants, and camels and asses.</p>
               <p>V. The Apostles do not disallow of
such serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
&amp; called to the professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie
in that state, not to change, but
to abide in their calling. 1. Cor. 7. 21. <hi>Art
thou called being a seruant? care not for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is alledged that such seruitude is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the law of nature. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is indeed
against the law of intire nature, as it was
before the fall, but against the law of
corrupted nature since the fall, it is not.</p>
               <p>But Christ hath purchased liberty to
belieuers, Coloss. 5. 11. <hi>Ans.</hi> Only a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
libertie in this life; &amp; a corporal on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the life to come. For though y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
in regard of faith &amp; the inner man
be equal to his master, because in Christ

Thus God commanded the men
of Israel to walke in their families. Deut.

God gaue of <hi>Abraham</hi> before the law

to looke that they do religiously there
behaue themselues, &amp; after the publike
exercises ended, &amp; the Congregation is

they haue heard, that they may profit in
knowledge and obedience. Act.</hi> 10. 24.

<hi>For this very cause the fourth Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
is giuen first of all &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
to the master of the familie, that
he might see the Sabbath kept, and be a
principal doer in all parts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
therein. Exod.</hi> 20. 10. In it thou shalt
not do any worke, thou nor thy son, nor thy
daughter, thy man-seruant, nor thy maid,

               <p>Neither is this his care tied only to
the Sabbath, but vpon other daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
it, he ought to cause them of his
houshold, as much as in him lieth, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
to places, where the word of God
is preached. Commendable was the
practise of <hi>Marie</hi> the sister of <hi>Martha,</hi> in
this case, who when Christ came to her
house is said, <hi>to sit at his feete and attend
vnto his preaching,</hi> Luk 10. 39.</p>
               <p>III. To prouide for his family meat,
drinke and clothing, and that they may

liue a quiet &amp; peaceable life, 1. <hi>Tim. 5. 8.

scribe which is taught vnto the kingdome
of heauen is like vnto an housholder, that

               <p>IV. To keepe order, and to exercise
discipline in his house, and that in this
manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In case of offence, when a capitall
crime is committed, which incurreth
publike censure; he is not to punish it
himselfe, but to bring the offender to
the ciuill Magistrate, to informe of his
fault, that he may haue his desert: It was
a course established by the Iudicial law,
which God gaue vnto</hi> Moses <hi>for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in causes criminall among the
Israelites: Deut.</hi> 21. 18. 19. 20. If any man


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2719:101"/>
hath a son that is stubborne, &amp; disobedient,
which wil not hearken vnto the voice of his
father, nor the voice of his mother, and they
haue chastened him; then shal his father and
his mother take him, and bring him out, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Elders of his citie, and vnto the gate
of the place where he dwelleth, and shall say
vnto the Elders of his citie; This our son is
stubborne, and disobedient, and he will not
obey our admonition: hee is a rioter, and a
drunkard. <hi>Againe, Deut.</hi> 13. 6. If thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the son of thy mother, or thine own son,
or thy daughter, or the wife that lieth in thy
bosome, or thy friend which is as thine owne
soul, entise thee secretly saying, Let vs go and
serue other gods (which thou hast not
known, thou, I say, nor thy fathers) thou shalt
not consent vnto him, nor heare, neither shal
thine eye pitie, nor shew mercie, nor keepe
him secret. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 3. And when any shall
yet prophesie, his father and his mother that
begate him shall say vnto him, Thou shalt
not liue: for thou speakest lies in the name of
the Lord: and his father, and his mother
that begate him, shall thrust him thorough
when he prophesieth.</p>
               <p>If the fault be of an inferiour nature,


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2719:102"/>
and lesser in comparison; the master of
the familie ought to proceed by priuate
censure vpon the delinquent partie,
sometimes by admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, otherwhiles
by correction, and chastisement, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the quality of the offence, &amp; the
condition &amp; state of the person. Leuit.
19. 17. <hi>Thou shalt plainly rebuke thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and not suffer him to sin.</hi> Mat. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<hi>If thy brother sinne against thee, go and tell
him his fault betweene him and thee alone:
If he heare thee not, take yet with thee one or
two.</hi> Prou. 29. 17. <hi>Correct thy sonne, and he
will giue thee rest, and will giue pleasures to
thy soule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When admonitions and corrections
will not preuaile, the partie must bee
brought before the Ministers, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
of the Church, that they may
censure him. Matth. 18. 17. <hi>If he will not
heare them, tell it vnto the Church.</hi> And
the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> giueth order that the
Ministers of the Church should come
to those that are sicke, and pray for
them, Iames 5. 14. which if they doe in
case of infirmitie; then they are also to
be sought vnto, in case of errour and


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2719:102"/>
offence committed, for redresse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But when none of all these meanes
will do good; if the partie be a seruant,
his master may, and ought to remoue
him. Psal.</hi> 101. 7. There shall no deceitfull
person dwell within mine house; he that tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
lies shall not remaine in my sight. <hi>Ioh.

for euer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V. To giue intertainment to those
that are strangers, &amp; not of the familie,
if they be Christians, and Belieuers; but
specially to the Ministers of the Word.

<hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 2. Be not forgetfull to lodge

the woman of Shunem &amp; her husband
performed vnto the Prophet</hi> Elisha,
2. <hi>King.</hi> 4. 10. Let vs make him a little cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
I pray thee, with walles, and let vs set
him a bed there, and a table, and a stoole,
and a candlesticke, that he may turne in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when he commeth to vs. <hi>These are
the duties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heere if it be demanded, whether the
master of a familie is alway, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2719:103"/>
bound in his owne person to doe
all these things?</p>
               <p>I answere, that if there be iust and
necessarie cause, either in respect of his
owne inabilitie, or in regard of publike
imployment, vpon a lawfull calling,
whereby he is hindred, so as he cannot
do any of them himselfe, at some times;
it is lawfull for him to haue, and vse a
deputie. This our Sauiour Christ tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
in effect, when he saith, <hi>Who then
is a faithfull seruant, and wise, whom his
master hath made ruler ouer his houshold,
to giue them meate in season?</hi> Mat. 24. 25.
Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> had a steward of his
house, <hi>Eliezer</hi> of Damascus, Gen. 15. 2.
and he performed the waightiest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that concerned the establishment,
and continuance of Familie, not by
himselfe, but by his Steward, as namely
the choice of a wife for his sonne <hi>Isaak,</hi>
Gen. 24. 2. <hi>Therefore Abraham said vnto
his eldest seruant of his house, which had the
rule ouer all that hee had; Put now thine

King of Egypt had <hi>Ioseph,</hi> Gen. 39. 4. <hi>So
Ioseph found fauour in his sight, and serued

for the good of her charge, Prou.
31. 13. <hi>She seeketh wooll, and flax, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth

there is need. Vers. 26. <hi>Shee openeth her

are proper to her selfe, and not part of
her dowry which she brought vnto her
