            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas I Robert Sharpe, haue hertofore vnaduisedly, conceyued good opinion of certayne bookes of an aucthour, otherwyse vnknowne, saue onely, that hee noteth hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by the Letters <hi>H. N.</hi> And was induced therevnto, partly by the straunge tytles that he gyueth to him selfe, terming hymselfe, amongest other names, <hi>A Prophet raysed vp from the dead: Specially by God appointed, and stirred vppe, according to the promises for this tyme</hi> which he calleth <hi>the last day of grace.</hi> Affirming <hi>that he hath receyued his message from the mouth of God himselfe.</hi> And partly being also mooued by the noueltie of the Doctrine, and great promises made, as though men might therby attayne to bée <hi>Deified,</hi> or made as God: Now vppon conference wyth the Godly learned, (whereof some are in auctoritie) being admonished of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie of the sayde aucthour, in vsurping the sayde tyttles, and of hys blasphemous sacriledge, in taking vnto hym other greater tytles, as, <hi>That he is the illuminate with the true light of the perfect being: Annointed with goddes diuine being: One whome God hath hominified him self withall, and who is codeified with God him selfe:</hi> (For with such monstruous and vnused termes, he cloketh his blasphemies, as though he were made one with God, and God one with him) Segregating vnto him selfe a priuate Conuenticle of simple deceaued men, (whom he nameth the <hi>Familie</hi> or <hi>Comunaltie of Loue</hi>) and detesting all wyse and learned men, whom he tearmeth <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture learned.</hi> And also I being aduertised by the sayde Godly learned, of a great number of detestable Errors contayned in the bookes of the sayde <hi>H. N.</hi> And specially in those twoo wicked Bookes. Whereof the one hée nameth <hi>The Euangely or Gospell of the Kingdome:</hi> As though hée had brought a newe Gospell into the world,) which Sainct Pawle forbiddeth, and holdeth acursed, though it were brought by an Angell from heauen) And the other Booke hée calleth, <hi>The Declaration of the Masse.</hi> In the which twoo Bookes, and other lyke wicked Bookes, of the sayde aucthour, not onelye the vsurped auctoritie of the Bushop of Rome, and his Cardinalles, and the Sacrifice of the Masse, wyth manye other lyke wicked errours, but also <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore vnderstanding nowe my grosse errours, I doe here before God and you vtterly detest, and from my heart abhorre, as well the sayde Aucthour, wyth all hys arregant, and blasphemous titles, as the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sathan, by hym stirred vp, to seduce and beguyle the simple people: As also all his Damnable errours and Heresies whatsoeuer. And doe confesse here before God and you, that I am hartily sorye that euer I dealt wyth any such Books, or resorted to any secréet Conferences, assemblies, or Conuenticles, wyth those that are named <hi>The Familie or Comunaltie of Loue:</hi> And that thereby I haue gyuen so great offence vnto the Churche of God: for the which I most humbly and hartily aske forgiuenesse both of God and you. And doe promise fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neuer to meddle, with these, or any other such Bookes, or with that secte hereafter: But vtterlye doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and forsake the same, and all other Errours and Heresies whatsoeuer contrarie to the Common, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene, and Athanasius Créedes, or to the holye Scriptures conteyned in the Bookes of the olde and newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And doe also forsake whatsoeuer is repugnaunt to the Doctrine nowe taught and pupliquely set foorth in the Church of England, which Doctrine I acknowledge and confesse, to be the true and Catholicke Doctrine, agréeable to the Canonicall Scriptures, and that the same of all Christians, ought to be professed, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of any daunger to the body, whether it be by death or otherwayes. In whiche profession, that I maye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly remayne to my lyues ende, I doe most hartily beséeche you, to commende me in your prayers, to the great goodnesse and mercye of Almightye God.</p>
