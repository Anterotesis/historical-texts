            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I was when I first came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Idumaea;</hi> as my tender age
required a <hi>Guardian</hi> to manage

were, whom at the first I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into my acquaintance:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47894:15"/>
And with these I lived for a
little time familiarly: and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
my selfe much by their
company: But alas for griefe,
I continued not long with
them; Other <hi>Companions</hi> drew
me from them. Those good
and vertuous ones betooke
themselves, as I thought, to a
course of life too strict for my
loose affection to follow. I felt
the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>youth</hi> ryoting
within mee. Those devout
tasks, which before I observed;
begun now to bee intermitted.
I held a sober regular life too
eremiticall: private retired
walkes too stoicall. I thought
with my selfe, how I had staied
too long in the <hi>Tyring-house,</hi> I
must now shew my selfe upon
the <hi>Stage;</hi> where I played the

my whole <hi>life</hi> upon the

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47894:16"/>
saw a Thiefe, I followed him:
and with the Adulterer I divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
my portion. I bestowed
the <hi>day</hi> in variety of follies:
and a great part of the <hi>Night</hi> in
a delightfull remembrance of
those follies. Let us prepare
our selves (said one) for the
spoile: and I had an hand as
ready to further it, as hee to
demand it. Let us drinke wine
in bowles, and carouse till our
eyes be red; let the day care
for it selfe, while the day of our
life admits no care. Let us
take our full of pleasure, (said
the wanton) let our delight be
in dalliance: and I followed the

though her wayes led to death.
And I delighted my selfe in

raged, nay raigned in me?
what divided thoughts of <hi>hope</hi>
and <hi>feare</hi> were ever encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
me? In my prosperity,
feare of adversity wrought
upon me: in my adversity, hope
of prosperity seazed on mee.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47894:17"/>
Neither did either of these <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi>
well content me: for, as
thoughts of the one made mee
proud; so a conceit of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
made me impatient. Now,
what hourely affronts did I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
by my owne, while I stood
thus pursued by them? I found
nothing on earth worthy my
desire: yet were my crawling
desires so fast glued to earth, as
if they had no other Heaven to
aspire to. Naturall Philosophy
had sufficiently taught mee in
my minority, that betwixt <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi>
and <hi>infinite</hi> there was no

of too large a circumference,

tri-angular heart, resembling
the Image of the blessed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
could no more by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
of the world bee
confined, then a tri-angle by a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47894:18"/>
Circle was to be filled. In this,
my <hi>Speculation</hi> had inform'd
me, but the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>application</hi>
of it was farre from me. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it possible, that a
Sconse should be secur'd from
foes without, that harbour'd
so many dangerous Traytors
within. For my mis-guided
affections (like scattred troops

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alne off from their Captaine)
committed all insolencies. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
found they in me, which
was not exposed to their fury.
Thus did my <hi>Familiars,</hi> and
knowne Acquaintance worke
upon my weaknesse; take mee
with their subtilties; and lead
me captive to all miseries. Yet
for all this was I silent, pleasing
my selfe with the impunity of
a delinquent. So I might sinne
safely, and flatter my selfe with
a seeming security: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to my selfe a long life foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly,

because in it the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty;
I could hugge my
betrayer: And herein so farre
was I from vindicating my
wrong; as I accounted him
my best friend, who had shewn
himselfe privately my malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou'st
Foe. So farre was I (I
say) from revenging my selfe
of him, as I sought to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
my selfe with him. For
the injuries I suffer'd, I was
either insensible of them, or I
dissembled them. I neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

enter'd Lists; and how weak
a Combatant I proved amidst
those encounters wherewith
I grappled. The <hi>Field</hi> where I
pitched was the <hi>World.</hi> A place
full of Snares, and such as sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all Estates. I could not see
that place, wherein I could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
true peace. That which
in reason should have beene my
contempt, became my content.
Those <hi>May-buds</hi> of prosperity,
honour and humane glory
were scattered here and there
to take mee; and no sooner
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47894:19"/>
were they seene by me, then
they tooke me.</p>
               <p>That retired Cell, wherein I
both enjoyed my selfe, and the
contemplation of Him that
made me, had now for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
beene estranged from mee.
I found such <hi>Objects</hi> in the
<hi>World,</hi> as I condemned my
selfe for staying so long out of
it. If I desired to bee <hi>rich,</hi> I
found meanes how to purchase
my ends: which, were they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so sinister, the custome was
so generall, as it authoriz'd the
errour. Were it <hi>Honour</hi> that I
sought after, I found a way
quickly to enjoy her, though
the purchase made mee an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
gainer. Friends I could
not want, so long as I wanted
no meanes: For meanes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
mee powerfull Friends:
but all these, by an unexpected
overture, clozed with unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47894:20"/>
ends. For all these, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I did not employ them to
that end whereto they were
ordained; but put more trust
in them, then in him from
whom they were derived;
turn'd to my undoing, which
well bestowed, had beene my
raising. No <hi>fight,</hi> no <hi>victory;</hi>
no <hi>Conquest,</hi> no <hi>Crowne.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
in the very first assault,
I remember'd my Creator; and
to promote his honour, I made
a faire shew, as if I would have
entertained the encounter: but
my resolution became weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and discovered my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Eternity, eternity;</hi> how

those noble <hi>Virgins</hi>
endured; how they sleighted
price, prayer and threats: and

those famous <hi>Confessors</hi>
professed the Faith, even in the

her pathes lead unto death.</p>
               <p>And now give mee leave to
talke a little with thee, O my

ever I came into any place,
wherein I could promise to
my selfe peace. In this popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Citie, I cannot take my
walke in any street, wherein I
am not subject to bee taken by
thy deceit. Thou sendest forth
those two <hi>light Spies,</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
and bring in Objects of
lust; by these am I wounded,
by these doe I suffer a continual
<hi>Combat.</hi> Neither are these
wounds cured, now when my
youth has left mee; when
these daily Messengers of death
summon me. For, though I bee
neere my <hi>Grave,</hi> I am nothing
richer in <hi>Grace.</hi> Though those
follies of my youth have now
left me, (and woe is mee that I
did not leave them before they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47894:24"/>
left me) yet other aged mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
grow strong in me; against
which I must prepare my selfe
for the encounter, or I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
for ever. Would you heare
what my distempers are? They
are these: Though few bee my
houres; hoary my haires: yet
am I as numerous in my
worldly cares, as if I were
but even now entring into the
world. I cannot without an
envious eye see my Neighbours
field flourish; others prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
gives me occasion of repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
others adversity grounds
of rejoycing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Honour I would
have, yet can I hardly <hi>support</hi>
my selfe, much lesse that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
which is conferred on me</p>
               <p>Alas, poore mouldred earth!
Now, when I carry about me,
such constant Companions of
my mortality! when Aches,
Cramps, and Coughes are my
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47894:25"/>
ages livery! Now, when <hi>Death</hi>
waits at the Wicket, and bids
me come away, and leave
the world, seeing it is weary of
me: and fit me for my shrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
sheet, being all that is left
me; yet have I a moneths
mind to be greater, or richer, or
more eminent in the eye of the
World, as if I could dispense
with age, or make a truce with
death.</p>
               <p>Thus am I encountred with
new temptations: Night and
day am I beleagred: nor can
I find any rest; so fierce and
furious is this Combatant my
<hi>Flesh.</hi> O how justly then
may I complaine of this my
houshold enemy! And how
may I escape her subtilty! It is
her <hi>Delicacy</hi> that has undone
me: for by <hi>pamphering</hi> her, have
I <hi>famished</hi> my selfe: I tooke pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of her weaknesse, and I che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd

her: and behold now I
am abused by her! Shee has
wounded mee with her eye;
no, with both her eyes has shee
surpriz'd mee. For with her
<hi>right eye</hi> she shew'd me <hi>prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
and by inclining to her,
caused me to commit idolatry.
And with her <hi>left eye</hi> shee
darted <hi>adversity</hi> at mee, and so
made me murmure against him
that made me. O how I feele
my selfe now failing and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to earth; yet how are my
thoughts so glued to earth, as if
they had no other place to
thinke on! O my God from
the depth of thy mercy, looke

thou knowest my necessity, let
me not become a prey to mine
enemy.</p>

Didst thou imitate that

forth the voyee of thy prayer,
that Christian sacrifice of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication?
Didst thou prepare
thy selfe against the assault?
Were't thou carefull of thy

thou <hi>fast</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> that thou

mightst not enter into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Were those <hi>Allyes</hi> thou
hadst within thee, true unto
thee? Did not those on whom
thou relyed, betray thee? yes;
deare Lord, I must confesse it:
I was betrayed by my owne, to
my shame. But alas, had these
stood for me, all this had little
availed me; for I was such an
Enemy to my selfe, as I would
have betrayed my selfe, had I
neither suffered the assaults of
heavy Friends within me, nor
open Foes without me. O how
soundly slept I, while my
ghostly Enemy stood at the
gate ready to enter in upon me?
Watchfull was he in seeking to
surprize me; but carelesse was
I in labouring to prevent his

               <p>POore pride! what hast thou
in thee that may please thee?
what good thing that may
praise thee? Can the <hi>Leopard</hi>
pride himselfe in his spots: or
the <hi>Swan</hi> in her black feet?
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47894:35"/>
What hast thou, which thou hast
not received: and if received,
to whom is the glory to bee
rendred? Thou hast nothing of
thy selfe but sinne, and sinne
begets shame. What shame is
it then to magnifie thy selfe in
sinne? Shall thine <hi>Horse</hi> or
thy <hi>Speare</hi> save thee? or shall
the strength of an Hoast deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thee? Looke upon that
vile <hi>matter,</hi> whereof thou wert
made! Poore dust and ashes
was thy moulding; and to
dust and ashes must be thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning.
Is this cover of flesh,
such a dainty thing to glory in?
Must not the beauty thereof
turne to rottennesse and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:
and the glory thereof
sleepe in the dust? Must not
that faire front be pilled, and
her beauty pillaged? Must not
those sparkling lights, which,
sometimes made others priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47894:36"/>
or which made thy selfe
a prisoner by their wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
become Lodges, forlorne
Lodges for wormes? Must
not that face, now so phantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
in-laid with <hi>Love-spots,</hi>
become an horror to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder?
Must not every part
or parcell of that goodly piece,
that faire building, fall into
ruine, irreparable ruine? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
then, poore <hi>Pilgrim,</hi>
canst thou find without thee,
wherein thou maist justly pride
thee. Looke inward then;
and see if thou canst find any
thing there that may procure
thee favour in the presence of
the Almighty, by approving
thee a sitting Instrument of his
glory. Ah me poore sinfull
wretch! what mountaines
of heavy-pressing sinnes doe I
feele, ever ready to sinke down
this surcharged vessell of my
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47894:36"/>
soule! I begun no sooner to
live, then to love sinne. No
sooner to breath, then breath
forth the infection of sinne.
The world receiv'd me no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
for a dweller, then she ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
me for a sinner. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
indeed, when so much
grace was given mee, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned
with mine own heart:
and begun to examine my selfe
what I had done, <q>what
works of mercy hast thou
performed? what actions of
perfect obedience hast thou
expressed? Bring forth that
poor man, whom for Christs
sake thou hast cloathed. That
hungry-starv'd soule, whom
for his precious sake thou hast
relieved. Were't thou so
poore as thou couldst not doe
it? Hadst thou not so much
as one single <hi>mite,</hi> nor one
<hi>cuppe</hi> of <hi>cold water</hi> to bestow
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47894:37"/>
on Christs members! Blush;
O blush thou wretched Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim!
Thou hadst change
and choice of cloathes, and
these in thy Wardroabe must
lye rotting; or to <hi>Moaths</hi>
become feeding. Thou hadst
oyle and meale in thy Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher;
yea, thy store-houses
surfeted of plenty: and thy
wine-presses groaned in their
fulnesse: yet must the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
soule perish, rather then
be relieved; The thirsty die,
ere h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e bee refreshed; The
naked be utterly starved, ere
hee be cloathed. Look then
and take a full view of thine
<hi>inward man;</hi> and see if there
be any thing in him, that may
justifie thee by him! Sift
and search him; the more
thou shalt discover him: the
more thou shalt be ashamed
of him.</q> Whence then thy
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47894:37"/>
                  <hi>pride?</hi> whence thy <hi>vaine-glory?</hi>
Resolve thy selfe to teares; fall
prostrate before the Throne of
grace. If thou have a desire to
be like thy Saviour; love <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi>
it is the best badge of
Christian honour. In whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
dwelleth the <hi>pride</hi> of
<hi>life;</hi> that soule cannot dwell in
Christs love. These are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
lodgings, and are reserved

               <p>O my Redeemer, give me a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

Many yeares are now
gone and past, since I left my
Fathers house; since I divided
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47894:38"/>
my portion with Harlots; since
I rebelled against my Prince;
that Prince of Princes. Meanes
had hee made; and sundry
Messengers had hee sent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> and there
hee shewed before my face, and
unto my shame: what Iustice
and Temperance, what Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Continence; what
excellent morall vertues ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
even in those who were
Heathens, and knew no God.
These onely pertak't some
weake glimpses of a naturall
light: They knew not what
<hi>Eternity</hi> meant: nor where
that <hi>Heavenly City</hi> was to bee
found: yet hated these to
wrong one another: or to doe
to another what they would
not have done by an other to
themselves. These loved good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
without hope of reward.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47894:39"/>
Their ambition was only to be rte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
after death: or by their

were all their <hi>vertues</hi> but <hi>splendid

whatsoever is not of <hi>faith,</hi> is <hi>sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From these then, taking me by

me what wondrous things
he had done for mee. How,
though I was bound, infinitely
bound unto his Majesty. Even
by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> for my
creation: in distinguishing me
from all others; nay, in setting
me above all others: &amp; in giving
me a command over all others:
yet had it bin nothing to have
created me, had he not likewise
redeemed me: lost I was, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
lost: &amp; he spared not his

had he not likewise sent his

No sense could take delight in

this was the lowest of my

I desired in mine Heart to be
the Master of an estate before

took my portion, and went
away into a farre Countrey.
And there I plaid the riotter,
till I became a miserable Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Then, and never till then
did I consider what I had
done. For by this time had I
forgot my Fathers House: So

long and so sweetly had I been
lulled in the Lappe of Sin. But
having now reap'd the fruites

have a remorse of Conscience:
and to have some small sensible
feeling of repentance. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

miserably poor as if I return'd

I might of necessity perish,
there were no remedy. Nay,
I must to my shame confesse it,
that such was my <hi>disobedience,</hi>
and so crooked my will amidst

this my aversion from evill and

Yea, but dangerous wounds

his sacred Majesty, both in
quantity and quality. I have
not had God before mine eyes:
the pathes of righteousnesse

they were of no inferior nature,

fruit and stolne waters were

got such possession of mee, as
were it in action or discourse,
there was nothing which took
mine eare more, or made the

how that the <hi>Adulterer</hi> and

judge. How, that the <hi>pleasure</hi>
of <hi>fornication</hi> was <hi>short,</hi> but the

was? And the more I begun

but a <hi>torture,</hi> which dams
the soule for ever. I found the
deceitfulnesse of this sinne:
with what resolves I made
hourely, to become a true and
unfeined Penitent, never to
returne to my vomit. I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
how a <hi>continent soule</hi> was
the <hi>precioust treasure;</hi> how
God would not dwell in that
heart that was infected with
this sinne. All this I applyed
to my heart; but alas, how
long did it remaine uncorrupt?
No sooner was there an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of temptation offered, then
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47894:63"/>
my vaine heart quite forgot
what shee had resolved. The
thought of <hi>Eternity</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
choaked with an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
desire of enjoying what
was lighter then vanity. Woe
is me that any <hi>reasonable soule</hi>
should bee so deluded! That
neither the promises of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life, nor the shame of this
present life could decline mee
from working such iniquity!
I found how all bread was
sweet unto the <hi>Adulterer.</hi> How
none was more estranged from
his love, then whom hee was
bound most to love. Thus I
perished with open eyes: for
I knew well how the <hi>Harlot</hi>
would bring a man even to a
<hi>morsell of bread.</hi> How her paths
were full of deceipt; and how
her foot-stepps led unto death.
And I understood how there
was nothing to be compared
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47894:64"/>
to a <hi>vertuous Woman,</hi> and what
felicity I enjoyed in such a
Choice. With what pious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequies

I was deprived of her. Yet,
though ripenesse of yeares had
nipped in mee the blossoms of
of youth: nay, though age had
writ deepe furrows in my
brow, yet found I youth
enough in my doating fancy.
For I am ashamed to thinke
with what an unbeseeming
lightnesse I encountred a
strange face. How soone I
could gather by the wandring
motion of her eye, the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

which did least become me. So
dangerous is the custome of

Pilgrim, wherein hast thou
done this Second <hi>spirituall
worke</hi> of <hi>Meroy,</hi> to <hi>Correct the
delinquent?</hi> Nay, rather hast
thou not cherished him in his
sinnes: and told him they
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47894:79"/>
were none, when as they pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the clouds, and came up
with a strong voyce even into
the presence of God? Hast
thou not <hi>blessed</hi> the <hi>wicked</hi> in his
<hi>evill wayes:</hi> and mov'd him to
make a league with his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions?
Yes, Lord, yes;
yet not unto all, have I done
this. For some there be whom
I have <hi>corrected,</hi> nay <hi>censured</hi>
rather then <hi>corrected.</hi> For my
desire was to have their sinnes
published to their shame; to
have their good names taken
away; to have them houted at
in the street, which tasted more
of <hi>detraction,</hi> then <hi>correction.</hi>
For this I did not with the
<hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>meeknesse,</hi> as I was
commanded: but with the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
of <hi>fury</hi> or <hi>indignation,</hi> which
brought them to bee rather
hardned in sinne then refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
But I must confesse, I
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47894:79"/>
offended farre oftner in the
former then in the latter. I
meane in humoring sinne; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make me more endeared
to them: or else for feare lest
the very like sinnes should bee
found out and reproved in mee
by them. So as my owne guilt
made mee to palliate their sin.</p>
               <p>Deare Lord, I know well I
have often sinned herein: I have
stood in feare to reprove the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
of others, and therefore
became I Author of their death:
because that poyson which by cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against, I might have expelled,
I have not expelled: in humoring
those which I should have corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
Nay, what was more: I
conceived indignation, against all
such as reproved me for my vices:
so as, those have I hated, whom I
ought to have loved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
distasted or displeased me,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47894:80"/>
I desired earnestly that they should
not be. O forgive me these. And
make me henceforth such an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to all vices, as I may <hi>correct</hi>
my selfe with as impartiall
sharpenesse: Others with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of compassion and meekenesse.</p>

I have known such
as were destitute in this kind;
how with teares in their eyes
they importuned my advice:
and I had it in readinesse, but
would not minister it: because
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47894:80"/>
hee was poore and despicable

besought it. And alas, was this
the cause? Hadst thou beene

was poore and succourlesse that
did request it. For consider thy

good and gracious God, should
hee not looke downe upon thee
with the eyes of his mercy, and

might become of thee? Into
what straits has thy soule beene
brought? how dry, &amp; desolate?
how weake and dis-consolate

thou hadst without thee, feares

foundst a faithfull Counsellor
to advise thee; a gracious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
to refresh thee. And yet
thou quite forgotst all this,
when thou sawest thy brother
in necessity. He complained to
thee how hee was wronged,
and it lay in thine hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
it, but thou wouldst not
be seene in it. Thy <hi>Counsell</hi>

               <p>VVHat a dangerous thing
the <hi>Memory</hi> is, when
made a <hi>Reteiner</hi> of injuries!
This caused that noble Heathen
to desire rather how to learne
the art of <hi>forgetfulnesse</hi> then the

remembred more things (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

which hee desired to forget,
then ever hee forgot what hee
desired to remember. This
very case is mine: I have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd,
but not comparably to
what I have made others suffer.
I held the <hi>offences</hi> done me so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable,
as they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the power of flesh and
blood to beare. Reconcil'd I
would not be unto death; for

death I pretended easie to such
an injury. So as, though by
continuance of time, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceed

seeme in some sort to coole; all
that their perswasions could
bring mee to was this: I would
<hi>forgive him,</hi> but never <hi>forget
him.</hi> I would ever have an eye
on him: nay, rather if I at any
time met him, I would ever
have mine eye from him. My
heart was not with him. Neither
could I with patience (such was
my malice) speake unto him.

the hard-heartednesse of <hi>Dives,</hi>

Crums, some poore fragments
from his well-furnish'd Table,
to feed a poore hunger-starv'd
Begger: And upon re-view of
that story, concluded him just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
damned, for suffering his
needy Brother to perish, while
he surfeited: So as his very
dogges might partake, what
poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> could not get.
Nay, this hungry Begger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
more court'sie from his

For they <hi>licked his sores,</hi> wheras

               <p>But now tell me, unhappy

as that Prophet said to <hi>David?
Thou art the man.</hi> Didst thou
never see thy poore necessitous

compassion of his poverty?
Didst thou goe to thy <hi>Cruse</hi> to
refresh him with <hi>oyle:</hi> or to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47894:91"/>
thy <hi>Barrell,</hi> to make him a
Cake, that hee might walke in
the strength thereof, and not
die? Nay rather, hast thou not
suffered him to cry at thy gates,
till his very bowels earned
within him; and thou wouldst
not heare him? Hast thou not
bestow'd more liberally upon
the proud <hi>Actor,</hi> then on thy
poore <hi>Brother?</hi> Nay, hast thou
not sowne so lavishly thine ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bestowed
fortunes upon the
Brothell or Stage, as thou hast
left nothing to give to the poor

some of Christs owne

food? And didst thou not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
how so many as thou

when thou mightst relieve
them, so many hast thou mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,

               <p>Thy desire was to passe time
over with a merry heart: and
to satisfie her in the lusts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And yet thou hadst so much
divinity in thee as sometimes
to consider, how none could
partake in comfort here and
elsewhere. How none could
be there comforted, who was
not here afflicted. How none
could be there solaced, unlesse
hee here sorrowed. How the
Almighty had a Sonne without
sinne, but none without a
scourge. One, who wept of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
but was never seene to
laugh. One who from his
birth to his death made his life
a continued Scene of sorrow.
One, who in the bitternesse of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47894:112"/>
his soule called and cryed to all
such as past by him, to come
unto him, to behold him, and

there were sorrow like unto his

               </p>

O bring mee now to a true
sense of my sinne; to a true sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for my endanger'd soule. Let
my eyes be so well acquainted
with teares; as my affection may
be estranged from all joyes. Let
mee become so happy a Mourner,
as with devout <hi>Magdalen,</hi> I may
become an hearty Convert of an

from sinne, become a welcome

O no; I see you cannot justly
speake one good word to the

hath beene otherwise
amongst you. The spirit of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47894:120"/>
contention and contradiction
raigned in me: and so farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
was I from the bond of

more then nursing enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Injuries I would beare
none: nay, rather then embrace
<hi>peace,</hi> I would make injuries
of none. Neighbourly arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I neither affected nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
it was my counsell
ever that suits should bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced:
Let the Law try it,
though the cause were not
worth a see for which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
Nay, to feed this fire
of debate with new fuell; I
told such who repaired to mee
for advise (damnable advice to
lead a deluded Client into the
height of all vice) that to beare
an injury, were to make every
one their enemy. How hee
who forgives him that
wrongs him, encourageth him
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47894:120"/>
to picke a new quarrell at him:
while the remitting of one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the admitting of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
yea, where a wrong is
threatned and not revenged, it
emboldneth the Actor to see it
executed. Thus lay I a snare
privily to catch the simple and
innocent doer; and by my
mischievous counsell to make
him of a Lover of peace a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Barreter. But evill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
is worst for the Counsellor;
this I find too true to my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort.
For now me thinks
all those differences which I
raised; all those quarrels which
I started; present themselves
before thee, threatning nothing
less then perdition to me: for by
the malicious instigation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
they buzze like Bees about
me, and with strong hand bring
mee forth, before the face of
heaven and earth publikely to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47894:121"/>
accuse me. This is hee, say they,
who would be called the <hi>Child</hi>
of <hi>God;</hi> but how can hee have
any interest in that title; how
dares he presume to derive any
such promise from <hi>God,</hi> who all
his life time has beene a profest
Enemy to the <hi>peace</hi> of God?
Hee has laboured to encourage
Neighbour against Neighbour;
to bring all things into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
by his distemper; and may
such an one have any hope to
aspire to a title of such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?
The world has beene

nothing but contention
relished well with him: and
shall his spirit which disquieted

<hi>peace?</hi> Or the reward of such
as embrace <hi>peace;</hi> or that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative

                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:47894:121"/>
to be called one of the

and by what meanes may

these accusations, whereof I
am not onely endited, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed.</p>
               <p>Even by thy meditation, my
deare Saviour; who brought
peace unto us, by suffering so
many things for us. O be thou
my <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> my sweet Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer!
Let mee now at last,

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:47894:123"/>
their Christian constancy with
their dearest blood; This it
was, which enduced so many
religious Virgins to overcome
the weaknesse of their sexe:
and with a vowed constancy,
and constant chastity to sleight
those assaults of savage cruelty;
those threats of brutish hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which the enemies of
Christ and of his Crosse bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
forth against them. This
caused those faithfull <hi>Confessors</hi>
to stand in defence of the
truth, and in the face of their
<hi>Persecutors</hi> to maintaine what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they had professed, and
to confirme it with the losse of
their lifes; rather then the light
of the Gospel should by their
inconstancy become darkened:
or the least derogation to his
glory who was the Author of
it, should bee by their fainting
or back-sliding occasioned.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:47894:123"/>
These found them Refuges in
Caves and Holes of Rocks;
and in these Recluses were
they comforted: for in these
they devoutly meditated of
those <hi>holes</hi> of the <hi>Spirituall
Rocke,</hi> Christ Iesus, in whom

I remembred, I had shut the

though my privacy
has seldome knowne the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47894:126"/>

it an act of great incivility not

               <p>THe very first with whom I
took occasion to discourse,
appeared to me at the first sight
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47894:127"/>
a very compleate Gallant; and
of a proper winning perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage:
neat was his dresse; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed
and curiously dishevel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his haire; with a long
amorous lock hanging downe
his shoulder; the twirling
whereof mee thought gave an
infinite grace to his discourse.
I made bold to aske of him,
where hee was borne, and in
what parts hee had most remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
For his <hi>birth</hi> hee told me
the very <hi>Angels</hi> would informe
me: for howsoever some might
imagine that in regard of his
familiar discourse and converse
with men, hee had received his
birth and parentage from them:
yet hee came from an higher
stock: and that it was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for him to remember his
descent without reserving of
an <hi>Angelicke</hi> state. This I must
confesse made me hold him in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47894:127"/>
more reverence then all the rest
of my Guests: for his curiosity
in diet, lodgi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
might accommodate him
did so properly become him, as
his fellow Travellers seemed
but home-spunne Countrey
Swaines unto him. And to
answer mee in whatsoever I
demanded of him, touching
the <hi>place</hi> of his aboad; hee told
mee that upon his first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into this lower world,
hee planted first neare that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
City <hi>Babylon;</hi> where by
his instructions hee made the
common people there such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients,
as leaving their former
rudenesse, they betooke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to such nicenesse and
neatnesse, as they would rather
neglect their trade, then not
observe the <hi>fashion</hi> of the time.
But to have seene what a
princely port the better sort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47894:128"/>
would have mov'd
the passengers greedy eye soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to admire it, then unseene
to believe it, But to remaine in
one place still, were it never of
so beauteous a site, or pretious
in magnificence of state, was
the least of his thought: for he
told me, that his <hi>Commission</hi>
was more <hi>Generall:</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
by his <hi>Superiour</hi> to put
in practise such directions in
every City, Burrow, Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Village, as might win
the hearts of all such inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
unto his <hi>Prince:</hi> and by
that meanes inlarge his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Wherewith drawing
forth a long scroule, he shewed
unto mee a Briefe of all such
directions as were prescribed
him: with a relation of such
places and persons by whom
hee was best entertained. What
Countries he had brought in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47894:128"/>
and gained: how farre his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Seignory was enlarged,
with divers other particular
remonstrances; the discovery
wherof so much delighted me,
as I desired nothing more then
with more freedome to enjoy
his company: resolving to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
his stay some longer
time with me: and to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
hee inclined readily. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
hee told mee, that during
his sojourne with mee, hee
might sometimes of necessity
crave my pardon to resort to
divers of his <hi>Masters</hi> especiall
Customers, as Painters, Persu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
Periwig-makers, with
other commodious Ingles for
the Tyre-house of sinne; to the
end they might keepe their
hands in ure, and their braines
aworke, to shape a Coat for the
Moone, and bring the world
into a new fashion. And to the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:47894:129"/>
end hee might doe mee a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
for my late hospitality; he
so strangely madded mee with
the thought of bravery, as I
became wholly his, cheerfully
embracing whatsoever hee
commanded mee: for within
short time I became such a Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall

to entertaine <hi>pride</hi> with such hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality?
No, Lord, no. Thou
became humbled, that I might bee

O my Redeemer, expell from mee

desiring to enter into confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with those that consorted
with him: The very next day,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:47894:130"/>
I tooke occasion to talke with
another of my Guests: one,
who as I formerly observed,
was so unlike the former in his
condition, as hee seemed not
to bee one of the same Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
or Nation. For asking of
him the place of his Birth and
Countrey, hee answer'd mee
bluntly, that for his birth, hee
grew forth of <hi>Achans</hi> wedge:
and for his Countrey, as he was
a <hi>Tyrian:</hi> but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aving now left
that depopulated Citie, every
place was now his Countrey.
For his appa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell, it was so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
put on, as if either hee
were weary of it, or it of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I imagin'd him at the first sight
to be <hi>Male-contens:</hi> for with
foulded armes and dejected
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yes, poring still upon the
ground; hee appeared as one
who had rather be buried in it,
then live above it. So as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:47894:130"/>
to him, and desiring to
know the ground of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content:
in an heavy and
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

me, <hi>Because hee could not bee
content.</hi> Not content, said I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
why what would you have?
whatsoever, said hee, others
have. Then replyed I, you
would others to have nothing.
That were nothing to me, said
hee, so I might have all things.
This at first seemed to mee a
strange humour: yet within
short time by his advice I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne
to labour of the same
distemper. I held it a brave
thing to bee rich, for I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
how wealth had so taken
up the opinion of the world,
that a rich man, lived he ne're so
wretchlesly, yet after his death,
it would be said of him: <hi>Hee
dyed a good man!</hi> I considered
too, how by this meanes one
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47894:131"/>
might be provided of rend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing
a curtesie to his friend, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
revenge upon his foe.
Yet for the former of these,
my sage Guest told me, that
the way to thrive was not to
be giving, but receiving: and
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>count him the best friend,
who was aptest to forget what
hee had given, or in expecting
what hee should receive.</p>
               <p>And now by meanes of those
worldly Lectures, which hee
had by my direction so grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and effectually read unto
mee, I became such a Proficient
in <hi>Mammons</hi> Schoole, as those
who long time had beene nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and nusled in it, could not
come neare mee in the Practick
part of a Worldling. Though
I knew nothing more pretious
then time, yet made I small
account of the sale of time for
the gaine of gold, I begun to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47894:131"/>
dispence with my nights rest:
and to weaken nature, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridging
her reliefe; chusing
rather to starve then impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
my state. What others of
my Meni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y enjoyed, I, though
the Master of the Family, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Nothing might eate while
I slept: meane time, while I
slept, I gave way to <hi>strangers</hi>
to <hi>eate</hi> up my <hi>strength.</hi> Thus
came my cares to be increased,
while my fortunes multiplied.
Yet what comfort found I in
these? The richer I grew in
state, the poorer I grew in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
Though I outwardly
surfeted, I became inwardly
starved. Thirsty were my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;
ever labouring of most
emptiness, when in reason they
might have bin fullest. And yet
how I hugged mine owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction!
Every day I understood
how I was neerer and neerer
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47894:132"/>
to my dissolution: and yet still
farther and farther from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:
I had heard likewise,
how riches would not deliver
mee in the day of wrath: yet
did I treasure up vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the day of Wrath. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
how <hi>bitter death</hi> would
be unto that man that put his

               <p>Deare Lord, give mee grace to

               <p>BY this time I had received
sufficient instructions from
two of my Guests; how to
thrive in the world: as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
how to reserve a port or
proud posture in the world.
And howsoever <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse</hi>
seemed to bee of
different conditions: and of
such dis-consorting humours,
as these two never tooke liking
to any <hi>Musicke,</hi> but what was
full of <hi>discord:</hi> yet me thought
they agreed well enough toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
under my roofe: yea, I
I bestow'd them in the very
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47894:133"/>
next lodging to mee, that I
might enjoy the benefit of their
Company more freely.</p>
               <p>But having now broke off
my discourse with that Guest
of mine; a man wholly made
of earth; and looking aside, I
might perceive a fresh youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Consort entring the room,
where wee conversed. By his
habit, gate and fashion, I could
scarcely distinguish him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee were man or woman.
So strangely effeminate, and to
light discourses so affected, as
hee breathed nothing but amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Songs and Sonnets; loose
love was the line by which hee
directed the whole course of
his life. His bosome was farced
full of amorous Knights ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures:
His morning Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
were <hi>Boccace</hi> and <hi>Alcae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi>
His evening Anthems
were <hi>Ariosto</hi> and <hi>Reginus.</hi> For
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47894:133"/>
his person, he was of a promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
constitution, but of pale
complexion: a quick piercing
eye; a nimble perswasive
tongue: and of such a wooing
winning action, as no expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
came from him which
would not enforce affection. I
must confesse, I no sooner saw
him, then I found a glowing
heat within mee towards him:
yea, I begunne mee thought, to
conceive better of him, then
either of the two with whom
I had before conversed; so full
of delightfull variety was his
discourse; so melodious his
voyce; so affectionately mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and compleate in every
part. I desired much to know
his descent and Countrey: and
hee resolved mee readily; that
his first plantation was neere to
the banks of that famous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Sybaris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> where he erected

not onely to improve his own

some few moneths after to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned

found such entertainment, as
neither care nor cost were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wanting

I importun'd him much to

become his Scholler: but small
importunity needed, seeing his

the conference of these
three Guests; in whose fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
I took much content.
For as the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>third</hi> had
recommended to mee <hi>Rules</hi> of

so had the <hi>Second</hi> taught mee
a thriving way how to cram
my Coffers, that I might more

ofth' one and th' other; hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
my selfe satisfied in these;
I resolved to enter into treaty
with the rest: so as walking
one day very early, I chanced
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47894:136"/>
to meet with one, but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beseeming'st
one of all my
Guests, for his complexion
seem'd so withered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed:
his body so meagre
and macilent; as he appeared
rather like some <hi>Anatomy</hi> then
any living Creature. This
poor marrow-eaten Wretch I
found sighing and making a

mis-chance had befal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him: but inquiring the reason
of his sorrowing, he told mee
that the occasion of his griefe
proceeded not from any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happe
falling to himselfe; but
for the happinesse he perceived
many others lived in. For to
see anothers field flourish; or
his goods to increase and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
was such an eye-sore unto
him, as nothing could more
distemper him. This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be a base condition,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47894:136"/>
and such as to humanity had
very small relation. So as, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to quit my house of
him; and give him his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port:
finding nothing in him
but an harsh unsociable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
rejoycing in nothing
more then the ruine of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet desiring to sift him a
little further, and to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
to make tryall of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
I took first, occasion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of him of what Parents
hee descended; and in what
Coast he first planted? and he
told mee, that <hi>Iewry</hi> was his
native Countrey; and his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
Iewes;</hi> with whom he long
time remained neare to the
Lake <hi>Asphaltos.</hi> I asked of him
what content he could take in
the World, when nothing but
the evill successe of others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
him any object of joy in
the world? And he answer'd
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:47894:137"/>
mee, if I knew what strange
content the <hi>Envious</hi> man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
from others mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
I would preferre that
humour before any personall
honour: for, said hee, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
stands so affected, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
want variety of Subjects
to minister to him that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
which he desired. I must,
indeed, confesse, quoth he, that
I am of necessity now &amp; then
to encounter with some argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of discontent; as I did
this very Morning in seeing
your Neighbours Pastures so
fruitfull; their harvest so hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
but for one of these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
I shall find an hundred
occasions of content. No place
is exempted from mee: no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
excepted from playing one
part or other in this enterlude
of folly. O how it joyes mee
to see a proud ambitious spirit
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47894:137"/>
entring lists with his Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor:
where the one must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
fall to advance the
other? Honour was their bait,
and it proves their baine. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
to see a Love-sick amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Foole put his whole pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
on his back, to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
his light Mistresse with
a phantastick Dresse: and in the
end come home with a repulse:
and so like a Child put singer
ith' Eye: or laying it to heart,
make the losse of her fancy, the
Cloze of his misery. Againe,
to see a miserable covetous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
scraping up an injurious
estate for a Prodigall Child;
who before his Fathers Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
bee solemnized, takes as
much paines how to scatter it,
as ever his raking Father did
to gather it. Or to see a base
worlding spend himselfe in
sighs and teares for the losse of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47894:138"/>
his beast; making himselfe no
better by his foolish mourning
then that poor senselesse Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for which he mourned.
To see wisemen lament for the
death of their Children; as if
death were some new thing:
or that there were no hope af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Death. To see a confident
Client faile in his Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an Earth-worme stript of his

               <p>This I considered, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought

encountred another cleare of

was and well-liking; one who
cared not much what <hi>arrow</hi> of
Gods judgment were shot, so
<hi>famine</hi> were left out. He told
mee, he had beene a professor
of Philosophy in the Epicures
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:47894:139"/>
Academy. How he was by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
a <hi>Sidonian,</hi> and descended
from the <hi>Vitellian</hi> family. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
in the manner of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
he discovered no great
arguments of a Scholler; being
of a dull and clodded fancy:
and of apprehension slow and
heavy. His providence meerly
consisted in purveyance for the
belly. Wherein hee observed
such delicacie; as hee scorned
much to sit at that Table which
was not stored with all Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
I told him Strangers were
not to be so curious; but rather
contented with whasoever
was for the present provided.
Wherewith seeming a little
moved; Sir, said he, I am nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so wanting in friends nor
fortunes, as I need rely upon
reversions. I have thus long
lived and fed deliciously, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
my Bellie my Deitie. And
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:47894:139"/>
if you knew what delight
there were in a luscious Tooth,
and what pleasure in full Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes;
what strength they afford
to nature: and how they infuse
into the Bloud a fresh revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
vigour, I am perswaded
you would preferre this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
before any other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>Sir, answer'd I, take me not
up so shortly; I was never yet
knowne such a niggard; as for
sparing a little trash to starve
my Belly. Others through their
misery may stand indebted to
it, but for my part I will rather
choose to abridge mine <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,</hi>
then be so taxed by it.</p>
               <p>But by your favour I
must tell you what I have

makes a God of his Bellie, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fets
in the delight of such a

daintie Deitie. And I have
sometimes read <hi>Lessius</hi> his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
in Physick. How, when
Nature grew so weake in him,
as there was no hope of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
him: and that his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
had left him: yet by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
himselfe a strict Diet,
and by duely observing what
he had prescribed; he even in
his declining age became
youthfull; in his recreations
fresh and cheerfull: and even
to his death strong and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>And yet he for all this died
(said my delicious Guest) and
tell me then what did his rules
of Physick, availe him? Go to,

begun I to loose the hopes of a

               <p>THe very next I took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to talke withall, was
the most braving and imperious
Guest that ever any one gave
harbour to. For during those
few dayes wherein hee had so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
with mee, he begunne
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:47894:142"/>
to keepe such a quarter, as if
the whole house had beene at
his command. Not a servant
but shak't and shudder'd when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
hee came in presence.
So teechie and froward was his
humour, that all things seemed
in his judgement out of order.
Thus did my whole family
suffer through his fury. So as
indeed, I had a great desire to
quit my house of him: for
daily did mine eares glow
with complaints against him.
No servant would stay with
mee so long as hee remained
with mee. All things grew
out of joynt; all things out of
square. And now having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to put in speedy execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
what I had intended; I
tooke the opportunity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with my mind. But
when I had told him, how my
whole family grew weary of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:47894:142"/>
him: and that I might of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
keepe my house alone, if
I rid not my doores of him:
Hee fell into such a furious pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as I feared much he would
have offered some violence to
mee: but as good fortune was,
his fury resolv'd it selfe into
words: which were delivered
in that braving and domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manner; as mee thought I
begunne to take affection to
that humour. For he told me,
and that in such a scornefull
way, as not a word came from
him but it breathed contempt,
or threatned a mischiefe, that
if I thought hee was beholden
to me for my entertainment, I
was much deceived: for he held
my entertainment so unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of him, as I might hold
my selfe sufficiently contented
that hee would accept of it.
But Sir, said hee I must tell you,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:47894:143"/>
I cannot chuse but smile at your
folly; to see you thus over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aw'd
and baffall'd by your own
family. Your indiscreet pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
if you quicken not your
temper, will ere it bee long,
make you a Servant of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
and by their malepert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
bring your command in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a bondage.</p>
               <p>Your Neighbours too, they
observe the quietnesse of your
disposition; and they play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your easinesse. For shame, be
of sharper mettall. Make your
Servants tremble when they
heare you: and enforce that
commanding awe to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours,
that as if they heard
thunder, they may <hi>blesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
when they come neare
you. Impunity opens a passage
to all impiety; if any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
or committed to your
charge shall but lightly offend;
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:47894:143"/>
yet you must not be too indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in rendring a pardon. I
hold it farre better, and for
your state or condition fitter,
never to debate the cause with
mildnesse, for that tasteth of
too much softnesse, but to <hi>strike</hi>
before you <hi>speake;</hi> to season
your reproofe with correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which will beget in you a
reverence, and in them more
subjection. This that Roman
<hi>Vedius</hi> could doe bravely; and
in such an imperious sort exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
his Soveraignty: as his
very becke was a word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to all his family. And
this while I was in <hi>Thebes</hi> (for
I am a Theban borne) did I
constantly practise; and that
not onely over such as I might
command: but over such too,
whose spirits I found so ready
to vaile to one of my quality;
as I made them no lesse subject
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:47894:144"/>
to my uncontrouled will, then
if they had beene of my owne
family. For during my reside
in that famous City, none but I
raised that fearefull fraternall
emnity betwixt <hi>Eteocles</hi> and
<hi>Polynices:</hi> which unnaturall
contest (so strongly had my
fury wrought upon their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits)
could receive no end, but
in one anothers blood. Neither
was it my humour to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined:
for I had dreamed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before my departure thence,
how with unfortunate <hi>Hecuba,</hi>
I was conceived with a <hi>fire-brand,</hi>
and that it could not bee
quenched but in the blood of
many nations. Neither did
that ominous Dreame of mine
prove false: for though with
<hi>Cassandra's</hi> prophesie, it would
not be believed, the fatall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters
of many flourishing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
have before this time
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:47894:144"/>
confirm'd it. For to omit the
subversion of many ancient
Empires; whose memory now
sleepes in dust, I appeale even
to your selfe, by whose meanes
those ruines were occasioned,
and that lately amongst our
<hi>Free States?</hi> By whose agency
those fearefull and fatall divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
sprung up in <hi>Calidore:</hi>
where <hi>Religion</hi> made the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi>
but <hi>innovation</hi> of <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
plotted the <hi>ground.</hi> And
who became the manager of
those disloyall attempts but my
selfe? If then your desire bee,
to be one of note or fame in the
world; observe my directions,
admit of no reconciled foe into
the list of your discourse. And

have you to skrue your passion

or shouldst punish mee

my Brother. Hee many times

my pardon: yet would not all

               <p>BVt amongst all others, who
had liberally partak't of my
bounty; there was one, who
so little deserv'd it, that in a
carelesse security, as one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectlesse
of any courtesie, hee
would all the day long take his
rest; and scarcely rise without
much adoe to take his necessary
repast. And one day I chanc'd
to find him, when all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
were addressing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to one exercise or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
turning or rather row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
himselfe in his bed, like a
doore upon the hinges. So as,
I begun to take him under
hand, and to reprove him;
bidding to shake off <hi>Sloath</hi>
for shame, and prepare himselfe
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:47894:147"/>
for some taske: lest in time he
might incurre <hi>Margites</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
who, because hee neither
digged, plowed, nor did any
good thing all his time, was not
onely barred all civile society
living; but was not admitted
to have his ashes deposited in
the Vrne of his Ancestors, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
I desired to know fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of him what content hee
could take in groveling after
that manner in his bed of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
while every creature ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his ranke or quality,
discovered some token of their
industry. And in a sluggish
manner hee told mee; how
there was none, but at one time
or other hee might thrive, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
that hee kept his shop;
Now, what did any one know
but that it was his <hi>Calling</hi> to
make his shop his bed: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was hee (as h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pretented) unimployed,
when hee seemed for rest most
addicted. For that very mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and no longer since, hee
told mee that hee kept his bed,
not so much for his owne ease,
as for composing a maine diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
which two noble Ladies
had referred to him. For there
had lately appeared to him two
brave women attired in prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
habit, who contended much
for superiority: and the names
of these two Ladies were <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phuia</hi>
and <hi>Argia.</hi> Now these,
after such time as they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
before him, discovered
both their <hi>Descents</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi>
For <hi>Euphuia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her selfe descended from
an <hi>industrious</hi> family; so shee
shewed her selfe a true daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for shee was wonderfully
given to <hi>industry.</hi> Whereas <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi>
was clear of another humor:
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:47894:148"/>
for nothing suited better with
her disposition, then to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
These two, accordingly
as they stood severally affected,
brake forth into commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of what their natures stood
most inclined to. <hi>Euph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that nothing improved
any ones private estate or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
more then <hi>Industry.</hi> The
other, with no lesse confidence
spake all she could in praise of
privacy, and a sleepy kind of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity;
saying, how that was
well got, that was got in a
warme bed: and that <hi>Timandra</hi>
purchas'd as much pleasure in
the embrace of her friend, as
ever <hi>Thalestris</hi> did in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfiture

to advance the honour of
Armes with all other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

with much moderation repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her frowardnesse; telling

would spend no breath in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending

                  </gap>e Arbitrator,
desiring rather a nappe in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
then discharge the part of
a Moderator: So as, I might
easily conjecture, to what side
hee inclined most, by his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versenesse
from labour. And,
indeed, I must freely confesse,
I begunne not altogether to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:47894:149"/>
dislike his humour. For when
hee had more fully acquainted
mee with the quality of his
condition: how and in what
manner hee had ever lived;
how hee had shunned all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
employments: desiring
rather a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>ease,</hi> then to
dis-ease his owne quiet for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
good. Againe, what a
madnesse it was, to toyle or
turmoile ones selfe in the
world; to have a <hi>sickle</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<hi>corne;</hi> or to have an <hi>oare</hi>
in every ones <hi>boat?</hi> To be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a wise and subtile
Commissioner; and so spend
his spirits about a fruitlesse
or thankelesse labour? To play
the carking Husband, in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
for a progeny of hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Rake-hels? To afflict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in the hoording up of that;
which is got with paine and
toyle, kept with care, and feare,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:47894:149"/>
and lost with pangs and griefe?
No, no; said hee, let the world
wagge, so I may enjoy my rest;
draw my Curtaines close; take
my morning nappe; let the
Husbandman meet with a
Snake in the way; Let the
thirsty worldling play the
Mole, digge and delve; I shall
rather pitty his folly, then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
his happinesse.</p>
               <p>This humour, the more I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
it, the more I affected
it. So as I begunne to imitate
my Guest, and to sing the
Sluggards Lullabe, with <hi>yet a
little,</hi> and <hi>then a little.</hi> And
though poverty came so upon
mee, yet the enjoyment of a
little Summer made me forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of an ensuing Winter. An
hundred excuses would I
mould, purposely to sleepe se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely:
and free my selfe of all
busines, though it did never
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:47894:150"/>
so nearely concerne mee. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there was an <hi>Adder</hi> in the

or some indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to health, injoyned me to
keepe my bed. Thus did my
delicacy bring mee to securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
which howsoever I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
my selfe, was so farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
from me: as in the end
I found my perplexed estate
ever to danger most ingaged,
where weaknesse of opinion
dreamed to mee, that I was

By harbouring <hi>Wrath,</hi>

So as, those darlings of

short and rare my compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

without intention, my reading
without edification, my speech
without circumspection; I
grow ashamed of my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
acknowledging nothing
to bee due unto mee, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

when at any time I pray, I
mind not what I pray, nor to

him to whom I pray, or that

my prayer shall bee heard by
him,<note place="margin">Ib. c. 8.</note> seeing I my selfe doe not

<hi>Prayer</hi> without devotion is like

               <p>O my deare Lord, as thou hast

O how happy had that rich man

his <hi>Bowels</hi> to the poore!
Little knew hee how soone his

thy best thoughts, or bestow
thy care, then the <hi>salvation</hi> of
thy <hi>soule?</hi> Didst thou thinke it
so easie a taske to get <hi>Heaven,</hi>
as to purchase it by making
thine <hi>Heaven</hi> on <hi>earth;</hi> yet hadst
thou but taken halfe so much
pains to get <hi>heaven,</hi> as thou hast
done to get <hi>Hell:</hi> thou mightst
have challeng'd more interest to
<hi>Heaven,</hi> then now thou canst.
Many summer days &amp; long win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
nights have thy follies taken
thee up: and these seem'd short
unto thee, because thou tookst
delight in those pleasures of
vanity: But to bestow one

suffer; and how long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
seem'd that houre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that task was wearisome
to thee, and thy mind was else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where

thee; when thou wouldst nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

long, and found so small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
that may deserve your
teares? Is the world, this
empty Sponge, growne so
neare to your heart; as it has
power to draw teares from
your eyes? Tell mee the
ground of your griefe! Doe
you sorrow because Old-age
comes upon you, and you
can live no longer: or if you
should live, you cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
that fulnesse of youthfull
pleasure which you formerly
tasted? or are you unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:47894:195"/>
to forgoe your possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
to take a long leave of
your friends; or to be stript
of those goodly honours,
which you here enjoyed?
No, I hope you are wiser
then to become so foolish a
Mourner. What is it then
that has thus violently
wrought upon your reason:
and brought your disordered
thoughts unto this distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Surely, it must bee of
some importance that has
brought you into this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolate
anguish. But this I
perceive to be a distemper of
your mind: and it shall bee
our principall care; upon
discovery of your wound,
to apply a speedy cure. Goe
to then, disclose your griefe
freely; and believe her, who
hates nothing more then
<hi>breach</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> that upon
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:47894:195"/>
your imparting of it, you
shall receive this friendly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
from mee; either to cure
it or allay it.</q> Herewith I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
so encouraged, as I made
a free discovery of the grounds
of my affliction; which shee
tooke so well at mine hands, as
presently causing me to sit by
her, shee begunne to comfort
me in this manner. <q>You have
done wel in this discovery of
your grief. Wounds cannot be
cured, before they be opened.
Neither doe wee feare but by
ministring some fitting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions,
our endevours wil
bring forth that good effect,
as you shall find great case in
your afflictions. You tell me,
how the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of
your <hi>end</hi> is very terrible to
you: not so much in regard of
your fear of <hi>Death:</hi> as of that
fearfull day of <hi>Iudgement</hi> after
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:47894:196"/>
                     <hi>Death.</hi> For you find in your
selfe such an infinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable
weight of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
sinnes pressing down-your
soule even to the gates
of Hell, as lesse then grieve
you cannot; else were you
insensible of the losse of a
soule. Trust mee, Pilgrime
so farre am I from sorrowing
with you, as I rejoyce in your
sorrowing: For this sense
of your sinnes brings you to
seeke for cure: which had
they not afflicted you, and
and brought you even to the
pit-brinke, had beene the least
of your care. It is well then
for you that you are affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted:
for else you might
have gloried and fatned
your selfe in your sinnes, and
so eternally perished. Bee
then of good comfort: and
suffer not <hi>Cains</hi> desperate
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:47894:196"/>
conclusion to have any pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
in you: For I must
tell you, hee sinned more in
saying, <hi>Greater is my sinne then
can be pardoned;</hi> then in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
his Brother: For as
in the one, hee lay violent
hand on the Image of God;
So in the other hee detracted
from the highest and dearest
prerogative belonging to
God: for there is no attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
wherewith hee is more
delighted, then to be styled
a <hi>God of mercy.</hi> We may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then conclude: That <hi>des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire</hi>
is of a more high and
hainous nature then any sin.
For tell me, has not God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with his owne mouth
promised, and is he not both
able and willing to performe
what hee hath promised?
That, <hi>At what time soever a
sinner doth repent him of his sin</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 18.</note>
                     <pb n="374" facs="tcp:47894:197"/>
                     <hi>from the botome of his heart,</hi> hee
<hi>will put awdy all his wickednesse
out of his remembrance</hi> Though
late repentance then bee sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
true, yet true repentance
never commeth too late. The
good Thiefe had no sooner
repented him of his sin, and
confessed Christ, then he was
even at the last hour received
to mercy: which example, as
it admits no such liberty as to
encourage any to <hi>presume,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there was but one: nor
to throw downe any into
<hi>despaire,</hi> seeing there was
one. Indeed there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that endangers mans
salvation more then by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
way to <hi>delay:</hi> yet when
the sorrowfull soule heartily
repents him of what is past,
and with a constant religious
resolve intends to redeeme
the time to come; his pious
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:47894:197"/>
teares, devout prayers, holy
resolves will find ready ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
to the Throne of
Grace. For as his <hi>mercy</hi> is
above all his <hi>Workes,</hi> so will
hee shew it most on that
worke which stands in most
need of his mercy. This I am
sure your long experience not
onely observed but plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
tasted, for else have
those yeares of your Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
beene ill bestowed;
that hee is <hi>gracious, merciful,</hi>
and long <hi>suffering.</hi> Nay, that
it has been evermore the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of this good and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Shepherd, to call home
those that were wandring,
invite those that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
expect those that
were fore-slowing, &amp; to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
those that were retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Nay, that it has bin ever
the condition of this valiant
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:47894:198"/>
                     <hi>Iosuah,</hi> to exhort you to
fight, and so to helpe you
that you might become Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
in that fight. In one
word, it has beene ever his
care to behold you when you
were in the Battaile sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to encourage you when
you were failing, and
crowne you when you were
vanquishing. Come then tell
mee, are you wearied and so
heavy laden, that you must
faint by the way, if you bee
not refreshed? Behold, how
hee has invited you to come
unto him, where you may
receive refreshment and
comfort from him! Bee not
then <hi>wavering</hi> in the <hi>Faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Iam. 5.</note>
but take fast hold of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
who will not faile
you: and relye on his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
which in your greatest
straits will deliver you. Bee
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:47894:198"/>
                     <hi>faithful</hi> then unto the end, and
he wil give your hearts desire.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Ladies exhortation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
mee much comfort in
this my affliction; but much
more when I knew who shee
was: for I had heard much of
her, though I was never till
then well acquainted with her.
For so soone as I heard her
name, I began to be very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that whatsoever shee
spake came from good ground.
Nay, I understood how no acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were it never so good in
its owne nature, could subsist or
become really good without
her. How she was the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke
of all vertues; the pure
Fountaine and firme foundation
of all divine graces. How no
fruits were they never so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to the eye, nor savoury to
the taste, but they were <hi>Sodoms</hi>
apples, unlesse they received
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:47894:199"/>
grouth and ripenesse from her.
How every <hi>faithfull soule</hi> lived
by her:<note place="margin">Hab. 2. 4.</note> how every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>justified</hi> by her: good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
then had I to rely on her,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 28</note>
and to derive comfort from
her.</p>
               <p>Having in this manner with
her sweet instructions refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
mee, promising mee with
all, that even in mine Agonies
of death she would be near me,
if now in these few but evill
dayes of my Pilgrimage, shee
were not discarded by mee:
which I vowed never to doe
so long as there was breath in
my body; shee suddenly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
from me; which did not
a little perplexe me: for never
tooke poore afflicted soul more

not how soone
<hi>Faith</hi> begins to decline and
grow out of request in the

found true by mine own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience:
for albeit, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:47894:200"/>
assurance of <hi>Faith</hi>
might seeme to have removed
from me all occasions of feare:
and had so well strengthned
mee, as those infirmities wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I formerly laboured, were
to the outward eye wholly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in mee: yet remained
there still some <hi>core</hi> at mine
heart. I found it was not so
well with mee as it should be.
Me thought day and night that
terrible voyce of <hi>Behold the man
and his workes!</hi> ever sounded in
mine care. For I considered,
how as God was <hi>mercifull,</hi> so
hee was <hi>just.</hi> Neither did it
stand with Gods <hi>Iustice,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
any other <hi>sentence</hi> upon
mee then as my sinnes deserv'd.
What then could I expect, but
to be throwne downe into that
bottomlesse pit, where nothing
but <hi>woe, woe</hi> in every place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded:
horror and confusion
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:47894:200"/>
dwelled? Thus fared it with
mee, as with one newly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
out of some dangerous
sicknesse, and after his recovery,
by reason of some distemper
makes relapse into his former
malady. But I found, how
when mans helpe faileth, Gods
beginneth: And that mans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
was Gods opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
So gracious is the Lord
to those that feare him: yea, to
all such as with an humble and
contrite heart returne unto
him. For behold how light
appeared out of darknesse!
One day as I stood thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed,
weary of life, yet feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to dye, there appeared, mee
thought, before me a woman of
a beautifull and cheerfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
bearing an <hi>Anchor</hi>
upon her shoulder: who draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards me, presently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of mee how it was
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:47894:201"/>
with me? But as one desirous
to have none to share with mee
in the burden of my affliction:
nor to partake of any comfort,
so strangely had my folly given
way to temptation: as I turned
uncivilly my face from her: but
of so sweet and well-compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a spirit seemed this Lady, as
all this nothing amated her:
and the better to bring mee to a
feeling of mine owne infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
addressed her discourse in
this manner unto me.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Goe to sir! you must not
have your owne will in this
sort: A froward Patient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a rough hand, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
heart. But I will shew
my selfe more courteous to
you. I am not ignorant of
of your disease; and much
relyes your malady on my
cure. Doubt nothing of your
recovery, so you will but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:47894:201"/>
discover your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.
Neither am I alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unacquainted with
my sister <hi>Faiths</hi> late visit of
you: whose sound cordiall
comforts might have
wrought such effect in you,
as you should have lesse nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
any other receipts, had
you discreetly applyed what
was so seasonably, and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignly
ministred. But before
I beginne with you; let mee
so farre prevaile with you, as
to remove from your too
much dejected and depressed
spirit, all those unbeseeming
thoughts which perplexe
your quiet: Bee not such an
enemy to your selfe, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that, which may rectifie
your state: And of sick; may
make you whole: and of a
faint-hearted souldier, a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
Warrier. And now
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:47894:202"/>
to prepare you the better for
this spirituall encounter:
my first Assay must be, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
those <hi>skales</hi> from your
eyes, which by long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
are growne so thick,
as they keepe you from
knowing us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This said, shee infused a smal
quantity of a precious kind of
liquor into my dusky and dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
eyes: which infused, those
very <hi>skales,</hi> which formerly
troubled my sight, became re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved:
so as, I perceived
who it was that ministred unto
mee: and by little and little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
so strengthned, as I was
confident of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
little cheered; as one desirous
to perfect what she had begun
to make mee more hopefull of
her cure, shee acquainted mee
with the quality of her power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:47894:202"/>
                  <q>How now, said shee, I
cannot be perswaded but you
must now of necessity know
mee? Though I have beene
long time a stranger to you;
let us now renue our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance;
believe it, it shall
not repent you: for I never
yet lodged in that Inne,
which held mee not a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Guest. Many before
this time had untimely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished,
had they not by mee
beene seasonably supported.
By land and water have I
offered my selfe a friendly
companion: and firmly stuck
I to them who relyed on me,
in time of greatest danger
or opposition. And when no
semblance of delivery appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
no <hi>hope</hi> of liberty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached:
We with this
<hi>Anchor</hi> brought them to the

so securely, as no perill could
interpose their security.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And now tell me, is our
strength so weakned, as wee
cannot performe what wee
formerly so happily effected:
No, we are the same; so wee
find the same Spirit in those
to whom we apply our cure;
which to accomplish shall be
our principall care. Take
then for an <hi>Helmet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 8 Tit: 2. 13.</note> the <hi>hope</hi> of

I recommend you.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This said, she retired, but my
<hi>Hope</hi> became much strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
For having sometimes
heard, how <hi>Hope</hi> that is <hi>seene,</hi>
is not <hi>Hope:</hi> Though I did not
see her, yet was I comforted
by her: for her sweet and
comfortable advice had so
cheered me; as with that pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of patience, (and that
with great vehemence) I cryed
forth in this manner; through
the <hi>hope</hi> and assurance which I
had in my deare Saviour: <hi>I
know that my Redeemer liveth,
and that with these eyes I shall see
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I begun to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at mine owne weaknesse;
how I could so much as have
the least distrust or diffidence in
Gods goodnesse: how I could
suffer my spirit to be so uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:47894:204"/>
drenched and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the depth of misery:
having so free <hi>accesse</hi> to the
Throne of mercy. Againe,
how in this surging Sea of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;
where every worldy
wave threatneth ruine: I durst
presume to play the <hi>Mariner,</hi>
and faile without mine <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor.</hi>
Finding then so sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
a cure for my care: Such
sweet solace to mine anguish:
so present a repreve against
death: so fit a receipt to my
griefe, I thought good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to the Lord with my

unto him from whom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

grounded mine <hi>hope.</hi> My mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

that in an acceptable time hee

to suffer, and by suffering to

suffering him not to bee

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se it. For she found me sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:47894:206"/>
to no such dis-consolate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
but refreshed with joy
above measure; which to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper,
shee begun to impart
her mind unto mee after this
manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It joyes mee much, good
Pilgrim, to see you thus
brought from death to life.
But it were well for you so
to moderate these comforts
which you have received: as
not to lose your selfe, lest you
might deprive your selfe of
the benefit of this comfort.
You may doe well then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to imitate the <hi>Fly,</hi> which
putteth not her feet into the
great Masse of honey, but only
taketh with her tongue so
much thereof as serveth her
turne and no more, lest by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
otherwise, she might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
taken and drowned
therein. Too much honey
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:47894:206"/>
cloyeth: and too much of
comfort drowneth. Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
then these, as you tender
your invvard peace. Time
has beene vvhen the very least
beameling of these comforts
which now so plentuously
reflect on you, would have
infinitly refreshed you: for
your spirit was wounded
within you: present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
and future hopes had
wholly estranged themselves
from you. Stand then in feare,
lest by abuse of these, some
worser thing befall you.
Many, by being unhappy
have become happy: but very
few have attained true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
by being in this
world ever happy. Now
then, as my sister <hi>Faith</hi> has
in these spirituall comforts
grounded you: And my
younger sister <hi>Hope</hi> has in
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:47894:207"/>
these confirmed you: So shall
it be my care, who am their
poore contemptible sister,
to prepare you for them, as
they have prepared them for
you: that such choyce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts
may be applyed to that
end for which they were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred:
and your comforts
such, as the issue of them
may not be repented.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After this discourse of hers,
I desired much to know her
name: for being, as shee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
sister to those two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
from whose advice I had
received so great comfort: I
wondred much at her Habit:
for though her presence were
comely, her countenance love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
her behaviour sweetned
with a well-beseeming mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty;
yet her apparell was but
meane. Which she observing,
with a quick delivery and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:47894:207"/>
gravity, shee thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
mee.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You must not gather by my
<hi>Habit</hi> what I am. For I
weare the worlds livery;
such as shee is pleased to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
upon mee; with no
lesse content, then shee
throwes it on me with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
For many yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
have I beene the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<hi>Almoner:</hi> yet never to
this houre did I increase my
store: for all the service I
did him, I required no other
wages of him, but to take
his poore Hand-maids coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
which was: To make
himselfe happy with his
owne. But alas, I found <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi>
saying too true! The
vertuous did more frequent
the doores of the rich, then
then the rich of the vertuous.
The poore were vertuous,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:47894:208"/>
and repaired to the doores of
the rich: but the rich were
vicious, and would not open
their doores to the poore.
I observed how vertue was
accounted such a treasure, as
'twas held more fitting to be
out of the world then in it:
whereas riches held that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
amongst men: as
men were held of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without it. But yeu de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to know my name; and
you shall have it: but I pray
you doe not imitate the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of this present world,
by loving one worse when
you hear it. Neither am I a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Consort for you, unlesse
my two Sisters have wrought
some good effect on you. For
<hi>charity</hi> is <hi>cold;</hi> and such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
are not easily enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:
nor such Guests
kindly received; where the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:47894:208"/>
one bids us <hi>give</hi> that we may
<hi>receive:</hi> the other bids us
<hi>give</hi> all that we <hi>have:</hi> and
when all that wee <hi>have</hi> is <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
to expect our reward in
heauen. But this <hi>sowing</hi> of
<hi>bread</hi> upon the <hi>water,</hi> is of
too hard digestion to a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
worldling: and yet it
must be <hi>sowne</hi> upon the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
or your <hi>harvest</hi> is lost for
ever. Let mee then second,
what my deare Sisters have
proposed: as your discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
were by them not onely
allayed; but with assurance
in Gods promises confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
So heare what <hi>charity,</hi>
the Worldlings out-cast, will
doe unto you; to make you
perfect throughout for Him
who will receive you. I
have never yet beene known
to bee more ready to <hi>promise</hi>
then <hi>performe.</hi> Yet shall the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:47894:209"/>
promise which I make unto
you, bee of infinite conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:
for it shall make
you eternally happy in the
performance. You are here
planted in a <hi>vaile</hi> of <hi>misery,</hi>
where I promise to cover all
your <hi>scarlet sinnes</hi> with the
<hi>white roabe</hi> of <hi>mercy.</hi> Nay,
I will yet goe a little farther
to conferre on your peacefull
progresse the higher honour:
If you will deaine to leave
the world, and receive mee
who am despised of the
world: If you will, I say,
leave her society, and bid adue
to her blooms of vanity: by
keeping mee company, I
shall conduct you safely to the
Kingdome of glory.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now let it be the least of your
feare, that I promise above
my power. For as my sisters
imparted their love unto
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:47894:209"/>
you, in cheering, comforting,
and confirming you: so shall
you find no lesse alacrity in
mee, in perfecting what they
have so happily begunne in
you. For I must tell you,
(neither would I have you
thinke that this proceedeth
from any <hi>vaine glory,</hi> being
that which could never chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the least affinity with
true <hi>charity</hi>) that though my
sisters may seeme to have
priority in list and number, yet
am I to challenge preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in respect of dignity and
order. This that vessell of
Election confirmed when he
said: <hi>Now abideth faith, hope,
charity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 53. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>these three, but the
greatest of these is charity.</hi>
Neither shall you need to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any other description
for the portraiture of my
feature, or quality of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:47894:210"/>
then what that glorious
Champion hath already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to you. For tell mee,
have you desire to bee infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in what most concerns
you; to bee edified in what
most imports you? It is not
<hi>knowledge</hi> but <hi>charity</hi> that
must worke this good effect
in you. For, <hi>knowledge puffes
up,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>but charity edifieth.</hi> Or
would you bee perswasive in
Oratory; or powerfull in
prophesy; or an usefull Alm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
for your soules safety?
you must necessarily bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by <hi>Charity;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">v. I.</note> or
you are but as <hi>sounding brasse,</hi>
or a <hi>tinkling Cymbal.</hi> Your
power to remove <hi>mountaines</hi>
shall not remove in you the
least Mole-hill of your sinne.
Your bestowing all your
goods to feed the poore,
shall not make your soule
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:47894:210"/>
rich: these cannot profit you,
if <hi>charity</hi> doe not accompany
you. Seeing then the <hi>tongues</hi>
of men and angels are but
<hi>tinklings</hi> and very <hi>sounds</hi>
without <hi>charity; knowledge</hi>
becomes fruitlesse without
the edifying helpe of <hi>charity;
prophesies,</hi> bee they never so
mysterious; <hi>Sciences,</hi> bee
they in their owne nature ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

that in her absence I might find

Will and Testament.</head>
               <p>IN the name of the <hi>Father,</hi> the
<hi>Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost. I S.
M.</hi> A poore penitent Pilgrim,
found in body, and of perfect
memory: yet being daily read
in the Lecture of mans morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
how all <hi>Flesh</hi> is <hi>Grasse,</hi> and
the <hi>beauty</hi> thereof as the <hi>Flower</hi>
of the field; which this day flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth,
to morrow withereth:
and that it is every Christians
duty to <hi>prepare</hi> himselfe before
<hi>Death</hi> come, lest it find him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided
at such time as it shall
come. Moved, I say, with
these considerations, I have
here made this my last Will
and Testament as followeth.</p>
               <p>First I bequeath my soule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:47894:216"/>
the hands of my gracious
Redeemer, by whose most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
blood I was redeemed:
and by whose merits and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
(for my merits are his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies)
I hope to bee glorified.
And forasmuch as there was
no <hi>safety</hi> out of the <hi>Arke;</hi> nor
no salvation now without the
<hi>pale</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> figured by
the <hi>Arke:</hi> and that the <hi>tares</hi>
from the <hi>wheat</hi> must be severed:
the <hi>Sheepe</hi> and the <hi>Goats</hi> must
not into one <hi>Fold</hi> be gathered:
HERE in the presence of God
and his blessed Angels; for the
discharge of mine owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and the satisfaction of
others, who, perchance, have
in their opinions been divided,
doubting much how I in
points of Religion stood affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
Doe I make a free and
publike confession of my Faith:
being that <hi>Cement</hi> by which
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:47894:217"/>
we are knit unto her, and made
<hi>Members</hi> of her.</p>
               <p>I beleeve the <hi>holy Catholike
Church,</hi> to be the <hi>Communion</hi> of
the <hi>Faithfull,</hi> whereof I desire
to live and dye a Member: for
which to suffer I should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it an honour: holding
this for a <hi>Principle</hi> ever; That
none can have <hi>God</hi> for his <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
that will not take his <hi>Holy
Spouse</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> for his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
There is no Article in the
Apostles Creed which I do not
beleeve for Catholike and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall,
with the exposition
thereof, and every Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>use or
Particle thereof in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as it hath beene universally
received by the holy Catholike
Church, from the first four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years after Christ: and as it
holds in consent or harmony
with the Holy Scripture, the
Christians Armour; by which
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:47894:217"/>
and the constant practise of
piety, every faithfull Souldier
of Christ Iesus may be enabled
to pull downe those strong
Holds of his spirituall enemy:
and by possessing his soule in
patience, obtaine a glorious
victory. And as there have been
at all times tares in Gods field;
so is it more to be pittied then
doubted, that there are many
surreptitious errours crept into
the bosome of the Church
through the corruption of
time, and our enemies malice:
which though they ayme not at
the <hi>Corner-stone,</hi> nor at the
maine <hi>foundation,</hi> yet being but
<hi>stubble,</hi> &amp; no wayes conducing
to so glorious a building, they
are to bee accounted of that
quality, as they blemish much
her primitive beauty. These
then being the fancies of
humane braines, and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:47894:218"/>
into the Church for private
ends; and so continued rather
by an imperious then just com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
I hold them so farre
from being effectuall to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as they become scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to many tender conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and consequently deserve
rather to be rejected then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.
But for the <hi>Ornaments</hi>
of the Church, as shee is the
<hi>Kings Daughter,</hi> so she should
be comely: and for her <hi>musicke</hi>
or <hi>melody;</hi> being his <hi>Spouse,</hi>
it admits harmony: for so
drowsie is mans zeale and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
as hee stands in great
need of something to stirre up
his devotion. Likewise of those
ancient and decent <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
of the Church, being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
and not superstitiously
used, I have ever reverently
esteemed. Neither am I igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
how disputation in argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:47894:218"/>
of controversall learning
hath beene of late yeares in
more request then care of
blamelesse conversation and
living; how indiscreet and
impertinent reasoning has in
many places brought that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
effect, as it hath begot
many irreparable rents in
Christs seamelesse Coat: thus
wounds left to the handling of
unexpert hands became so farre
from curing, as they grew
more dangerously spreading;
and desperately increasing then
they were in the beginning,
and before they came to hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
These Deficiences are
with pious teares and devout
prayers to be repaired, that men
of learning may bee likewise
men of living; being endowed
with that zeale, as in all their
arguments by way of private
discourse or more publike op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:47894:219"/>
their sole ayme and
desire may bee to propagate
the Gospel, and in it the glory
of God, with all singlenesse of
mind, and that without singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
of judgement; being so
free from all manner of osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
or the spirit of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
as they may shun no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,
nor hold any thing more
deare then the Churches peace,
So as, to compose this breach,
I never hold those in points of
Religion to be sitting Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
who made it their onely
ayme in a scholasticall manner
to weave up their Arguments:
but such moderate spirits,
whose desires were rather to
cleare mens consciences from
inbred scruples, then broach
new differences.</p>
               <p>With all due reverence I
esteeme of those two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:47894:219"/>
                  <hi>Baptisme</hi> and the
<hi>Supper</hi> of the Lord, as those
two nursing brests of the
Church: the one to clense and
purifie us at our entring: the
other to strengthen and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
us living: and to glorifie
our soules at their departing.
As with mine <hi>heart</hi> I <hi>beleeve</hi>
unto <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> so with my
<hi>Mouth</hi> doe I <hi>confesse</hi> unto <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
Neither, doe I professe
my selfe such a <hi>Soli-fidian,</hi> as to
hold <hi>Faith</hi> sufficient to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without <hi>Workes.</hi> Neither
such a <hi>Champion</hi> for <hi>good workes,</hi>
as to hold <hi>works</hi> effectuall
without <hi>Faith.</hi> As <hi>Faith</hi> is the
root, so are <hi>works</hi> the fruit.
Nay, I hold these to have such
necessary dependence one of
th' other, as they are ever to go
hand in hand together: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that fearefull curse which
our blessed Saviour sometimes
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:47894:220"/>
pronounced upon the <hi>barraine
Fig-tree,</hi> must be their censure.
And now in this day of my
<hi>Change,</hi> as in this confidence
I have ever lived, so my trust is
that in the same I shall dye:
<q>That in the Resurrection of
my Saviour Christ Ies<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s is my
hope: and in his Ascension is
my glory.</q> For, <hi>I beleeve that
my Redeemer liveth, and that
with these eyes I shall see him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I rendred an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of my faith; the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
whereof as I have ever
professed in my life: so I hope
with all Christian constancy to
continue the profession thereof
even unto death. So as, though
the assaults or temptations of
the Devill, my spirituall enemy,
whose practise hath beene ever
by cruelty or subtilty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
man of his hope of glory,
should with all fury assaile me,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:47894:220"/>
yet shall they never have
power to prevaile against mee;
for the Lord, who is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
will in mercy draw
neare mee, and in that dying
conflict give mee the victory.
This then shall be my clozing

and not live.</hi> True it is, when
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:47894:221"/>
the <hi>outward house</hi> is orderly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
the <hi>inward house</hi> cannot
chuse but bee better prepared.
To remove then from mee the
cares of this present world,
that I may take a more willing
adeiu of the world before I
leave it, and so addresse my
cares for a better world by wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
my desires from it: for
live hee cannot in the Land of
the living, who prepares not
himselfe for it before his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
my mind and will is,
that my worldly substance bee
disposed of in manner and
forme following.</p>
               <p>First, then after this vessell
of Earth, this poore shell of
corruption shall bee to earth
committed, and as neare to the
bones of mine Ancestors as the
conveniencie of the place may
permiti, nterred: and that my
Funerall expences shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged;
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:47894:221"/>
in the performance of
which Christian duty I approve
of decency, but in no case
too much solemnity; (which
has too often drowned the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of mortality in the
lees of sensuality) after this, I
say, my will is, that this small
estate wherewith God hath
blessed mee, shall be divided in
equall parts or portions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
my Children: that, as
they are all equally mine, so
they may bee equall sharers in
mine: Of whom I will not
prophesie that they will <hi>dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate</hi>
or seatter all I leave them:
I have better hopes treasured
in them. For the portions I
leave them, though small yet
competent, if they be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
and more then I could
wish them, if otherwise affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
A very little will suffice
nature; enough I leave them,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:47894:222"/>
if well employed: too much
if abused. May Gods blessing
and mine be ever with them in
their improvement of it. And
that I may crowne their hopes,
and my houres with one bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
more: Blessed Spirit, by
which every Passenger is safely
conducted from this vale of
misery, to the Kingdome of
glory, as these little ones are
mine by <hi>generation,</hi> so may they
be thine by <hi>regeneration,</hi> to
whose gracious protection
both now and ever I commit
them.</p>
               <p>Now I nominate and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
for Surpervisors of this
my last Will and Testament, my
deare friends, <hi>Agapetus &amp; Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licrines,</hi>
if they shall bee then
living at my death: whom I
heartily desire, for the loue they
beare to goodnesse; nay, for
the love they bear to him, who
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:47894:222"/>
is the fountaine of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and as I repose much trust

               <p>And now mee thinkes,<note place="margin">Hieron.</note> all
my worldly cares are drawne
neare unto their period. Seeing
then I am sailing towards mine
Harbour; Let mee strike An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor:
that taking the wings of
the Morning, I may fly to the
bosome of my dear Redeemer.
Co forth then my Soule, what
fearest thou? goe forth, why
tremblest thou? Thou hast had
enough of <hi>Idumaea;</hi> for what
foundst thou there but anguish?
Now then turne thy face to the
<hi>Wall,</hi> and thinke of the <hi>Land</hi>
of <hi>Promise.</hi> Thou hast but
now a little time left thee: the
remainder whereof is justly
exacted by him that made thee.
Sighes, sobs, prayers, and teares
are all the treasures that are left
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:47894:223"/>
thee: and precious treasures
shall these be to thee, if presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>faith</hi> to the Throne of
mercy. The Enemy can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
prevaile, where Christian
<hi>feare</hi> and constant <hi>hope</hi> possesse
the Soule. Let thy <hi>Desire</hi> then be
<hi>planted,</hi> where thy <hi>treasure</hi> is
placed; and as one ravished
with a spirituall fervour,<note place="margin">Hieron.</note> cry
out and spare not with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Father: <q>Should my
Mother pull her haire, teare
her Clothes, lay forth
those Brests which nursed
mee, and in this sort hang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
me; should my Father lye
in the way to stoppe me, my
Wife and Children weepe
about mee; I would throw
off my Mother, neglect my
Father, contemne the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of my Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to meet my Saviour,
Christ Iesus.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="437" facs="tcp:47894:223"/>And lesse then this, O my
soule, thou canst not doe;
if thou callest to mind what
thou leavest; to whom thou
goest; and what thou hast
in exchange for that thou
loosest. For what leavest thou
here, but a world of misery?
To whom goest thou, but to a
God of mercy. And what hast
thou in exchange but immortal
glory, for a vile, fraile, and
corruptible body? whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thou hadst here, was
got with paine, kept with
feare, and lost with griefe:
Whereas now thou art to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
eternall riches without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring;
and to enjoy them
without feare of losing. <hi>My
heart</hi> then <hi>is ready,</hi> my <hi>heart is
ready;</hi> too long have I sojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
here, in making me a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to my heavenly Country
It is high time for mee then to
