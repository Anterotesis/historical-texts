            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>You ſhall alſo therein perceiue how that in thinges which ſeeme moſt doubtfull and wholly deſperate; and when in outward appearance wee are as it were at the poynt of death and vtter deſtruction, our Lord hath vſed, and is alwayes ready to put foorth his hand to defend and<note place="margin">Exod. 2.</note> preſerue thoſe that are his.

And that <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> ſold, by his breathren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mourned for by his father for dead, &amp; caſt into a miſerable Priſon, ſhould ſaue his Father and Breathren from moſt great Famine, &amp; place them in the beſt part of <hi>Egipt?</hi> Who<note place="margin">Ionas. 2.</note> would haue thought that <hi>Jonas,</hi> caſt into the Sea, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; yea &amp; as it were buried in the belly of the Whale, ſhould haue been the ſauer of the great citie of <hi>Niniue,</hi> and a figure of the Meſsias?

            <p>You ſhall likewiſe know by this Diſcourſe, the great virtue, force, &amp; efficacie of Prayer made in Fayth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we obtaine of God much more good, then we dare aſke or demande at his hands. What could the Mother of <hi>Moſes</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:21341:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deſire more, when her Child was put into the Water, but<note place="margin">Exod. 2.</note> onely that God would preſerue it from death? But by her Praier ſhe obtained much more; for he being found by <hi>Pharaos</hi> Daughter, he was not onely deliuered out of danger, and committed to his owne Mother to be nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but waxing great, he was adopted for the Sonne of the Kings daughter. What could the people of God (cruelly<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> afflicted by the <hi>Egiptians)</hi> deſire more, but that God haue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toucht the heart of <hi>Pharao,</hi> he ſhould permit and ſuffer them to depart out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> to ſerue him in the land of their Fathers? But he did more for them; for, deliuering them out of the miſerable ſeruitude &amp; tirannie of <hi>Pharao,</hi> he inriched them with the ſpoyles and riches of the <hi>Egip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> whom afterward he drowned and vtterly ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Sea; thereby declaring his Iuſtice in puniſhing of thoſe that afflict his people. What could <hi>lacob</hi> likewiſe<note place="margin">Gen. 33.</note> when he left the houſe of <hi>Laban</hi> his Father in law, haue deſired more, when he prayed vnto God to deliuer him from the feare which he had of his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> but that he might paſſe freely &amp; ſafely on his way? but God not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly graunted him that, but much more: for when his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther met him, he not onely receiued and entertained him courteouſly, but offered to beare him company on the way. And what could <hi>Joſeph</hi> (being a Priſoner) more deſire<note place="margin">Gen. 41.</note> of God, but onely his enlargement and deliuerance from thence? which at laſt he obtained, and much more; for he was made Lieutenant and Gouernour of all <hi>Egipt.</hi> But I for my part, haue receiued more grace and fauour, then all they; for the billowes of the tempeſtes of the ſoueraigne God, had not onely ſubiected my life to a miſerable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall captiuitie, wherein not onely the <hi>Pope</hi> and his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, determined to deſtroy me, and to make me vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto the world during the reſt of my dayes: but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, enimie to my Soule, had made and ſeduced me to become one of the moſt filthy Apoſtates that euer was heard of: and for that cauſe my heart was continually vexed with moſt cruell troubles: mine owne corruption
<pb facs="tcp:21341:4"/>
made warre againſt me, and my torments put me in feare and doubt, that God had wholly reiected and barred me out of the Kingdome of Heauen. I found my ſelfe to be in continuall feare (for want of Fayth &amp; repentance,) think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that abuſiue of troubles, that by incredulitie, I ſhould vtterly be cut off from the loue and fauour of God. Yet I was not deſtitute of the Spirit of Prayer: for in my greateſt troubles and aflictions, lifting vp mine eyes vnto Heauen, I often times ſayd, Hath the Lord caſt me off for euer? Is his louing kindneſſe withdrawne for euermore? Hath the moſt mercifull God forgotten to be pittifull; hath he (by reaſon of his anger) ſhut vp his compaſsion? And often times ſighing and ſpeaking vnto my ſoule, I ſaid: Oh my ſoule! Why art thou abaſhed, &amp; why doeſt thou tremble within me? Repoſe thy truſt in God, and hope in him, he ſhall yet be prayſed and magnified in thee, when with a benigne countenance onely, he eaſeth thy torment. The Father of mercie, the God of all conſolation, did not reiect my prayer: he receiued my requeſt, and heard me in Heauen: He brake my bandes, and of a Captiue, ſet me free and at libertie: He dealt not with me as I deſerued, nor rewarded me according to my iniquities: For that as farre as the Heauens are diſtant from the Earth, ſo much hath his mercie been aboundant vnto me. With the ſame affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that a Father is mooued towardes his Child, with the ſame hath the Lord been mooued towardes me. Let my Soule bleſſe him, and all the partes and members of my body prayſe his holy name: He hath ſaued me out of the Pitte, and withdrawne my life from death: Hee hath pardoned all my Iniquities, and healed my Inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">

               </gap> friendes, I haue imboldned my ſelfe to ſalute you, and to giue you to vnderſtand many thinges which concerne the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory of God, the edification of his Church, and the ſaluation of my ſoule.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21341:6"/>
Truely, if it were not for the aſſurance that I haue of your pietie towards God, and Chriſtian charitie towards your Neighbours, I durſt not haue been ſo bold, as I am at this preſent, to certifie you of the miſerable eſtate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into my ſinnes haue brought mee; but aſſuring my ſelfe, that you will be imitators of the Mercie of God, and of the Grace of his Sonne, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the death of a Sinner, but that he ſhould conuert and be ſaued; it maketh me doe that vnto you, which the diſeaſed perſon doth vnto the Phiſition; which is, to diſcouer the Griefes of my heart, and the Wounds of my ſoule.</p>
            <p>Beloued breathren, in mee you ſee and behold the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne and ſpectacle of the iuſt Iudgement of God vpon man, who hauing acknowledged Ieſus Chriſt for my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, trode his Word vnder my feete, and made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his holy Ordinaunces; and therefore God as a iuſt Iudge, ſet me vpon the ſcaffold of his Wrath and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation; becauſe I would ſeeme to be Wiſe in my ſelfe, forgetting the indignitie and miſerie of my eſtate, I haue grieued the holy Ghoſt, which had regiſtred mee in the Cathalogue of the bleſſed; certainely I had been moſt happie, if at the iſſuing foorth of my Mothers Wombe, I had been buried, without euer ſeeing the light of this World, ſeeing that by my ſinnes, I haue ſubiected my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine dayes, vnto ſo many outrages and griefes: For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is there any man that hath receiued more benefites at the holy and liberall handes of God our Father, then I? Who from my youth vpwardes, was brought vp and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the moſt excellent Schooles that are in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; hauing had a Father, that ſpared no thing to bring me vp in Learning, Vertue, and Pietie, and that ſhewed me an example of Conſtancie and Fidelitie; hauing ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death for profeſsing the name of the Lord. But, as if God had done me wrong, to continue his graces and great mercies vnto me, I became the moſt filthy &amp; beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:21341:6"/>
Apoſtate that euer was in the World; I ſay the moſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy: for, conſider I pray you, the Apoſtacies which were in times paſt in the auncient Church, ſpecially during the tenne great Perſecutions from <hi>Nero</hi> to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great; and the eleuenth, which was vnder <hi>Iuhan</hi> that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Apoſtate, which cauſed ſo many Reuoltes in the Church, and when ſo many great perſons made ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke of the Fayth.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo the Apoſtacies that haue been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in our dayes, and you ſhall ſee, if you can ſinde the like to mine? That a Seruant of God, nouriſhed and brought vp at the feete of true Doctors, the Sonne of a Martire, one that preached the Ghoſpell 17. or 18. yeares, and that with edification in the time of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, when the Swordes of Tirantes made all publike places in the <hi>Netherlandes</hi> redde with humaine blood, I reputed my ſelfe not onely happy to beleeue and anounce Ieſus Chriſt; but with the loſſe of my goodes to indure all ſortes of oprobyes and ſlaunders for his name; in, and by whom I beleeued and ſpake. And yet neuertheleſſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, with ſo great ſcandale, hauing made my ſelfe a Diſciple of Antechriſt, Who would not be abaſhed, and abhorre ſuch an offence?</p>
            <p>And therefore it is, that I openly cry out and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that my Sinne is not like vnto other mens ſinnes; for if any man ſinneth by ignoraunce or infirmitie, hee ſhall finde a Mediatour which will pray for him, and it ſhall be pardoned: but who ſhall be my Mediatour? I haue offended God and all his Seruantes; I haue ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized his people, and haue made my ſelfe vnworthy of the commiſeration of honeſt men: Therefore the dolors of death eternall haue compaſſed me about, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtes of my iniquitie haue abaſhed me; for the Arrowes of Almightie God haue wounded my ſoule in ſuch maner, that no part of my Fleſh, nor any of my Vaines are whole, ſo much my miſchiefe increaſeth: my Heart panteth and
<pb facs="tcp:21341:7"/>
beateth in my breaſt with griefe, my Bones are weakened by reaſon of the great diſtreſſe, which I indure by meanes of my wicked action.</p>
            <p>Behold how thoſe that abandonate them-ſelues vnto Vanities, are forſaken of God, and of their owne grauitie. It is a horrible thing to fall into the handes of the liuing God, and to abiure his Trueth, once knowne.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I doe? ſhall I deſpaire? Muſt I at my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of this life, attend and expect the reward of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>ludas,</hi> and ſay with thoſe miſerable Apoſtates; My Sinnes are greater then the Mercie of God? No, I will not deſpaire; for I know, the eternall God is good; that his Mercie ſurmounteth all the Heauens, that he deſireth not the death of a Sinner but rather that he ſhould repent and be ſaued; and that inceſſantly he pardoneth and forgiueth his elect.</p>
            <p>He pittieth true repentant ſinners, be they neuer ſo miſerable and great offenders: and where Sinne aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, his Grace ſuper-aboundeth.</p>
            <p>I haue met with my Mediatour the Sonne of God, my ſoueraine Sacrificator, who can and will haue compaſsion of my infirmities: but more then that, his voyce and his example ſommon, induce; yea and lead me to approch<note place="margin">Math 11 28.</note> neere vnto him. Come vnto mee (ſayth hee) all you that are heauie laden and wearie, and I will refreſh you. And<note place="margin">Eſa. 1. 18.</note> againe, Come now (ſaith the Eternall,) if your Sinnes were as redde as Scarlet, I will make them as white as Snow: and if they were as redde as Vermilion, I will make them white like Wooll.</p>
            <p>When a man of credite ſpeaketh, wee beleeue him: how much more then ought we to beleeue the mouth of him that can not lie? It is hee that ſanctifieth my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, to the ende that they ſhould not bee the entry vnto eternall paine.</p>
            <p>I haue likewiſe ſet before mine eyes, an infinite number of examples of his pietie towardes Sinners. The poore
<pb facs="tcp:21341:7"/>
Publican caſting downe his eyes to the ground, crauing<note place="margin">Ioh 12. 3.</note> mercie of Ieſus Chriſt, returned home iuſtified. The ſinfull woman waſhed our Sauiours feete with her teares; and hauing wipt them with her haire, obtayned pardon of her finnes. The poore Theefe being hanged vpon the Croſſe, deſiring to be ſaued, and calling vpon Ieſus Chriſt, aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Croſſe into Paradiſe. S. <hi>Peter</hi> hauing three<note place="margin">Luk. 22.</note> times denied his good Maiſter, after he had bewayled his ſinnes with humilitie and repentance, loſt not the grace of an Apoſtle, but was reeſtabliſhed in his eſtate and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I call to minde great and inorare ſinnes, cruelties, and wicked Apoſtaſies committed againſt God, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets by King <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> who neuer the leſſe being Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in <hi>Babilon,</hi> and finding his Conſcience to be much preſſed with the feeling of his wickednes, after he had confeſſed his faultes vnto God, he was receiued into mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. <hi>Jonas</hi> flying away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the face of God &amp; from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in <hi>Tarſis,</hi> becauſe he would not follow his vocation, was caſt into the Sea; and after being miraculouſly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of the Whales belly, went to <hi>Ninine</hi> to declare his Commiſsion.</p>
            <p>All theſe examples haue made me know, that God is exceeding good to thoſe that ſeeke him; who pardoneth all our infirmities: hee is ſo good, that hee will neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs according to our ſinnes, for he is prompt to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and ſlow to Anger; and hee is the perfection of all goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>Vp then my ſoule, and prayſe God: and thou Sathan my aduerſarie, preſent no more vnto mee the inormitie of my apoſtacie, thinking to aſtoniſh my conſcience, for the mercifull God of my continuall complaintes, hath heard my voyce, he hath receaued my requeſt, and hath graunted me more then I aſked him: All my enemies ſhall be aſhamed and confounded, neither could Sathan be<note place="margin">Luk. 15.</note> both my Iudge and my Accuſer, for it was God whom I
<pb facs="tcp:21341:8"/>
had offended, who onely is my Iudge: If therefore he is my Iudge, who dares take vpon him to condeme me? If he be with me, who can be againſt me? and if my Iudge will be my Aduocate and my Interceſſor, why ſhould I feare the power and force of the Diuell, &amp; Tirants, although they ſought to aſſayle me?</p>
            <p>And therefore being in this ſortreſolued, I determine to doe two thinges: The one following the example of<note place="margin">Luk. 15.</note> the Prodigall Childe, to returne to my Countrie, and my Fathers houſe againe, I know he is mercifull, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by my ſinnes I haue loſt his fauour, yet he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaue nor looſe his bountie. I will willingly forſake the company and fellowſhip of thoſe filthy Beaſtes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with whom I haue ſo long time conuerſed, which is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Romane</hi> Antechriſt the Sonne of perdition, that lifteth and oppoſeth himſelfe againſt the Kingdome of the ſonne of God; and that vnder a falſe title of Pietie, at this day tiraniſeth ouer all the world, deſiring to ſatisfie his couetous humour with crueltie and ambition. I will willingly abandon that ſorrowfull habitation, ſo odious and infamous, and will put on the Roabe of Humilitie, to preſent my Father with a true and ſinceere contrition and confeſſion of my faultes and offences. My contrition ſhall be a diſliking and deteſtation of my ſinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, a trouble of Conſcience, apprehending and feeling in my Soule, the wrath and anger of God, which I haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred and deſerued by my offences, which would cauſe me to deſpaire, if I were not ſtrengthned an other way; which is by a true and liuely faith in the mercie of God; by the which after I haue truly &amp; duely confeſſed my ſinnes, I depoſe my ſelfe by faith to mount vp vnto the throane of grace, to obtaine one drop of the Blood of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I haue ſayd within my ſelfe, I will ſeeke the face of God: But where ſhall I find it, but there where his Word is faythfully preached, and the Sacramentes truely
<pb facs="tcp:21341:8"/>
adminiſtred? This Church ſo well marked, was once my Mother; ſhe conceaued and brought me foorth to Chriſt my Sauiour: ſhe had giuen me many faire &amp; great prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues; for ſhe had committed vnto me the keeping of her Spouſes Flocke; but I was one of thoſe fooliſh Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes, (of whom the Prophet <hi>Ezecheel</hi> in his 13. Chapter of his Reuelations ſpeaketh,) which follow their owne fantaſies, and haue no care to execute their Offices and Vocations; and therefore God, the iuſt Iudge, was angrie with me; he diſpoyled me of his fauours, which were the ſinguler giftes &amp; graces wherwith he had indowed me in my youth; and hath made me eate with Beaſtes, as he did the Prodigall Child: Yet I can not forget the loue which once ſhe bore me; and therefore I haue aproched vnto her againe, hoping that ſhe will be a follower of the bountie of God to wardes me aſking two things of her: The one, that ſhe will vouchſafe to pray vnto God for me; for as iſſue of all enterpriſes dependeth vpon the fauour of God, (without the which we can doe nothing,) it is reaſon and very fitte to begin ſo holy a worke, with the inuocation of his holy name: The other, that in this great perturbation of Spirit whereunto my intemperaunce hath brought me, ſhe will vouchſafe to giue me counſell and aduiſe, for that from hence-foorth I will no more be wiſe in mine owne conceite, but onely in God; in whom conſiſteth the ſpring of Life and Wiſedome.</p>
            <p>I was then in an obſcure and blacke Priſon, wherein Antechriſt of <hi>Rome</hi> had cauſed me to be caſt without any hope euer to come out againe. My Accuſations were; That beeing Seruant to the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Cleaue,</hi> I had been a Fauteur &amp; Mediator for the Churches which our Lord had aſſembled in the Dukedomes of <hi>Inlyers, Cleaue,</hi> and <hi>Bergh,</hi> hindring diuers ſiniſter enterpriſes pretended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. The rigor which they vſed againſt me was great, and my life was in danger, if the hatred of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall perſons, which were the cauſe of my miſchief,
<pb facs="tcp:21341:9"/>
had had as much place and force, as the benignitie and prudence of the noble Princeſſe of <hi>Lorraine</hi> had power to defend and preſerue me from their cruelties.</p>
            <p>Being in my ſorrowfull Priſon, abandoned of all the World, when it ſeemed that I was at the poynt of death; and that Heauen and Earth had conſpired togeather, and agreed to worke my ouerthrow and deſtruction, I deſired my God, to let me know the cauſe of his wrath and anger conceaued againſt me; who ſufficiently made me vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by his holy Spirit, that my apoſtacie was the only cauſe thereof. I lamented my euill; I fainted vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of my anguiſh; I waſhed my Bedde with teares, and watered my Couch with weeping; and without longer delay, I made a Vow agreeable and pleaſing vnto God: which was, that if he would vouchſafe to deliuer me out of Priſon, and to reſtore me to my friendes againe, that in the firſt reformed Church, according to the word of God, which I ſhould come vnto, I would certifie vnto it my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, &amp; my deſire; which was, to cry God mercie, &amp; to extirpe the Scandale proceeded of my Apoſtacie, by the way of humilitie &amp; repentance. The Lord which doth all things iuſtly, heard my Prayer, he receaued my requeſt, he graunted my deſire, he brake my bands, and of a Priſoner, made me free. It is reaſon therefore that I performe my Vowes: I haue not done like <hi>Ionas,</hi> who in ſtead of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Niniue</hi> the great Citie, tooke the way to <hi>Tarſis:</hi> nor<note place="margin">Luk. 19:</note> like the wife of <hi>Lot,</hi> who looking backe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe went out of <hi>Sodoma &amp; Gomora,</hi> was turned into a Piller of Salt. Our Lord alſo ſaith, That hee which putteth his hand to the Plough, &amp; looketh backe, is not good for the kingome of heauen: therfore I eſteemed the things of this world, hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and a hinderaunce vnto the couers of my vacation: &amp; taking my way ſtraight to this Church which had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred me in Chriſt, with teares in my eyes, and griefe of heart, not ſo much with the feeling of my temporall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, as for that I haue offended: I aſked two things of
<pb facs="tcp:21341:9"/>
her; the one, if that the way of Repentance ſhould yet be open vnto me? and the other, what penaunce I deſerued, or ſhould ſubmit my ſelfe vnto, to deface the euill which I had committed? Shee made me anſwere; that God neuer ſhutteth the Gate of his Church againſt any man, truely repenting: and hauing conſidered my teares and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes, and the effectes of my contrition, ſhe did chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably comfort and inſtruct me.</p>
            <p>I am with ioy and gladneſſe of ſpirit come out of <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> Mother of Confuſion, which had lifted me vp in pride againſt God and his Church; which foſtered in my foule, not onely a perpetuall dolour and anguiſh, but an executioner which neuer let me reſt in peace night nor day. For the which, infinitely I thanke my God, that in my old age, and before I goe downe into the Sepulchre, after hee had fatherly puniſhed mee with ſo long and horrible Impriſonment; he hath this day reſtored me to my Mother his Church, to be a Temple and Habitation of his Spirit: in the vertue whereof, I beſeech him to bleſſe and ſanctifie my ſteppes to his glorie, and to make me capiable to be, and continue his moſt humble and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſeruant.</p>
            <p>Oh happie Priſon, which hath deliuered my ſoule from deſtruction! and taking me by the hand, to lead and conduct me by the pathes of Iuſtice, to the Peace of the Elect: Who would not admire the great effectes of the prouidence of God, who in moſt deſperate thinges, can withdraw the ſhadow of darkneſſe, to illuminate and direct our vncertaine ſteppes, to follow his will? Behold how it happeneth many times, that that which we thinke would be moſt hurtfull vnto vs, turneth vnto our great profit.</p>
            <p>For the Priſon, out of the which I am deliuered, without any blot of mine honour, hath done that in me, which the Priſon in <hi>Babilon</hi> ſometimes wrought in King <hi>Manaſſes:</hi> So that I will not ceaſe euery day to giue thankes vnto our
<pb facs="tcp:21341:10"/>
good God, who euen in the multitude and greateſt force of my afflictions, did alwayes ſupport and vpholde my Soule in ſuch libertie, that it ſeemeth that how ſtrong and great ſoeuer my troubles were, they had power onely to ouercome and maſter my particular Paſsions, and to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate my Spirit to Heauen; to make me ſo much the more capiable to obtaine of God the aſſuraunce of his mercie, by diſpoyling me of the tranſitorie &amp; corruptible thinges of this world, to the end to eleuate and ſtirre mee vp to thinges glorious and eternall. For as much trouble and diſquietneſſe as my impriſonment procured vnto my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſo much and more force and reſolution it added vnto my ſoule. It is true that Pietie is weakened, by too great Felicitie: but the Croſſe and Perſecution accompanied with a good Conſcience, maketh it become an aſſured Bulwarke againſt all the effortes and forces of the Diuell. And in trueth we ſee, that thoſe whom God puniſheth grieuouſly in this world, for the moſt part are they, whom he inſtructeth moſt fauourably; in ſuch maner, that to ſpeake properly, the euils which God ſent me, and which I indured patiently, were no euils vnto me, but ſharpned and ſtirred vp my ſpirit to ſoueraigne good.</p>
            <p>Certainely that which <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth, is very true; That thoſe that are in griefes and anguiſhes, haue the functions and faculties of the Soule more excellent, then in time of proſperitie. But that which maketh me moſt to woonder, is, that as much as my afflictions ſeparated me from the Houſe of God, and the companie of the Faithfull; ſo much it ſeemeth, that they augmented and increaſed the former affection which I had, to reunite my ſelfe thereunto, and to leaue <hi>Papiſtrie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A good man, can not ſhunne aduerſities; but hee may well ſurmount and vanquiſh them: and Although he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto men, to be wholly abandoned and reiected; ſo it is, that in the middle of his troubles, he alwayes enioyeth a perfect felicitie, the which hath ſworne to be ſo loyall
<pb facs="tcp:21341:10"/>
vnto him, that whatſoeuer hapneth vnto him, ſhee is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with him, ſhee is alwayes within him, and maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his Soule in ſuch an eſtate, that in what condition ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhee findeth her ſelfe to be, ſhee is alwayes like vnto her ſelfe, being ſo highly eleuated aboue the accidentes of humaine thinges, that ſhee can not receiue any hurt or diſgrace.</p>
            <p>Seing then that the word of God teacheth vs, that hee which hath publikely offended the Church, ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and acknowledge his fault openly; and for that the Order of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline in the Church of God practiſeth the ſame: I haue deſired that my returne into the Houſe of God, ſhould be publikely made, and in the middle of this notable congregation of the Children of God, in this Towne of <hi>Wezel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> and that not onely becauſe of the knowledge which I haue of ſo many Prerogatiues which our Lord hath giuen it, as being the auncient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of poore afflicted Chriſtians; hauing purged it from the darkeneſſe of errours &amp; ignorances of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Wolfe, for the ſpace of 70. yeares and more; and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly defended and preſerued it from a thouſand and a thouſand outrages, ambuſcadoes, and ſiniſter enterpriſes of Tirantes; whereof I am partly an eye-witneſſe. And thus much more, for that I know that at this preſent, and in this notable companie, there are yet many of you that know, that the ſubiect and ground of the anger of thoſe that perſecuted mee, proceedeth from this; that duering the time of my continuance in the ſeruice of the noble Houſe of <hi>Cleaue,</hi> I did charitably ſuccour the afflicted Churches, which Antechriſt and his ſupporters ſought and inforced them ſelues to ruinate and ouerthrow. Knowing then, that with the cauſe of my afflictions, the cauſe of fauouring of your Churches (and particularly of that which our Lord hath aſſembled in this Towne,) was ioyned: I aſſure my ſelfe, that you will haue compaſsion of the griefes which I feele at my heart, for hauing offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:21341:11"/>
God, that in reſpect of me, you will doe as God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently doth; who hauing opened the eyes of my vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, hath taken my ſinnes and caſt them behind his backe: hee hath throwne them into the deepe Sea, that he might not lay them any more to my charge: whereof not onely the holy Ghoſt beareth me witneſſe, but by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie miniſterie which it hath pleaſed him to eſtabliſh in his Church, giueth me euident and manifeſt aſſurances, beſeeching you to haue pittie on mee; and caſting from before your eyes the ſcandale which I haue committed: reſtore me to that alacritie of ſpirite which in times paſt my heart enioyed, when holding each other by the hands, we aſcended with ioy to the Mountaine of the Lord, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the God of <hi>lacob,</hi> with Songes and Thankes-giuing, becauſe he had made vs members of his Sonne Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; whereby in this temporall life you ſhall do that which God doth in the ſpirituall life, in comforting the afflicted, and ſuch as are truely ſtricken with vnfeigned ſorrow &amp; remorſe of their ſinnes: for as by his goodneſſe and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie he relieueth and ſtrengthneth them; ſo he that loueth clemencie and mercie, maketh himſelfe worthy and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piable both of the Joue of God, and the world.</p>
            <p>Let your hearts then be mooued with my ſigthes, &amp; by bereauing your ſelues of the remembrance of my faultes; therein ſhew your ſelues as ſtrong as my wickedneſſe is great: my bruſed bones ſhall reioyce, my tongue ſhall openly ſing the prayſe of the Lord; my cloſed lippes ſhall open againe, highly to thunder foorth his Iuſtice: I will teach his wayes to thoſe that tranſgreſſe, to the end that ſuch as haue done, as I haue done againſt the Lord, may willingly conuert.</p>
            <p>I am aſſured that you will graunt my requeſt, for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue your bowels to be mooued and proane to mercie; your countenaunces are witneſſes vnto me of your chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic; and your teares, of the griefe you haue in your hearts.

And will not you reioyce with the holy Angels, for the honour which God hath done vnto me, this day to haue receiued me into his Church; from the which Sathan, enimie to Iuſtice and truth, had ſeparated me, &amp; almoſt deſtroied me, if God had not bin merciful vnto me? But he hath loſt his prey, he hath ſpent his time in vaine, he remembred not that God is my Father, that his Chriſt is my Mediator; he knew not that the holy Ghoſt had regiſtred me in the booke of Life, and in the cathalogue of the Elect; whoſe fall is not eternall.</p>
            <p>Therefore that I may no more fall into thoſe ſnares and nettes, I haue withdrawne my ſelfe into the houſe of God, into the fort of the Lord, to be made his houſehold Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, and a member of his Sonne, willingly forſaking the raigne of the <hi>Pope;</hi> whoſe doctrine &amp; religion, to ſay truth, is no other thing but auncient paganiſme, mixed with Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſme, and couered with the cloake of Chriſtianitie; which treadeth vnder foete the knowledge of the ſoueraigne God, and the mercies of his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
            <p>For when men make the ſimple people beleeue, that the Sonne of God (in whom conſiſteth the wel-ſpring of life) hath not fully ſatisfied the Iuſtice of God his Father, but hath onely obtayned the firſt grace for vs; that is to ſay, the occaſion or cauſe of Merite; and that it reſteth now in vs to be carefull not to loſe the occaſion, to obtaine the reſt. Is it not a moſt impudent boldneſſe, to diſpoyle Ieſus Chriſt of his vertue, ſeeing the Scripture witneſſeth for

him; that all thoſe that beleeue in him, are iuſtified? And thoſe hel-houndes teach, that there proceedeth no other benefite vnto vs from him, but onely that hee hath made vs an ouerture and way to be iuſtified; contrarie to the<note place="margin">Iohn. 5. 12.

And theſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abuſed Papiſtes, not contenting themſelues therewith, bereaue God of a great part of his Prayſes, to transferre them vnto men.</p>
            <p>But tell me I pray you, What thing is more agreeable to the Chriſtian fayth, then to acknowledge and confeſſe our ſelues to be deſtitute of all vertue, to be clothed therewith by God: voyde of all goodneſſe, to be filled therewith by him: ſlaues to ſinne, to be deliuered by him: blind, to be illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by him: weake, to be ſuſtained by him: to bereaue our ſelues of all maner of glory, that he onely may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and we in him? Further, what is more proper vnto Faith, then to aſſure our ſelues that God is our benigne and louing Father; when Chriſt is acknowledged to be our Brother and Mediatour, then to expect all good and proſperitie from him, whoſe loue and fauour is ſo much ſhewed &amp; extended vnto vs, that he ſpared not his Sonne, but expoſed him vnto death for vs: then to reſt in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine aſſurance and hope of ſaluation, and of life eternall, when we know that Chriſt hath been giuen vs by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in whom ſuch treaſures are hidden? But theſe thinges are repugned by the Papiſtes, who ſay, that ſuch certaintie of aſſurance, cannot be without arrogancie &amp; preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But as we muſt not preſume of any thing to be in our ſelues; yet we muſt preſume of all thinges in God, for in trueth we are not for any other cauſe bereaued of all vaine glorie, but onely to the end that we ſhould be glorified in him. On the other ſide, behold and ſee with what affection

thoſe miſerable and ignorant perſons (I ſpeake ſpecially of Eccleſiaſticall perſons) are mooued and ledde: they eaſily permit both them ſelues and others, to be ignorant, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and careleſſe of the true Religion, which is taught vs by the holy Scriptures, and which ought to be reſolutely and firmely held among all men; and thinke that it is no great matter what Fayth euery man holdeth; nor whether he holdeth with God or Chriſt: ſo that with an inueloped or impoſed Fayth (as they tearme it) they ſubmit their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to the iudgement of the Church, and care not though the glory of God be poluted by euident Blaſphemies, ſo that no man ſpeaketh a word againſt the authoritie of our Mother the holy Church; that is, (according to their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,) the Sea of <hi>Rome:</hi> And therefore they fight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with ſuch rigour and boldneſſe for the Maſſe, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, Pilgrimage, and ſuch trifles, in ſuch maner that they denie, that true pietie can be obſerued, if all thoſe thinges be not beleeued and holden for infallible rules of our ſaluation; although they prooue nothing by the word of God: Wherefore I pray you, but onely becauſe their Belly is their God, the Kitchin their Religion, and the World their Paradiſe; which being taken away, they are not onely perſwaded that they can be Chriſtians, but which is more, no men: and although ſome of them liue delicately and in great aboundance, and others liue barely and votarely in pouertie gnawing of Cruſtes, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they liue all by one Pot: which without ſuch aydes, would not onely waxe cold, but wholly be frozen vp: And therefore he which among them, hath moſt care of his Belly, is the moſt zealous in their Fayth. To conclude, they haue all one ſelfe-ſame purpoſe and intent, either to maintaine their Kingdome, or their Bellies: and there is none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſheweth the leaſt apearance in the world of true zeale, and yet they ceaſe not to Slaunder, and with Fire, Sword, Water, and all other miſchiefes, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue and perſecute the doctrine of Trueth; either to

make it odious, or ſuſpected. But if we were permitted to ſpeake as boldly and as well as they, I am perfwaded that their hotneſſe, wherewith they boyle ſo terribly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, would be ſomewhat cooled: for to ſay trueth, that which the blind world at this day honoureth in thoſe idle Bellies, is onely a faigned vizard of Hipocrifie, which vnder the ſhadow of the Church, would hide their coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, to beare rule; ſeeking for the Church of God, in the beautifulneſſe of Houſes, and other exteriour orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes; thinking that the vnion of the Faythfull, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and is contayned in thoſe exteriour thinges, which are tranſitorie and corruptible; and not rather in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and trueth. Wherefore according to the word of God, we hold the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Seate of Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, which eleuateth and oppoſeth it ſelfe againſt that of the Sonne of God, which vnder a falſe title of Religion, at this day tiranniſeth ouer all the world, liuely repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> that Seate of Impietie whereof the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi>

            <p>But ſome men will obiect, and aſke mee; Did not you before your reuolt, know theſe great impieties and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, <hi>viz.</hi> that all the <hi>Romane</hi> ſect is but a King dome of Vntruethes, where the name of the eternall God is villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly prophaned, and the Lordes honour impudently giuen vnto Idoles?</p>

We muſt not then feare that by leauing the Church of Rome we diuorce our ſelues from the Church of God; for the communion of the Church was not ordained to that end, that it ſhould be a place for to draw vs to idolatry, impietie, ignorance of the true God, and other wickednes: but rather to retaine vs in the feare of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the truth. We do truly withdraw our ſelues from Poperie, and not from the Church; we ſhun and flie from idols, but not from the true Church; we will withdraw our ſelues from the tyrannie of the Pope, and not from the true Chriſtian common wealth; from the plague, and not from life: ready to reunite our ſelues with them, when Antichriſt, and the miſchiefe which he hath brought into it, ſhall be driuen away. In the meane time the houſe of God ſhall be my habitation, the Lord my portion, and his Sonne my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor: he will cauſe me to reſt in his parkes of aſſurance, he will reſtore my afflicted ſoule, and will preſerue me, if it pleaſeth him, from the bloudy hands of thoſe that ſeeke my vtter ruine and ouerthrow.</p>
            <p>All you that haue done as I haue done, and haue ſuffered your ſelues to runne headlong into miſchiefe, and which as yet liue in the kingdome of Antichriſt, with a contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and defiled conſcience, and vnquietneſſe of ſpirit (for I thinke and beleeue certainly that it is impoſſible for a man that hath knowne the impieties of Papiſtrie, where the bloud of Chriſt is bought and ſold, where his onely propitiatorie ſacrifice offered for our ſinnes, is eſteemed to be inſufficient to deface them; where the merits of men are equalized with the merits of Ieſus Chriſt: I beleeue that his ſoule is alwayes in paine, and that if he ſtayeth long there, in the end he will feele an executioner in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which will neuer ſuffer him to liue in peace night nor day:) I beſeech you moſt humbly in the name and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of Ieſus Chriſt, to abandon and leaue the ſynagogue of Sathan, and to reunite and ioyne your ſelues to this Church of God, vnited and conioyned in faith with the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apoſtles, in the word of God; which is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

It is into his lap that I yeeld my ſelfe, it is vnto the guard of his pietie that I haue recourſe: beſeeching him with all humilitie to receiue and admit me into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of his children, hauing determined to liue with them (by the power of my God) all the dayes of my life. I likewiſe deſire thoſe, on whom God hath powred his grace (hauing miraculouſly preſerued them in his Church, with conſtancy and perſeuerance, without hauing diuorced themſelues, or committed apoſtacie as I haue done:) to praiſe God with all their hearts, and continually to giue him thanks; for it is a moſt great miracle, which proceedeth not from their owne force and vertue, but from the holy and liberall hand of God our Father. Wherefore let them perſeuere in louing of God, and flie from finne and vices; and being of a good courage, the kingdome of Antichriſt will fall, and that of Ieſus Chriſt ſhall be eſtabliſhed: but before that hapneth, the diuell will enforce himſelfe more then euer he did, to make warre againſt the Church.</p>
            <p>Behold wherefore, if euer the children of God haue had need of prudence and wiſedome ſurely to direct their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine paths according to the word of God, it is now in this pitifull and ſorrowfull time, wherein Satan, enimy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all righteouſneſſe and godlineſſe, ſeemeth to haue ſo much authoritie euen ouer the elect, that if they were not miraculouſly aided and defended by the holy and liberall hand of God our Father, they ſhould not onely be vtterly caſt downe, but the earth would ſoone be reduced vnto the ſame ſtate that <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorra</hi> was in times paſt. Let prayer therefore, accompanied with true repentance, be our refuge vnto him, who will neuer forſake his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that will cauſe the aſſaults of Antichriſt to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, as he once drowned <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the ſea.</p>
            <p>To make an end, I beſeech you pray vnto God for me; and if any one among you haue any bookes, which in times paſt haue beene printed in my name, in diuerſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, bookes full of ieſts, lies, and falſe ſuppoſitions; I

            <p>If you aide me with your prayers vnto God, and if you be imitators of that great mercy which he hath ſhewed this day vnto me, which I beſeech you beare in minde; I will praiſe God for your pietie, and pray vnto him to continue his mercy towards you and yours, with long life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py dayes.</p>

               <p>Amongſt other ceremonies which the Papiſts do vſe, one is after conſecration of the bread, to bleſſe the ſame bread with the ſigne of the croſſe, and certaine words, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now I demand of them, if it be lawfull for the creature to
<pb facs="tcp:21341:18"/>
bleſſe the Creator? For benediction (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) is alwaies from the greater to the leſſer, <hi>The leſſer is bleſſed of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 7. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>the greater,</hi> as he affirmeth in expreſſe words. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. 7 For the father giues his bleſſing to the ſons, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> did to <hi>Iacob,</hi>

And it is commonly obſerued, that the father at the very point of death giues his bleſſing to his ſonnes: but the ſons (which are the leſſer) although they reuerence and honour the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do not yet giue him benediction. By which I conclude, that the Papiſt Prieſts (as inferiour) ought not to bleſſe Chriſt their ſuperiour: and if they do it in their Maſſe (as they terme it,) they bleſſe not Chriſt the Creator, but the bread the creature; and ſo they worſhip the creature, not the<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 25.</note> Creator: as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>They haue turned the truth of God into a lye,</hi> and worſhipped <hi>and ſerued the creature</hi> much more then the Creator.</p>
               <p>Neither ought we to beleeue that Chriſt is in their hands, when the words are pronounced by them. For many are conſecrating the Sacrament at once, and the body of Chriſt being but one in number, is not in many ſacrifices. For the body of Chriſt is natural, and keepeth a place, and is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in many places at one time.

               <p>If this be ſo, how dare the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſtes pronounce Chriſt himſelfe with his Diuinity and Humanity to deſcend into their hands? Or if the true body of Chriſt were in the ſacrifice, or the ſacrifice it ſelfe were the true body of Chriſt, how comes it that brute beaſts haue place there? For many times the flies goes vpon it, and other inſenſible creatures, as is daily ſeene and made manifeſt. And I my ſelfe often celebrating the Maſſe, haue ſeene flies vpon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament conſecrated, and made holy. Therefore we may not beleeue the true body of Chriſt to be there. Sometimes alſo by negligence of the Prieſts, part of the ſacrifices haue fallen vpon the ground, and bene troden vnder foote. And I am a faithfull and true eye witneſſe, that in the yeare of our Lord 1595 in a Church, which the Order of the moſt holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath at <hi>Turol,</hi> whereof I was chiefe, a certaine religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man (as they call him) celebrating the Sacrament, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the chalice vpſide downe, and the conſecrated wine (as they ſay) was part ſprinckled on the earth, and part ſhed vpon the Altar. And for theſe miſchaunces there are certaine rules ſet downe in the Miſſall of <hi>Rome,</hi> ordaining puniſhments to ſuch Prieſts by whom they happen or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall. Alſo in the Emperours Cathedrall Church of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1580. the theeues ſtole away a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Caſket, where the conſecrated Sacrifices were vſually kept, and threw the ſacrifices themſelues vpon the ground and vpon the Altar.

                  </gap>ſo tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the cheſt where the Sacrifices were kept, and they were throwne vp and downe. Therefore we may not beleeue the body of Chriſt to be there. For if (as they grant) the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud remaine vnder thoſe formes, ſo long as they continue vncorrupt; and if alſo laid vpon the ground (as is aforeſaid) they be vncorrupt, and ſo are troden vnder foote; then Chriſt muſt likewiſe be troden vnder foote, which is a moſt groſſe abſurdity. Sometimes alſo as I haue
<pb facs="tcp:21341:19"/>
ſeene) wormes haue bred in thoſe their ſacrifices. If then we hold their opinion, it muſt needs be that they beingendred out of the body of Chriſt, not out of the bread, becauſe there (as they ſay) the bread is not. <hi>Haec de Accidentibus.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if by miracle (as they hold) they continue and abide of themſelues, then they ought to be kept by miracle without any corruption; for there is no greater reaſon for the one, then for the other: nor of the body of Chriſt. Otherwiſe the body of Chriſt ſhould change the forme, and the very wormes ſhould partake of the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt, and from thence haue originall beginning; which is moſt falſe and vnworthy. Therefore it is to be ſaid, that nothing is there more then the bread it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, let there be two ſacrifices of bread put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſod, and made at one time, of one meale, fire, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and let the one be conſecrated and made holy, and the other vnconſecrated, and we ſhall ſee their corruption to be alike. It therefore followes, that the one hath no more in it then the other, neither is the body of Chriſt more in the conſecrated forme of bread then in that which is vnhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Sometimes alſo poyſon (as they ſay) is put into that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that ſo men may be bereaft of their liues; as it is read of the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the 7, and of Pope <hi>Victor</hi> the third, whereof the firſt loſſe his life by the Sacrament of bread poyſoned by his Conſeſſour: the laſt, by wine tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiate. Therefore we muſt conclude, that the body of Chriſt is not there, or otherwiſe the body of Chriſt to be the inſtrument of ſin, and the meanes of euill; which is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</p>
               <p>This corporall abſence, Chriſt hath manifeſtly ſhewne,<note place="margin">Ioh 12. 3 Iſa 66. 1.

               <p>The Diuell getteth much, and enlargeth his power and number by the idolatry of the Church of Rome, which he ſtill perſwades them to maintaine; and ſo they will, vntill it ſhall pleaſe God of his infinite goodneſſe and mercy to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their eyes, and make their vnderſtanding perfect, that they may truly ſee and reade the booke of God, for they yet liue in error and darkneſſe. But if they would looke vpon, and heare the booke which <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the high Prieſt found in the houſe of the Lord, they would do as that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly king <hi>Ioſiah</hi> did in the 18. yeare of his Monarchy: who as<note place="margin">2.

               <p>But the Pope takes vpon him to do this; for if any come vnto him, and deſire the reliques of ſome Saint, as of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molaus,</hi> or any other, he will anſwer that he hath none, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his bones are diſperſed: But he takes the bones per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

               <p>I obſerued the power, couetouſneſſe and tyranny of the ſame Pope: I beheld his exceeding pompe and pride, and with theſe things, and many more of this nature, my minde was much tormented.

I replied with the very words of Chriſt in defence thereof, but was compelled to hold my peace, and the Sonday following conſtrained to preach of him that they hold and terme accurſed, in the preſence of the Inquiſitor, and lay open his mind and pleaſure againſt Gods word, and to ſay that brotherly correction had no part or place in ſuch matters, as were contained in the Edict.

Againe, <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhall eate of this bread,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo by this it followes, that the Pope doth falſly intrude himſelfe to be the head of the Church, as is proued by this reaſon. The Primitiue Church, and that which flouriſhed for many yeares, knew no other head but Chriſt, nor had any vniuerſall Biſhop. But the Primitiue Church (euen according to the opinion of the Papiſts) was the true Church: Therefore the true Church ought to knowe or acknowledge no head but Chriſt, nor any vniuerſall Biſhop. It is alſo thus proued by authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhop of Rome wrote againſt <hi>Iohn</hi> Patriarch of Conſtantinople, ſaying: He that ſhall name himſelfe the vniuerſall Biſhop, may be called the forerunner of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.

               </p>
               <p>Chriſt had not where to lay his head, and will not one Pallace ſuffice the Biſhop of Rome? Chriſt refuſed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Regall dignity, being offered, and will not one Crowne content the Biſhop of Rome? Is it not enough that he poſſeſſeth Italy, vnleſſe with his triple Crowne he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the world?

So he thought himſelfe both King and Emperour: in ſo much as when the Iubilee was firſt granted, he ſhewed himſelfe openly the firſt day to the people, attired in his Pontificall veſtments; and the day following in his armor, and coate of male; and in the preſence of all the people with a loude voyce he commanded himſelfe to be proclaimed Caeſar.

               <p>They ground their falſe opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon the power of Chriſt, which power they pretend to haue as his Vicars: for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>All power is giuen vnto me, both in heauen and in earth:</hi>

               <p>But I demand this of theſe Antichriſts; that if they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Chriſt in this, why they do not follow him in humility? For although Chriſt had the power of rule and command, yet he in reſpect of his humility vſed them not, but rather affirmed his kingdome not to be of this world. But if the Pope do not imitate Chriſt, he is not his Miniſter, his Vicar, nor ſucceſſour.

               <p>AVricular confeſſion, (which the Papiſts call the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penitence) is very fooliſh. For this tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call confeſſion, is neither found in the law of nature, nor in the Law of God: but in the diuell and the Popes kitchin, to increaſe their fare, and delicacies. Neither did the Apoſtles<note place="margin">Cal. lib. <hi>3.</hi> Cap. <hi>4.</hi> Chryſoft.</note> teach the ſame, or Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt:</hi> as <hi>Caluin</hi> directly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.

Take heed thou reueale them not to any man, leſt he vpbraid thee; nether confeſſe them to thy fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, lest he publiſh them: but vnto him which is the Lord, who hath care and charge ouer thee.</hi> And againe, <hi>Tell thy faults on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto me priuately,</hi> (God here ſpeaketh,) <hi>that I may heale thy diſeaſe, and deliuer thee from ſorrow.</hi> Which words (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are repugnant and contrary to that great beaſt) are by the commandement of the Inquiſitors taken away and blotted out in the booke, called <hi>Index expurgatorius.</hi>

               <p>Many in the ſame manner of confeſſion haue reuealed
<pb facs="tcp:21341:25"/>
their ſins willingly to their Confeſſours, and the Confeſſour to the Iudges, and others.</p>
               <p>A certaine Biſhop of <hi>Girona</hi> in the time of <hi>Iames</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond king of <hi>Arragon</hi> (being his Confeſſour) reuealed his confeſſion to the Pope, and the king forthwith cut out his tongue. I my ſelfe can faithfully witneſſe, that being many times preſent at the talke &amp; communication of Confeſſours, they haue ſo fooliſhly behaued themſelues, and ſo openly in their talke reuealed the ſinnes that haue bene confeſt vnto them priuately by the penitents; that their names and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons haue eaſily become knowne to me, and perhaps to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, that haue heard the conference. And although there be diuers lawes ordained by the Pope to puniſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours thus offending; they yet commit this crime of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation, and (which is worſe) without a ſumme of money, the Penitents haue no grant of abſolution, as appeares in the bookes of Taxes, &amp;c. By which feare, many euen in the very act of confeſſion do conceale the truth, till they be compelled to confeſſe the ſame. I could ſpeake much of this matter, and point it out with my very fingar, but I will obſerue my oath, and with good aduice forbeare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it.</p>
               <p>In this matter of auricular confeſſion, the Confeſſours are wont to ſeduce, and auert the minds and affections of women from God, and to turne and conuert them to their owne luſts and filthineſſe. To proue this true, I preſent (as witneſſes) thoſe Confeſſours that haue bene puniſhed by iudgement of the Inquiſition, for ſuch abhorred and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable wickedneſſe; and ſuch as haue bene adiuged to puniſhment, and by ſentence of the Prelats and others, for being found guilty of the like miſdemeanours. For by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confeſſion, many monſtrous enormities ariſe, and are begotten.</p>
               <p>To auoid the imputation of tedioulneſſe, I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to make any longer diſcourſe, or diſcouery of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But with all my heart, with
<pb facs="tcp:21341:26"/>
all my minde, and with all my ſoule, I reuerence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe all things whatſoeuer our new reformed Church doth allow and embrace. And if any of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall vpbraide me that I haue falſely and perfidiouſly fallen<note place="margin">Amb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ca <hi>9.</hi> in Lucan, lib. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> from the ſame.; I anſwere with Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> In leauing it I forſake not Chriſt: Him onely no man ought to forſake, or change: to whom it is worthily ſaid, <hi>Lord to whom ſhall we flie?

We muſt ſhake off the duſt from our feete, leſt the drought of our barren vnfaithfulneſſe prepare and make the way ſandy, and hard to the true progreſſe and paſſage of our mindes and vnderſtandings. So if there be any Church (as he ſaith afterward) that renounceth the true faith, and doth not keepe and obſerue the foundation, and ground of the Apoſtles preaching, it is to be left and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it beget not the corruption of vntruth.</p>
               <p>Seeing then I haue found Chriſt onely, and his doctrine dwelling in the reformed Church, and haue ſeene that erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious teachers do deforme &amp; diſgrace the habitation of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> I haue deſeruedly left the one, that I may cleaue to &amp; embrace the other: &amp; that according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 10. &amp;. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ca. 5. 11. &amp; 10.</note> of the Apoſtle: ſaying, <hi>Do not company together with idolaters.</hi> And againe: <hi>Haue no fellowſhip with the vnfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workes of darkeneſſe, but euen reproue the rather.</hi> And what more vnfruitfull worke is there, then to embrace falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and hereſie?

               <p>Let it not be obiected vnto me by any aduerſary, that I haue denyed my baptiſme by which I am conſecrated to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: for I onely renonunce the vaine ceremonies vſed therein by the Biſhops, without authority of holy Scriptures.

               <p>I was borne at <hi>Caeſar Auguſta</hi> (which is the chiefeſt place of the kingdome of <hi>Arragon.)</hi> The day before the Calends of February, at two of the clocke in the afternoone, and in the yeare of our Lord 1567. of honorable parentage both by father and mother, as is well knowne in my countrey, and by Gods prouidence without any impediments or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of nature: I was baptized in the pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Giles,</hi> and confirmed by that excellent Prince <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and Arch-biſhop of <hi>Caeſar Auguſta.</hi> From my infancy with my parents great care and induſtry I was trained vp in the doctrine and religion of the Church of Rome, and with my yeares my knowledge thereof was much increaſed, and I did reuerence the ſame with ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ardency, as no other religion appeared vnto me ſo profitable or pleaſing.</p>
               <p>My father departed out of this life when I was but 16 yeares of age; but my mother as ſhe was carefull I ſhould be brought vp and inſtructed after the cuſtomes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church (for ſhe was full of zeale and deuotion,) ſo was I taught Muſicke and Military diſcipline, and other exerciſes of body, to my age beſt fitting and agreeable.

               <p>Hauing recouered her health and ſenſes againe, ſhe ſtill continued her meanes and deuices to change my mind, and vſed the ſame almoſt a whole yeare, ſo that at length ſhe compelled me to forſake the Monaſterie. Neuertheleſſe I promiſed ſuch as I left behind me, to returne againe with what ſpeed I might poſſibly. But I became ſomewhat for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of my promiſe, by reaſon that at that time, my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey preſented vnto me many obiects of pleaſure and dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation. For there were great triumphs and ſolemnities for the celebration of the mariage of <hi>Katherine</hi> daughter to king <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, with <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of Sabaud: with which my mind was much caried away and diſtracted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21341:29"/>
But my former purpoſe and my continued deuotion vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging me, I performed my promiſe, and with great ioy of thoſe Religious men that expected me, I returned backe to the Monaſtery, where I liued a while in much gladneſſe and contentment. But after a certaine time I left the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery againe, by ſome occaſion of buſineſſe, and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my firſt religious purpoſe, I be tooke my ſelfe to the Religion of the holy Trinity, and was receiued in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of <hi>Caeſar Auguſta</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1585. I made choice of this Order, for the ſingular deuotion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The Prelate and other religious men of the ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie for many cauſes were deſirous of my continuance amongſt them. I therefore began to apply my ſtudies to humanity, till at Valence by the diligence of my Tutor, and my owne great labour, I attained to ſome perfection of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke and Philoſophy. Afterwards I was ſent to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vniuerſitie of Illerd: where I wholly dedicated my ſelfe to Diuinitie, and hauing paſſed the ſeuerall termes and courſes of Diſputations, Exerciſes, and Lectures, I was commended to be one of the beſt in Theologie. For which I gaue God hearty thankes: for theſe beginnings broughtme in the end to know thoſe things which my ſoule euer thirſted after.</p>
               <p>Theſe foundations layd, I was ſo well eſteemed of, that I was called to the Miniſtery, contrary to their owne orders and inſtitutions, which forbid any man that dignity vnder the age of 33 yeares. But the Prouinciall did willingly diſpence with me, and ſo I was made Miniſter of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Liria:</hi> About three yeares after, I was made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of another monaſtery of higher dignitie, called <hi>Nue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra ſenora de las ſogas,</hi> in which time by occaſion of ſome contrary occurrents that befell concerning our Order, by certaine learned Prelats, and very great men, I was choſen Embaſſadour to the Reuerend Generall of our Order, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then at Paris: which I diſcharged, by Gods aſſiſtance, though with great danger of my life. After I had obtained the preſence of our Generall, he lent ſuch attention to the
<pb facs="tcp:21341:29"/>
complaints deliuered by me, that he diſpatcht me with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition and order for ſuch as were troubleſome and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of obedience: and gaue me full power, and orders, for the reading of Diuinity.</p>
               <p>Graced with all theſe titles, and additions of dignity, and preferment, I returned againe into <hi>Spaine:</hi> But I had not long ſtayed there, when vpon inſtance of other weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty occaſions that concerned our Order, I was ſent againe to the Generall, with two other graue Miniſters in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Him I found ſo kind, and louing, and ſo reſpectiue of me, that whatſoeuer belonged to the gouernment of the Prouince, I obtained at his hands. He created me at that time both Maiſter and Doctor (which with vs is a matter of much honour and commodity.) But after my returne into the Prouince (which containes vnder it the kingdomes of Arragon, Valence, Catalonia, and Mallorica) by comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement which I had receiued from the Generall, there was a Conuocation had for the election of the Prouinciall; and the choice fell to <hi>M. Stephen Bertiz,</hi> a Noble man, of verie great learning, and my eſpeciall good friend. He for the loue he bare me, made me chiefe Secretary of the Prouince. A little while after the religious men of our Monaſtery of Dertaſa, made me Miniſter (which in the Order of the holy Trinitie, is as high a place as theirs is, who in the orders of other monaſteries are called Priors, Wardens, Abbots, Prelates, &amp;c.) and created me alſo the chiefe of the houſe. That I might not ſeeme vnthankfull, I tooke vpon me that charge, and in the Colledge of the ſame City I was made Doctor. Afterwards (vnknowne to me) both by the Church and Citizens of Vernauen, farre enough diſtant from my houſe, I had the charge giuen me of their Church, and of the preaching of the Lent ſermons. And that I might wholly conſecrate my ſelfe to preaching and reading, and not be hindered by any other care of rule or gouernment, (which is much contrary to the profeſſion of learning) I left the monaſtery of Dert, and reſigned my office of miniſtery.</p>
               <p>In the monaſtery alſo of Valence, which is the chiefeſt
<pb facs="tcp:21341:30"/>
monaſtery of all the Prouince, where are reſident to the number of 50 Preachers, Doctors of Diuinity, and others moſt approued men for learning, there was an aſſembly had for the election of one that ſhould be Miniſter &amp; Head of that monaſterie; and the 26 day of April, in the yeare 1601, that lot fell to my ſhare. So conſequently all the goods &amp; riches of the monaſtery were put into my hands and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as well of ſiluer and gold-plate, as of other precious ornaments, treaſure, and ſums of money, with which the ſame monaſtery is richly furniſhed: For it hath yearely to be laid forth and diſtributed by the Miniſter 4000 crownes a yeare. In the time that I was Miniſter of Valence, I was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten created viſitor of the houſes, and with the fulneſſe of power made Vicar Prouincial of all the foure kingdomes. And laſtly, the 8 day of Nouember in the yeare 1602, with generall and Apoſtolique power was conſtituted viſitor of certaine monaſteries within the limits of the Prouince. I was greatly beloued of the Generall, and other Prelats and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men of that Order which in times paſt I profeſſed, and was well accepted with Eccleſiaſtical gouernors.</p>
