            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Application of this point, <note place="margin">Iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Artiller; exercises.</note> doth as neerely concerne this <hi>Artillery Company,</hi> as any of the former, both for iustification, and also for approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and commendation thereof. Were our daies more <hi>halcyon,</hi> more quiet, and peaceable then they are, or were they more free from feare of danger then they are, yet were your Artillery exercises lawfull, needfull, vsefull. True it is, that they are not in pitcht fields, <hi>pede pes, &amp; cuspide cuspis,</hi> face to face, foot to foot, speare to speare against enemies. They are in a quiet Citie, in a time of peace among your selues. They are like the <hi>Olympian</hi> games (instituted by potent and prudent <hi>Hercules)</hi> and the <hi>Isthmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>

Are they therefore not lawfull? Or not needfull? Or not vsefull? Hee is too seuere and censorious, and goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the liberty of Gods Word, that condemneth all recreations, all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightsome pastimes. He is too impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident and imprudent, that concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth nothing needfull or vsefull, whereof there is not necessary vse in that present and instant time wherein it is vsed. Were your Artillery exercises onely for recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are the best recreations that can be vsed.

in the things which men doe, swalloweth vp the paines that is taken about them, makes men the more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and constant in their exercises, and bringeth them to the greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and perfection therein. Not onely expert souldiers, but experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Captaines also are made by Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary recreations vsed in <hi>Artillery Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</hi> So as if suddenly Armies were to be raised of more men then all the Military Companies can afford, yeo might sufficient store of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and other Commanders and officers be taken out of your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to gouerne and guide, to instruct and encourage such as for want of former exercising were altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced.

of other nations and ages, our <hi>Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi> well discerned the neede, vse, and benefit of such recreations as might fit men for Warre: which moued them to make such strict Statute Lawes for the exercise of shooting, as they did: For,</p>

            <p n="3">3. Hee was to bring vp those that were in his house in the exercise of shooting.</p>

            <p n="5">5. If a seruant tooke wages, his Master might buy him bow, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and deduct the price out of his wages.</p>

            <p>In those daies gunnes (the sure and soare messengers of death) were not so in vse as now they are. Strength and skill in shooting was it that made our english nation famous for Warre.

            <p>Such recreations in peace as are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations vnto Warre, iustly deserue to be reckoned vp among those neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie vocations whereby Polities are preserued: and while you are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your selues therein, you are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in your calling, and you goe on in that way, wherein <hi>God</hi> promiseth to <hi>giue his Angels charge ouer you, to</hi>

matter of so great consequence, so nearely concerning the glory, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, and safety of the whole land, and of all the societies and seuerall persons therein. Me thinkes that it is more then meete that euery Citie and Corporation, if not euery Towne and Village throughout the Land, should haue an <hi>Artillery Garden:</hi> and that the great populous Cities, especially LONDON, should haue as many <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery Gardens,</hi> as it hath <hi>Wards:</hi> and that publique allowances should bee afforded to such as willingly offer themselues to these Militarie exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
