            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WELL knowing my
most Noble Lord,
that these things will easily receive
Perfection in your Hands, which
for many Reasons are beyond my
reach.</p>
            <p>This Treatise (if it may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that name) is the least in
<pb facs="tcp:59261:3"/>
Bulk, and seemingly relating to
the sleightest Subject I have met
withal in <hi>Pyrotechnia.</hi> But in the
many Volumns great and small
that I have read relating to these
Matters in our own and other
Languages; I do not find the least
Pretence or Thought of doing
<hi>that</hi> which here is undertaken, <hi>viz.
To raise so great a heap of Fire, and
to confirm the Fact by the greatest
Proofs that can be had or wish'd for,
which are Experiments and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
Mathematical.</hi> Yet this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is not the matter aim'd at,
the Problem is universal, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to the Fortifications of all
sorts of Guns and other Engines
with their Carriages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is
<hi>to increase or decrease the strength of
Materials according to the Effects
and Services required.</hi> But the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Skill in this Undertaking being
<pb facs="tcp:59261:3"/>
to adjust the Instrument and Means
in a due and proper Proportion to
the Effect sought for; I do with
all Humility and profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
make offer of this small Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say.</p>
            <p>It is your Lordships great Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and Merit, that has enabled
you to tread the intricate and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

for the Welfare and Honour of
your Country, has always been
the inbred Vertue of your Family,
and which is brought to its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in your self.</p>

Young PYROBOLISTES.</head>
            <p>ROckets are the most Artificial
piece of Fire-work yet used
amongst the Pyrobolistes, and
hath been more used of late
Years than formerly, and that the Young
Artists may not spend their Time and
Money unnecessarily, I have given easie,
plain, and ready Rules for making of
Rockets to two Inches and half Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which is sufficient for all private
Occasion, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the Mould of a Rocket.
Of the Rouler and Case. Of the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.
Of the Receipts of Rockets. Of
the Driver. Of the Boring of the
Rocket. Of the Stars and other Matter
to be put in the Head of a Rocket. To
Head a Rocket. Of the Sticking of a
Rocket. And lastly, to Fire the Rocket.
And some Observations about the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:59261:5"/>
of a Rocket in general; all which
I hope will prove casie and beneficial to
the Ingenious, and those that are willing
to Learn: and what you do, endeavour
to do it well, and do not be Conceited;
which if so, I have my ends. And
from these little beginnings greater Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
may be obtained, and you may become
serviceable to your Country; in which be
sure to be Careful, Honest and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>

            <head>TO THE
Other PYROBOLISTES.</head>
            <p>ABout fifteen Years since I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
of a method to increase
or decrease the strength of the
Metal of Guns, which is this
that I intend to discourse of. And at the
Close of a small Treatise to hit a Mark
published in the Year 1691. I proposed
that Problem in Print; since that time
there has been more than Ordinary occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for it, by Reason of the new Casting
of the Mortar-pieces. About two Years
since I put that Problem into a method,
and made a Draught of the whole matter
to increase or decrease the strength of the
Metal of a Gun in any possible Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
assigned. But when I saw the Mortar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces
brought from Sea broke, it was
thought to be a good time to shew it,
<pb facs="tcp:59261:6"/>
which was done, and the whole matter
discoursed of at large, but it signified
00. But now I apply that Problem to
the making of Rockets for the young
Artist, as you see in its proper place.
And it is manifest that the young Rocket-makers
of this City are very Careful and
Artificial in their Rockets of <hi>8d. 12d.</hi>
or <hi>18d.</hi> value, otherwise they may break
and so lose their Labour and Discredit
themselves. Seeing these Mathematical
Rules are so applicable to the greatest
nicety of the Rising of all sizes of
Rockets; is it not more valuable to be
applied to those Chargeable Instruments
of War, <hi>viz.</hi> Guns of all sorts, with
their Carriages, and all other their Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture?</p>
            <p>As to the Doctrine of shooting by the
increase and decrease of Powder, this
way of making of Rockets proves it to
be absurd; for all Rocket makers to this
time weaken the Composition of their
Rockets, as their Rockets are in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or having greater quantities of
<pb facs="tcp:59261:6"/>
Composition; and that by chance, and
without any Mathematical Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And also by Experience, in Table
<hi>June</hi> 1. 1691. and in the first Column
Experiment 4, against that in Column 2
you will find 4 Ounces of Powder, and
in Column 3, 3377. Again, in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn.
1, against Experiment 1 in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
2, you find ½ an Ounce of Powder,
and against that in Column 3, you find
213; now because the Requisite of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
are as 8 to 1, therefore I multiply 213
by 8, and it makes 1704, much short of
3377, which indeed should have been
equal to the said 3377. that is the
Ranges upon the plain of the Horizon
are not as the Requisites of Powder which
projected those Ranges; the like may be
done in all the other Experiments. I.
have made hundreds of Experiments in
several sorts of Mortar-pieces, and am
ready to make as many more, all which
will manifestly confute the Doctrine of
shooting by the increase and decrease
<pb facs="tcp:59261:7"/>
of Powder, and have often invited the
first promoter of that Doctrine to see his
Invention confuted; and I do here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
all the Practitioners in that Science
of shooting by the increase and decrease of
Powder, to come and see their Doctrine
confuted. I do hear assert it is impossible
ever to bring that way of shooting to be
so exact and ready for use, in all or any
sorts of Guns, as the common or usual
way is, by keeping the Requisites of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
constant, and elevating the Piece. In
the Complicating of Rockets, whose Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters
are at any great distance; we make
use of Experiments of shooting made upon
another Occasion, and those Experiments
serves sufficiently well; but if we were
to do them justly according to Art, there
should be two even Chased Guns of the
same Proportion as the Rockets are of,
that is the Diameter of the exposed Rocket
2½ Inch multiplied by 6 is 15 Inches,
and those should be the Diameter and
length of one of the Guns: 4 Inches the
Diameter of the other Rocket, multiplied
by 6 is 24 Inches, which 4 Inches for
<pb facs="tcp:59261:7"/>
the Diameter, and 24 Inches for the
length should be the other Gun, or any
two Guns in that Proportion. For the
Requisite of Powder take the Cube of 4,
which is 64, as also the Cube of 2½,
which is 15.625, divide the greater
Cube Number by the lesser, and the
Quotient is 4, sufficiently near; so the
Requisites of Powder of these two Pieces
are as 4 to 1, then take any reasonable
Requisite of Powder for the 4 Inch Gun,
then take the fourth part of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for the Requisite of Powder for
the lesser Gun, discharge them both at
one degree of Elevation, and note their
Ranges. Their Bullets are to be of the
same Metal, and of the same likeness, and
both exactly fit. In a Mathematical
sence these Ranges should be equal;
but by Combination the greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Powder aggitates more upon the
great Bullet, than the lesser Requisites
doth aggitate upon the lesser Bullet,
and that causes those differences, the like
when two quantities of Powder aggitate
upon one Bullet; it is Experience only that
<pb facs="tcp:59261:8"/>
determines the matter. Although strange
things sometimes happens; yet this we
will Assert, and endeavour to maintain
that Mathematical Knowledg, join'd with
faithful Experiments, will do greater
matters than most Men commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>

               <p>THE Ingredients which Rockets are
Composed of are Saltpetre, Sulphur,
and Wood-Coal mealed, and passed
through a fine Sieve. First, take the
largest of Small-Coal made of Birch-Wood.
Secondly, chuse the Yellowest
Roch Sulphur. Thirdly, take Saltpetre
put in a Brass Vessel, to which put so
much fair Water as will dissolve it, put
that Vessel upon the Fire, when it boils
scum it clean; when the Water evaporates
and consumes, stir it with a Spatula of
Wood to meal it, what remains of the
Saltpetre upon the Spatula, and sides of
the Vessel, rub off with your Spatula of
Wood; then meal it, and pass it through
a fine Sieve. A second way to Clarifie
Saltpetre; take a Crucible, set it in the
Fire, put Saltpetre thereunto, increase the
Fire till the Saltpetre be Reduced to a
liquid quality like Water; when it boils
take mealed Sulphur upon a Spatula of
Iron, and put it into the boiling Saltpetre;
so often repeated, the Flegmy quality of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59261:11"/>
the Saltpetre will be burnt away, and the
flame will remain as white as the Body of
the Sun. Then pour it into some very
smooth Vessel, which being cooled, you
may reduce it into meal. These ways I
have done for my Recreation; but I usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
take the cleanest Saltpetre to be found
in Drugsters Shops, and it does as well.</p>

will rise swifter than when bored, the
Composition lying looser about the Needle
than if it were bored, takes fire easier, and
this is most necessary in large Rockets,

such will hang too long time upon the

               <p>This will hold in Rockets of 1 Inch, 1½

must be less solidity to the hollow Cone of

that way did no better than these I now

the Stick at the Head, three quarters of an
Inch or less, the thickness half an Inch
or less, the small end of the Stick three
eighths of an Inch and square, and to be
made of light Deal; such a Stick will do
very well, and may be counted Custom
without Demonstration. In the Winter
1695. there were two sets of Fire works,
in the first of which the Wind was North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and the Rockets in their rising
worked into the Wind. In the second the
Wind was Westward, and had the same
effect as the first; the Reason was because
the Stick was to heavy at the upper end,
and too light at the lower; and so the
Center of Gravity of the Rocket and
Stick was too near the Rocket: when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Center of Gravity should be in
the middle, betwixt the lower end of the
Stick and upper end of the Rocket; and
to do which the bigger end of the Stick
ought to be downward; by this means a
lighter Stick would serve, and if the Wind
did drive the Rocket, the Rocket would
move less, and yet perpendicular to the
Horizon. Nature it self has taught us the
same; for all Birds, especially Birds of
a swift flight, spread their Tails for their
Guide. Sticks of Rockets ought to be one

to another as the length and Diameters
of the respective Rockets; that is, as the
Diametre 1½ Inch is to the thickness of
its Stick, so is 4 Inches the Diameter of
a 4 Inch Rocket to the thickness of its
respective Stick. As the length of one
Rocket is to its Stick; so is the length of
any other Rocket to its Stick: and as the
weight of one Rocket is to the weight of
its Stick; so is the weight of any other

they rose well.</p>
                  <p>An example of a Rocket of 6 Inches
Diameter, keeping the same Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Take the Cube of 6, which is 216,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59261:22"/>
divide that Cube by the Cube of 4, which
is 64, the Quotient is 3, that is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in the Rocket of 4 Inches, is to
the Composition in the Rocket of 6 Inches,
is as 1 to 3; then I look in the Table of
<hi>Aug.</hi> 24. and find in the second Column
the Requisites of Powder half an Ounce,
and an Ounce and a half; and against
these Requisites in Column three 800, the
unequal Range, and 236 the equal Range,
which I multiply by 3, and it makes 708:
then as 4 is to 6, so is twelve half quarters
of an Inch, the Diameter of the new
Orifice of the four Inch Rocket, to eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
half quarters of Inches; that is 2
Inches and 1 quarter: or as 4 is to 6, so is
1½, that is 3 halfs, to 4½ half Inches,
that is 2¼. Then I had no such Ranges,
that their Requisites of Powder were in
Proportion as the Cube of 6 is to the
Cube of 2½; therefore was I forced to
help my self by Proportion, which is the

and a half Rocket to an Inch, put the
unequal Range in the first place, and the
Work is done. The Composition these
4 and 6 Inch Rockets were made of, were
1 Sulphur, 1½ Coal, and 4 Saltpetre; but
I believe 1 Sulphur, 1 Coal, and 4 Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petre
would do better, there being no

Reason of the large Diameter of the

               <p>Thus have I given plain and easie
Rules to the Young Pyrobolistes for the
making of small Rockets; and also for
the making of great Rockets, to them of
a greater Knowledge and Purse, even
such as was reputed impossible; for a 4
Inch Rocket was given in by our ablest
Pyrobolistes to be out of size, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
impossible to rise. Now, if that 4
Inch Rocket was thought so, what will
they say to them of 6, 8, 10 or 12 Inches
Diameter; for certainly this Rule takes in
all sizes to 500 or 1000 weight, or higher.</p>

the second and third Column, under
Pounds and Ounces of Rockets. I find
three Pounds and 12 Ounces the weight
of the Rocket when finished, being 6

32 Ounces of Composition to fill 4 Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters.
In the fifth and sixth Columns
I find 20 Pounds 4 Ounces for the Mallet

                  <p>When Rockets are of a great weight,
the Mallet will be too heavy to manage,
therefore do thus. The Mallet of a three
Inch Rocket, <hi>viz.</hi> 20 Pounds weight is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59261:28"/>
of a good size; and we will make an
Example of a 3 Inch and 7½ Rockets, and
we will take it as useful that all Rockets
to 3 Inches Diameter, may be filled with
eight Charges, but further not, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
7½ in the first Column. In Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
4 I find 500 Ounces of Composition
for that Rocket, which I divide by 8, and
the Quotient will be 62.5. In the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola
A H Z, let A H be the Number of
Ounces 5062 5 in the Mallet for the 7½
Rocket, and A G the Number of Ounces
324 in the Mallet for a 3 Inch Rocket;
then the Ordinates H Z and G Z will be
the Forces of those Mallets; then as H Z
is to G Z, so is 62.5 to 15.811, that is 15
Ounces and <hi rend="sup">•••1000</hi> shall be your Charge of
Composition. Further, divide 62.5 by
15.811, the Quotient will be 3. <hi rend="sup">2•</hi>22/10000 the
Number of Charges in the eight part of
the Composition; then multiply 39529
by 8, there will be 31. <hi rend="sup">••31000</hi> Charges in
that Rocket. Lastly, give about eighteen
blows to every Charge, with that Mallet
for the 3 Inch Rocket, so your Work will
be done, by two Men, in two hours.</p>
