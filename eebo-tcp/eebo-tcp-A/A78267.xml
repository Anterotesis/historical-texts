         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE PURCHASERS of ſome LANDS, belonging to the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> in the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> by Leaſes for 21 Years.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Burrough is an Ancient Burrough, and had ſeveral hundred Acres of Land given the Burgeſſes and their Succeſſors by King <hi>Athelſtane,</hi> 7 or 8 hundred years ſince, which were confirmed by ſeveral ſucceeding Kings of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That King <hi>Charles</hi> the 1ſt, in the 11th year of his Reign confirmed the ſaid Charter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and granted them ſeveral other Priviledges; the Burrough at firſt conſiſting only of free Burgeſſes, but of late years there is an Alderman, 12 Capital Burgeſſes, 24 Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons called Aſſiſtants, Land-holders and free Burgeſſes.</p>
            <p>That about the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the 1ſt, the Aldermen and 12 Capital Burgeſſes uſurped to themſelves 13 ſeveral incloſed Grounds, part of the ſaid Lands which cauſed great Differences, and Law-Suits between them and the free Burgeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but about the 6th year of the ſaid King, it was agreed amongſt themſelves, that the 13 Capital Burgeſſes ſhould hold the ſaid Grounds as long as they continued Capital Burgeſſes, paying 10 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to a Free-School, and 10 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to an Almes-Houſe, but were often interrupted by the free Burgeſſes, for that the ſaid Lands ought to have been held (as they were given) in Common.</p>
            <p>That 4 or 5 years ſince a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> was brought againſt the Corporation, and proſecuted to Judgment, and entred, and the Corporation and Lands ſeized.</p>
            <p>That ſome ſhort time after the late King <hi>James</hi> the 2d did by Charter, (amongſt other things) grant to the Burrough the Lands aforeſaid, and named therein an Alderman and 12 other Capital Burgeſſes.</p>
            <p>That preſently after the Perſons within the Corporation cut down the Hedges, and levelled the Ditches of the 13 Grounds, and made it Common, and claimed it in Common, and denied the new Capital Burgeſſes to hold it, as it was formerly held by the old ones.</p>
            <p>That afterwards a Common Hall was called within the Burrough, there being preſent all the Magiſtrates, and the major part of the free Burgeſſes, for ſetling the ſaid Lands belonging to the ſaid Burrough, as alſo the ſaid 13 Grounds and other Agreements, and By-Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that then all things were ſetled and agreed on by all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons then preſent, <hi>(Nemine Contradicente)</hi> which were many more than the major part of the ſaid Burgeſſes, and for that there had been ſeveral Diſputes in former times, and then concerning the ſaid 13 Capital Burgeſſes holding the ſaid 13 Grounds to themſelves, which ought to have been held in Common, it was agreed that the ſaid Lands ſhould be Leaſed out to Tenants for any Terms, not exceeding 21 years to raiſe Money to pay the Corporation's Debts, reſerving 50 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> (viz.) 10 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to a Free-School, 10 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to an Almes-Houſe, as formerly, as alſo 5 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to a Bell-Man, 5 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to the Steward, 15 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s. per Annum,</hi> an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Alderman for his Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the remainder for a Town-Stock.</p>
            <p>That the ſame was drawn into Writing, and Signed by the major part of the Corporation, and by 7 or 8 of the Perſons who call themſelves the old Burgeſſes, ſome of them receiving part of the Fines, there being not above 2 or 3 now living that did not conſent with the Common Seal of the Burrough affixed, which ſaid Agreement was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in Chancery, and (amongſt orher things) is in theſe words, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the 13 Grounds called the Burgeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes parts, and all other Lands and Rents being part, or parcel of the ſaid 13 Grounds, or thereunto belonging, and all other Lands held in ſeveralty by the late Capital Burgeſſes, ſhall from time to time hereafter be Leaſed out by the Alderman for the time being, the High Steward, or in his Abſence his Deputy-Steward, and Aſſiſtant therein named, and the 4 other Stewards of the 4 ſeveral Companies, or the major part of them, the Alderman for the time being to have a caſting Voice, and always to be one for any term of Years, not exceeding 21 for ſuch Fines, as they ſhall agree, provided the whole Rent reſerved for all the ſaid Lands to be Lett, ſhall be 50 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> at the leaſt, clear of all things.</p>
            <p>That the Alderman, and the major part of the Perſons appointed to make Leaſes, did make Leaſes under the Common Seal of the Burrough, to Tenants for valuable Conſiderations, reſerving the 50 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> Rent as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, which Tenants to their great Coſts have improved the ſaid Grounds, and ſome of them have burnt, bak'd 4 of the ſaid Grounds, and ſowed Wheat on them at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt, now worth near 200 l.</p>
            <p>It is intended on behalf of the old Burgeſſes, upon the Report of the Committee of the Bill, for reſtoring Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, to move the Houſe to alter that Clauſe in the ſaid Bill, that provides for all Leſſees of Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and get a Clauſe inſerted, to deſtroy the Tennants Leaſes, without ſatisfying the Money paid by them, for Fines and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, although the Leaſes were made by the major part of the Corporation, as alſo by ſeven or eight of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>The Tenants hope that the Parliament will not inſert any Clauſe to make void their Leaſes, they being Purchaſors on valuable Conſiderations, as alſo ſowed their Corn peaceably, being matter of Title, and for the Reaſons aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>One <hi>W— A—</hi> thô one of the Leſſors, and a Party to the Agreement and Decree, is now Sollicitor againſt the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and (as we are informed) hath wrote a Paper of the Caſe, with a great many voluntary Miſtakes, and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Tennants are willing to accept their Fines and Improvements.</hi>
