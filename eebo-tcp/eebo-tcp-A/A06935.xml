         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the chaine which drawes them, and they shall finde it iustice, not the quarrel of earthly passion; and let them looke at the end whereat they would aime, and they shall finde it is Heauen and the Communitie with Saints, not the Court (which is the Theater of worldly praise) nor the Princes fauour: But if all this preuaile not, but still this secure Slumber of Peace will lye heauy vpon them; then stirre vp thy warme bloud, and modestly thus chide them:</p>
            <p>Tell them, that as the King is the great maine Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or Sea of all Honour, and may bestow his waters freely at his pleasure; so he expects from those which are his pettie Riuers, that hourely to him they pay backe their Tributes: That hand which giues Honor, euer lookes from the honour'd hand to receiue some seruice; Then you (O you yong men, you ablemen) you that haue receiued honors beyond expectations, fauours past hope, and wealth past merit: Looke whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Riuers be not conuerted to standing lakes, and no Tribute returned, and whether your seruices be not concealed, whilest poore barren wishes only make good the place of a dead duty; if you finde these falts amend them, if you finde these falts forsake them.</p>
            <p>Againe, tell these great ones (whom hardly Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der can awaken) that when they neglect <hi>Honour,</hi> they neglect and are rebellious against God, and it is a meere folly for them to hope to rule men, when they will not be ruled by him that made them; But they will answere thee, that greatnesse of place, giues them priuiledge from Censure, and so they can cary a faire shew, no matter for sufficiencie. Reply thou that it is folly to thinke so, for assure them that a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall

shew of sufficiencie, is but like small Wines which will not keepe, and being once tainted, no poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son like that of Contempt.</p>
            <p>Say vnto those which are dull, and want good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereon to build great thoughts, that as small springs are soone emptied if they be often drawne; so spirits that haue weake foundations, silence is good to make them seeme wise; but when Wisedome comes to proue them, euery imagined good thing (in them) fals asunder like so many disioyned pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Tell the phantasticke Mimmickes of honour, those which are caried away with euery shadow of fauour or fashion, that neuer fixe vpon any thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant or serious; that alwaies hunt after vanities, and thinke no exercise in Armes so meritorious, as tossing a Shyttelwike: tell them the study of vaine things is a toilesome Idlenesse, and a painefull Folly; the spirit which is strucke with this disease, are very hardly cured; neither can their curiositie in this kinde (how carefull soeuer) afford them any thing but Ignorance; and belieue it, there is nothing more dishonourable or daungerous either to Court or Common-wealth, then an Ignorant great one: Tell them that <hi>Henry</hi> the Great of <hi>France,</hi> call'd Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Noble-men <hi>Golden Calues,</hi> and all that did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to them, were worthy to perish for Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: It was his opinion, that Noblemen might bee borne good, Generous, and capable of Vertue; but Instruction only makes them wise: Wisedome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gotten without paine, she cannot be sold, or if she could, it is ten to one, this sort of Nobilitie would

neuer buy her, there are so many follies to step betwixt her and them, which are both cheape, and euer ready to pull downe the market.</p>
            <p>Lastly, and for a Conclusion of this small Treatise, say to him, whatsoeuer hee be that shall taxe me of bitternesse, or thinke I haue gone beyond the bounds of good manners in seeking to aduise them, who are aboue the rule of my knowledge, and that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is aboue me doth nothing belong vnto me, tell them they are mistaken: Bid them call to minde, that the Tree which grew from <hi>Romulus</hi> Iaueling (when he threw it into the ground) was walled about by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and kept so carefully, that if any man (of what degree soeuer) saw the leaues begin to wither, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently gaue an allarum to the whole Citie, and cryed for water as if all had beene on fire: In like manner, Subiects haue cause to grieue and call out, when as those plants, from whence the hope to gather the strength of <hi>Protection,</hi> the fruits of <hi>Iustice</hi> and the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of their <hi>rest,</hi> doe wither either through the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of those which should prune and preserue them, or through the want of good Sap, which might be infused into them by due watering and manuring.</p>
