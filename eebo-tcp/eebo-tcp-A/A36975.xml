            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Arrogance a Poet may be guilty of in a Dedication, often brings him more terror, than his fear for the success of his Play; and I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought the Frowns of an offended Patron a greater Punishment than the Censures of the Partial Criticks. But the Sin of Confidence is so natural to a young Poet, and so suitable to his Character and Business, that an Excuse, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof (as it would be extreamly unnecessary, so it) might perhaps be a hinderance to his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. My sence of this, has encourag'd me to present this Comedy to your Grace; with this humble Suit, That as it has indifferently past in the Opinion of the Town, it may have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to stand as Neuter in your Graces Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour:
<pb facs="tcp:48986:3"/>
The greatest Confidence of a Poet can ask no more; nor can you, <hi>(My Lord)</hi> Govern'd by your Excellent Temper, grant less. This I know I need not repeat, nor urge a second time: For who ever yet made an Humble Address to your Grace, that went away unsatisfied? You are so far from Singularity, so Nobly Iust, and so unwearied in doing good, that to Pen your Applause, were as impossible a work, as to Pen the Actions of your Life, every hour producing some memorable thing as an Addition to the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume. <hi>My Lord,</hi> 'Tis not only my particular Grief, but every ones for your Graces depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>England:</hi> And though the great Place of Trust conferred upon you by His <hi>Sacred Majesty,</hi> (and which none can be more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of) gives us proof as well of your Pious Loyalty, as Unequal'd Grandeur; Yet such an Influence you have gain'd on all Hearts, that they had rather the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> should lose its Preserver, than they so good a Patron. This I confess I am most sensible of, perhaps having as much cause as any; which Relation I'll smother, lest it is thought Interest more than Gratitude makes me resent it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48986:3"/>If I have presumed too much, I have this Excuse, That a Dedication to such a Person cannot be VVrit without it; and 'tis the only Honour a Poet is ambitious of, to have a great Name before his Play. I confess I was guilty of this; and have only this Excuse for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance of a Dedication, That your Grace was pleas'd to favour my Last, and that this was VVrit with the same Integrity. For the Play I can say nothing; only that it was my own, though some are pleas'd to doubt the contrary, (the <hi>Scotch Song</hi> excepted, a part of which was not mine; nor do I desire any Reputation from it.) Be pleased, <hi>My Lord,</hi> to forgive this Prolixity; and believe my sence of the Honour I have in Addressing to your Grace, almost equals the Ambition I shall ever own, in Stiling my Self,</p>

            <head>Prologue.</head>
            <l>IF Plot and Bus'ness Comical and New,</l>
            <l>Could please the Criticks that sit here to view,</l>
            <l>The Poet might have thought this Play would do.</l>
            <l>But in this Age Design no praise can get:</l>
            <l>You cry it Conversation wants, and Wit;</l>
            <l>As if the Obvious Rules of Comedy,</l>
            <l>Were only dull <hi>Grimace</hi> and <hi>Repart√©e.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Such, Sirs, have been your Darlings prov'd of late:</l>
            <l>The Author therefore careless of his Fate,‚Äî</l>
            <l>And knowing Wit a Chattle hardly got,</l>
            <l>Has ventur'd his whole Stock upon a Plot:</l>
            <l>He says a Mock-Song, or a Smutty Tale,‚Äî</l>
            <l>Can please the Town; and why not this prevail?‚Äî</l>
            <l>I friendly told him, all that I could say,</l>
            <l>Was, that your Fancies lean'd the other way;</l>
            <l>And you lov'd Wenching better than his Play.</l>
            <l>For th' Body still you Luxury prepare;</l>
            <l>But let the Mind be desolate and bare:</l>
            <l>Thus lose your selves in the Worlds prudent thought,‚Äî</l>
            <l>Then strive to get Reprieve by finding fault.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>A Critick is a Monster that can sway</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Only o'er Ignorance, and yet dares prey</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Upon that Power that form'd him out of Clay.‚Äî</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Adulterate Age, where Prudence is a Vice,‚Äî</l>
            <l>And Wit's as scandalous as Avarice:‚Äî</l>
            <l>Yet in despight of this,‚Äîy'are Poets too;</l>
            <l>And what two Fops rail at, a third shall do.</l>
            <l>Upon our Priviledges you incroach,</l>
            <l>And with dull Rhimes the Noble Art debauch.</l>
            <l>For Writing Plays you scorn a Poets Name;</l>
            <l>A Bawdy Song's enough to get you fame:</l>
            <l>Where midst the Reputation that is due,</l>
            <l>You will be sure no man shall censure you.</l>
            <l>Yet though your Faction does infest the Town,</l>
            <l>There is a wise Cabal dares judge and own</l>
            <l>Desert and Wit, and our Endeavours Crown:</l>
            <l>To these we humbly Dedicate our Plays,</l>
            <l>Whilst at their Feet our Poets throw their Bays.</l>

                     <p>Nay, I confess, 'tis a sign of your kind resentment of my passion: Oh Heav'n! that happy thought has made me all rapture: I'll cherish it, Madam, as I would my Youth, or the best of all my Sences, the Sence of Feeling.</p>

                     <p>Cherish it rather as the means of keeping our love from my Husbands knowledge. Well! I swear the thought of my indirect plot sometimes makes me very melancholy.</p>

                     <p>Melancholy?‚ÄîFie, Madam, banish such thoughts for ever from your breast: If you are melancholy now, what would you have done, if I had not known you, when the Clog of your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (I mean your Husband) would have been your perpetual plague, and given you cause for more melancholy than the contrivance of the plots you speak of?‚Äî</p>

                     <p>Ay; but to break a Vow, Sir, a Vow: Little do you think what 'tis to break a Vow.</p>

                     <speaker>Rashley.</speaker>
                     <p>Little do I think? Madam, I thought you had known me so much a Gentleman, to imagine I know what belongs to the breaking a Vow as well as another man. To undeceive you, I have broke twenty Vows, that is, unnecessary Vows, (such as yours are!) nay, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a scruple of Conscience: I thank my Stars, I'm of a tougher Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>

                     <speaker>Emil.</speaker>
                     <p>Besides, you consider not the other inconveniences; you know my Husband's Sister <hi>Maria</hi> loves you, and is of that untam'd, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, that she'll revenge my invading her propriety in your heart by discovering our love to my Husband: I know she plots it hourly; and tho' her pretence is the Honour of our Family, her real design is through her love to you.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Rashley</speaker>
                     <p>Never doubt your Husband, Madam, he has so strange a confidence in my fidelity, that to possess him otherwise, were utterly to take away the little sence is left him. You know he brought me to lodge in his house, which prudently I refus'd at first, and seemingly fled from the Heav'n I desir'd, to make him more importunate: Since I came here, you know how he has carrest me; and to colour my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, and divert you, have feign'd a Mistriss in this quarter of the Town; and then, as if I spoke of her, have told him all that has past betwixt my self and you, at which the good-natur'd Creature has laught extreamly, and wisht me good luck a thousand times; and can we now doubt further success? By Heav'n, we cannot Madam.</p>

                     <speaker>Emilia.</speaker>
                     <p>Then you know there's another great obstacle; <hi>Ned Ranger</hi> has long profest a passion for me, and doubtless is not ignorant that my love for you is the cause of his no better success: A jealous man sees more than twenty others; and 'twill be very necessary for us to be careful of so dang'rous an Enemy.</p>

so; success, which animates the Hero, and leads him on to greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes than before he durst attempt, has cherisht hopes in me: Let me alone with him; and for thy part, Igad I'll turn thee loose to any Female-Devil on this side <hi>Lapland,</hi> either for plot or repart√©e.</p>

But what bus'ness can your Sister have with you? The Devil and She have been plotting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether about this Intrigue.</p>

                     <p>I am glad I've got air agen; this damn'd old Gib-Cat has mew'd me this half hour into such a hole, that had I staid a minute longer I had certainly been smother'd: it stinks worse than a Pothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries Shop, and is furnisht with nothing but Gally-pots full of nasty Oyl, into which groping about I often thrust my Fingers:‚ÄîFough!‚ÄîAssafoetida, as I live!‚Äîa most intolerable stink!‚Äî‚ÄîAh! the Devil grind her old Chops.‚ÄîStay;‚Äîthis is sure <hi>Emilia</hi>'s Chamber, and if I am not mistaken, I heard a whispering here;‚Äîit may be they're together;‚ÄîI'll be still and listen.</p>

                     <speaker>Emil.</speaker>
                     <p>I am confirm'd, and will proceed in loving. A Husband is a dull insipid thing, pall'd and grown stale within a week: But a Lover appears still new and gay, and is to perpetuity the same he was at first,‚Äîall mirth,‚Äîall pleasure.</p>

                     <p>He, dull Creature, Heav'n knows, is blind to all your Charms. Marriage acts only the Decrees of Duty, Love has the least share in 't. In this Age a Husband with a Wife is like a Bully in a Church;‚Äîthe only pleasure he takes is to sleep away the hours shou'd be employ'd in Conjugal Duty.</p>

                     <speaker>Emil.</speaker>

            <l>I had so many Smutty Iests those days,</l>
            <l>I could get none but Women to my Plays.</l>
            <l>But that's all one;‚Äî<hi>Icod,</hi> the Youth that Writ,</l>
            <l>Does well;‚Äîand who knows,‚Äîmay do better yet:</l>
            <l>Therefore you should incourage him, D'ee hear?</l>
            <l>And he that fails, I wish this Curse may bear,</l>
            <l>That he be really my Character,‚Äî</l>
            <l>Lascivious, Deaf, and Impotent as I;</l>
            <l>And Gad that's Plague enough,‚Äîand so <hi>God bu'y.</hi>
