            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>POOR JOHN: OR, A LENTEN DISH.</head>
            <head>BEING The Soliloquies of JOHN LAMBERT now Priſoner in the Tower of LONDON.</head>
            <p>HOw various and inconſtant is the Wheel of Fortune all the world knows: And I have now found by wofull Experience. I could never perſwade my ſelf till now, but that I was born under a Regal Planet, notwithſtanding the malignity of my Starrs was ſuch, that in my Childehood I was poſſeſt with that Diſeaſe call'd <hi>the Kings evil;</hi> which was healed under God by the late King CHARLES: and how I rewarded him for his pains Who knows not? But I am not guilty alone of this abominable ſin of Ingratitude, many thouſands having offended in the like nature, though but few ſo deeply as my ſelf; and <hi>Charles Fleetwood</hi> his gracious God-ſon may be plac'd in the firſt Rank alſo. I confeſs, my ambitions were boundleſs, and by reaſon of the fawning ſmiles of Fortune (whom I thought to have led by the noſe like a dog in a ſtring) my hopes were not mean. I thought my lot would have faln in as good ground as <hi>Olivers</hi> did, and was content he ſhould King it as long as he lived, as knowing, that my turn was next: yet when I ſaw that he laboured to ſecure the Government to his ſon, and to ſettle it in his own line, I began to oppoſe him; which he perceiving quickly laid me aſide, and for a long time I was no body; but I made a ſhift to ſtart up again, and to ſcour off the rubbiſh of my former honour which had lain long a ruſting, by the reſtauration of the Rump, and the Good Old Cauſe. Then I deemed my ſelf a Protector in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> being in higher favour with the Rump then their ſnivelling Lieutenant-General <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> under whoſe wings I thought good to play my game a while. In ſhort time I had a good occaſion to make my ſelf gracious in the eyes of my Rumpiſh Maſters, and to advance my fame in the Opinion of the People, as well as Souldiery, by the fooliſh undertaking of Sr. <hi>George Booth,</hi> which hath rendred him infamous to Eternity; Moſt men concluding him wanting either in Judgment or Fidelity: what his fault was is beſt known to my ſelf, but I liſt not now to ſpeak of it. However I had a thouſand pounds as a gratuity for that ſervice, which was no more than a ſtraw in my aſpiring thoughts, yet I took it thankfully: Shortly after I gave my good Maſters a Writ of eaſe, and cleans'd the houſe of 'em: For if I had not ſo ſerved them, they would have quickly diſpatched me: whereupon I ſet up a crew of mine own Creatures (the Committee of Safety) but they vaniſhed, like <hi>Will of the wiſp,</hi> and were blown away with one blaſt from the Rump: my ſelf being firſt outwitted by <hi>Monk,</hi> and then forſaken by all my Souldiers, was forc'd to ſneak home, and put my finger in a hole; and now I have got the Tower over my head, but e'relong I fear I ſhall go to Tiburn: Nevertheleſs in this day of my ſolitude, and affliction, I do cheer up my drooping Spirits, and add a little comfort to my ſorrowfull minde with theſe and the like contemplations.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>I conſider to my ſelf the mutability of Fortune in her diſpoſe of all tranſitory enjoyments, and how I may poſſibly be raiſed again after a downfall now, as well as formerly: And ſince the</hi> Rump <hi>had her Re-reſurrection; Why may not I?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>I call to minde thoſe many gracious promiſes of Dominion, Profit and Pleaſure made unto me by my good Lord and beſt Mr.</hi> Belzebub, <hi>provided, I would continually perſevere to ſerve him faithfully; the neglect whereof I heartily repent, as a main (if not the ſole) cauſe of all theſe misfortunes fallen upon me, reſolving to be doubly diligent for time to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>It is ſome comfort to me that I am not alone miſerable, according to that ſaying,</hi> Solamen miſeris, &amp;c. <hi>For I hope if I be hang'd, Sr.</hi> Arthur Haſlerig, <hi>Mr.</hi> Scot, John Hewſon <hi>and others, will have ſo much good fellowſhip in them, as to hange with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>I am much pleaſed with the exerciſe of my revenge on Sr.</hi> George Booth; <hi>for I did not onely put him to the run at</hi> Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le-witch, <hi>but have forc't him out of his Lodging in the</hi> Tower.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>Since I have laid up all my Sacrilegious and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful Poſſeſſions (as we ſay) in</hi> Lavender, <hi>to ſupply my want of moneys in my Northern Expedition, it is not a little comfort to me to be maintain'd at the charge of the Common-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>I can ſleep quietly and ſecurely here, being rid of thoſe biting cares wherewith I was wont to be troubled by day, and my Ladies inſatiable appetite at nights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>I Muſe upon the fate of</hi> Roger Mortimer, <hi>who made his eſcape hence, and cros't the</hi> Thames <hi>without the help of other Oares then his own naked Armes: And who knows, but I, that reſemble him ſo much in ambitious attempts, may tread the ſame ſteps, for the purchaſe of deſired Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>The time being at hand, in which Providence hath deſign'd the Reſtauration of</hi> CHARLES STUART <hi>and his Family, it is matter of joy to me, to be caſt down from the Pinacle of Honour by others, rather than to be an Object of his moſt Juſt Revenge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>It is my greateſt Happineſs, that whatever befals me here, and whatever Ignominious Death the Parliament may juſtly inflict upon me; yet my hope is to be ſo highly preferred in the other world, as to be placed next unto</hi> Oliver Cromwell, <hi>before</hi> Pride, Prideaux <hi>or</hi> Bradſhaw, <hi>ſince I knew the time when I was ſecond to none in</hi> England, <hi>but him alone. This (O mighty</hi> Lucifer) <hi>ſhall ever be the Humble Requeſt and Prayer of thy moſt faithful, though now afflicted Servant,</hi>
