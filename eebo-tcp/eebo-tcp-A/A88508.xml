            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Common-Prayers Complaint.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>WHat ſhall I doe; I am caſt out of doore,</l>
               <l>In Church, nor Chappell, I muſt come no more:</l>
               <l>For I am call'd plain Popery, by thoſe,</l>
               <l>That by the Spirit, Prayers doe compoſe;</l>
               <l>Such are the men your Round-heads dote upon,</l>
               <l>That can make prayers, of an houre long:</l>
               <l>That ſigh, and ſob, with making many faces,</l>
               <l>And theſe are men, preferr'd in good mens places.</l>
               <l>Fy, fy, I am aſhamed to ſee theſe dayes,</l>
               <l>Where none but ſuch as by th'Spirit prayes,</l>
               <l>Regarded are; for now adayes they cry,</l>
               <l>Down all, that will not with the times comply.</l>
               <l>So impudent they are, the Church they call</l>
               <l>A den of Theeves, yea and th' houſe of <hi>Ball:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Th'had rather preach in Barnes, in Tubs, and Stables,</l>
               <l>For there they can repeat their lyes and fables:</l>
               <l>But Parliament look too't, or elſe wee'l come</l>
               <l>'Gainſt them and you at dreadfull day of doome:</l>
               <l>You choſen were as Fathers of the land,</l>
               <l>Thinking for King and Kingdom you would ſtand,</l>
               <l>Maintaining our Religion, as it ſtood</l>
               <l>In th'beſt Reformers time, that e're were good.</l>
               <l>Stabliſh'd I was by Orthodox Devines,</l>
               <l>But <hi>Pim,</hi> and th'reſt to contrary inclines,</l>
               <l>They think they're wiſer then our Fathers were,</l>
               <l>And yet will coozen, lye, and cheat, and ſweare:</l>
               <l>But 'twas not ſo in that Queenes dayes, whoſe fame</l>
               <l>To th'world is ſpread, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by name:</l>
               <l>There never was ſuch Schiſms, ſuch ſects as now,</l>
               <l>Preaching in tubs, <hi>Green, Spencer, Hunt</hi> and <hi>How.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>No, not ſo much as one man durſt be ſeen</l>
               <l>To contradict the ſayings of the Queen:</l>
               <l>Much leſſe to take up Armes, for to Rebell,</l>
               <l>And Parliament to count this doing well;</l>
               <l>No marvell 'tis that 'gainſt me they doe riſe,</l>
               <l>When as they doe our Gratious King deſpiſe:</l>
               <l>Yea, baſe Mecannicks, that doe preach in tubs,</l>
               <l>Did come to th'Court with ſwords, and ſtaves, &amp; clubs,</l>
               <l>And did annoy CHARLES, our moſt gracious King,</l>
               <l>Day after day they came (but did not bring</l>
               <l>Petitions in their hands) for to implore,</l>
               <l>But Brazen fac'd they came to <hi>White-hall</hi> doore;</l>
               <l>At which affront our King ſeem'd diſcontent,</l>
               <l>And thought not little that his Parliament</l>
               <l>Should ſlight him ſo, as not to take a courſe</l>
               <l>With baſe Mechanicks as did ſweare, nay worſe,</l>
               <l>Yea, ſpeak high Treaſon 'gainſt our royall King,</l>
               <l>Which he did hear, yet 'twas counted nothing:</l>
               <l>His Majeſtie ſeeing himſelf ſo ſlighted,</l>
               <l>Abus'd by baſe Mechanicks, and not righted,</l>
               <l>White-hall he left, to Hampton Court he went,</l>
               <l>Being fill'd with ſorrow, grief and diſcontent,</l>
               <l>To think that having reign'd ſo long in peace,</l>
               <l>This happy Peace ſhould now begin to ceaſe,</l>
               <l>And Civill Warre amongſt our ſelves begin:</l>
               <l>O what an age is this we now live in,</l>
               <l>That Subjects now againſt their Prince muſt warre,</l>
               <l>Yea, and themſelves at firſt begin to jarre:</l>
               <l>For they began an Army for to raiſe,</l>
               <l>Five members 'twas, bee't ſpoken to their praiſe.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Pim,</hi> he began to ſet it firſt on foot,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Stroud,</hi> and <hi>Hampden</hi> both apploy'd them toot,</l>
               <l>An Army muſt be rais'd, or wee're undon,</l>
               <l>The land with Popery will ſoon be o're run,</l>
               <l>Come ſayes <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> let's not make delay,</l>
               <l>Let's raiſe Ten Thouſand men, and ſend away,</l>
               <l>Brave <hi>Eſſex</hi> wee will make our Generall,</l>
               <l>And to the Souldiers wee'l be liberall,</l>

               <l>Great heaps of money, and of Plate, nay more</l>
               <l>Then for the preſent they could well diſpoſe,</l>
               <l>But what's become of all that now, God knowes,</l>
               <l>The Army being rais'd, away they bent,</l>
               <l>To meet our Soveraigne with full intent,</l>
               <l>To kill and ſlay all thoſe that took his part,</l>
               <l>But yet you ſee it was beyond their art;</l>
               <l>For I am ſure they have been often bang'd,</l>
               <l>And in the end I think they will be hang'd.</l>
               <l>What! take up arms againſt your gracious King!</l>
               <l>This is a horrid and a Heatheniſh thing.</l>
               <l>Stay, cry you mercy: CHARLES is no longer King,</l>
               <l>King <hi>Pim</hi> it is, the Round-heads would have him:</l>
               <l>Their Zeal is ſet all on a burning fire,</l>
               <l>That none a happy Union doth deſire:</l>
               <l>See how the rage of this great factious crew,</l>
               <l>Are bent 'gainſt kingdoms three, all to undoe,</l>
               <l>Such plunderings, and ſuch pillaging, nay ſtay,</l>
