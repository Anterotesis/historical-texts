            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>¶ To the Right Honorable and my ſinguler good Lorde, the Lorde Robert Dudley, Earle of Leyceſter, Baron of Denbigh, Knight of the moſt noble order of the Garter, Maiſter of the Horſe, and one of the Queenes Maieſties moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable priuie Counſell.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: <hi>Diogenes</hi> being demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what thing of all other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed olde ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and liued alſo longest: aunſwered: Benifite. The which (ſayde he) bestowed vpon an vnworthy perſon, &amp; of vnthankefull minde, dieth ſtreight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further fruite: but done to a worthie man and of courteous nature, it is neuer forgotten, but augmenteth bonde during life. So, my Lorde, confeſsing my ſelfe not
<pb facs="tcp:4853:3"/>
only bounde to your Lordſhip in mine owne reſpect, hauinge heretofore tasted of your Honour, but dulye remembred by my late Lorde and Fathers testament of his great bonde vnto you (who liuing loued and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured your Lordſhip, and dying was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſhew to the worlde that he was not forgetfull of your Honourable fauour and courteſie ſhewed him) and nowe alſo of my Lord my Brothers, ſucceeding him, whoſe bonde your Lordſhip still increaſeth to you with your large and friendlye loue to him, which doth no more binde him, than hee is nowe and euer will bee thankefull to your Lordſhip in acknowledging the ſame: I haue preſumed vnder your fauour to offer to your Lordſhip this meane Preſent as a witneſse of my dutie and loue, and of your Lordſhips honor and goodneſse, meaning for life to retaine with me a gratefull minde
<pb facs="tcp:4853:3"/>
to your Lordſhippe. Howbeit, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the learned writers of our Engliſhe Nation, and pervſe their graue and wiſe inuentions and diſcourſes of their owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, excellently writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our owne tongue, without interpretation of others workes, knowing that to tranſlate onely is a farre leſse reputation, than to be an Author of any good worke, and to bee tyed to others wordes &amp; constructions bringeth ofttimes in an other language obſcure and darcke phraſes: as I doe reioyce in them, ſo am I aſhamed of my ſelfe, that this ſmall gift of mine to your Lordſhip neither aunſwereth my good will vnto you, nor is worthie (as I wiſhe it) of your Honour. Yet my good L. let me humbly intreate you to esteeme (as <hi>Darius</hi> ſayde) not the value of the gift, but the occaſion of the thing giuen. And how much the gift of it ſelfe is but ſimple and
<pb facs="tcp:4853:4"/>
without curioſitie, ſo much the rather the ſame well conſidered, is to be lykened to vertue it ſelfe, which needeth no glorious ſhewe or oſtentation to the iudgement of the wiſe. By meanes whereof, I am imbolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this rude and homely ſtile to preaſe to offer to your Honor the fruites of my ſimple traueyle, and to dedicate this noble and pleaſant Treatiſe, which at the first ſight will ſeeme to manye a vaine thing, treating only of Beastes: but better adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they ſhall finde it within full of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, examples, and gouernement.</p>
            <p>Some perhappes will thinke my labour bestowed in the tranſlation hereof, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to your Lordſhippe, ſuperfluous, for that your Lordſhip vnderstandeth the Italian tongue verie well, and can perfitely ſpeake it. For ſuch as vnderstande anye tongue, in which any good Authour hath
<pb facs="tcp:4853:4"/>
written, doe rather deſire to reade it in the ſame tongue, wherein it is originally writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, than in any other tranſlated. Wherfore <hi>Plato</hi> the great and learned Philoſopher willed ſuch as talked with him of Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, to repaire to <hi>Euclydes,</hi> or elſe to reade it in his owne tongue. To thoſe I aunſwere. That I haue committed no errour to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it to your L. (vnleſse peraduenture in preſumption) to thend that ſuch as vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande not, may be pertakers of your gifts: and your L. that vnderstandeth, maye at your pleaſure and leyſure, conferring the one with the other, be iudge of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I haue made your Lordſhip patrone and my only Mecenas. As concerning the morality and ſenſe of this Philoſophie, it is ſhadowed by the maner and ſpeache of brute and dumbe beastes, and by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and gestes of their liues, which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
<pb facs="tcp:4853:5"/>
ſuch a veyne of delite with it, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst a number of Italian Authours, which I haue read, I coulde finde none better in my poore opinion for mee to deale in, and pleaſanter for your Lordſhippe at voyde times to reade than this. Wherein you may my Lord, ſee into the Court, looke into the common wealth, beholde the more part of all estates and degrees: and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour and common ſort alſo maye learne, diſcerne, and iudge what waye is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the trade of their life: but Courtyers aboue all others attending on the Princes preſence. A Glaſse it is for them to looke into, and alſo a meete ſchoole to reforme ſuch ſchollers as by any maner of deuiſe, practiſe, or ſubtiltie, vniustlye ſeeke to aſpire, or otherwiſe to abuſe the Prince.</p>
            <p>Thus my Lord, leauing further to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large mee, and to trouble your Lordſhip,
<pb facs="tcp:4853:5"/>
humbly beſeechinge you to take my rude paines and bolde offer hereof vnto your Lordſhip in ſuch good part as I haue ment it (deliuering it to your honorable protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, knowing my little labour herein to bee ſubiect to the cenſures and reproofe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that are readie to carpe at euery little fault, or finding themſelues touched anye waye, will miſlike a troth) with offer alſo of my humble dutie to your Lordſhippe, I humblye take my leaue, wiſhing your Lordſhippe and your noble houſe long life and happie ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſse in all your affaires.</p>

First, to giue occaſion that their wiſedome and learning ſhould be knowne to the worlde. Secondly, that men of iudgement and diſcretion reading the ſame might reape the benifite of their rules to direct this fraile lyfe. Thirdlye, that hee that vnderstandeth theſe examples, knowing little, ſhoulde by them knowe much. And fourthly, and last of all, if he were yong, and had ſmall delight to reade much: yet he may with a ſhort and</hi>

                  <hi>pleaſant waye be instructed with theſe delighting fayninges, and with thoſe ſimilitudes and examples taste the ſweeteneſse of the woordes, the pleaſure of the ſentences, accompanied with proper tales: and ſo (Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader) profite himſelfe, and teache others. In this their treatiſe ſuch wiſe Fathers haue hidden from vs woonderfull ſignifications. For a treaſure vndoubtedly of ſo high a misterye and doctrine as this is to be more estemed, than all the Iewelles of the worlde. This precious Iemme of knowledge, who ſo ſhall lodge it in the ſecreſie of his memorie, ſhall neuer loſe it, but ſhall rather augment and increaſe it with age in ſuch ſort, that he ſhall winne a marueylous commoditie to him: and of that plant ſhall taste the ſauorie, pleaſant, and profitable fruites, no leſse wonderfull then delectable. To reade ſuch a Booke (worthy Reader) thou must call thy wittes togither, vniting them and thy vnderstanding with the due order of the woorke, to knowe why, and to what purpoſe the olde prudent Fathers framed it: least thou be lyke to the blinde man, that wanting his ſight, taketh vpon him to go ouer Mountaines, Hilles, and Dales, through most daungerous and perillous wayes. He therefore that doth reade, must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what he readeth, and why he readeth it: and not to be ſo deſirous to come to the ende, that he marke not the beginning, and forget the ſenſe (full of knowledge) lincked with the middest and end. For he that readeth ſo, readeth without fruite, and rather troubleth the minde, and wearieth his body than otherwiſe, not forcing the benifite and knowledge of the truth. Folow therefore theſe graue preceps and ruled order, and let no vaine thoughts poſſeſse your mindes to withdraw you from reading it. For to finde ſo riche a treaſure, and not to know how to take and laye it vp: is rightly to folow him, that finding a Maſse of Golde and Siluer, had not the wyt to take it, and cary it away.</hi>

But ſéeing the ſummes ſo great that ſcant twentie men coulde carie it awaye, it gréeued him much that hée alone coulde not conuey it, and thus hée ſayde to himſelfe.

               <p>ON a time one earneſtly beſought a Poet &amp; an excellent Rhetorician (his very friende) to giue him ſome thing written that might be learned and eloquent, which
<pb facs="tcp:4853:10"/>

His friende conſented, and performed his deſire, and gaue him in a written booke (faire bounde and lymned with golden letters) many goodly ſentences, ſo that he began to learn by rote his written authorities, and laboring night and daye to commit them to memorie, he determined to ſhow that he was alſo learned. And being one daye in argument, not vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſignification of the words he had learned, for that they were not in his owne tongue, hée began to alleadge them quite from the purpoſe: &amp; being taken with the maner they lawghed him to ſcorne.

What? thinke you I am deceyued, that haue learned that I alleage out of the booke of a woorthie learned man, yea, and the letters lymned with golde to? at which woordes they laughed him more to ſcorne then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſée his ignorance.</p>

               <p>AN honeſt man lying in his bedde hearde a Théefe going vp and downe in his houſe: and thinking to paye him home (to take the more aduantage of him) ſuffered him to take his pleaſure and loding, that hauing in déede his packe at his backe, he might euen then as he thought take him with the maner, and iuſtly reward him with the ſwordes point
<figure/>
as he liſted. Thus debating with him ſelfe, imagining to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his purpoſe, (the Théefe occupying all this while him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe taking what he woulde) this ſtelye good man fell a ſléepe againe, and the Théefe with his fardell of the beſt things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any let at all quietly departeth his waye. This man when
<pb facs="tcp:4853:11"/>
he awaked and ſawe his houſe naked, hys cheſtes emptye and broken open, bitterly ſighed and lamented, curſing himſelfe, and blaming his folly: conſidering hée might eaſily haue ſaued all that he was robbed of (ſince hée knew it and heard the noyſe) and for very ſloth woulde not once riſe and defend it, hauing as it were the théefe in his handes. Knowledge therefore is aptly compared to a trée, whoſe fruite are the works: and this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is that we al ought to deſire, and to exerciſe our ſelues in. Were it not a mad part to leaue the brode beaten hie way, and to take the vnknowne and daungerous pathe? Euen ſo it may be ſayde of him which followeth his owne appetite and lyking, gouerning himſelfe thereby, (and not as he ought with reaſon and good order,) leaning to theſe worldlye experiences, which euer deſireth that that is profitable, but follow alwayes in déede things that are hurtfull. A man of ſuch life and gouernement we may compare to him that knoweth good meates light of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and the groſſe ill and heauie: yet ouercome with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire taketh that that is moſt hurtfull, and ſo being hurt, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone is the cauſe of all his yll.</p>

                  <hi>EVen ſuch a man is he whome affection ſubdueth. He vnderstandeth and is learned, and able to decerne troth from falſhoode, and yet will not put in proofe the true profit, nor once follow and deſire knowledge and wiſedome. We might bring this man in thexample of him that hauing his ſight good and perfite, ſhutting his eyes would needes be ledde by a blinde man, ſo that both they falling into a diche were drowned, and miſerably died. Euery man will condemne him for a foole, and worſe than mad, that hauing his ſight good and without blemiſhe, that might haue ſeene the daunger and ſcaped it, and of mere fooliſhneſse would not. Therefore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wiſe and diſcrete perſon must continually labour to reade, and to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande that he readeth, and must then teache it to as many as deſire to knowe it, and to doe the good workes of the knowledge he teacheth, that euery way he may ſhowe the wonderfull profit of his doctrine: for in this caſe he may not be like vnto a Well or Spring, which without any profit to</hi>

Prouided euer that he can master himſelfe, and ſubdue his affections. For to a wiſe man three things are pertinent: to wit, Knowledge, Richeſse, and Mercie. And of all things a man must chiefly beware of reprouing his neighbour of that fault he himſelfe is guiltie off. That he be not likened to him, which hauing a Perle in his eie, found fault with the element that it was alway clowdie, not conſidering the blemiſh of his eie.

But rather I will conclude, that euery man is bound to labor to procure his liuing, &amp; he may not make any ſuch caſes preſidents, in which it pleaſed GOD to ſende great riches</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4853:14"/>
                  <hi>without labor, as in this. For theſe are only the ſecrets of God, &amp; we ought not to aske the cauſe of his diuine goodneſse. The wiſe man therefore muſt endeuour himſelfe to gaine that he may, honeſtly and vprightly, trusting always in almightie God that he will proſper his doings and giue him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, ſeeking euer to keepe him ſelfe out of trouble and ſorowe: and not to do as the Doue, which breeding hir Pigions about the houſe (making them familiar with the ſame) albeit they are monthly taken from hir and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, yet ſhe leaueth not for that to returne to hir olde nest and breede yong againe, though ſhe know they ſhalbe taken from hir. We finde it written, that God hath ordeined the end and terme of all things, and that they can not paſſe. Therefore ſay theſe wiſe men, that he that worketh respecting the worlde to come, lightneth the burthens and troubles of this frayle life: But he that repoſeth his trust in theſe worldlye thinges and is wrapped in the ſame, doth waste and conſume his yeares. A man ought to labour in theſe three things, bicauſe he hath neede of them, to wit. To knowe to keepe the lawe, and the good ſtatutes thereof. The ſeconde, to procure things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for mans life. And the thirde, that his woorkes be pure and cleane with himſelfe and among others. Then he must beware and withdrawe himſelfe from foure other mortall and damnable. The first, is to be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in his art or ſcience. The ſeconde, to contemne that the law commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. The third, to credit all things lightly. The fourth, to denie knowledge. For he that will be reputed wiſe in his doings, must first conſider well what he taketh vpon him: and if he neede counſell, let him aske it of a faithfull friende. When he happeneth to haue great matters in hande, let him not goe about them raſhly, but first way the importance thereof. That he be not likened to one which being out of his waye, and going on ſtill, is the farther of the place he would go to. And alſo compared to another, which hath but a little hurt in his eye, and by continuall rubbing of it he maketh it incurable. A man must feare the diuine iuſtice, inclining him ſelfe to that that is good, and doing that to his neighbour he woulde haue done to himſelfe, helping him in all daungers as he woulde be holpen him ſelfe. And to conclude this our worke, he that meaneth to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande it, muſt order his life according to the lawes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of vertue: as ſhoweth theſe wonderfull and learned examples, and ſententious authorities.</hi>

            <head>The Argument of the Booke</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat tyme there reigned in Edon ſo manye Royall crowned kings, amongst the reſt there was a King called <hi>Anaſtres Caſtri</hi>: who choſe for chiefe of all his Courte one <hi>Berozias,</hi> whome hee made high treaſorer of all his Realme, a man right noble in his deedes, and rich of poſſeſsions: &amp; him he loued and trusted ſo much, that hee put his princelye perſon and whole affaires of his Realme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his handes. It happened one daye there was preſented to the king a Booke, in which was written many goodly dedes and ſecrets, and amongst the heape this was one. Howe that in India were marueylous hie moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, in which there grewe certaine ſortes of herhes and trees, which if they were kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
<pb facs="tcp:4853:15"/>
and confected afterwards in a certaine kinde: they ſhould drawe out of that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous compoſition ſuch a remedie, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they might raiſe to life again the dead. The king no ſooner read this wonder, but he burned ſtraight to knowe the troth thereof: wherefore in haste (as ſoone as might bee) he diſpatched <hi>Berozias,</hi> and bade him hie him thither, commaunding him to ſee if he coulde finde it true. And bicauſe it was a hard and painefull enterpriſe, he furniſhed him with golde and ſiluer, not onely ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but more than needed, that he ſhoulde not lacke. Then he deliuered him his letters of recommendation to all thoſe kings of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, praying them to further this worthie man in his noble attempt, purpoſed to good ende. <hi>Berozias</hi> licenſed nowe of the King to depart (furniſhed with money and letters) went into that countrie, and arriued in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4853:15"/>
preſented straight the king his maisters letters: by meanes wherof he was receyued of the Magistrates as was pertinent to the Imbaſie of ſo highe a Prince. And his meſsage deliuered, they vnderstanding the cauſe of his comming, offered themſelues with all the wiſe men they had to fauour his enterpriſe, and to further it all they could. And thus honorably accompanied of al the ſage and wiſe men, conducting him through all the Mountaynes and Countries there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, they had and gathered all they found written for the conditing of ſo precious an electuarie. And all they ioyning togithers to make this confection, proouing it a great while, could neuer finde it worke ſuch effect as to raiſe any one from death to life againe. So that they ſaw by proofe that all that was written in the booke concerning the electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was meere falſe and vntrue. This thing
<pb facs="tcp:4853:16"/>
grieued much <hi>Berozias,</hi> that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne to the king <hi>Anaſtres</hi> his maister and bring no better newes with him: howbeit conſulting with theſe graue and wiſe men before his departure, how he might doe, not to retourne home in vaine, there was giuen him by a famous Philoſopher of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, a goodly treatiſe, who ſerched himſelf alſo to finde that ſecrete, and in the ende he vnderstoode that it was the Booke which was ſo called. And ſo, O graue <hi>Berozias,</hi> thou ſhalt ſay vnto the king, and returne to him with ioye.</p>
            <p>The hilles which we ought to ſeeke, are the wiſe and learned men. The trees and herbes growing vpon thoſe hilles, doe beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken wiſedome and learning: which ſprings of the vnderstanding and iudgementes of the learned. The medicine or electuarie condited of thoſe herbes, are the bookes full
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4853:16"/>
of most learned writings, compoſed by the high and deepe wittes, and with this oyle or Baulme they reuiue the deade. For with ſuch knowledge the ignorant and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are instructed: whom wee maye iustly recken deade and buried.</p>
            <p>Therefore tasting the ſweeteneſse (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually reading) of the doctrine of the ſages, they receiue health and reſurrection. This interpretation greatly reioyced <hi>Berozias,</hi> in ſo much as hee beſought the Princes and ſage men that they would giue him but the copie of that booke to carie to the King his Maister, which (although the booke were alwayes in the handes of thoſe Kings, for that it was ful of Morall Philoſophy) was graunted him, licenſing him to tranſlate it out of the Indian into the Perſian tongue, with the helpe and knowledge of all thoſe learned Philoſophers, which was ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularlye
<pb facs="tcp:4853:17"/>
done that it bare the vaunt of all Morall Philoſophie. The Booke receiued with due and infinite thankes rendered to thoſe noble Kings and Sages, for the great honor and curteſie they had done him: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rozias</hi> departeth home, and being come to his Maister, preſented him the booke with relation of his whole entertainment.</p>
            <p>The King hearing ſo noble an expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo wiſe and diſcreete an interpretation, thankefully receyued the Booke, esteming it aboue any other preſent. And thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth he procured with great diligence to haue alwayes bookes, and thoſe he ſtudied, deſirous of knowledge, ſeeking to entertaine in his Court wiſe and learned men: iudging (as is true) that bookes and wiſedome are the greatest treaſure and delight to man.

To be briefe: Euery man (little or much) wetteth himſelfe in this raging riuer of mans life. He that wetting his foote runneth alongeſt the hancks ſide of this terrible Brooke, is a man that is oppreſſed with bondage, that enioyeth naught elſe in this world but miſerable lyfe.

Sure this worldly life repreſenteth no more but the little worlde of our bodie, which carieth a wonderfull preſence: and that little breath of ours once ſpent, it is then but a ſhadowe, duſt, and ſmoke. Theſe worldly fauours and temporall goodes in the iudgement of the wiſe ſeeme but as ſnowe, which with the firſt beames of the Sunne diſſolueth and commeth to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

Hée that can ſhunne the water of this riuer, which carieth in his courſe, Pride, vaine glorie, laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuiouſneſſe, couetouſneſſe, preſumption, infirmitie, and loſſe: may be called diuine and not humaine.

This valiant knight awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and hearing the noiſe of their feete in the houſe, imagined (as it was) that there were theeues: and they were euen vpon the point of opening his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber doore where he laye, when he togging his wyfe awaked hir, and ſoftly ſaid to hir. Haue ye not heard the noyſe of the theeues in the houſe that are come to robbe vs? I woulde haue ye therefore aſke mee ſtreight with great inſtance, after what ſort, whence
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4853:20"/>
and howe I came by all that we haue togither in the houſe. And ye ſhall aſke mee ſo lowde that if there were any at the chamber dore he might eaſily heare you: and I will ſeeme to be verie ſcrupulous to tell

you, then ſhall you bee more earneſt with mee than before to vnderſtande it: at length you ſhall preſſe mee ſo with importunacie that I will tell it you. The Ladie his wife being verie wiſe and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, began in this maner to aſke hir huſbande, and thus ſhe ſaide vnto him. O deare ſir, graunt mee I beſech you one thing this night that I ſo long haue deſired to knowe: to tell mee how you haue done to come by all theſe goodes you haue gotten togither.

So he gaue hir an anſwere at randon, nothing aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering hir deſire. She contending with him, and he aunſwering, in the ende as he had bene angry, he ſayde to hir. I can but muſe what reaſon mooues you (in Gods name) to deſire to knowe my ſecretes, being a thing that little profites you to know them, or not to know them. Be ye contented Madame, and ſet your heart at reſt: let it ſuffice you to fare well, to be richly apparelled, and to be worſhipfully wayted vpon and ſerued, although ye do not importune me to tell you ſuch a ſecret. Theſe are not thinges to be tolde, for I haue hearde it ſpoken many a time and oft, that euery thinge hath eares: therefore many times thinges are ſpoken which are repented of the partie afterwardes. Wherefore hold your peace, for I cannot tell you. To this aunſwere his Ladie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and louingly beſought him to tell hir, ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entiſing him with wifely traynes in ſuch ſort, that the knight wearied with hir importunate ſpeach yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſaid to hir. All that we haue, and as much as is in the houſe (but ſweete hart I charge you let it neuer come from you) is ſtollen, and in deede to be playne with you, in the nightes ſeaſon I ſtole it from this and that mans houſe, ſo that I neuer gate any thing trulye. His Ladie amazed to heare that aunſwere, woulde not yet beleeue it at the firſt, but ſaide. What for ſhame how can you euer ſpeake this with truth? being reputed here the beſt Gentleman in this Citie: and there is none in all this realme I dare well ſaye that woulde once dare to ſuſpect you for a theefe. Out a theefe, one of your worſhip and

You thinke it perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture a wonder that I haue tolde you: but liſten yet &amp; you ſhall heare more. Euen from my cradell in maner I alwaies had delight to ſteale &amp; filch, and it liked me a life to be amongſt theues that my fingers might euer be walking, ſo ſweete was the craft vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. And a Mate amongſt them there was that loued me ſo well, that he taught mee only a ſinguler tricke, and ſo rare a ſecret as neuer yet was hearde. And wote ye what it was? a fewe wordes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurations whiche I made to the Beames of the Moone, and I ranne ſodenly to embrace them, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon them quicklye into euery part where they ſhone. Somtime I came downe vpon them from a high windowe, another time I ſerued my ſelfe with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to get vp againe to the top of the houſe: ſo I ſtaid and went on them as I liſt, and did what I would.

And thus good wife (as I haue tolde thee) I made me riche, and now I care for no more. One of the two theeues (who gaue a liſtening eare, ſtanding at the knights chamber dore) heard all that he ſaide, and bare it away with him in memorie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuing it was true that he ſpake, knowing this riche

The chiefe theefe appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled like a woman got vp to the toppe of the houſe, deſirous to proue that in deedes which he had heard in words: So he made his exorciſme and enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment repeting it ſeuen times, &amp; then embracing the

beames of the Moone, his armes throwne abrode, he caſt himſelf on them, thinking to haue gone from windowe to windowe, and ſo hedlong he fell to the grounde in ieoperdie to breake his necke. But the

Moone for the firſt time fauored him ſo that he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not himſelfe, but brake his legges and one of his armes as God would haue it: ſo that oppreſſed with paine he cryed out alowde, lamenting his miſſehap chaunced to him, giuing to much credit to an others wordes. And thus not able to creepe nor goe, he pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully lieth expecting death. The knight leaping out of his bed ran to the crie, and come to the place, he found this vnfortunate and wretched theefe lying on the grounde in womans apparell, and hee gaue him many a faire wounde to lighten the paine of his broken legges and arme, and forced him to tel what cauſe moued him to come to robbe his houſe. Thys miſerable theefe aunſwered him (fearing leaſt hee would kill him) and tolde him the whole cauſe of his comming. But yet that that grieued him worſt of all was ſaide hee, that he was ſuch a foole and beaſt to beleeue his words: and beſought him though he had at leaſt hurt him to much with his wordes, (which he had dearly bought and repented both) yet that he would vouchſafe not to hurt him in his deedes alſo.</p>

That noble Romaine that ſought and laboured to bring the people and Communaltie to loue their Magiſtrates and ſuperiours, tolde them a pretie tale (to write it happilye in this Booke for him that knoweth it not) howe the handes were angrie with the bodie, and thus at variaunce would not for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice giue meate to the mouth: as thoſe that thought themſelues inferiour to no other member, and thought ſcorne to take ſuche paynes, and the other members not.

At length by chaunce there came within his dioceſſe a mightie growne Hart, who tooke his herbage there as his right alſo, and did eate and feede beyond all reaſon or meaſure.

his hedging bill at hym, and hitting hym full on the knee he cutte him ſuch a gaſhe, as he had beene as good almoſt haue howght him. So this poore Bull with his wounde was left in the fielde not able to go after the herde. The herdeman after the tyme of giſting hys cattell came out, and that the ſeaſon of the yeare did haſte him home to preſerue the beaſtes from the ſharpe &amp; bitter wether of the mountaines: he brought them into the playnes againe, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp his account of them all, ſhewinge in ſteade of the heighfare his caſſock made of hir ſkinne, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring hir death and the Bulles departure. Saying that the Bull beinge in loue with hir, (and in his chiefe pride) ranne his waye, and ſtrayed ſo farre, that hee went quite out of ſight and coulde neuer be ſet eye on agayne: ſo that the owner amazed with that tale quieted himſelfe.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was an Ape in our Maiſters woodes, which made many pretie toyes and deuiſes with his handes, for I that caried home the woode from thence ſawe it, and therefore I can be witneſſe of it. But one day being buſie to meddle with an Arte he had no ſkill of, in ſteade of a fiſh he caught a frogge. I ſay ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that a laboring man of oures went one daye to the woode, and hewed out a lode of woode, which laying on my backe I caried home. It fortuned one daye that he cloue certaine logges or billets not very bigge: and to make them fitte for burdens he hewed them with a long axe, riuing them with wedges out of hand, that the woode opened, ſo that giuing fower ſtrokes with the Betell he layde them on the ground in peeces. Nowe this bleſſed Ape got him vp to the top of an Oke and looked diligently after what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner this labourer hewed his woode in ſo ſmall pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and was verie deſirous (as it ſeemed) to proue it with his owne handes if he coulde likewiſe doe the ſame, and he had his deſire. The woode cleauer hauing clouen one halfe a ſunder, left it euen ſo, and went and layde him downe in the ſhadowe to take a nappe: ſo that the wedges and axe remayned in the woode. Straight commeth downe this fooliſh Ape from the Oke, and ketcheth holde on the ſteale of the Axe, and tampered ſo long withall that at length

                  <hi>IT is not good therefore I tell you plaine for you to deale in Princes matters, to ſearche out their meanings &amp; intents. If néedes yée will, marke well my wordes, and ſaye I tolde it you. Vpon my lyfe yée both in the ende ſhall feele the ſmart and payne thereof. The Aſſe perſwaded by his Mothers wordes left off his enterpriſe: but the prowde Moyle ſayde, I intende to know them, and therfore I will get mée to the Court. And I will you knowe deare Mother, that manuell craft is one exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and to knowe to behaue themſelues in Court is an other Arte. Thy wordes in part are good, to cauſe them refrayne from doing things they can not bring to paſſe. But to me that muſt remaine in Princes Court, I maye not go ſo plainlye and ſimply to woorke, but muſt vſe euery one with Arte, fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtill their humor: to deale in others matters with deceyt, and in mine owne to haue a ſubtill witte, deuiſing ſtill all I may to be chiefe about the Prince. And that that now I haue tolde you, I haue long ſince determined to doe. In Princes Courts he that procéedeth not ſtowtely in his matters, beſides that he is thought a Coward, they take him for a foole. What? knowe not you that fortune fauoureth ſtill the prowde and ſtowte? thinke ye my ſtowteneſſe will not fauour me, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the malice of vnderſtandinge, and with the pride of reputing my ſelfe of noble bloud, which preheminences ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine happie ſtate in Court? And he that hath the name to bée wiſe, ſubtile, ſharpe of wit, and with that to be of noble houſe: hath made him already a Cloke for ſinne, and a garment for his naughtineſſe. That that I haue ſayde I ſpeake with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for proofe therof I can alledge you infinit examples. The Pecocke though his faire tayle couer his fowle féete, yet it is not ſaide that he ſcrapeth in dunghill at all, but he is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the faireſt Fowle of two féete.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Wolfe was taken in a ſnare that a ſhepeheard had pitched at the foote of a hill (where euerye morning he founde the haunt and tracke of the Wolfes feete) and at that time there paſſed by another ſiely ſhepeherde, whom the Wolfe called to him, and made a bargain with him, that if he would loſe him he woulde neuer take any of his ſhepe, &amp; thervpon gaue him his faith. The ſhepeherde newly come to keepe ſheepe, like a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4853:35"/>

<figure/>
to the Iudges, and tolde them the pleaſure he had done him, and what the Wolfe did promiſe him. The Woolfe being brought before the Iudges, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that he promiſed him ought: and if they would needes make it that he had made him a promiſe, he ſayd that in that place where they ſay he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, he would go from his worde againe. The Iudges agreed, and went togithers to the place. The Woolfe being come to the foote of the hill, ſayd
<pb facs="tcp:4853:36"/>
to the ſhepeherd: was I here? yea anſwered hee. And here then ſayde the Woolfe before theſe Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges I doe vnſaye it againe. Naye ſayde the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (knowing his malice) it will not ſerue thee, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thou wert faſt tied in the ſnare euen as he found thee. The Woolfe glad to be releaſed of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (being in deede a ſubtile beaſt, but yet not drawing ſo deepe as the Iudges vpon the ſodeine) beaſtly ſuffered himſelfe to be ſnared againe as the ſhepeherde founde him.

Whileſt this matter was a doing thus, the other ſhepeherde commeth in the nicke that firſt had pitched this ſnare, and ſo tooke the Woolfe for praye (as of right hee might) and forthwith he ſlue him with his ſheepehooke.

If we ſhoulde feede of no other but of our owne fruites, wee ſhould ſeldome fill our bellies: ſaying, I will none of them bicauſe they are none of ours. Then turning to the Moyle, with a certaine louing aſpect, he followed on his tale. The worthineſſe of the minde and vertue, is that that is to be eſteemed. That ſure is the knowne ſhielde and armes of the true Gentilman, and not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

Who ſéeing ſo fantaſticall a beaſt with ſo great barbs, which ſomtime were a pale blew, ſomtime a ſkie colour, now chaunged from that to white, and then to black againe, he wondered to ſée thoſe ſodeine chaunges: and more, beholding his ſwelling and raiſing vp his fethers, putting forth that horne of fleſhe, he ſayde he neuer ſaw before ſo goodly a woonder.

And wote ye what? thither came a number of beaſtes of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie (vnderſtanding of his captiuitie) to raunſome him.

The Foxe hearing the ſounde of thys yll fauored noyſe ranne quickly to hide himſelfe in hys hole, where he lurcked ſtill till the noyſe was gone: which was ſuch, that it feared the Pullen, and ſcared him from his pray. One day this Foxe being on the ſide of a hill, hearde againe this fearefull noyſe of belles, and lifting vp his heade to looke about him, there he ſawe theſe bleſſed Moyles comming with their belles, and laughing to himſelf, was aſhamed of his ſimplicitie.

May not hée tell him with the terrible voyce, that I am afrayde of him? and out of doubt for as much as I can imagine, he cannot but be a beaſt of a marueylous ſtrength: and adding thereto the others treaſon, it is another maner of thing than to be but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde only.

               <p>O Faire Bull, and more than beloued brother: knowe thou I am Secretarie to the King of all vs vnreaſonable beaſts, and am ſent to thee from the Lyon moſt puiſſant and mightie, not onely of men, but of ſtrength aboue all other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4853:45"/>
honeſt beaſtes) and tooke vpon me this iourney to thee, and haue promiſed the King in thy behalfe (I knowe thou wilt not deceyue mee) that thou ſhalt come vnto his Maieſtie, adding further too, that if

thou hadſt known his Maieſty had bene at hand (as he was in deede) I was bolde to ſaye thou wouldeſt haue come to his highneſſe, &amp; humbly haue done thy dutie to him. Aſſure thy ſelfe he is a King that hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablye entertaineth, rewardeth, and requiteth any ſeruice done him by his faithfull ſeruants, and he is not alſo forgetfull of his friends good willes. And if thou wilt be but ſuch a beaſt as thou oughteſt to be,
<pb facs="tcp:4853:46"/>
I warrant thee thou ſhalt ſet thy foote by the kings, and bee no leſſe thought of than he, and will he nill he thou ſhalt be as well fedde euery day as hee. If thou wilt not come aduiſe thee, I haue ſayd, thinke vpon it: thou art olde ynough, therfore thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt or ſhouldeſt knowe what thou haſt to doe. He is King here, and will bee King too. If thou wilt not ſhewe thy ſelfe a ſubiect, the Kinge is to doe as hee thinketh good, and ſo I leaue thee. The Bull that had no more the white fome in his mouth, and had loſt his luſtie courage, wanting his yong and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted force, conſidered of it like an aged bodie, as hee had bene a gelt Oxe that had drawne in plough a xij. yeares, and aunſwered many wordes confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, running from one thinge to another, and thus they went debating and kneading of the matter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>githers a good while: the Bull ſtanding rather in feare than hope, which feare this Moyle with hys true reaſons brought out of his heade againe.

Then ſayde the King to himſelfe. O, what a goodly proportioned beaſt is hee? my Kingdome without his force were nothing. And euen in that
<pb facs="tcp:4853:47"/>
moment at the firſt ſight hee fell in loue with him. And nowe come to the Kinges preſence, this Bull kneeled downe, kiſſed his hande, and ſaluted him: and did ſo finelye and cunninglye excuſe his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<figure/>
in comming to his Maieſtie, that the Lordes ſtanding rounde about the king were rauiſhed with his wordes, they did ſo pleaſe them. The king bade him ſtande vp, and willed him to tell the cauſe why he kept ſo long in thoſe fieldes, and what hee ment to braye and rore ſo terribly.

And paſſed many things by the Bulles meanes, which his mightie Bulſhip gaue him gratis, for that he was as a ſworne brother to his Moileſhip. In the ende this Moyle gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen thus great began to looke hie, &amp; prouinder pricked him ſo, that like a beaſt (forgetting him ſelfe) he muſt néedes take vpon him to reproue his Maieſtie of parcialitie, and ignoraunce: and hauing no bodie that he might truſt to breake withall, he was</hi>

Wherefore he was forced to goe ſéeke oute the Aſſe his brother, and to make him priuie to the matter, knowing he had none ſo ſure a friend to him whom he might truſt but he. When they met, he beganne to tell him at large his whole griefe and trouble, complayning of the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the King all at once, that he had ſo long followed his

tayle, and had neuer any thing of him woorth his trauell: and if I had done no more but brought him out of the feare he was in, and to bring the Bull to his preſence.

So it fell into the king of <hi>Canatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> his heade to go ſee him alſo, and thither he went. Who when hee founde him deepe in iudgement of high myſteries (as he was moſt ignoraunt in baſe and meane things) he gaue hym great treaſure to buylde and ſuſtaine him with without trauayle. An olde long practiſed and beaten theefe hearing of this richeſſe, imagined ſtreight with himſelfe to ketche two Doues with one Beane: and one nyght he toke his iourney towardes this holy man, and when hee was come to him, pitifully bewayling the yll lyfe he had led, he prayed the ſielye foole to keepe him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4853:49"/>
in his prayers, and to teache him the good and holy commaundements of the lawe. And forthwith he gaue himſelfe to faſting and prayer. So that this holy and ſimple man thought he would haue loſt his wittes, and thus with his cloked deuotion by little and little he made him ſelfe maiſter of the houſe and riches. One night this ſtowte theefe caryed awaye a great ſumme and value, cleering the houſe of all that was ought woorth (as a Barbers baſen) and bought him a Hogge. This holy deuout man ryſing in the morning, and miſſing all his neceſſaries, hee wondered with himſelfe, but moſt of all hee muſed that all his golde, ſiluer, and thinges of value were ſhrunke awaye. Yet hee had ſuch a heade that hee ſtraight thought vppon the malice of his vnhappie ſcholler, lamenting much the loſſe of this ſtrayed, or rather altogither loſt man. But to heare of him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne he wandered through many a Countrie, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſeeking vp and downe, at leaſt to meete with him, though hee might not recouer his goodes, and it grieued him ſore to be in the middeſt of his ſorow, for the loſſe of the one and the other. This good man being in good hope yet, met in the waye with two wylde and ſauage Gotes, which were at dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye foode togither, and tried it out by the heades for lyfe and death, to which fraye came alſo the wylie Foxe, that ſtepping in betweene them both, lycked vp the ſtreames of bloude that fell from their harde horned heades, and tending ſtill this bloudie feaſt, not regarding the daunger he was in, they fiercelye meeting their bodies togither, cruſſhed this Foxe
<pb facs="tcp:4853:50"/>
betweene them both ſtrayght to death: Who deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly payde his prowde attempt. The holy man ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thys chaunce, kept on his waye, and came at length to a great towne: and bicauſe it was night, bichaunce he came to be lodged in a pore olde beade womans houſe that played the Bawde, whych had laide hir egges for hir ſelfe long time before, &amp; then was glad to haue others to lay egges in hir houſe, of which ſhee otherwhile liked to feede on and to take ſome little profit. But at that preſent time the yong faire Henne ſhe had in hir houſe at halfe of the profit, ſhe had a Cocke by hir ſelfe, and would be troden of no other. Now the Bawde ſeeing ſmall profit come of hir egges, ſhe tooke on lyke a mad woman. And the yonge Henne keeping hir ſelfe ſtill to one Cock, ſhe was not able to liue ſo on it. This made the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man madde for anger, inſomuch as ſhe determined one daye to giue him a remedie for this: and the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Henne hauing appointed hir friende and Louer one night, and prepared a certaine drinke to breath him in his iourney, and to make him luſtie, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſhe vnwittingly chaunged it, and in lieu of hir firſt and coſtlye potion, ſhee placed where hir Louer ſhould lie a receyt of <hi>Oppium.</hi> Thys Cocke ſleeping ſoundly coulde by no meanes be awaked: ſo that the poore broken Maide went vp and downe the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber like one ſtraught of hir wittes, and thought to go out for ſomewhat to wake him, ſaying that hee that gaue this potion had ſure chaunged Violles: and going hir waye abrode to ſeeke remedie, the Bawde thought ſtrayght to diſpatch him. And hauing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4853:50"/>
already a Quill which ſhe had fylled with fine venimous beaten powder, ſhee went and put it to the mouth of this ſleeping Cocke, and blewe at one of the endes to make it enter perforce into the body. But it happened farre otherwiſe than ſhee looked for. For euen at that inſtant there came ſuch a blaſt of winde from him that had the <hi>Oppium,</hi> that ſhee hauing hir mouth ready to blowe, receiued with the force of his winde the whole powder into hir owne bodie, which was made ſo ſtrong that forthwith ſhe fell down dead. And thus weening to haue deliuered the yong Mayde from him, to haue gotten the more gaine to hir ſelfe, ſhee quit hir ſelfe of hir owne life. A man ſhoulde neuer for any vile corruption relieue one, to hurt another. For neyther doth Gods lawe nor the lawe of nature beare it. And in the ende the worlde will hate ſuch wicked meanes, though for a whyle and at the beginning it ſemeth to fauor them. That this horrible fact and miſchiefe was miſliked the world doth know it, teſtified by ſo many written authorities: ſhewing that hee which gaue himſelfe ouer in praye to vice, and ſhee for hir wicked fact, were both buried togithers in one graue. The whole Planets aſſembled themſelues togither to conſult vpon condigne and ſolemne puniſhment: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not ſuch wickedneſſe ſhoulde paſſe without memorie, teſtimonie, and perpetuall record of eche others deede. And all ioyntly concurring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>githers in conſent, agreed to frame a notable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, as now followeth. They turned the Louer into a Moyle, and the deade Woman continuallye

This holy man departed from his lodging, and the night following he came to ſuch another, in maner greater, or at leaſt the like. A yong maried wife inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by an old Bawde fell to naughtineſſe, and ſtill as oportunity ſerued, the yong man hir Louer came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the gardein of hir pleaſures. The huſband being ware of hir trade, fayned to go forth, and ſaw all the becknings &amp; promiſes: ſo vpon a ſodain he returned into his houſe and without any word at all, tied his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4853:51"/>
wiues belly to a naked piller, and laid him downe to ſlepe behind the ſame where hir Louer muſt needes come in: who walking at his appoynted howre, and miſſing of his purpoſe, went ſtraight to the Bawde, &amp; made hir go into the houſe, which bichaunce had the keye giuen hir of the fore gate by this yong wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded wyfe. And when ſhe came in, finding hir bound, ſhe vnloſed hir, and ſtoode hir ſelfe tied in hir roume, and ſent this pleaſaunt wife awaye to fetche a good night. In the meane time the huſbande of this yong woman awaking, deſirous to knowe how all things went, he called his wife many times, but the Bawde woulde not aunſwere for hir bicauſe ſhe would not be knowne. The Goodman riſing vp in the darke in a rage ſayd, wilt thou not aunſwere me? with that he flue vpon hir and cut of hir noſe. The Bawd was whiſht all this while and durſt not ſpeake for hir life. The yonge woman that had beene feaſted abroade, and ſweetelye taken hir pleaſure, returned home, and ſeeinge the olde Bawde thus vnhappilye dreſſed for hir ſake, it grieued hir verye ſore (yet gladde hir ſelfe had eſcaped the daunger) and ſo vntying hir, bounde hir ſelfe againe, and ſent this wretched Bawde home without a noſe. The Bawd departed thence, the yonge woman called hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, and making pitifull mone ſhewed hir inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie: and that this is true ſayde ſhee, beholde my face (is as it was at the firſt) made whole againe by God (reſtoring mee my noſe) bicauſe I am true to thee, and to let thee knowe thou haſt done mee open

The fooliſhe huſbande ranne for the candell, and found hir noſe faſt to hir face (which hee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued he had cut off) as if he had not touched hir: and aſking hir forgiueneſſe, euer after hee loued hir en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierly, and thought hir honeſt. The olde Crone and Bawde returned to hir houſe with hir noſe in hir hande, and hir face all beſmearde with bloude: yet fortune fauoured hir in this, that ſhee was a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers wyfe, and hir huſband ryſing early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before daye to ſhaue the tayles of the Monc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyes of Portingale (for there there groweth heare on their Buttockes, and no where elſe) called to hys olde wyfe for his Combe caſe with razors and other trinckets. Nowe ſhe being thus handled as ye haue hearde, (loth to ſhowe hir ſelfe) put it to aduenture, and giuing hym all his conceytes wythin the caſe, ſhe reached hym the razors in his hand, the blades not put into the haftes. The poore man haſtie of his worke, in the darcke haſtilye tooke the razors in hys hands, and all to cut his fingers: and then for anger (feeling his fingers cut) he threw them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him with great violence. With that this craftie olde Bawde cryed out amaine, alas, alas, my noſe. And takyng one of thoſe razors ſhe al to bloudied it, and ſtraight ſhewed him (hir huſbande comming with the light) the bloud, hir noſe, and razor. The huſband aſtonied at this, to ſee this in maner impoſſible happe, ſhee ſtanding ſtowtely to it, cauſed hir friendes and kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks to be ſent for, &amp; pitifully complaining to them, they altogithers went to preſent this chaunce to the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4853:52"/>
Lordes and rulers of the towne, and made hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande be puniſhed. This holy man (as one in deede that ſawe this practiſe) loth to ſee the innocent huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande ſuffer for his wifes falſe accuſation: went to the ſeſſions at the day of his araynement to witneſſe a troth for the ſiely man. And as hee was bent to ſpeake in fauour of this poore Barber, he ſodeinly eſpied that olde beaten theefe that had robbed him, and whom he went ſo long to ſeeke, who was euen newlye puniſhed for an olde offence hee had done. This good man forgetting to followe the Barbers cauſe, and to doe that good he came for: cried oute vppon the Iudge for iuſtice agaynſt the theefe (as hee that in deede had more minde of hys golde than of deuotion:) and beſought him he might haue ſome part of his owne that was left, ſince he coulde not poſſible recouer the whole. The Moyle that all this while had hearde the Aſſes long diſcourſe, replyed ſtraight, and thus he ſayde.</p>

This pore Leueret ſeing hir ſelfe thus diſtreſſed vppon the ſodeine, called on the Beetell that was makynge certayne little Balles, I can not tell what, and bade him helpe hir. The Beetell fiercely turning to the Eagle, bade hir get hir thence, and let hir alone, for ſhe was his. The Eagle beholding the fooliſhe Beetell how

               <p>THere dwelled a great Paragone of India (of thoſe that liue a hundreth yeares and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer mue their feathers) a birde of the water, aire, and earth, in a great thicke cloſe knot of Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie vppon a pleaſaunt Lake, placed beneath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4853:56"/>
the little hilles ſpred ouer with herbes and flowers. And alwayes in his youth he liued (as his nature is) of fiſhe, the which with ſome deuiſe hee tooke by Moone light with great ſweat and labor. And nowe being aged, not able to plunge into the water with his wonted force, he was driuen to flie in the aire and feede on Crickets, which beyng fewe in number, he was almoſt ſtarued for hunger. But one day ſtanding by the riuers ſide all ſadde and malin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, loe there commeth a great Crabbe wyth hir legges ſpred abrode to the bankes ſide which ſayde. Sir Fowle how doe you? in fayth quoth he naught at home: for we haue yll newes abrode. I pray you what are they ſayde the Crabbe? Certayne fiſhers ſayde he that within fewe dayes with ſome engines and deuiſes will drie vp this Lake and take vp all the fiſh. But I pore wretch, that yet otherwhile had one, how ſhall I doe? I would I might ſaue them (ſince I am like to loſe them) for the benefite that I haue had ſo long time, and that I might take them out of the Lake, &amp; flying carie them into ſome other ſurer place. The Crabbe hearing ſo yll newes, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Parliament all the fiſhes of the Lake, and told them this matter. The fiſhes foreſeeing the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at hande, had preſent recourſe vnto the wylde Fowle for counſell, to tell him howe it ſtoode wyth them: and ſayde vnto him. If this be true, out of doubt we are in great daunger &amp; therefore giue vs the beſt counſell thou canſt, as well for the loue thou beareſt to this Lake, as for the ſeruice we looke to do to thee, honeſt Fowle. The Paragone that knew
<pb facs="tcp:4853:57"/>
there was good paſture and a fertile ſoyle, caught holde, and bitte ſtreyght: ſaying. The great loue I beare you (quoth he) deare brethren myne, for that I haue bene bredde, fedde, and brought vp in this Lake, euen to crooked age, maketh me truly to pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yee, and ſure I am and will be ready to doe yee any good I can. Therefore in my opinion (and yee will be ruled by mee) you ſhall doe beſt to gette you hence, and tarye not their comming, for they wyll ſpare none: all is fiſhe that commeth to nette with them. And bicauſe I am practiſed in the worlde (as he that goeth in euery place) I can tel you there are a thouſand places fairer than this, better, and a clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer water, and were marueylouſlye more for your profite and healthes: and if ye be contented, I wyll tell you where and how. All at once yeelded to him, and greatly commended him, (O fooliſhe fiſhes to beleeue ſuch a beaſt) prayinge him to diſpatche the matter wyth as much celeritie as might be. He wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led then ſome of them to get them vnder his pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to hold faſt wyth their billes by the fethers of his tayle, and ſo to trayne them on, hee dyued ſo farre vnder water that they might conueniently faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten themſelues in order to flie with the Fowle. And when they were mounted on his backe he tooke his flyght fayre and ſoftlye to the toppe of one of thoſe high Mountaynes, and ſetting them downe on the ground he eate them al at his pleaſure. This maner of fiſhing continued a while bicauſe it went forward day by day as he beganne, ſtill filling hys bellie. But the ſhe Crabbe that was rather malicious than not,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4853:57"/>
imagined that thys Fowle had wrought ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, and euen then there was a Tenche that ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued well ready to goe wyth the Fowle as the reaſt had done before, and this Tenche was ſo plumme and fatte that ſhee might well ſerue him for a good meale. In the ende the Crabbe ſayde. O Fowle my deare brother, I would thou wouldeſt carye mee to the place where the other fiſhes are: and hee was contented. So ſhe gate vp on horſeback as it were, and with hir feete claſped the Fowle about the neck, and he ſtreight mounted into the ſkyes, as one that ment in deede to let the Crabbe fall and breake in peeces: and euen then hee eſpyed for the purpoſe a heape of ſtones where he thought to woorke thys feate, to let hir fall. The Crabbe beholdinge the garbage and offall of thoſe deade fiſhes, ſeeing the yminent daunger ſhee was in, ſtreight opened hir mouth and ſeaſed on the neck of the Fowle, holding as hard as ſhee could for hir life: and ſhee kept hir holde ſo well, that ſtreight ſhee ſtrangled him, and the Fowle fell downe deade, the Crabbe on his backe aliue without any hurt at all. The Crabbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home to hir Lake, and tolde all the miſchiefe of the Fowle, and in what daunger ſhe was in, and howe ſhee had freed them all from his deuouring throte. Which vnderſtoode, the fiſhes all wyth one conſent gaue hir many a thanke.</p>

                  <hi>THe Foxe telling his tale, came to giue this counſell to the Rauen, that he ſhould goe into ſome neighbours houſe and ſteale a Ring, but ſteale it ſo that he might be ſéene take it, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi>

                  <hi>from place to place, ſnatching here and there till he came into the Serpents hole. For by this meanes being eſpied with the maner, euery bodye woulde runne after him, and then he ſhould let it fall into the Snakes hole. They to get the Ringe againe would digge into it, and ſéeing the Serpent, they ſhould by this meanes come to kill hir. The Rauen lyked the Foxes opinion, and robbed from one a Iewell of good value, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it thither, whither all the yonge people ranne after him, and digging the hole, the Serpent came out amongeſt them, and they ſlue hir. And thus with one little reuenge he quited many iniuries done him. The Aſſe that knewe his ſubtill prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes well ynough, aunſwered. And ſo am I of thy opinion, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if one deale with a foole, or with one that will put a viſer on his face, and that imagineth none can make it ſo faſt and fit as himſelfe, and that truſteth altogither to his money, eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming no bodie, and liues ſitting in his chaire without any care. The Bull doth not ſo, for I haue alwayes knowne him in his affaires no leſſe ſubtill than wiſe, and likes to heare euerye bodie, but ſpecially to followe the counſell of graue men in his matters. And touching this matter I dare boldly ſaye to thée, and aſſure thée, that the Bull hath a great confidence in me, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I brought him to the Court vnder the ſafe condite of my worde, (although it néeded not) and the othe that I made hym will make him beléeue me in anye thing I ſaye: and therefore let him come when he liſt, I haue done his errant well inough I warrant ye. He reckeneth himſelfe ſafe with me, but I will playe him ſuch a part as the vicious and wicked Foxe played another Lion (as the ſtorie following reciteth) being like to haue bene deuoured of him.</hi>

                  <hi>Moſt puiſſant and mightie Prince, I haue euen ſtriued with my ſelfe to hide the cauſe of my inwarde ſorrow, which in déede is ſo much as it can be no more. And albeit I haue bene many dayes in comming to your Maieſtie, ſeeking to eaſe ſome part of my trouble: yet I could neuer finde any deuiſe or meane to releaſe my heauye and wofull heart of any one iote thereof. And this is onely growne (O Noble Prince) of the great loue I beare your Grace, bicauſe it toucheth not onely your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in perſon, but therewith the whole ſtate of your Princely Monarchie. And I that am your Maieſties vaſſall and ſubiect, and a louer of the conſeruation of your Realme and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, am bounde (will I nill I) to diſcharge my bounden du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to your commaunde. Truely the trembling of hart that I haue ſuffered hath bene extreme, night and daye continuallye vexing and trormenting me, when I haue thought of ſo daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a caſe. The thought that pricked mée on the one ſide, was to doubt that your Maieſtie woulde not credite me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraying to you the daunger: and not diſcloſing it, I had not diſcharged the dutie of a true ſubiect and faithfull ſeruaunt to his Lorde. Compelled therefore to open (as is the dutie of euery ſeruant) all that that any way may fall out to the hurte and preiudice of the Maiſter, I come moſt humbly to ſignifie to your Grace the caſe as it ſtandeth.</hi>

                  <hi>be well thought of and credited. And he tolde me that the Bull had ſecret practiſe with the chiefe of your Realme, and that he had oft priuie conference with them. And amongſt other things he tolde them all the great feare your Maieſtie had of him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing to them alſo your cowardly hart and ſmall force. And he went ſo farre forth in termes of reproche and diſhonour of your highneſſe, that if his counſell, fauour, helpe, and good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment had not bene, as he ſaid: your Maieſties Realme (not knowing whether you are aliue or dead) had ben at this preſent brought to nothing. And furthermore hée did exhort them to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble togither for their profit, and to chooſe him for their King. Saying, if they would doo this for him, he would take vpon him to driue you out of your kingdome: and he being King woulde ſo exalt them, and ſhewe them ſuch fauor, that they ſhoulde not finde him vnthankfull, beſides that he would acknowledge the whole benefite procéeding from them. And moreouer (the worſt is yet behind) the more part of them, I ſweare to your highneſſe by the heade of my brother, haue promiſed with ſpéede to put it in practiſe, and continually they deuiſe the way to performe it. So that inuincible prince, take not Negligence for your guide, but preferre and entertein Diligence to preuent the traiterous prepared daunger, and to foreſée the happie wiſhed health of your Royall perſon. I was hée that made him promiſe your Maieſtie ſhoulde not offende him, nor once touche him when I brought him to the Court. I am he that euer lyked and loued him as my deare brother.

               <head>Of three great fiſhes, and what is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by them.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lmoſt vpon the borders of Hungarie there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Lake that bredde fiſhe of a marueylous bone, and that of monſterous great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as was to be founde or hearde of in the worlde. The King bicauſe of the wonder of this Lake would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to be fiſhed at any time: but that himſelf when it pleaſed him euery certaine yeares did draw it drie. The King forgetting the Lake a great time, and leauing his wonted fiſhing, three fiſhes grew ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of a monſtrous bigneſſe and vnſpeakable huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the which feeding on the leſſer eate vppe the ſtore of the Lake, leauing it in maner without fiſhe to that it was before. Now, as ſtill it chaunceth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing is knowne, the deuouring of theſe fiſhes was brought to the Kinges eare, inſomuch as hee determined to goe fiſhe the Lake for the three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring fiſhes to eate them, that the frye myght in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Order giuen to his fiſhers, hee went vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lake. My Lord you muſt know that euerye where there is of all ſortes, ſome reſtie, ſome liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, ſome knauiſhe, ſome good, ſome naught, ſome madde, ſome ſwift, ſome ſlowe, and ſo foorth. I meane, that of theſe three fiſhes one of them was malicious and ſubtill: the other of a highe minde,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4853:63"/>
and very ſtowte: &amp; the third was ſlothfull and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. An olde Frogge that ſtoode many times wyth theſe fiſhes in diſcourſe, to talke and play at ſundrie other paſtimes (the whiche knewe ouer night the drawing of the Lake) went the ſame night to ſeeke out theſe fyſhes, and tolde them of the daunger at hande: and euen as one would haue it, they were at the table with three great Eeles, although it were late, (for then Fiſhes ſuppe) and yet for all this newes they ſtirred not a whit, but made the Frogge ſit downe, and they beganne to Carrowſe when it was about midnight. So that within a whyle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken in their cuppes, (bidding well for it) their heades waxed heauye, and ſo to ſleepe they went: Some at the table, ſome on the ground, ſome in one place, ſome in another. At the dawning of the daye the Fiſhers began to ſpreade their nettes, and to compaſſe the Lake drawing all alongſt. The Eeles hearing the noyſe got them into the mudde, that the verie mappe of Nauigation could not haue diſcouered them. The ſubtill and malicious fyſhe hearing a noyſe, ranne ſtreight into a dytch, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a little ryuer where hee was ſafe from daunger of the nette. The other was not quick, for the nettes had ſtopped his paſſage, and bicauſe hee was ſtrong and ſtowte, hee made as though he had bene deade, hauing his mouth full of ſtynckinge mudde, and ſo floted with the waues vp and downe. And the thirde was called of the Frogge ten times that hee ſhoulde riſe and awake: whooe, but all in vayne. He punched him for the nonſte, and iogged
<pb facs="tcp:4853:64"/>
hym agayne to make him awake, but it woulde not be. And he, tut lyke a ſluggarde aunſwered hym. I will ryſe anone, anone: I pray thee let mee alone a while, let me lye yet a little curteſie and then haue with thee. Still the Fiſhers went on apace wyth their nets, and let go the water: and when they ſaw this great Fiſh aboue the water, floting as I tolde you, they tooke him vp and ſmelled to hym, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuinge hee ſtoncke they threwe him from them into the Lake agayne, and caſt him into the ſame place where they had already drawne their nettes, and ſo he ſcaped with life. They happened on the thirde, which was as a man would ſay a certayne let me alone, and drowſie fiſhe, and they tooke hym euen napping: and when they had him (thinking they had done a great act to ketch him) they caried him in haſte to the King (but by the way I doe not tell yee of the bragges they made in ketching thys Fiſhe) alyue as he was. Who commaunded ſtreight he ſhoulde bee dreſſed in a thouſande kyndes and wayes, for that he was fatte, great, and mightilye fedde. Now your Maieſtie hath hearde the tale of the ſlowe and ſleepie Fiſhe, I leaue it to your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe iudgement and determination, to foreſee the daunger, reaping the profite: or to leape into it, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ouerthrowing your ſelfe.</p>

               <head>A tale of the Flea and the Lowſe, and how the Flea was reuenged of the Lowſe.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here lodged an olde Flea in the chamber of a great Prince, and there dwelled with him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a gentle Lowſe. The one continually fedde vppon little whyte dogges of fyne longe heare, and after hee had fylled himſelfe he retired with ſafetye all the day, and walked at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The Lowſe that was ſtronger of bodie, and bit harder, many times draue hir from hir paſture: So that the poore Flea was madde for anger ſhee could not be reuenged. It happened that the Prince tooke to wife a beautifull yonge Ladie one of the moſt delicateſt and fineſt morſels that euer Prince taſted of in the world, and in that Chamber was his wedding bedde. The Flea drawne to the wedlocke bedde with the ſweete ſauour of hir bloud, conueyed hir ſelfe ſtreight betwene the ſheetes, and in hir firſt ſleepe ſhee ſweetely fedde at will on this angelicall foode. Nowe ſhee bit hir yuorie thighes, then ſhee gnawed hir breſt of congeled milke, anone ſhee ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hir delicate and ſoft throte, another while ſhee pretie playde hir, pinching that ſweete carcaſſe: and when ſhe had filled hir bellie ſhee leaped away, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4853:65"/>
went to take hir reſt, ſhunning the day light. The Lowſe attended to feede on Dogges fleſhe, (for at that time it was the order, that Fleas fedde of men, and Lyce of Dogges) and liued in Gods peace. The Flea, whome extreme rage did gnawe to bee reuenged of the Lowſe, went to ſeeke him out with this cloked brotherly loue, and ſayd vnto him. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though no cauſe mooue mee to deale friendly with thee, hauing receyued continuall diſpleaſures and wronges at thy handes, yet I cannot refrayne but I muſt doe ſomewhat for thee, ſince ſo good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is offered me: and I am the willinger to doe it, bicauſe thou ſhalt knowe I loue thee, and wyſhe thee well. Thou ſhalt vnderſtande I feede euerye nyght on the moſt ſweeteſt bloud in the world: and woteſt thou who it is? it is of the beautifull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate yong Lady newly ſpouſed. If thou wilt go in my companie I am contented to carye thee thyther with me, and will gladly impart my ioyes and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare to thee: and henceforth let peace for euer bee concluded betweene vs. Agreed quoth the Lowſe. And with that they louingly imbraced eche others: the Flea inuiting the Lowſe, and the Lowſe accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hir bidding. With this newe cloked reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion togithers they went, to the great ioye of the Flea, not for the atonement made betweene them, but for the opportunitie of time that had ſo fitted hir to make hir reuenge: and the more it gladded hir to, that hir owne force and might being inſufficient to encounter with his ſtrength, yet ſleyght and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſupplanted and exceeded hys force. The nyght
<pb facs="tcp:4853:66"/>
was come, the Prince and his Ladye were layde in bedde to take their reſt, the Flea and Lowſe lyke brethren leaped on the bedde, and when they ſawe them at reſt, and faſt a ſleepe, they diſpoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to feede, and lyke ſtaruelynges in maner fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed they layde on lode, ſo that they rayſed great brode ſpots like pimples, and red as a Roſe. Theſe vermins being now in the only gardein of ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, continuing their byting euen in good earneſt: this tender Ladie forced with their cruell and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous bittes awaked perforce, and ſoftly called hir Lorde and huſbande, and tolde him. I feele my ſelfe terriblye bitten this night with ſome vermine, and yet I know not what it is that thus hath diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mee. Hir huſbande ſtreyght called vp his men, and bade them bring light. The Flea ſo ſoone as ſhe eſpied light, like an old practiſer at fowre leapes conueyed hir ſelfe away, and ſo eſcaped. The poore Lowſe that was no great horſe to leape, was taken tardie, and not able to alledge for his purgation, as a dumbe creature receyued the lawe, condemned to die, and was committed to be preſt to death betwene the Maydes two nayles, where for his obſtinacie and preſumption ſhe thruſt out his bloud and milke that he preſumingly had ſucked of ſo noble a Ladie.

into the Pye, and ſet in foote when hee ſeeth his time. And for this time I will occupy your Maieſtie no more but with two words only of the Flea, which hearinge the cracke of the ſillie Lowſe laughed a while at the reuenge that others toke of him for hir: and to hir ſelfe ſhe ſayd. Ah ſirra, gramercy my good witte yet. Thou haſt done that on a ſodeine for mee, that all the ſtrength I haue could not bring to paſſe in a long time: and nowe yet with another mans
<pb facs="tcp:4853:67"/>
hande I haue pulled out the Crabbe out of hir hole. I am euen with him I warrant him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WHy, what ſhall wée doe then? if the caſe ſtande as thou ſetteſt it forth, what way ſhall we take? I will heare thée willingly, and follow thy counſell: with this condicion though, that in this interim my Realme and perſon be not touched, or that I ſuſtaine perill or loſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>INuincible Lorde, to haue any member feſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and rankle, and plainely to ſee that if it be not cut off it will corrupt and infect the whole bodie, and in cutting it off, the bodie remayneth ſafe and free from infection: what is he ſo madde that will not cut it off? The ſhepeherde findinge in his flocke (I ſpeake more reſolutely) a ſcabbie and infected ſheepe, doth not only cut off his legge, but riddeth him out of the waye, bicauſe he ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the flocke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SVre this ſodeine matter maketh me much muſe, ſayde the Lion. For one way draweth me to loue him, and that is the credit I repoſe in him, the long experience of his good gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his vertues and wiſedome, and bicauſe I neuer founde cauſe in him to detect him any way. The other thing that preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me much, is feare: which is a great burthen. I would faine therefore finde a waye betwéene both, that ſhoulde be betwixt loue and hate, or betwixt feare and truſt, and this it is. To call (if thou thinke good) the Bull, and to examine him well and ſtreightly. And if I finde him any thing at all blotted with this humor, I will chaſtiſe him with baniſhment, but neuer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue my handes in his bloud, procéeding lyke a great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:4853:67"/>
                  <hi>Prince. This determination lyked not the Moyle, as he that was ſure to liue like a wretched beaſt, and that his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice by this deuiſe ſhould appéere: and ſtreight he aunſwered the King. Your Maieſtie hath euen lighted right on the moſt ſtranglingſt morſell, and the hardeſt Nutte to cracke: if you meane to follow that you haue propounded. For he careth not to throwe at his enimie, that beléeueth he is not ſeene: but ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to beholde if it light right. But if he beware once he is ſeene, then for ſhame he ſticketh to his tackle, and followeth on his blowe, leaſt he ſhoulde be counted a foole and Coward both in his doings. And by ſuch like meanes I haue oft times ſéene a little ſparckle kindle a great fire. O my Lorde, he that fayneth he hath not bene offended, maye at his eaſe and leyſure be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged. Contrarie to thoſe that neuer bring any thing to paſſe that they would, when they ſpit that out with their tongue that they thinke in their heart. Therefore I am determined (if your Maieſtie will like my opinion) to worke another and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture a better way. I will home to his houſe, and as a friend I will féele him to the bottome and grope his minde: and he as my verie friende alſo (and that aſſuredly truſteth me) will laye himſelfe open to mée, I am ſure of it. Such paſſioned mindes will eaſilye breake out at the firſt, and they cannot kéepe it in but out it muſt. They are beſides that great boaſters and vaunters. For they thinke they ſtande in déede in that degrée and termes of reputation and honor that they imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be in, and they make large promiſes, and builde Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels in the aire: and at euery worde they ſaye they will make thée great, and bring thée into fauor, and when time ſerueth thou ſhalt ſée what I will ſay and doe both. It will not be long to it. Well, well, I know what I ſay. So that with ſuch lyke Phraſes and deuiſes, it ſhall procéede rightly. And thus in theſe traines appéere yet tokens euident inough and very notable. If he haue not capacitie and iudgement to conceyue mée, and that he euen croſſe not my meaning: I that haue an ynckling of the</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4853:68"/>
                  <hi>thing already, I will be with him in euery corner, I will not miſſe him an ynch. If he rayſe men, what order he hath giuen, and whether his houſe be armed or no, yea, and I will drawe out the matter ye ſhall ſée finely out of his naughtie fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call head. And if he go ſo priuily to worke that I cannot ſée him where he goes, nor know what he doth, as I am ſure I know perfitely all his practiſes: I will bring him to your Highneſſe, and when hée ſhall appéere before you, you ſhall eaſilye finde him. For his heade is not without feare, and his ſight very dull, and he will not come to you with that chéerefull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce he was woont to looke on you before. He will be verie ſuſpicious and not continue in a tale, and I know your Grace ſhall perceyue his malicious and ſpitefull practiſe by many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens euident ynough. And what knoweth your Grace whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the penne of his hart will not write all his thoughts in his forhed? as many times it falleth out vnhappily, contrarie to the diſpoſition of his thought that hath offended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THis fable filled the Lions heade full, and he bade him not ſlowe to bringe his matters to paſſe. The Moyle when he ſawe this geare woorke with the King, and that his brayne was ſwollen for ſuſpicion, ſayd to himſelfe. Nowe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bul is caught, we haue him euen as we would. So forthwith without delay he went to <hi>Chiarino</hi> (the Bull ſo called) and he was as pale and malincholye as it had rained vpon him. O your Moilſhip is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſayd the Bull: Ieſu what hath become of your Lordſhip ſo long? In fayth you haue beene longed for at the Court, that you haue bene thus long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But I doubt me we ſhal heare worſe than that,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4853:68"/>
ſeing you thus leane and miſerably conſumed away. But I pray ye how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it to paſſe that I finde ye in this wretched ſtate? you wil not maruaile I truſt I am thus inquiſitiue. For you muſt vnderſtand the

loue I beare you, and partlye the dutie I owe you, (where I may pleaſure you with my countenaunce or aucthoritie) are not to be put in Salt nor Oyle to doe you good, and to helpe you if you bee in anye daunger. Leaue off this ſadneſſe of fellowſhip, and tell mee your griefe, and I will vnfolde it well y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be it neuer ſo intricate, and ſpare mee not I
<pb facs="tcp:4853:69"/>
praye you, but be bolde of mee. Tut, giue me but halfe a looke, and then let mee alone. With theſe wordes the Moyle made aunſwere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>TRuly faith hath left hir habitation on the earth, and bountie reigneth no more in any lande: neyther doe I thinke your wiſedome can doe more or leſſe, than the heauens and celeſtial motions doe diſpoſe you to. Lorde, what a marueylous thing is this? that to come to fame and renowne by degrées of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, it bringeth a thouſand daungers with it. We neuer (or ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) doe well, when we followe our owne humor or counſel. And he alſo that out of the bookes of the ignoraunt taketh forth any ſentence to ſerue his turne, muſt of neceſſitie repent him when he ſéeth his folye. All the Stories of the worlde affirme, that a lame man can neuer go vpright. The Sages alſo agrée, that the higheſt places are moſt daungerous to clyme. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is beſt euer to beare a lowe ſaile: not to hie for the Pie, nor to lowe for the Crowe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THy talke brother Moyle (ſayde <hi>Chiarino</hi> the Bull) me thinketh is verye troubleſome and ydle, and without any maner of reaſon. It ſeemeth a folde of wordes that the angry hart diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth, and that hee is not in good peace with hys maiſter. How ſay ye? aunſwere me but to this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O My good</hi> Chiarino<hi>: thou art inſpired with the holy ghoſt, the Deuill is within thée thou haſt ſo rightly hit me. It is true the King is angrie and ſuſpecteth ſomewhat, but not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row me I aſſure thée, nor by my meanes. Now thou knoweſt verie well the promiſe I made for thée, and the beaſtly othe I tooke, which bindeth me in déede to my worde: and let it go as it will, ſure I will not breake my promiſe with my friende that</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:4853:69"/>
                  <hi>I loue for anye reſpect in the worlde, let the worlde runne on whéeles as it liſt. Therfore I will tell thée if thou hadſt not bene warned of it before. And harcken how.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Two Gotes my verye friendes, and of great iudgement came to ſée me, weening to bring me pleaſant newes, not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that we two are tyed as it were by the nauels togither, being both as one in friendſhip. And they tolde me for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that the Lion our King is marueylous angrie, that he ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked againe at the mouth, making ſuch verſes as the Cattes doe when they go a catterwawling in Ianuarie, and in that furie he ſpit forth theſe words. Euer when I ſée that Bull before me, I am ready to fall for anger. An vnprofitable body, and no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in him at all: brought into the world but to fill his paunch at others coſt. I can not be well, he doth vexe all the partes of me he doth ſo much offend me. Well, I will take order for this well ynough, and ſith he doth me no ſeruice by his life, I will profit my ſelfe by his death at leaſt. When I heard theſe words ſpoken, thou mayſt imagine whether my heares ſtoode vpright or no, and I could not hold but I muſt néedes ſay. Well, well, ſuch Lordes, in faith they are lyker Plowmen than thoſe they repreſent. I ſée they ſtie the Hogge to fat him vp, and ſo to eate him. O this his ingratitude and crueltie, (I cannot hyde it) and his ſo great beaſtlyneſſe togither hath taken mée by the noſe, as if I had met with the Muſtarde pot. For thoſe good qualities of thine, for that league that is betwixt vs (although I were ſure of his Graces indignation) and bicauſe me thinke thou art betrayde, I could not chooſe but come and tell it thée. So that good</hi> Chiarino<hi>, thou art great and olde ynough, looke well to thy ſelfe, thou néedeſt not be taught, thou art wiſe y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and there an ende. Thou art paſt a Steere, and a Bull full growne, nay rather a fat Oxe. But heareſt thou me, Gods my bones not a word for thy life: for if thou doeſt, all the fatte lieth in the fire, and the pottage maye be ſpilt and caſt on the Moyles backe.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:4853:70"/>
                  <hi>CHiarino</hi> ſtoode a while on the ground like a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed beaſt, as one that had bene drie beaten, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fronted with ſo malicious a deuiſe. Then he layde his hande on his heart, and bethought him of all his buſineſſe and matters: as of his gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, office, liuing, aucthoritie, and regiment: and knowing himſelfe as cleere as a Barbers baſen, he hit the matter rightly, imagining (as it was) that ſome had wrought knauery agaynſt hym, and ſayde. Well, go to: there is nothing breedes more occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mortall hate, than the vyle and ſlye practiſes of the peruerſe and wicked. Our Court is full of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious perſons, which ſtirred vp perhaps with ſpite to ſee the Prince fauour and lyke my ſeruice (being a coreſey to their heart to abide it) doe wickedly practiſe and deuiſe ſuch miſchiefes. They ſeeing (as I ſay) the graces and benefites the Prince beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on mee, making mee honourable, and heapyng great thinges vppon mee, doe procure by indirect meanes to make his Maieſtie turne his copie, &amp; me to chaunge my wonted maners. Sure when I loke into the matter and aduiſe it well, it is me thinkes a thing not to be credited, and it makes me not a little to wonder that hys Grace without cauſe is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued: yet in the ende truth I knowe wyll take place. God will not long ſuffer ſuch practiſes. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lawe wyll in any wyſe permit that a man ſhall haue iudgement before he be heard. Since I came firſt as a beaſt into his Highnes ſeruice, I neuer did any thing that my conſcience ſhoulde accuſe me in.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4853:70"/>
But yet I haue as great cauſe to bewayle my myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps come to me, as he that putting himſelfe to the ſea (and might haue gone ſafe by land) was thrown on a rock and drowned: and all through his owne ſeeking. All they which buſie themſelues thus in Court, and run from table to table, making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues great with this man and that man, ſtill whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering in their eares, muſt (notwithſtanding that the Prince rewarde them, or that he bee very well ſerued of them, and lyke them) looke to bee touched at one time or other, and vnhappilye to fall into the Princes diſgrace, and perhaps to remaine ſo a good whyle out of fauour. And this onely riſeth by theſe double reporters and tale bearers, or by the enuie of Courtiers, which is mother of all vyce and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. I dare boldly ſhewe my face euery where, for anye offence I euer did the King. And if I had committed a fault throughe ignoraunce, and not of wyll: me thinkes I ſhould not be puniſhed neyther for the one nor the other. The counſell that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes gaue him, hath euer fallen out well, and to good purpoſe. And if perhaps they haue not all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſuch effect as they ought: he muſt thinke For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune will play hir part in theſe worldly things. And this I ſaye for purgation of my vpright and honeſt meaning to his royall Maieſtie. I am ſure the Kinge will but proceede with iuſtice, following the ſteppes of the iuſt: the which will laye no violent handes on any beaſt, but wyll firſt inquire, whether the cauſe be iuſt, who are the accuſers, whether hee be a lawfull man that doth ſuch a thing, and if the
<pb facs="tcp:4853:71"/>
qualitie of the offence agree with the conditions of the accuſed, wyth ſuch other lyke circumſtances and ceremonies pertinent to matters of ſuche impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce. Hee that gathereth vnripe fruite, repenteth him of the marring it. Beholde the fruites eaten in Court: in the mouth paſſing ſweete and luſſhious, but in the bodie God knoweth verie bitter and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Lorde, howe manye doth the fooliſhe vayne pompe of the worlde deceyue and abuſe? I maye rightly take my ſelfe for one of thoſe, that ſcant hath taſted of the ſhadowe of his ſweeteneſſe, but I am euen filled with poyſon. The heauens beget beaſts, and they ioyne togithers: but I would I had neuer ioyned with it, ſince I ſhall leaue it ſo quickly, foole that I was, that I coulde not knowe the difference betwixt him and mee, and diſcerne his nature. Go you and ſerue in a ſtraunge countrie a Gods name. See what difference there is betwixt hym and mee. I muſt weare the yoke, and he muſt breake it. I am borne to labor, and he muſt ſit ſtill. When I haue meate giuen me I eate, and tarie not his rauening. Flies may liue abrode in the fieldes, and yet they flye into mens eyes: ſo that ſometime wyth death they paye for their comming, or at leaſt are driuen awaye with hurt and mayme. And to conclude, I feede on the graſſe, and fill mee, and hee feedeth on daintie fleſhe, and fareth well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THeſe thy wyſe reaſons, O</hi> Chiarino<hi>, ſincke not into my heade ſayd the Moyle (as he that woulde néedes make him beléeue he gaue him a remedie for his griefe, and preſented a</hi>

                  <hi>cup with poyſon.) Make no more wordes, for thou muſt put to thy hande to redreſſe it, and not to lament it. For yll ſtande wordes in place where déedes are requiſite. To ſhewe his griefe ſayd the Bull, and to breake his minde to his friend, me thinkes it is partly an eaſe to the heart, and a lightning of the minde to him that is afflicted. And ſo much more is this in me, bicauſe I ſee my ſelfe in great daunger, and like to be vndone. And although the Lion delighted not in my hurt which I may ſuffer, (and as thou ſayſt liketh him) yet the iniquity of my eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies notwithſtanding wil ſo preuaile againſt me, that the king will giue no eare to my innocencie. And I am ſure (for I ſée it in the Element) that the like will fall on me, that lighted on the Camell with an other lyke Lion: which tale followeth, and this it is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN <hi>Thebaida</hi> (a countrie ſo called) before diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of caues were made betweene the great and lyttle beaſtes, men abode with beaſtes manye times in one hole, and liued lyke brothers: and men were then ſo ſcant that they coulde haue no other men to wayte vppon them, inſomuch as they tooke vnreaſonable beaſtes to ſeruice, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of <hi>Olofar</hi> King of knaues, which at that time did neuer other but lie alongſt on the ground, and was ſo ſlothfull that he ſuffered the Snakes to come and rubbe his feete to prouoke him to ſleepe. Now this ydle beaſt dwelled neare vnto a Caue where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited togithers three beaſtes, to wit: A Woolfe, a Foxe, and a Rauen. I praye yee ſee what a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſhe fraternitie was amongeſt theſe three: and it might be ſayde. The beſt taketh vp the worſt. This
<pb facs="tcp:4853:72"/>
layſie Knaue bichaunce got vppe one morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes at Cocke crowing, and hee ſawe this that I
<figure/>
will tell you now. Certayne Merchaunts paſſed by with a marueylous number of Camels loden, and on a ſodeine one of them fell downe for wearineſſe, not able to go anye further. Inſomuch as the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunts vnloded him of hys burden, and caſt it on the reaſt, to ech one ſome, till they had it all on their backes agayne amongſt them, and ſo left thys Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell behind them to the mercy of the wylde beaſtes. The Woolfe, Foxe, and Rauen, chaunced to come
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4853:72"/>
that waye, and they ſawe thys poore Camell come as one that had neuer a whole ioynt in him, and as it were halfe deade. The Camell recommended him ſelfe vnto them, and tolde them by what meanes he
<figure/>
was brought to thys miſerable myſhappe. Theſe three were ſorie for it, and toke compaſſion on him, and as they might caried him to their Caue, where they refreſhed him with ſuch confections, as were fitte for the place and tyme. And thus they kept him ſtill in cure till he recouered, and patched him vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne. They three ſeeing ſo goodly a morſell of fleſh
<pb facs="tcp:4853:73"/>
as this Camell was, thought it beſt to preſent hym to the king, which was an olde Lion, and his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace not farre from them. The Camell hearing them ſaye we will preferre you to the Lion our Emperor, King, Prince, Archduke, Duke, Marqueſſe, Erle, and chiefe Lorde ouer vs, to be his Page of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie Chamber, lyked no whitte of that eſtimation and aduauncement, and would not vnderſtande the matter. Howbeit they made ſomuch on him, and clawed him, that they brought him on fayre and ſoftly (as his pace is not faſt) and he went as though one ioynt would not hang by an other. When hee was come to the kings preſence, he humbly kneeled downe, &amp; exhibited to his grace in writing the cauſe of his comming to him, as he was before inſtructed by the Rauen, &amp; kiſſed his hande. The Lion hearing himſelfe called inuincible, moſt puiſſant, moſt noble, ryght honorable, great Clarke, Suffragane, and Archking, ſhewed himſelfe very gentle, thoſe royall termes ſo pleaſed him, and woulde not deuour the Camell as the rauening Woolfe had beckened to him, and as that ſubtill Foxe had wincked on him: but hee made hym of hys Chamber, and treaſorer of his houſe. And moreouer, beyonde all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, he did aſſure him wyth ſafeconduct, and made marueylouſly on hym, ſtrokyng him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande tymes vnder the chinne, and receyued hym into ſeruice. This Camell that was fedde nowe with the Chariot horſes, and fared as they did, grew quite out of faſhion he was ſo full fedde, and his Cote was as ſleeke as a Mowles ſkinne. So
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4853:73"/>
that they that knewe him before, and ſaw him then, ſpighted him out of meaſure, and gaue him many an
<figure/>
yll looke. Yea thoſe chieflye that brought hym firſt to the Court, were they that looked moſt awrye on him.</p>
               <p>It fortuned one day that the Lion being a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a great wylde Chaſe, met with an Elephant, who beleeued and was ſure hee was the greateſt beaſt of the world, and looked in all and for all to be the greateſt Kyng, as he was in deede the greateſt bodyed beaſt. Inſomuch as after hote wordes, they
<pb facs="tcp:4853:74"/>
grue to luſtie ſtrokes: in the ende the Elephante ſtrake the Lion into the thigh with one of his teeth, that he pierſed it quite through. So that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſet one of his ſtubbed feete on the backe of the
<figure/>
Lion to plucke it out, that hee made him haue the ſquirt for wo he ſo ſqueaſed him, and ſaid: <hi>Cedo bonis.</hi> And the Elephant departed his waye for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt beaſt of beaſtes. This battayle fell out yll for the Lyon, ſo they caried him home vpon a wheele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrow after the faſhion of the Countrie, and there hee was ſtreight miniſtred vnto with ſouereygne
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4853:74"/>
Balmes, and within ſhort time galantly healed. The Lion continued hys dyet a whyle at the Woolues prouiſion, and his meales were ſo ſlender that hee became as leane and drie as a Kixe: that if one had put a Candle light into his bodie, it would haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen light as through a Lanterne. After this fough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fraye betweene the Lion and Elephant, not a beaſt of them durſt once ſturre to hunt, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe was more afrayd now than before, leaſt he ſhould meete with ſuch another banket. Yet being thus leane as he was, and ſuch a dearth beſides, he was ſorier for his ſeruaunts than for himſelfe. The Rauen, the Woolfe, and the Foxe that were all three in maner famiſhed, one day vnder good licence and coulour they painted theſe wordes vnto him. The benefites receyued from your Maieſtie, moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prince, before the Elephant had thus miſvſed you, maketh vs greatly pitie your caſe. Therefore we are all determined to our vttermoſt powers to go out to prouide you of vittayles ynough and more than ſhall ſerue you. The Lion gaue them agayne wordes of <hi>Sgratis vobis,</hi> and that hee was rather bounde to them, with many other ceremonies: yet in the ende hee prayed them if they woulde doe anye thing to relieue him, that they woulde doe it quickly without delay. Theſe worſhipfull beaſtes layd their heades togither, and conſulted on the matter, and hauing imagined many and ſundrie wayes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes, and not knowing which waye to bring this geare about: the Rauen that alwayes bringeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll tidings, ſayd thus. My maiſters, this Camell
<pb facs="tcp:4853:75"/>
is not of our league &amp; fraternitie, neyther commeth any thing nere our maners and faſhions, nor liueth not of that that we liue of.

So that betwixt our peruerſe fantaſie and his fooliſhe vnderſtandinge there is as much difference, as betwixt water and lande. Were it not beſt to ſhew the King that in this neceſſitie hee myght doe well to eate him, and the rather for that he is verie good fleſhe, and fatte as a crammed Capon. If any will obiect and ſay he doth all in the Court, and manigeth the whole affayres of the Realme, O beware what ye doe. Then may we aunſwere. What lacke or myſſe ſhall the Realme haue of any ſuch paunches? What wonders or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice doth he more than others? Howe ſaye ye, howe lyke yee my opinion: ſaye I not well? Yes ſayde the Woolfe. And I lyke it the better bicauſe of his heigth and ſtature. For I warraunt you, a good ſkeyne of threede and ſomewhat more will not meaſure his length he is ſo tall, but all the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for vs. For there is ſo much meate on him, that when the Lion hath eaten all the fleſhe (which will fill him, truſt to it) and taken his pleaſure, the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the bones will ſerue vs well eyght dayes. The Foxe was of contrarie opinion: and wiſhed rather they ſhould driue a nayle into the head of him to ridde him out of the waye, ſo that dying of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe they were ſure no bodie woulde come and eate of him, and much leſſe ſuſpect that hee were made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.

And thus ſayde hee we three ſhall haue meate ynough to chawe on, to ſerue vs galantly for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and fare lyke Lordes. Tuſhe as for the Lions good grace, let his Kingſhippe ſhift as he lyſt, neuer take thought for him: Gods Lord is not he King? he may take and leaue where he thinkes good. O thou foole ſayd the Rauen, art thou ſo ſimple to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that ſo huge a carkas as he will dye for ſo litle a pricke or hurt? No, no, thou thinckeſt thou haſt a Henne or Partridge in hande that are ſoone nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the head, and diſpatched ſtreight. I tell it thee for this ſayd the Foxe. Sure the King will not giue eare to it, nor heare a worde ſpoken agaynſt him: and all bicauſe he gaue him hys worde, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him he would not touch him. And what? thinke ye the Prince can with his honor go backe from his worde? no he may not, and I dare warrant you he wyll not. The Rauen that was the wyſeſt in the towne, and a Doctor in <hi>furtis,</hi> like a ſubtill Carin tooke vpon him the burden, with his malice to get out of theſe bryers well ynough: and ſo togithers they went to the Princes Pallace, and after they had done their due negligences, pulled of their cappes, and giuen him <hi>bona dies,</hi> they ſate them downe in their ſeates. The King ſeeing them come to him at ſo rare an howre, beganne to playe on the bridle, and ſayde to himſelfe. O bellie, now prepare thy ſelfe, good newes and God will. And turning him to the Rauen (that was reaching with his bill as though he would haue ſpoken to the King) he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him. Ah ſira, how is it with you: what ſaye you

Hée is rounde, plumme, fatte, and as full as an Egge, ſo that he will ſerue you a great while, &amp; alſo he is none of ours at any hand, neither yet is he called to any ſeruice for his richeſſe: for I haue knowne him a very begger ywis. The Lion cut of his tale and deuice vpon a ſodeine, and more than halfe angry he ſaid to him. Get thée hence out of my ſight thou and thy wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked counſel, vile ſtinking beaſt that thou art, that doeſt nothing elſe but plucke out eyes, a beaſt without diſcretion or fayth. Doeſt thou not remember what I ſayd to the Camell? Doth not he liue vnder my protection and warrant? The Rauen lyke an olde théefe let him goe on and ſaye his pleaſure. And though the Kinge grounded himſelfe on iuſtice, and ſought to perfourme his worde and promiſe paſt him, yet he ſtirred not a whit, no more than the wilde Bore among the thicke buſhes and Briers, nor once hid him ſelfe for all his heate and hote wordes, but tooke hart of grace on him againe.

He replied to the King, and told him a trimme tale with theſe wordes. Victorious Prince, your opinion is no leſſe good than iuſt, and I lyke it well that your minde agréeth with the greatneſſe of your crowne: but I ſtande in great feare that this your carnall holyneſſe will fall out verie hurtfull for your Kingdome.

               <p>THe King gaue very good eare to his profer, and bade the Rauen hie him, yet with proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo alwayes his honor might bee ſaued, and then worke with what arte or deceite he woulde he eared not, handle it as he liſted, neither would he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be priuie to it. The Rauen repaired to the conſiſtorie with his companions, and deliuered them his deuiſe and opinion. I would my maiſters ſayde he wee did deuiſe to ouertake this gorche the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell, for the King ſtandeth in it no more, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it ſhall be ſo.

ouer to his charge, as he that had made the promiſe to the king. Sirs, if my companie like ye, I will doe thus. Wee muſt haue the Camell with vs, that hee haue no time to preuent the ſodeine miſchiefe. All we foure will goe togithers to the king, and looke what profer I make, the ſame you may eaſily make without daunger I warrant ye: And after vs out of doubt this fat morſell will offer himſelfe to of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie (if it be but for good maner only) and I trow the king wyll vncaſe him, and make him leaue hys ſkinne behinde him. And when they had called the Camell, they went togithers to the king. The Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen (the cunningeſt ſpeaker of them all) with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable wordes began to ſaye vnto the king. Sir, theſe many yeares I haue enioyed my life vntill this preſent of your ſouereigne bountie, vnder your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties good peace and protection, and waying now the extremitie of your Maieſtie, it is more than time I ſhould ſatiſfie your goodneſſe to me in part, though not in all. But when I loke into myne owne weakeneſſe, alacke I ſee my myſſerie great, not finding any thing in me worthie to preſent you with, or fitte for your hyghneſſe. I am ſorie to ſee your Grace aliue halfe dead. Alas that ſuch a king ſhould periſh for famine. I haue not great thyngs to offer you, &amp; thoſe not worthy your Maieſtie, but yet with willing minde I preſent my bodye to you, take and feede my Lord of this my poore and ſimple carcas, die not ſir for hunger: for it better lyketh mee you ſhould liue for me, than it grieueth me to die for you. O it is but meete my Lord, that that which is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb facs="tcp:4853:78"/>
in you ſhould be ſaued, and the vnprofitable in me loſt. And here he proſtrated himſelfe at the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons feete, and made him way for his neck and fleſh, lying ſtill as he had bene deade. The Woolfe no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſawe the Rauen flatte on the grounde, but alſo with a Phiſicall hyſtorie ſayd, and repeated the ſelfe ſame word by word, and chopped himſelfe ſtreight vnder the kinge, that he might take his pleaſure of him if he lyked him. This maner of humilitie and offer lyked not the Foxe a whit, and ſteppe by ſteppe he came to make his oration, creping as the Snake to the charme, or the Beare to the ſtake. Now when the Camell ſaw him make no more haſte, he ſtepped in before him and occupied the place: and kneeling downe he ſayd. My Lord, thoſe that ſerue faithfully, diſpatch their ſeruice quickly: lo, I am here for you, relieue your famine. The craftie Foxe that ſtoode aloofe ſayde, although my fleſhe bee naught and an vnholeſome morſell for your Maieſtie, yet you may if it lyke you taſte it, and ſo hee looked downe, and layde himſelfe on the grounde. The Lion ſeeing theſe beaſtes on the grounde like drunken chickens, thanked them one by one, ſaying to the Rauen, that his fleſhe was full of yll humors, and if it had bene good he would neuer haue offered it to him: and to the Woolfe alſo hee ſayde, that his was to tough to digeſt, and at once hee put his deuouring mouth to the throte of the Camell, and ſet his gripyng talons on him, and tore him in peeces before a man would haue ſayde I am here, when the poore wretche thought he ſhould haue eſcaped with the reſt.

to all honeſtie. But the beſt was, the Lyon ſent the other beaſtes packing to the Gallowes and they would, for he would not giue them a bytte to relieue them with, ſo they died miſerably for hunger. Sure a fit death to aunſwere ſo wicked a lyfe.</p>

But take thou no héede to them, ſée them not, nor once harken to them I would aduiſe thée.

make any countenance that I am troubled or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but euen after myne olde woonted maner: and then ſhall I eaſily perceiue whether he haue ought in his minde againſt me, and that he ſtomacke mee. If at my firſt comming he doe not to me as king <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torcena</hi> did to <hi>Biſenzo</hi> hys Captaine, who hauing him
<figure/>
in ſome ſuſpicion, with his owne handes threw him to the grounde, and ſlue him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe Moyle liked not this determination, (perceyuing hys reaching heade to preuent his mallice) imagining that the</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4853:84"/>
                  <hi>King knowing his wiſedome, and ſéeing in him no alteration, would ſtreight thinke himſelfe abuſed, and then were he vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhamed and vndone both. Therefore fearing his fault, hee ſayde vnto him. My Lorde</hi> Chiarino<hi>, and brother deare (I will giue thee a watche worde to ſerue thy turne at néede) when thou ſhalt come before the Kinge, if perchaunce thou finde him very ſuſpicious, and that he caſt his deadly eyes on thée, and bende his ſhort eares, ſtanding vpright to heare what thou ſayeſt, or if any worde thou ſpeakeſt maketh him caſt vp his heade, or hang it downe: then (truſt me) beware of him that he playe thée not ſome part, therefore carie thy eyes before thée, and looke to his fingers, and ſtand to thy defence lyke a worthie Champion. For when he ſhall ſée thée prepare thy ſelfe with ſworde and buckler to reſiſt him, euen at that inſtant hee will chaunge his mind: and ſo by this meanes thou ſhalt ſee what he will doe. The Bull tooke his (as friendly) counſell, &amp; went forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to the Court. The Moyle alſo departed from him, and with great ioy flingeth to the Aſſe his Brother, and tolde him I haue diſpatched this matter. I haue done his errant I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant him. I knowe he knoweth his payne by this time, ſéeſt thou? Well I ſayd and did ſo much, that at the laſt I brought him to it. And though I had great labor to bring it to paſſe, yet better late than neuer. My ſubtill and malicious practiſes at length yet are brought to good purpoſe I thanke God. Oh what fame ſhall I get, ſhe ſhall be full of eyes though I haue ſéene light. Sounde thy trumpet once Ladie Fame through all the Countries round about, farre and néere: and if my practiſe fall out right, thou neuer ſoundedſt in thy life ſo goodly a double treaſon. O what a perfite counſeller ſhould I be, how trimly coulde I bring a ſpouſe to bedde? be of good cheare brother, the Bull perſwaded by me goth to the Court to ſéeke out the King, if he ſee him ſturre any thing at all: and the Lion alſo hath my Coccomber in his bodie, and in his heade the toyes and deuiſes that I haue tolde him, looking for the Bull with many an yll</hi>

               <p>WHen the Bull was come to the Kinges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, &amp; that he ſaw his head ful of ſuſpicion, and perceyued in him thoſe ſignes &amp; tokens that trayterous villeyne the Moyle had tolde him,
<pb facs="tcp:4853:85"/>
imagining preſently the kings pawes on his backe, and his mouth on his throte, remembringe the Moyles peſtilent counſell, he ſtoode ſtreight to his defence. And the King on the other ſide ſuppoſed he ment to aſſault him, and being informed before by the Moyle hee thought it ſure ſo, and that it was true that the Moyle tolde him: therfore without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further daliance, or tarying his meaning, he row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe, and on him he goeth, ſo that they began
<figure/>
a fierſe battayle, howbeit in the ende the olde Lyon wearied the Bull, that he laye deade before him, for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4853:85"/>
ſuch is the iuſtice amongeſt the Nobilitie and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull Courtiers of beaſts. And yet though the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ſtronger than the Bull: dealing wyth deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate perſons, he had but a bloudie victorie. The caſe was ſuch, and ſo ſodeine, that all the Court was full of ſorowe, and the more for that it happened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for, and neuer a worde ſpoken of it before: ſo that they were all by this chaunce ſtricken into a marueylous feare. The Aſſe beinge informed of
<figure/>
the terror of the matter was very heauy, and angry with his brother, inſomuch as he ſayde to him: O
<pb facs="tcp:4853:86"/>
curſed brother, thou haſt done a horrible and wicked fact. Haſt thou not almoſt brought the Kinge to deathes doore, cauſed thy friende to bee ſlayne, and put all the Court in feare, daunger, and ſorowe? and woorſt of all, thou haſt loſt thy credite and good name, ſhamed thy ſelfe, and for euer defamed thy houſe and parentage. And if thy wicked practiſe were knowne, what ſhould (thinkeſt thou) become of thy life? Oh caytyfe wretch. I ſaye no more Moyle, but marke the ende, this miſchiefe will fall on thy neck, and thou ſhalt gather of thy naughtye ſeede thou ſowedſt, naught elſe but prickes and thornes. For thy barren and drie grounde can bring forth nothing but Burres and Brambles. Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine iuſtice will not ſuffer ſuch and ſo wicked a dede vnpuniſhed. And though preſently it lighteth not on thy heade, the deferring of it will ſhowe thee howe much the whip with time doth growe. Oh brutiſhe creature thou: neuer to feare God, nor to loue thy neighbour, but alwayes to follow thy ſelfe, and to purſue thy beaſtly minde wythout regarde? thou mayntayneſt thy ambition, &amp; wyth that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſubuert and ouerthrow a thouſand Realmes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe trayterous Moyle hoong downe his heade all the while, and knewe well ynough that it was true the Aſſe ſayd, and that he miſſed not much the marke, yet he helde his peace, and would not aunſwere one worde. So the Aſſe followed on his tale, and came againe to the matter. I ſée my wordes but loſt, and worke ſmall effect: and I am ſure there is no rebuke more caſt away and blowne into the winde, than that that is giuen him, that is neyther capable of it, nor honeſt and iuſt: nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

In this meane while one of the Apes had ſpyed a Glowe worme in a hedge that ſhoweth like fire: and beleuing it had bene fire in deede, they ranne all to go fetch ſtrawe, ſtickes, and drie Pines to lay vppon hir, being verie deſirous to warme them.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Maker of Playes, dwellinge in a towne called <hi>Baccheretto,</hi> gaue to a rich Merchant a Pie (which one of his boyes that playde a part euer in his playes had brought vppe:) that had a propertie to blabbe and tell all that ſhe ſaw done in the houſe. This Merchant had a faire wife, which wantonly choſe to hyde hir ſelfe otherwhile with a goodly yong man hir neighbour. The huſbande was many times told of it, and did in maner perceiue ſomewhat himſelfe too: but bicauſe it was but ſuſpition and no proofe (and if he ſhould haue ſtirred in it he had not beene able to haue taken his othe that it was true) he ſtode betweene two waters, as he that was verie loth to beleeue it. And as in ſuch caſes it falleth out many times, that the ſeruants and familie (for the loue of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4853:88"/>
their Miſtreſſe) doe depende rather of their Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe than of their Maiſter, and are readyer to pleaſe hir of both. The huſbande ſeeking diuerſe meanes to come to the light of this matter, coulde neuer get out of them, but ſure ſir it is not ſo, you are deceyued. The good man perplexed in his minde, not knowing what way to deuiſe to boulte out this matter, remembred at the laſt that the Pye hee had in his Chamber (vpon the windowe) woulde ſerue his turne excellentlye well for the purpoſe, ſo hee brought hir to his wiues Chamber, as though hee had not cared for hir (meaning nothing leſſe) and there he left hir a fewe dayes. When he thought the Meale had bene boulted, hee cauſed the Pye to be brought againe into his Chamber, and ſhee tolde him all things directly as they were done, ſo that he determined to puniſhe hir lewde life. But as many doe, whome loue doth no leſſe ouercome than pitie, he let it alone yet many dayes. All this while hee hong vp the Pie in hir cage in the hall, and at night made hir be fetched in, and then hee knewe all that was done in the day from point to point, &amp; what had happened. Who was there, if hir Miſtreſſe went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode, how many poundes of Flaxe the Maides had ſponne, and how many times the ſeruants had ſet on the Flaxe of the Rock and pulled it off againe: when, what, and how. O what a vile craftie Pye was ſhe. The poore Maydes of the houſe neuer thought ſhe coulde haue tolde any thing in the worlde, nor made any reckening of hir at all. The huſband at the firſt beganne to groyne and lowre, and to caſt forth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
<pb facs="tcp:4853:89"/>
wordes and Parables to his wife, the which ſeemed not to vnderſtande him, though ſhee knewe his meaning well ynough, and ſuſpected that ſome of the houſe had opened the matter. Howbeit not able to burthen anye one particularly, bicauſe ſhee woulde be ſure not to miſſe, ſhee flatly fell out wyth them all, and tooke on with them to badde, brawling and ſcolding vp and downe the houſe lyke a madde woman all the day long. In continuaunce of time, whether it was that they ſtarued the poore Pye, or how the goodyeare the matter fell out I know not, but the Pye had founde hir tongue &amp; ſpake plainely to them, and ſayde: giue me ſome meate, or I will tell my maiſter. When they hearde hir prate thus, imagine you what ſport the women had with hir. And bicauſe ſhe was a beaſt, out ſhe tattled at once all that ſhe knewe of the men as well as of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: ſo that ſhe tolde them how hir Maiſter would aſke hir how they vſed hir, and what they did, and counterfeited his faſhions and ieſtures rightly, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king queſtions, and aunſwering hir ſelfe, euen as if hir maiſter had bene preſent to haue aſked hir.</p>
               <p>The Myſtreſſe and Maydes gladde they had found out the tale bearer, they came about hir with a light, and ſhut to the windowes, and with viſers on their face, diſguiſed, they daunced ſuch a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe about hir with Glaſſes, Fire, Water, and ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Belles, beating on the bourdes, ſhowting, and whooping, that it would haue made the wheele of a Myll deafe it was ſo terrible. And after they had done this, returning euerye thing to his place,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4853:89"/>
and openinge the Wyndowes as they were at the firſt, there they left hir alone, and woulde giue hir neuer a bitte of meate. When the Merchaunt hir maiſter was come home, and that he cauſed the Pye to be brought into his Chamber, ſhe beganne to lay out hir tongue at large, and ſayde. O Maiſter, I haue had an yll night to daye, there hath bene ſuch rayne, tempeſts, and ſuch noyſes, and I haue ſeene a number of Pyes paſſe by my Cage, but none of them all would tarie with me. O what a fooliſh time was it: yet in a moment the winde and water cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſo it was daye againe. Bid them giue mee ſome meate that I might dine, for it is eight a clock, and I am a hungred. The Merchaunt when hee heard hir ſpeake thus fooliſhly, and tell theſe fables, hee thought they were but toyes in hir heade, and that ſhee talked at pleaſure, nothing touchinge hir Myſtreſſe matters, and ſo let it paſſe for that tyme. One nyght the Merchaunt determined to lye out, and ſo he did, and left the Pye in hys wyues Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. As ſoone as it was darke his wife ſent for hir Louer, and ſtreight cauſed the Pye to bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye (hir Cage couered ouer) and caried into a Well: and when he that caried hir had let hir Cage downe a pretie deale into the Welle, he vncouered it againe, tying it faſt at the toppe of the Well for fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into it, and being Moonelight the ſame night, the ſeruaunt departed his waye without ſpeaking to hir, or ſeeing hir, and ſo let hir hange. A little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day the good wife of the houſe made the Cage bee couered agayne trimlye, and brought into the
<pb facs="tcp:4853:90"/>
Chamber, and ſo vncouering it in the darcke, fell a ſleepe againe (hir Louer being gone) till brode day. The Merchant came home betimes in the morning before ſunne riſing, and went ſtreight to the cage in his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. The Pie that hong in the Welle al night and knewe not in what place ſhee was in, nor what houſe it was, would very gladly haue tolde hir mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter all, and thus ſhe began. Maiſter, the Chamber was caried quite awaye to night, and I was in a great round Glaſſe with water at the ſunne ſhine of the daye, all night long almoſt, and then the Glaſſe and Cage was remoued, but I cannot tell whither: and ſo God gyue you good morrow maiſter. Nowe God giue thee ſorrow (quoth the Merchaunt) wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked beaſt that thou art: for throughe thy foolyſhe wordes I had well nere paide my pore Ione on the Petticote for thy ſake. And with that he ranne to the bed and imbraced his wife and ſweetely buſſed hir. His wyfe that ſawe hir time come now to be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and to free hir ſelfe of hir huſbandes conceyued ielouſie, cauſed the ſlouenly Wittall hir huſbande to tell hir al the Pies qualities &amp; tales ſhe had brought him: which when ſhe had hearde, out on hir whoore quoth ſhe, kill hir ylfauored harlotry, what meaneſt thou to kepe that fooliſh Birde? Hir huſband being rather in a rage than well pleaſed, bicauſe he would not gladly haue knowne that that his wife had tolde him. Toke the cage and the Pie and thrue hir out at the window, &amp; with the fall the pore wretch died out of hand. Therfore none muſt intermeddle in thyngs that belongeth not to them, neyther in wordes nor

But when they were come to the walles of the Citie, they altered their mindes, and one of them ſayde to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Let vs deuide the treaſure, that eche may carie home his part, and doe withall as he thinketh good. The other that was reſolued to ſteale it, and to haue it al to himſelf, meaning to eaſe the good honeſt man of his part, aunſwered <hi>ex tempore</hi> for his profite. Mee thinketh good brother it is not meete that our happe ſhould be common, and the friendſhip perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: but lyke as we met in pouertie, ſo let vs ioyne in richeſſe. Therefore for my part I will not deuide it, but we will enioye it friendly togithers, and the good happe that lighted euenly vpon vs. Howbeit for this time (if thou thinke good) let vs take a peece out to ſerue our neceſſitie with, to defraie houſholde expences, and other extraordinarie charges: and for the reaſt, it ſhall not be amiſſe if it runne in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon betwixt vs, and we will hyde it in the darke in ſome ſecrete place, ſo as we maye from time to time (alwayes as we nede it) take of it at our pleaſures. The good ſielye man (I will not ſaye foole) did not thinke of his pretenſed ſubtiltie, and that hee went about then lyke a falſe Knaue to deceyue him, but tooke him for a playne meaning man lyke himſelfe, and ſayde he was contented it ſhould be ſo. So for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4853:91"/>
companye they tooke eche of them his burthen, and the reſt they ſafely buried vnder the roote of an olde Elme, which the poore neyghbours that dwelled by called vile Knaue, and ſo with the little burden of their neceſſarie expences, ech of them repayred to their lodginges. Within three houres of the ſame night, the Companion that gaue counſell to leaue it abrode, went to the place of the hidden treaſure, and ſecretly caried it home with him. When tyme had conſumed the honeſt mans money, hee went to the theefe his partener, and ſayde to him. Brother I woulde gladly haue the reaſt of my part of the golde that remayneth behinde, let vs goe therefore I pray thee togithers as wee togithers did fynde and hyde it, and we will bring it home betwixt vs: for I aſſure thee I am in great neede. Of mine honeſtie well ſayde (quoth the theefe his companion) we are happily met: for I was euen nowe thinking of that thou telleſt me, and I promiſe thee I was comming to thee of the ſame errant. But now thou art come, in fayth welcome, thou haſt ſaued me ſo much labor: come on, gowe, let vs take our horſes and awaye, wee will not dwell long about this matter I trowe, we will handle it ſo nimbly thou ſhalt ſee: and then we ſhall liue merilye without anye care or thought, and neede not feare robbing. Now when they were come to the vyle Knaue (the Elme ſo called) where they had buried their treaſure, beinge a great and hollow tree, they began to digge for it, but in faith they might dig vnder the tree till their hartes aked, as deepe and as farre as they liſted, for the treaſure
<pb facs="tcp:4853:92"/>
was flowen. The theefe then played the Harlots part rightly, that weepeth and lamenteth to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt woman: and beganne to tell him there was no more fayth in friends, and that loue was loſt. Truſt that truſt lyſt, for by the Maſſe I will neuer truſt agayne. And when hee had often repeated this, hee beganne to throwe awaye his cappe, to crye out, and beate himſelfe, that he was lyke a madde man, nay a very bedlem in dede. His fellow that was no naturall, though he were ſomewhat lyke a Mome, woulde not bee lowted ſo, but rather laughed to ſee his knauerie and crafte, thinking notwithſtanding that he had ſtollen it (as he had in deede) but yet hee ſtoode in doubt, laughing ſtill. Then the theefe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged like a beaſt (as if he had had reaſon on his ſyde) and ſayde. None, no none but thou traytor, theefe, and villen (as thou art) coulde ſteale this. The ſiely man that of both had cauſe to complayne (all hope taken from him to recouer his part) in ſteade of accuſing him, it ſtoode him in hande to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to ſweare and forſweare: ſaying I cannot tell of it, I ſaw it not, I touched it not, neither did I once think of it till now. But tut al would not ſerue, nor ſtaye the theefe, but hee cried out more and more (and that alowde) and called him al to naught. Oh traytor, oh ſlaue, and micherlye theefe, who but thou knew of this? What man alyue but thou could once haue layde hands on it? Tarie a little, by Gods paſſion I will tell my L.

                  <hi>THis brawling and ſcolding continued a good while betwéene them, in the ende they went both to the Mayor: who after longe cauillations, intermiſſions, paremptories, exigentes, termes vpon termes, fauors, promiſes, agréements, prayſes, compremiſes, wagers, and a number of other ſuch lyke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceytes and toyes, perceyued his tale had neither head nor foote. Then ſayd my L. Mayor to picke out the core of this matter: when ye two hid this treaſure, were there any others with you, or were yee two alone togithers? The Knaue that had occupied his hands as nimbly as he that playeth on the Phife, anſwered ſtreight as if he had bene cléere and honeſt in the matter. My Lorde, and if it pleaſe your Honor, with your graces fauour, the trée it ſelfe and you were there and ſawe it, would witneſſe the matter plainely. For we both I am ſure put it betwéene the rootes of the trée, and therefore I beleeue it will ſhowe you the hole which the théefe hath digged. If God be iuſt, I knowe hée will make the trée tell, and as it were poynt with a finger to him that ſtale it, and ſhowe you of him Sir, of him that ſtandeth here before your Lordſhippes goodneſſe (and my worſhipfull Maiſters) lyke a ſteale Counter nowe, for out of doubt he ſtole it. My L. Mayor that had many times put his finger in the fire before, as one well acquaynted with ſuch lyke matters, and that coulde ſpie day at a little hole, ſayd, well then ye ſtande vpon the teſtimonie of the trée, and ſéeing ye doe ſo, both you and I will be at the doing of it God willing, and I will ſift it out to the vttermoſt I warrant ye, feare ye not. They putting in ſureties for their apperaunce, and a daye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the matter, were diſmiſſed the Court. This deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination liked the théefe of life, for he had ſtreight deuiſed a miſchiefe to blind my L. Maior withall. But here I wil make a little digreſſion. He that doth his things without aduiſe &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell can neuer do well. The counſell is euer ſound and good that commeth from olde experienced men, or at leaſt helpeth in</hi>

He that repreſenteth the Moyle, I hope ſince he will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no counſell, ye ſhall ſée him ſmart for it in the ende. For it is written. Heare my ſonne my precepts and counſayles, but the Moſte was deafe and coulde not heare of that ſide. And now liſten howe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe theefe had imagined a miſchiefe in hys heade, and as ſoone as hee was come home he ſayde vnto his father. O my good luſtie olde graye bearde, I will diſcloſe a great ſecrete to thee, which till this daye I haue kept ſecret, ſecret in my boſome manye a faire daye, and euer buried it within me, as he that coulde finde no time I tell thee to tryfle. But father, heare ye. To bee plaine with you, the treaſure I aſke of my Companion, I my ſelfe haue ſtollen it, that I might the better releeue thee in thy olde age, and alſo further and aduaunce my poore familie, a thing that thou and I both long time haue deſired. I thanke God, and my wiſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight (I ſhould haue ſayd before) it goth as I would haue it, I would wiſh it no better. Now if thou wilt be ruled, and haue the thing brought to paſſe (being alreadye in. good forwardneſſe) this cheate will be ours in ſpight of the Deuill. And ſo rehearſed all to hym that had paſſed betweene them before the Maior and the Bench, and adding this withall. I praye thee conuey thy ſelfe to night into the hole vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rootes of the tree where the treaſure was hidde, for it is long, deepe, and large. And when my

Lorde Mayor ſhall aſke the tree: <hi>Quem queritis</hi>? I woulde ſaye, who caried awaye the treaſure? then ſhalt thou aunſwere with a counterfeyt voice: <hi>Egus.</hi> That is my Companion, and thou ſhalt call him by his name. The olde man that was lyke vnto hys ſonne in euery poynt, had reaſon to holde of his ſide, after ninetene ſhillings to the pounde: but he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered foure wordes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SOnne, it is good to be merie and wiſe. I care not to take this matter vpon me, but me thinke it is harde and daungerous. A wiſe man will looke ere he leape. I feare me thoſe egges will be broken in the mouth while we are a ſucking of them. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth in an houre that happeneth not in ſeauen yeres. If thys geare come out, we haue ſponne a fayre thréede. Conſider it wel, miſhappes are euer at hande. Howbeit, ſo it happen not to me as it did to the Birde that would kill the Snake, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: and now heare the ſtorie how ſhe did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the rockes of <hi>Popolonia</hi> there was a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye tree, in the which a ſolitarie Birde builte hir neſt: and laying ſixe times, fiue of them miſcaried. Harde by this tree, there dwelled a great and an vnhappie Snake, which (as oft as theſe little birdes were in maner hatched and readie to flie) crept vp the tree to the neſt, and deuoured them all, that ſhe was readie to burſt for fulneſſe. So that the poore Syer of them was as angry as a Beare, he was ſo full of choler and ſorrowe. One day hee determined to aſke councell in the matter, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
<pb facs="tcp:4853:94"/>
with a Crabbe that was a Doctor in <hi>Libris.</hi> Hearing his learning, he ſaid naught elſe to him, but come and follow me. So he brought him to a Caue where dwelled a certayne beaſt (a companion of his) a charmer, an enimie to the Snake for his lyfe, and tolde him his nature, how that this beaſt delighted to eate fiſhe, and made him carie a little diſhe full of them, and to go ſcattering of them ſtill all alongſt till he came to the Snakes hole. The charmer hauing the ſauor of the fiſhe in the winde, followed the ſent, and when hee was come to the place where the Snake made hir neaſt, in a great fury he digged vp the grounde: and finding hir (as one woulde haue wyſhed it) in hir firſt ſleepe, hee killed hir. But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee was ſo well fedde, he went further gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp and downe, ſearching if there had beene ought elſe to haue lyked him: and hauing theſe Birds in the winde to, he got him vp to the tree, and deuoured them alſo.</p>

                  <hi>FAther you caſt beyond the Moone, and make doubtes where none are: there is no ſuch daunger in this as you ſpeake of. Too it luſtily, and be not afrayde, I will warrant thée for an Egge at Eaſter. What doeſt thou thinke I haue not wayed the matter to the vttermoſt? foreſéene it, preuented it, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thorowe it, and ſéene to the bottome of it? Yes that I trowe I haue. And if I had not ſéene it done as I would haue it, I would not buye the repentaunce of the lyfe of my deare, ſwéete, louing, and tender father. Therefore diſpatche, and about thy buſineſſe.

               </p>
               <p>IN the morning betimes, my Lord Maior, the Shirifes, hys brethren the Aldermen, the Recorder, the counſell of the Citie, my mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the Iudges, and Iuſtices of peace, with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my Lord Maiors and the Shirifes officers attending on him, ſolempnly went to the appoynted place for triall of this matter, and hauing hearde the parties in <hi>partibus</hi> and <hi>ſpartitibus,</hi> hee reſolued vpon the teſtimonie of the tree, and cried out. What ho, tree (three times) who hath robbed this treaſure? then this olde man that had lien vnder the tree all night, &amp; had a couple of Nuts in his mouth to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit the matter, anſwered quickly on a ſodeine the name of the good ſimple man. When the Maior heard this thing, that within the barks of trees there were certaine trembling voyces put forth, it ſo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him, that for the time he was extaticke, &amp; coulde not ſpeake a word: ſeeming to him and to thoſe that ſtoode by, that it was a wonderfull and ſtraunge thing. And thus wondering at the matter, to heare the voyce come out of the tree, he was about to ſay: Lorde, ſee what force troth is off. But with that
<pb facs="tcp:4853:95"/>
thought alſo he beganne to ſuſpect there was ſome knauery in hande, and bicauſe he would knowe it if it were ſo, he commaunded they ſhould lay a lode of wood or two about the roote of the tree, &amp; when they had done, that they ſhould ſet it on fyre: imagining that if there were any yll fauoured worme or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min in the hollownes of the tree, either he would fire him out, or at the leaſt burne hys coate or tayle. And if there were any deceyte, he knewe by this meanes he ſhould eaſily boult it out: and hauing cauſed wood to be brought and layd togither as he commaunded, they ſtreyght gaue fyre. Now the olde man hauing fyre at hys tayle lyke a Gloworme, and that it began to partch him, (thinke what heart he had) cryed out pittifully as lowde as he coulde. Alas, alas, alas. Water, water, water. I burne, I burne, I burne. Helpe, helpe. I am ſmothered, I am ſmothered. Come, come, come. Quick, quick, quick. Open, open, for Gods ſake. I die, I die, I die. And many ſuch wordes he ſpake, that he made them all ready to burſt with laughing. A ſirra (quoth my L. Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or) and art thou there in deede: In fayth the ſpirite is coniured now, he is ſure ynough I warrant him. And ſo he cauſed the ſpirit to be pulled out, that God knoweth looked lyke the verye picture of ſtryfe it ſelfe. Whan hee ſawe the poore olde Deuill howe he was dreſſed, at the firſt he laughed, and wythout any choler did ſtreyght examine him. But when the troth in deede appeared as it was, hee payde them home with their owne deuice, and gaue them that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4853:95"/>
they had iuſtlye deſerued, and delyuered all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the ſimple honeſt man. So that nowe thou heareſt howe innocencie is rewarded, and iniquitie puniſhed. Let ſtryfe go, and we ſhall lyue merylie.</p>

               <p>IN <hi>Terra Stolida,</hi> in a place called <hi>Vallona,</hi> it is reported there dwelled a riche Farmer, whoſe ſubſtaunce laye moſt in great Cattle: and at certaine times he droue them into other countries to paſture, where he abode with them many moneths. His wyfe that remayned at home, was good and ſquare, &amp; plumme of body, hir brawne as hard as a bourde, and had hir face before hir as other women: ſo that a great riche man alſo of that Countrie caſt his eyes vpon hir, and entertayned hir in that time of vacation. And ſhe that delighted not to be kept at the rack and maunger, ſuffered hir receipt to runne at large, to fare more daintily.

Hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande being come home that had beene long abſent, gladde to ſee his wyfe, and ſhe (in ſeeming alſo) no leſſe gladde of his comming, (but Lorde what feaſt and ioye in outwarde ſhowe betweene them) they ſweetely kiſſed, and with louing wordes imbraced eche other. Oh my Conye, welcome quoth ſhe. Oh my deare Muſſe (ſayde he) gramercy to thee.

I pray thee whence is thys little Knaue? what knoweſt thou not Conye ſayde ſhe? it is myne, (and this ſhe tolde him as ſhe that could cunningly handle him in his kinde) and ſo followed on, preuenting his tale. Doeſt thou not remember that three yeares ago there fell a great Snowe, (Ieſu howe colde it was) and at the ſame time I remember the Rauens and Crowes fell downe ſtarke dead in the ſtreetes, and the fiſhe dyed in the Welles. Oh what a colde it was, and I tooke it in deede (God knoweth) with throwing of Snowe balles, the yonge maydes of the Countrie and I togithers: and I cannot tell howe, I handled ſo manye, but well I wote I came home fayre with chylde, and I am ſure it was no other but the Snow, and that is ſene by the Boye, that is as faire and whyte as Snow it ſelfe,

His buſineſſe falling oute ſo that hee muſt needes go to Calicut, (which was a good thouſand myles off) he gaue to his neighbour (a friende of his) his yron to keepe till he came home. The yron taried the maiſter many a faire day, and ſeeing hee came not, he tooke his leaue, and went his waye: but hee that had it in keeping, tooke reuenge well ynough of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and made merie wyth it.

But he that was a ſlye childe, had ſtreyght deuyſed an excuſe to ſerue hys turne, and ſayde to him. I would to God you had neuer left it with me. For yee were not ſo ſoone gone, but there came euen the ſame nyght an armie of Rattes and Myſe, (drawne thither by the ſauor of the mettall) that lay continually at it: ſo that in fewe dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I or any of my houſe knewe it (thinke you that heare it how this was likely) they had gnawen and eaten it vp euery whit, and had not left by eſtimation vneaten, and not ſpoyled, aboue foure ounces.

The Merchant hearing ſo lowde a lye, could ſcant keepe him from laughing, though inwardly it grieued him: &amp; yet ſoothing him, he made

as he beleeued him, and ſayd. Sure it is a maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous matter howe this ſhould come to paſſe: and but that I heare you ſpeake it, I woulde neuer beleeue it. For doubtleſſe it is one of the woonders of the worlde. A ſhame take him that ſolde it mee. I cannot be perſwaded but that hee noynted it wyth ſome oyle, or gaue me ſome of that ſoft yron that is made of the water of Steele. But well, let the yron go where it will, and all my ylles withall, although it bee of no ſmall weight. I tell you truly I loue you ſo muche, that I make ſmall reckening of my loſſe, but rather I aſſure you I think it well beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſyth the wycked Rattes yet had ſomewhat to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteine them with, and that they pardoned you and your familie.

                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:4853:98"/>THe Merchant ſent for to dinner to hys houſe that had ſtollen the yron, went thyther ſtreight, and was marueylouſly feaſted and made off, (but in deede of his owne coſt) howbeit the beſt pleaſure of all was, the Merchaunt made verie much of a pretie little Boye, and hee was the onely ſonne and heyre of him that had bidden him to diner: and ſtill he fed the Boy, and made him great cheere. After dinner playing with his ſonne, and makinge much of him as I tolde you before, promiſing (as they doe to children) many goodly thinges: whyleſt the father began to nodde and to take a nappe, the Merchant made the Boy be caried to a neighbours houſe of his, &amp; there he hid him. The father when he awaked, went forth with the Merchant, attending their buſineſſe, and thought nothing of his ſonne, as he that was wont to goe forth without any ſuch care. So comming home at night, and not finding his ſonne, out he went all about the towne to ſeeke him, and ſpared not to aſke euerye bodye that hee met if they ſaw his ſonne. At the laſt by good happe hee ſtumbled on this Merchaunt, that in deede had ſtollen him (as the other had ſtollen his yron be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) and being in great perplexitie he ſorowfullye aſked him of his ſonne. The Merchaunt, all things framing as he wiſhed, (ſauing the giuing of his yron to hym to keepe) aunſwered ſtreight. Yes marrie I remember I ſawe (not long ſince the winde roſe ſo great) a ſielye Sparrowe catch a little pretie Boye by the heare of his heade, and in that whirle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wynde ſhee ſnatched him vp, and caried him quite

away into the ayre: and ſure by your wordes mee thinkes it ſhould be your ſonne. Therfore ſeeke him no more, for by this time he is in heauen, it is ſo long agoe I ſawe him taken vp from the grounde. The father hearing ſo impoſſible a thing, beganne lyke a madde man to crie oute, and ſayde. O heauen, O earth, O yee people of the worlde: gyue eare vnto this ſtraunge and wonderfull caſe. Who euer heard ſuch a thing? Who euer ſaw ſo ſtraunge a ſight? as to ſee little Sparrowes carie children into heauen? Are Children become Chickens, or Sparrowes Kytes? What ſayth the Merchaunt, you ſeeme to haue little practiſe in the worlde, ſyth yee remember not that an Eagle hath taken vp a man and caried him quite away.

                  <hi>THe Lyon therefore did amiſſe to kill the Bull, ſuffering him ſelfe and his iudgement to be abuſed and ouertaken, by the deuiliſh and ſubtill practiſes of the trayterous Moyle. In ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as when his choler was ouer, and that he had wreaked his anger of him, cruelly putting the guiltleſſe beaſt to death: he then to late looked backe on his bloudie déede, and repented him of his rage, knowing he had not done well to kill ſo wyſe a ſubiect, and ſo graue a counſeller. His conſcience griped him at the hart to thinke he had no lawfull cauſe to vſe ſuch crueltie to him. Such inwarde thoughtes drawe déepe, and touche the quicke, and can hardly be holden in and kept ſecrete. So that the Kinges heart burning thus, out he burſt a fewe wordes, which made the Moyles eares glowe: as that péece of wicked fleſh, that alwayes gaue attentiue eare, and looked to be payde home. So that vpon a ſodeine, to take awaye theſe thoughtes from the King, and that he ſhould not thinke to much vppon them, beſides that to continue him ſtill in his errour: he ranne to the Court, and downe he fell on his knées before the Kinge, and with all humilitie he ſayd.

               <p>YOur Lordſhippe (ſayde this wicked Moyle) ſhoulde not thus ſorow and bewayle the loſſe of him, which made thee lyue in continuall feare and torment. For wyſe Princes oft times doe both puniſhe and cut off many worthie perſones, and thoſe whom they dearely loue and eſteeme: and why? all for their owne ſafetie, and the preſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Realme. And Sir, of two euils they chooſe the leaſt: to kill one, rather than to make a thouſand die. Lo here is an example. Doe ye not ſee my Lord when one is bitten with a venimous ſerpent, that ſtreight he cutteth off the member that is bitten, not ſuffering it to infect and poyſon the whole bodye, by meanes whereof hee ſaueth his life, which elſe hee ſhould loſe? The Kinge ſeemed to graunt him, and the Moyle thought theſe wordes had cleared the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hart, and he craftily made much of the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Moyle, and like a brother intreated him. The Moyle ſate him downe on a forme in the Chamber of preſence a whyle, and began of himſelfe to thinke vpon the miſerie of Princes of light credit, and of the malice of theſe vile tale bearers, which ſet ſtryfe and contention betwixt partie and partie, of their tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,

                  <hi>LArge, great, wonderfull, and infinite are the wayes to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende, and innumerable are the ſnares and deuiſes that one wicked and naughtie diſpoſed perſon may deuiſe and ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode, to ketch a good and true meaning man, to ouerthrow him quite. And there is not ſo ſtraight a friendſhip but is eaſie to be broken, with the hand of naughty procéeding. As I haue proued it. If I coulde but write all the things that haue happened, the tales that haue bene tolde, and the long wouen cloth: I ſhould teache Princes howe they ſhoulde doe in all their matters, and woulde make them ſée the diſcretion that many haue loſt, and what waye they ſhould take not to fall into theſe Courtly flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers. Thoſe that beare office, and haue charge ouer others, ought diligently to ſearche out the troth of thinges: and not to goe as Flies without heades, and lightly to turne and chaunge as the wauering weather Cock with euery winde. Truely it is a fowle fault in meane men to giue eaſie eare to flatterers, but in great perſons it is a farre greater fault, &amp; in Princes chiefly a thing of moſt detect and ſlaunder, and of extréeme crueltie.</hi>

And thrée other things alſo there are for the ſubiects to obſerue vnto their Prince. Loue, fayth, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But euery one I ſée hath forgotten them, from high to lowe.

               <p>THe Lyon returned into the Chamber where the Moyle was, hee lycenſed him to depart, and the Moyle with due reuerence tooke his leaue of the King. Now the King left all alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne agayne to lament, and to repent him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande tymes that hee was thus ouertaken with the Moyles perſwaſion: and it grieued him ſo muche more, bicauſe he remembred the Bulles wyſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, wonderfull behauior, and noble conuerſation. And to baniſhe this inwarde conceyued griefe, that gryped him at the heart, he lyked to be amongſt hys Lordes and familiers, whom diuerſly hee entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And amongſt this rowte was the Lybberd, one of the nobleſt of bloud of all his kynne, and him the King truſted with many ſecrete thinges of hys lyfe. This Lybbarde one daye going out of the pallace to walke, paſſed bichaunce by the houſe of the Moyle
<pb facs="tcp:4853:105"/>
and Aſſe, and hearde the Aſſe crying out vppon the Moyle, and bitterlye reproouing him for that vyle treaſon he vſed to the Bull: and ſo hee hearde from poynt to poynt euery act and dede he did. With theſe wordes the Lybbard felt a thing touch his heart as one had ſpoken to him: and bade him marke well what Gods iuſtice will doe. So that he ſaw certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Moyle could not long ſcape the Kings wrath, and that he ſhould dearely buye the Princes griefe, falling into that ſnare he had layde for many others. Nowe as all curious ſearchers doe, that deſire to heare other mens doings, hee layde hys eare to the doore, and hearde the Aſſe his brother ſpeake theſe very words vnto him. O thou wouldeſt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thine owne fantaſie: I coulde not rule thee. All is well that endeth well ſaye I. Marke the ende. Thou reiectedſt my counſell, it ſkilleth no matter: I ſay naught but mum. If any miſchiefe light on thee, at thy perill be it: if the King doe puniſhe thee, thou haſt but well deſerued it, and God is iuſt if hee poure it on thee. O goodly act of thine, to betraye an innocent creature, and thy faithfull friende.</p>
               <p>Brother mine (ſayde the Moyle) no mo wordes I praye thee: that that is done cannot be vndone. And it is eaſier to reprooue than to amende. When the Steede is ſtollen it is to late to ſhut the ſtable dore. I knowe <hi>Chiarino</hi> is ſlayne and that guiltleſſe, and I confeſſe I was cauſe of his death. But let vs leaue off this vayne talke, and deuyſe ſome waye to driue out the ſuſpition the Kinge hath taken in his heade, that he thinketh there hath bene ſome trechery vſed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4853:105"/>
towards him. The Libbard hauing hearde ynough, and as much as ſerued his turne, departed his way, and hied him to the Pallace of the Queene mother, whither the King had ſent him for other affaires of his. After hee had done his meſſage from the King hir ſonne, he tolde the Queene mother al the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of that he had hearde, and of the rebukes of the Aſſe to the Moyle, and of his horrible committed murder. So the Queene mother and he reſolued to kepe it ſecret, bicauſe they would not the Aſſe ſhould haue anye hurt, knowing hee was a good, honeſt, playne, fooliſhe beaſt. In the next morning betimes the Queene mother went to the Court to ſee the Kinge hir ſonne, and finding him perplexed, and in heauy caſe, ſhe ſayd vnto him. What ayleſt thou my ſonne that I ſee thee thus troubled, and that theſe many dayes I ſawe thee not mery? If it be for any thinge thou haſt loſt, aſſure thy ſelfe that neyther ſighes nor ſobbes will once reſtore it thee agayne. This inwarde griefe doth vexe thy minde, feebleth thy bodie, and tormenteth thee much I ſee. But yet giue it not waye ſo farre as thou canſt not call it backe againe. Impart at leaſt thy deepe conceyued griefe vnto thy mother, and familier friends, ſuch as beſt doe lyke thee. If any helpe at all there bee, wee all will put to our helping handes. But if ſtill thou doſte burſt out thus in teares and ſighes, thou wilt rather ſhowe thy ſelfe a woman than a man. For ſo doe women vſe, for euerye trifle when they liſte to bring forth a teare. Perhappes it grieues thee thou haſt ſlaine <hi>Chiarino.</hi> Out of doubt I can aſſure thee
<pb facs="tcp:4853:106"/>
thou defiledſt thy ſelfe in innocent bloude: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any crime, faulte, or liuing offence to thee thou laydeſt thy handes vpon him. His mothers wordes at length drue theſe from him. It is an olde ſaying, and I haue heard it oft. Thinges loſt can neuer bee recouered: and this thing goeth to the heart of me. Naye ſee mother if I haue cauſe to ſorrowe, that ſince his death, and before, I neuer hard ſo much as an yll worde of my faithfull <hi>Chiarino.</hi> Sure if he had ment yll to me, it could not haue bene but I ſhoulde haue ſmelt it out, and it woulde haue come to mine eares one waye or other. And therefore to thee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone I confeſſe my faulte, and I maye tell it thee, the only worker of his miſchiefe was his cruell enimie the Moyle: which with practiſes, inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and deuiſes hath ſupplanted me, and killed him, moouing mee to wrath. Ah my ſonne, nowe I muſt needes tell thee agayne, thou haſt bene betrayed and deceyued both, and this a truſtie friende hath tolde me. The Lyon would faine haue knowne of whom: but the Queene mother would by no meanes at that time tell him ought. But this ſhe did aſſure him, that there was no newe inuention nor alteration in hys Realme that ſhoulde offende him in worde or deede: and bade him ſeeke well, and in ſhort time he ſhould knowe all. So the King ſince he coulde at that time get no more of his Mother, determined to aſſemble all the beaſtes of his Realme, and to call them to Parliament to conſult vppon this matter, and ſo he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:4853:106"/>
                  <hi>WHen this generall Counſell was called, where all the great Lordes of his Realme, and the wyſeſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, with all the ſouldiours were aſſembled, he alſo ſent for his Mother. Shée looking all the beaſtes in the face that were preſent, &amp; miſſing the Moyle, cauſed him ſtreight to be ſent for. So he came forthwith. But when he was come to the Pallace, and ſaw the Parliament houſe furniſhed with all the Colledge of beaſtes: then he knewe the Princes indignation, when loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon him earneſtly he ſaw his colour chaunge, and that his conſcience gnawed him for the death of the Bull. Now the Moyle knowing himſelfe guiltie, began to whet his wittes, and drawing néere to certaine of the great Lordes that ſtoode rounde about the Quéene mother, hée ſayde vnto them. Lorde what ayleth our noble King? what is the cauſe of this conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here? how commeth it he is thus malencholy? What, is there any ſodeine or ſtraunge accident happened in the Court, that we may knowe the cauſe? the Counſell hath bene called very ſodainly. The Quéene mother aunſwered ſtreight. Thou néedeſt not marueyle ywis at the Kings heauineſſe. For thou knoweſt well ynough (hauing giuen him the cauſe) his ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which with thy ſwéete ſugred wordes haſt giuen him bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gall. Tell me I pray thée? canſt thou tell who was cauſe of the death of the moſt noble and worthie knight of our Court? Was it thou perhaps? But the Moyle (as ſtoute as Golyas) without any bluſhing aunſwered ſtreight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOw I know the ſaying which our olde aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient beaſtes vſed in times paſt is true: and I am out of doubt of it. That let one doe as much good as he can, his rewarde I warrant yee ſhall be little ynough, and that God onely is hee who rewardeth and giueth recompence for anye benefite
<pb facs="tcp:4853:107"/>
or ſeruice done. O what a marueilous matter is it, that he that liueth well in this worlde, cannot conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to liue well, but is compelled to daunce after e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mans pipe: to holde with the Hare, and runne with the Hounde. The true heart I haue alwayes borne to the Kinge thy ſonne, and ſounde counſell which (God I take to recorde) I haue euer giuen him, doe not deſerue ſuch rewarde. For it is knowne well ynough that the Moyle his ſeruaunt hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him from many daungers, and preſent death alſo: and refuſed no traueyle for his ſafetie, and that I make his Lordſhip iudge off. Well, I onely craue of his Grace but that hee will inquire of my life and doings. For I knowe my proceedings will appeere better to him than is thought for: and I woulde my troth and honeſtie were openlye knowen to the world. And for my part, if the leaſt part of that were true that is ſpoken of me, and that I were any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way to be touched, his Maieſtie may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red I woulde not tarie an houre in the Court, and much leſſe haue come before theſe great Lords.

Therefore I pray thee noble Ladie, lende not thy eares to the wordes of enuious perſons, nor ſuffer his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie to laye handes on my innocencie. For if that ſeeme a ſtraunge thing to you, this <hi>a fortiore</hi> were a wicked fact: a fact without reaſon, iuſtice, and anye maner of equitie.

               <head>A tale of the Ioyners wife and the Painter.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was ſometime in the countrie of <hi>Catalogna</hi> a Ioyner of <hi>Tharſia,</hi> and hee had a verye faire woman to his wife as any that came into that citie a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares before hir. Thys faire woman became in loue with a Painter, and bicauſe the neighbours ſhoulde not be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie of his acceſſe vnto hir: ſhe prayed the Painter to make him a garment to bee knowne from others.
<pb facs="tcp:4853:108"/>
So that by hir eye, and feelinge (if there were no light) ſhe might yet ſtreight wayes know him. This deuiſe and requeſt pleaſed the Painter well, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon hee made him a white garment paynted with Pecocks eies, and wrought vpon it, and ſo with this robe in the night hee went to hir: without calling to any, or knocking at the doore, hee went to a place appointed where he founde hir hidden, and there he ſwetely ſollaced him ſelfe to his great contentation. At this compact betweene them for their meeting, one of hir ſeruauntes had cloſely put himſelfe into a corner, and hearde all that was ſayde and done, who cunningly diſſembled that hee knewe ought where his Myſtreſſe hid hir. This Painter with his white robe continued his haunt vnto hir a great while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeruaunt coulde come to beare halfe of his labor. It hapned yet on a night (as fortune woulde) that this Painter had occaſion to goe oute of the towne for certaine buſineſſe he had abrode: the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant when he knew it, hied him immediatly vnto the Painters houſe, and bade his wyfe deliuer hym hir huſbandes white robe. And when he had it, he put it on his back, and ſo went to his Miſtreſſe with all: who when ſhe ſawe it, and knew it, and beleeued it had bene the Painter (perhaps too, ſhee lyked to be deceiued) bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to purſue <hi>Venus</hi> ſport togithers. His errand delyuered, hee went and rendered thys robe agayne vnto the Paynters wyfe, who good ſoule knewe not what hir huſbande ment to weare that robe euery night. Anone after midnight as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill would haue it, the Painter came home agayne,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4853:108"/>
whether the ſprite mooued hym that he muſt needes goe coniure the Deuill, or that his buſyneſſe framed not that hee went for, or what it was I cannot tell ye, it is ynough, home he came: and putting on his white robe on his backe he flong out of the doores a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne in haſte, and to the Ioyners wyfe hee trud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But when he came there, he founde all faſt ſhut vppe, and no noyſe at all: ſo that hee was driuen to daunce attendaunce without doores and blowe hys nailes, as the Phiſitions Moile that waiteth for his maiſter, and ſtill chaweth on the bridle. Howbeit the next night hee returned, and at pleaſure diſcouered the countrie. And being haſtie in his iourney, what man (quoth ſhe) remember your ſelf, you rode farre yeſternight, and you are not yet at your iourneyes ende: I perceyue you haue yet a Coltes tooth in your heade. Well wanton well, you will tyer your horſe: and with ſuch lyke harlottrie louing wordes ſhe entertained hir friende the Painter. The Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hearing theſe wordes, beganne to ſmell a Ratte, and thought ſtreyght ſhee had taken in more horſes into hir ſtable than two. So he tooke his leaue, and home he went: and when he came home, examining the matter, his wife tolde him there came one in his name for his robe. Then were they both at an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deale, and woorſe than euer they were, for none of them knewe, nor could geſſe what hee ſhould be: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as after he had well fauouredly ribbe roſted his poore innocent wife, he threwe his robe into the fire. And ſo ſhee ſielye woman bare the blame that made no fault. The King therefore ſhoulde not ſo
<pb facs="tcp:4853:109"/>
lightly beleeue it, before hee be iuſtly informed: that anothers fault bee not puniſhed by my innocencie. My Lords and beaſts, think not I pray you that I ſpeake this for feare of death, but to purge my ſelfe of that ye haue hearde. For death is common to all, and I knowe I cannot ſhunne it, therefore I feare it not. But this I feare, that dying falſely accuſed, my name and houſe ſhould for euer be defamed: and to this I take great heede. The mother of the Lion, that was the very daughter of impacience, coulde not abyde to heare anye more fables, but caſt vp hir head, and turned hir about at thoſe words, and halfe in a rage, and in choler, ſayde thus to the Moyle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IF thy déedes were as good as thy wordes, my ſonne ſhoulde not be thus grieued nor offended: nor the poore Bull had bene nowe deade. But thy double dealings and prittle prattle, who did but giue eare vnto thée, (and beléeued thée) not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thée, are ynough to turne the Court topſie turuie. As thou diddeſt heretofore to</hi> Pannonia<hi>, who come home thou madeſt him beléeue (bicauſe his wife woulde not graunt thy vnhoneſt deſire) that ſhe was naught: ſo that vpon thy wordes he fell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hir with his féete, and paſhed hir to death. Then to late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting his fault, he heaped one yll on another: for he made all his Concubines to bée burnt. And all this came of thy curſed wordes. Therefore it is beſt for euerye man not to haue thy friendſhip. With that he lifted vp his eares, and with open mouth thus aunſwered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT becommeth not Madame the Kinges mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to heare the cauſes, reaſons, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, obiections, and wronges of the ſubiect
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4853:109"/>
with two eares at once, but with one alone. For your iudgement ought to be vpright &amp; equall, if affection or partialitie carie ye not away. And if the matter be for <hi>Chiarino</hi>: the Moyle will not for that forget that the King doth yet truſt him, and that he is a true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to his Maieſtie. And be yee aſſured Madame, that to trouble my innocencie, and to moleſt me that to all this Court is ſo true a ſlaue, it is an offence to pitie. Imagine how the Lioneſſe hart did riſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylouſly againſt him, bicauſe ſhe knew the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Moyle: and turning to hir ſonne ſhe ſaid. How thinkeſt thou of the boldneſſe of this moſt cruel vncurbed traytor? that as many as heare him think he hath reaſon. See I praye yee how he playes the Foxe. Beholde I beſeech ye his lookes, what kinde of ieſtures he makes. Thinke ye hee cannot hit one on the knee at a pinch and neede be with his heeles? Yes I warrant ye when ye looke not for it. O ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till beaſt, how he hangeth downe his heade. O what a traytours looke, ſee his falſe leering eyes. Lorde how terribly he lookes on vs. Diſmember my ſonne this curſed beaſt, and henceforth neither for friends, Courtiers, nor kynſefolkes requeſtes, euer keepe Moyles any more. The Lion for al theſe words ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not a whitte, neyther once caſt vp his heade as though hee had bene moued. The Lyoneſſe his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther madde for anger for hir ſonnes griefe: why then bicauſe thou wilt not puniſh a traitor, doeſt thou not beleue me? doeſt thou not credit thy Mother that telleth thee here before them all, and affirmeth to his face that he is a traitour to thee?</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:4853:110"/>
                  <hi>THen the King called a certaine fierce beaſt, and vgly mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to beholde, begotten of a Satire and of a Griffin, and he made him take a chaine and chaine the Moyle. The Moyle ſeing
<figure/>
ſo horrible a borned beaſt come towardes him, let fall his tayle for feare and ſorrow both, and thus of this helliſh furie he was chained, and caried to priſon, and as ye ſhall heare ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept and examined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHen the Moyle was thus apprehended, the Lyoneſſe went to the Kinge hir ſonne, and ſayde to him. The impriſonment of this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

member, hath greatlye reioyced all the Court: knowinge that nowe the tyme is come thys male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor ſhall bee puniſhed, and receyue iuſt rewarde for his treaſons. God, if thou diddeſt but heare what they talke of hym in Court, of his naughtie tongue, of his carying of tales from one to another, of ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abrode quarrels, contentions, ſtrifes, debates, and ſuſpitions in euery place where he cometh, thou wouldeſt bleſſe thee, and thine eares woulde glowe in thy head. O curſed Moyle. Neuer agree to heare him, neuer giue him audience, but referre his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the counſell, and then let iuſtice procede. Now I thinke thy lyfe ſafe, and dare boldelye ſaye thy Realme ſhall lyue in peace: ſyth the Moyle is forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming, and I hope ſhall be quite diſpatched. And bicauſe I would not haue thee thinke I ſpeake ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely: I wil tell thee what reaſon I haue to ſpeake it. And here the Lioneſſe reciteth from point to point what the Lybbarde had tolde hir, and how ſhe heard the whole matter of him. The King vnderſtanding his fact from the mouth of ſo credible a perſon, as that of the Libbarde: then he knewe it to be true, and that he had offended, which yet was not altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be beleued, and depended ſomewhat vpon the Moyle. And thus determined to puniſh the Moyle, he withdrewe himſelfe from the counſell, as all ſuch like Princes doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NOwe when Fame had blowne abrode the Moyles impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, and comming to the Aſſes eares his brother, hée ranne vnto the priſon, and his heart panted, and bet maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly:</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4853:111"/>
                  <hi>as that Aſſe that knewe howe this geare was brought about, and he tolde the Moyle. Our playe nowe is like to the playe of the two brethren, that hauing two Balles in their
<figure/>
handes, they gaue them ech into others handes, and they were both made of one faſhion and bigneſſe: ſo that in the ende to chooſe this or that they ſaw it was all one, there was no choyce in neyther. To haue thée in priſon, alas it troubleth me: and to haue thée abrode alſo it grieueth me. All commeth to one rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening. And with that for kindeneſſe he burſt out in teares, and wept bitterly. But afterwardes ſeing him with the chaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, he quaked for feare, and layde him downe on the grounde, crying out in his Aſſes maner, and ſayde. O bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:4853:111"/>
                  <hi>Moyle, what caſe art thou in now? Alas there is no more time to reproue thée now, bicauſe there is no remedie, as fewe dayes agoe there was, when thou mighteſt haue cancelled all: but thou like an Aſſeheaded foole, that mighteſt haue cléered the countrie (knowing thy ſelfe to be guilty) why didſt thou not take thée to thy legs? Thou deſpiſedſt my counſels to thée, &amp; yet they were good if thou hadſt had grace to haue taken them. It is true that is ſpoken by the mouth of beaſts that haue vnderſtanding. That the falſe and vntrue man dyeth before his time. As me thinketh I ſée by the Element will happen to thée. And this for none other but for thine inſolencie, and naughtineſſe: and thy craftes and deceytes hath brought thée to this trouble. O how happie haddeſt thou bene if thou haddeſt dyed in thy birth? Curſed, and wo worth be thy falſe knowledge and enuye of others weale and proſperitie: which onely is it hath brought thée to this infamous ende. Then the Moyle relented, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out in teares alſo, aunſwered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O My good Brother Aſſe, no liuing creature, howe wiſe and diſcreete ſo euer hee be, can ſhunne his miſhappes and yll fortune: and therefore I deſpiſed a thouſande of thy good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, for ſo was it giuen me from aboue. And if pride and ambition had not traueiled me ſtill, I could haue withdrawne mee: but the enuie of others dignitie and eſtimation had to much power ouer mee. O blind vnderſtanding of mans knowledge. It happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to me as to the ſick man, who hauing prepared for him moſt wholeſome meates, hee refuſeth them, and giueth hymſelfe ouer to his will and appetite, takinge them that are hurtfull for him, and filleth
<pb facs="tcp:4853:112"/>
himſelfe: which doth in dede both hinder his health, and continue his ſickeneſſe. He knoweth it, &amp; yet can not abſtaine. I knew well ynough my peruerſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandinge, but I neuer had reaſon ſufficient to bridle it. Nowe to late I finde my fault, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the daunger I am in, my ſorrow redoubleth on me: not ſo much for my ſelfe, as for thy ſake, bicauſe thou haſt alwayes bene with me. Thou art my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conſequentlye they will beleeue and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine (in deede) that thou art priuie with mee, and partaker of my doings. The Kinges officers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may take thee, and put thee on the racke, and make thee confeſſe my fault, and when they haue done execute thee. (For ſure they ſhall neuer haue it of me) and by thy confeſſion puniſh mee without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or pardon in this worlde. For of thy wordes dependeth my death, and of my wicked gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall growe thy yll, griefe, trouble, torment, priſonment, and extreeme puniſhment. The Aſſe hearing his brothers wordes, marked them well, that he trembled euery ioynt of him, and quaked like an Aſpin leafe: and a beaſtly feuer tooke him, with which he went his way home. But before he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thence, he ſayde vnto the Moyle. Brother, if thou wey my life, and wilt keepe me from perill (as thou canſt not any waye auoyde it) confeſſe thy fault is worthy of death: thus ſhalt thou free thee from the wrath of the Gods, and after this corporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thine, doubtleſſe thy ſpirite ſhall forthwith be tranſported to the heauens. Well ſayd the Moyle, the laſt and extreme remedie ſhall be this. If there
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4853:112"/>
be no hope of remedie, let it be as it will be: for my bodie well I wote ſuffereth already to much. Now get thee home, &amp; hide thy ſelfe, and let it light on me, as the world, Fortune, &amp; the Gods will aſſigne. The Aſſe departed from him verye ſicke, and ſore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in his minde, and his payne ſo helde him, that the ſame night hee ended his ſorrowfull dayes. Whoſe death a Woolfe that dwelled harde by him greatly lamented, and was a witneſſe afterwarde that confirmed all the wicked fact: who hearde in deede the ſame night howe the Aſſe reprooued the Moyle his brother. The Lyon ſent to the Libbard, and commaunded his officers they ſhoulde vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand particularly the Moyles caſe, and to diſpatch him roundlye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AL the beaſts got them into the Parliament houſe, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one tooke his place according to his degrée, and ſate them downe: and the houſe being ſet, there was brought before them in chaines this ſolemne traytor the Moyle. And when he was come before the preſence of ſuch a ſight of Aſſes and fooles, the Libbard ſtandeth vp, &amp; ſpeaketh. Right honorable, it is yet freſh in memorie, that the King killed the poore innocent</hi> Chiarino<hi>, ſo that from that time hitherto his Maieſtie hath not bene quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his minde, that hée put him to death by the falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and enuie of my Lorde the Moyle. His Maieſtie therefore hath liked to call vs to Parliament, that euery one of vs ſhould witneſſe the troth, if we knowe or haue heard any thing of his doings, in what maner he did it, what Arte he vſed, with whom he practiſed, and by whom he was aſſiſted in this great treaſon, to bring his wicked minde to purpoſe. Euery one of vs is bound that knoweth ought to vtter it, for the preſeruation of the</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4853:113"/>
                  <hi>Realme, and his Maieſties moſt royall perſon. And then by iuſtice it is méete ſuch traytors ſhoulde be puniſhed, and the good rewarded: by meanes wherof the good may liue vnder his Maieſties reigne and gouernement with ſafetie, and the yll be rooted out and cut off from the common weale. Euery one loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked other in the face, and helde their peace. The vnhappie Moyle, perceyuing that euerie bodie was aſhamed to take vppon them to tell ſo yll a tale, cut off Fortune by the waſte euen at that pinche, and ſtepped to the matter himſelfe, riſing vp vpon his féete (being ſet before) and boldly ſayd theſe words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O Noble and vertuous Lordes, what is the cauſe ye are all thus ſilent? O my Lordes, how gladde would I be (if I were in fault) of this your ſilence. But bicauſe I knowe mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, and my ſelfe cleere in that I am accuſed off, it ſhall not grieue me, let euery man ſaye har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily that he knoweth. But yet with condicion, that he haue the glaſſe of Verity before his eies, and that he aunſwere iuſtly to that he is aſked, and ſo ſhall hee (what ſoeuer he be) ſatiſfie God, and the worlde, and I ſhall remayne free and contented. It is true that euery bodye ſhoulde bee circumſpect to ſpeake onely that they knowe: and not to ſuffer themſelues to be caried awaye eyther with fauour, enuie, or malice. For then like ynough that loſſe and ſhame woulde come to him, that came to a Phiſition which had the Tiſicke, or if I lie not, was well ſeene in Phiſicke. In a certaine part of <hi>India Paſtinaca,</hi> there was a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in <hi>diebus illis,</hi> the which cured all, all the beaſts he viſited: and ſure it was a marueilous thing, there
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4853:113"/>
neuer died any vnder his handes that hee had cure off. This man being deade, was reckened for a Saint. Another Phiſition called maiſter Marre al, (in our tongue) beganne to caſt waters, ſetting eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vrinall by himſelfe, and bought him bookes to reſemble the other as neere as he coulde: and when he had met with any receit, oh he kept it full dearely. Afterwardes he had a toye in his head, that he tooke himſelfe for the ſelfe ſame Phiſition that was before him, both for learning and practiſe, ſo that he boaſted hee had done great cures, who coulde ſcant knowe he was himſelfe aliue, hee was ſo poore, and yet hee layde on lode as he had bene (yea marrie had he) the cunningeſt man in a Realme. It happened ſo that the daughter of the King of that Citie (where this Phiſition dwelled) fell ſicke, and hir diſeaſe was this. That being with childe hir noſe guſhed out with bloud very oft. The king that loued his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dearely, and gladly would haue had remedie for hir and coulde not, hee was very penſiue and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, and ſighed ſore for that worthye Phiſition that was nowe deade, the loſſe of whome went to his heart, ſyth none died vnder him that he had in cure. This newe come Phiſition knowing the Kinges caſe, went to his Maieſtie, and tolde him that hee ſhoulde not ſorrowe for the loſſe of the other Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for he offered himſelfe to ſatiſfie him as much in his ſeruice, as that other excellent and famous man his predeceſſor: and that he doubted not but he woulde finde out a preſent and ſouereigne remedie for his Graces daughter. The Kinge reioyced at
<pb facs="tcp:4853:114"/>
thoſe wordes, beleuing them as true as he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them: ſo he prayde him to miniſter to hir, and to applie ſuch preſent remedies as might with ſpeede ceaſe hir diſeaſe, and reſtore hir to hir health. Nowe to ſhowe himſelfe a rare and learned man, he came to his bookes, and toſſed and tumbled them pittiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, turning their leaues vpſide downe, beleeuing they were the bookes of the other famous man, and that thoſe woulde able him in his miniſtration as they did the other. Then he made his man bring him thoſe Electuaries, Compoundes, and Conceytes that the other Phiſition had left behind him, and he beganne to mingle them and worke them togither. But like an vnfortunate man in all his doings, there came to his handes a pot of Arſenicke, and bicauſe hee thought hee had kept and preſerued it with great care and diligence, hee tooke it for a precious oyntment, ſo that he tooke of that the greateſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, and mingled it with the others. This Arſenicke (which he ſuppoſed as good as Ginger) prepared in potion, hee caried it to the Princeſſe which ſhoulde haue dronke it: ſaying that ſtreight it would ſtoppe the bloud, and reſtore hir to health. The King ſeing he had thus quickly diſpatched his medicine, thought him one of the rareſt iudgementes and ſingulareſt Phiſition in the worlde. The vnhappie Ladie had ſcant dronke off a part of this potion, but ſhe felt hir hart labor and take on vnmercifully: ſo leauing the reaſt behinde vndronke, making pittifull mone, and ſcreking out for payne, ſhe wofully in ſhort time left hir life. The King ſeeing his daughter deade, was
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4853:114"/>
become the heauieſt man aliue, as euery man maye coniecture: and apprehending this beggarly Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made him drinke vp the reaſt, ſo that he ſtreight fell downe in the place and died. And it happened to him as to the pore olde man, that brake all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earthen Pottes or Pipkins he found with his Cudgell. So that one day he met with a hare brained yong felow,
<figure/>
of his owne humor and condition, and ſeeing the Pipkin in his hand, he lift vp his Cudgell and brake it in peeces, ſo that all that was in it ranne out.</p>
               <p>Therefore my Lordes take no fantaſie in your
<pb facs="tcp:4853:115"/>
heades that is not honeſt, for ſo yll woulde come of it: and take not vpon you any thing that you are not well informed off, leaſt yours bee the ſhame and loſſe. Let euery man remember his ſoule, and let him not ſay that he knoweth not: but to affirme that he hath ſeene, I am very well contented with that. Sure it were yll done (my Lordes) for anye man to ſpeake that he knoweth not certainely and aſſuredly, and the wrath of the Gods with ſuch lyke yll lucke as mine would be poured vpon them and their lyfe: and this none but I knoweth it better. The maiſter Cooke of the Kinges Kitchin (as fatte as a Hogge) hearing this brauery of his to enforce his credite, he tooke hart vpon him, and emboldened himſelfe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his nobilitie, and beganne to ſpeake in preſence of them all, and thus he ſayde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>RIght Reuerent and Honorable audience, ye are very well met in this place. Our olde auncient fathers that wrote many bookes of Phiſiognomie, (of the which I thanke the King I haue greaſed a good number, bicauſe I ſtudied oftentimes in the Kitchin) do tell vs many things, and gaue vs diuers tokens to knowe beaſtes and men, whereby we knowing them to be good or bad, they ſhould accordingly be rewarded or puniſhed.</hi> Id eſt<hi>, I meane ſo, to practiſe with the good, and to flie the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the euill. So it is, yea marrie is it, in faith I am ſure of it I. Nowe for that I haue ſtudied, and according to my ſkyll, (I tell yée my Lordes, I can not diſſemble) I finde our ſolemne Moyle here to haue manye yll partes in this matter, which ſhowe him in all and for all to be enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, falſe, and a traytor: leauing out that he is verye cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, and wickedly bent beſides. And ye marke him, he euer loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi>

                  <hi>hier with his left eye than his right, and his noſtrels he turneth ſtill to the right ſide, with his eiebrowes verye thicke and long of heares, and continually he looketh on the grounde, which are manifeſt tokens he is a traitor: and all theſe ſignes (looke ye on him that liſt) ye ſhall ſée him haue them rightly I warrant ye. The Moyle ſéeing the Swyne groyne with ſo yll a grace, although he was euen almoſt grauelled and out of countenance, yet he turned to him and replied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MY Lords, if it were true that this malicious Swyne and greaſie verlet here before yee all doth tell yee, that the heauens ſhoulde place ſignes in vs as a neceſſarie cauſe of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: then ſtreight aſſoone as we ſawe any beaſtes brought forth with thoſe peruerſe lines and marks, eyther they were forthwith to be puniſhed, or put to death, that they ſhould not worke ſuch wicked trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and effectes: and fewe beſides that ſhould bee borne, that the moſt part of them at the leaſt were not marked with theſe ſignes, that he &amp; his goodly bookes doe imagine. I knowe not if his doctrine ſhall be of ſuch authoritie receyued amongſt you, that it ſhall condemne my goodneſſe and pure workes. Sure this worſhipfull beaſt is deceyued, and doth as they that ſee an olde woman preſent a yong woman with any thing, or deliuereth hir ſome letter with anye pittifull ſhowes: ſtreight without touch of breſt, not knowing no further, they take hir for a Bawde. My worſhipfull Hogge ſhoulde knowe thyngs better before hee be thus bolde and ſaucie to ſpeake in this preſence. But none is ſo bolde as blinde Bayarde I ſee. Thou weeneſt to
<pb facs="tcp:4853:116"/>
poynt at me, but thy ſelfe it is that is poynted at, and thou marke it well. Thou ſuppoſeſt to detect me, and to open my defectes, and doeſt not looke vpon thy ſelfe what thine owne doe ſhowe thee. But harken to this tale, &amp; then tell me how thou likeſt it.</p>
               <p>OVr forefathers and elders ſacked a great Citie, had the ſpoyle of all that was in it, and put all to the ſworde ſaue olde men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and little children of all ſortes. In tyme theſe little ones grew, and bicauſe they left them nothing, men and women went naked, hyding only their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets and priuities with ſome thing. One day there came to the towne an olde countrie Cloyne to ſell woode, and hee brought with him his two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wherof the one went plainely to worke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ceremonie, ſhowing ſuch marke as God had ſent hir, and the other comely couered it wyth leaues as well beſeemed hir. The people began to ſay to the vnmoſeled Mayde: oh ſhame of the world, fie for ſhame, hyde, hyde, hyde. The olde Cloyne bicauſe he woulde not haue that Maygame behinde him, turning him, reuiled euery body that ſpake, and was as madde as a March Hare: and leauing him ſelfe bare, gaue hir his furniture to hyde hir ſhame. Then they were all on the iacke of him, and reuyled him to badde. His firſt daughter that was couered, ſeeing hir father bare, ſayde vnto him. Lo ſayth ſhe, ye haue made a good hande nowe: had not you vene better haue holden your peace, and to haue kept your owne priuities cloſe as they were at the firſt?

This tale I haue told for thee, maiſter Cooke of the Kings Kitchin. Thou doeſt not remember the vyle and infinite naughtie ſignes that thou haſt, and the great defectes and deformities placed in thy body. Thou, thou art vyle, ſlowe, and rauening. Thou art foule, ſtinking, filthie, lothſome, and a wretched thing: borne of a Sowe, and gotten of a Bore, and not of a Mare and an Aſſe as I am. Thou, a vile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourer of all thinges, and a ſolemne ſupper of broth and ſwill. Thou, a little neck, a vile viſage, with thy ſnowte forward: a narrow forehead, wide noſtrels, and ſhort noſed, ſo that the office thou haſt is yll be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on thee. For thou haſt no part in thee that is profitable, good, honorable, meete, nor ſightlye for any body, but when thou art before them in the diſh.</p>

                  <hi>THe Hogge ſéeing himſelfe thus well payde home in words againe, was glad to holde his peace: and after that neuer a one durſt once ſpeake a word any more. Thus for that time there was nothing elſe determined, but that the Moyle was caried againe to priſon by a Beare, who ſafely kept him, and looked to him. And now being the ſecond time againe clapped into priſon, there came to the Court a great friend of the Aſſe his brothers, who finding him deade, came to aduertiſe the Moyle his brother being in priſon, and was verie ſorie for the death of the Aſſe, which the Moyle had not hearde of all this while till nowe: and the Moyle tooke it ſo inwardly that it pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his heart, and néedes die he would. So turning him to his friende, which was a Foxe well ſtricken in yeares, he ſayde to him. Brother I am determined to die, and will make thée mine heyre. And making him get Penne, Inke, and Paper, he made his Will and bade him write, and bequeathed him all he had: which was a rich furniture. A double Coller with thrée Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4853:117"/>
                  <hi>A Moſell netwiſe for his mouth with a bit to the ſame. A coller of leather hungrie to hang ouer his necke with belles, a broade Pattrell with diuers coloured fringes made of Girth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>web and Canvas. A Baſſe, a great Crouper of wood, a Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, a Charger, and mayling cordes. A broade long Want, a tying Coller, a paire of Paſtornes, and a Tranell: with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ciuill furnitures pertinent to his eſtate. And then he confeſſed all, and tolde him his wicked practiſes and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that he onely (yea marrie was he) was the cauſe of all this ſturre. The Foxe thanked him hartily, and offered to helpe him with the King, and to trauell for him the beſt he coulde, bicauſe he was his chiefe Secretarie in Court and out of Court: and ſo departed from him. And he was no ſooner out of his ſight, but bicauſe he was in déede made heyre of that he had, he went to the Lyoneſſe and Lybbarde, and there confirmed the teſtament hereditarie of the Moyle. And to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his deſire (who deſired to die) he reuealed it, and accuſed the Moyle. So the traytor by another traytor was betrayed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the morning betimes all the beaſts met in the Parliament houſe, the Lawyers, Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Sergeantes, Counſellers and Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, and all the Kinges officers togithers: and there appeared alſo the Lyoneſſe, and Lybbarde. The inditement drawne, the witneſſes ſworne and depoſed, they cauſed the Moyle to be brought <hi>Coram teſtibus,</hi> and the Iudges: and the Clarke of the peace to read his inditement to his face. Now think whether his eares did glow, and his cheekes bluſh, when he heard the Foxe, the Woolfe, and Libbard ſworne as witneſſes againſt him. Hee ſtamped, hee ſnuffed, he cried in his Moyliſhe voyce, he flong, he yerked, and tooke on like a furie of Hell. And when
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4853:117"/>
he was wearied with theſe ſtormes and paſſions, downe he layd him, and rored out amaine. O I am killed, I am killed. I denie it. It is nothing true that is ſpoken: and therefore I warrant him it will come to that villaine the Foxe (who to haue my goodes hath thus falſely accuſed mee, accurſed was I when I made him mine heyre) which happened to him that brought vp three Popingeys or Parats.</p>
               <p>IN the middeſt of <hi>Tartarie</hi> there was a great honeſt riche man, that had the moſt true, faithfull, honeſt, louing, diſcretee, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wife in all that Realme: So that hir doinges were wonderfull, and ſhe alone was inough to giue light to halfe the worlde. This ſame Gentleman (huſbande to this wyfe) had a ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                     <desc>••…</desc>
                  </gap>nger to his man, proper of perſon, and comely to beholde. And this handſome ſeruing man became marueylouſlye in loue with his fayre yong Myſtreſſe, ſo that night and daye he could thinke of nothing elſe but which waye to purſue his loue. And when he had manye times (by tarying at home) aſſayde the ryuer to paſſe ouer, there was no pollicie coulde ſerue hys turne to obteyne fauor, but to bee enterteyned as a ſeruant ſtill. It fortuned him that one daye being a hunting, he found a Parattes neaſt, and in the neaſt three yong Parrattes: ſo taking them vp he caried them home, and familiarlye brought them vp, and taught them to ſpeake ſome things in his language, (the Indian tongue) which in that Countrie where he dwelled no body vnderſtoode. One of them could
<pb facs="tcp:4853:118"/>
piertly ſaye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Our Myſtreſſe maketh hir huſbande a Cuccolde. The other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O what a ſhame is that. The thirde ſayd, it is true, it is true, ſhe is naught. Theſe toyes had the ſeruant deuiſed to be reuenged of hir, for that he could not obteine his purpoſe, and bicauſe ſhe would not conſent to his wickedneſſe. Thus all the daye theſe bleſſed Parattes tampered on theſe verſes only, and ſang them ſtil as they were taught. And for that the tongue was ſtraunge, there was neuer none of the Countrie coulde vnderſtande it. There came one daye to the houſe of this honeſt man, two Merchants, kinſefolks to his wife, which bicauſe they had trafficked <hi>India</hi> very well, they had the tongue perfitely. And being at the table, they tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of many things, and they fell at length into talke of Parattes. So that the good man of the houſe cauſed his men to bring his three Parattes to him, only to ſhowe them vnto his kinſemen. The little Parattes being made of, beganne to ſing their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to repeate it ſtill apace. Nowe thinke yee what thoughtes theſe Merchauntes had, hearinge them ſpeake ſo vile and ſlaunderous wordes. And thus looking one at another, turninge them to the Gentleman, they demaunded of him: Sir know ye what theſe harlotrie Birdes doe ſpeake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No not I God knoweth, ſayde the Gentleman that ought them: but me thinketh it is a paſtime to heare them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Well, let it not miſlyke you to vnderſtand what they ſay: for it behoueth you to knowe it by any meanes. And ſo they tolde him all the ſtorie of the Parattes. The Gentleman was all amazed and troubled in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4853:118"/>
his minde to heare this expoſition. And then hee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them againe: but doe they ſing nothing elſe all daye but this, and ſtill in one ſonge? yea ſure ſince we came, no other tune nor ſonge had they but this. With that, very angry and woode as he coulde bee, he flewe on his wyfe, and woulde haue killed hir. But he was ſtayde by the Merchants, and his wife wiſely committing hir ſelfe vnto him, beſought hym diligently to inquire out the matter, and not to doe hir the wrong to beleeue thoſe fooliſhe Birdes: ſo he was forced to quiet himſelfe. Firſt he ſought to knowe and if the Parattes could ſay any other thing or no: and hee coulde not finde they coulde. Then the fault was layde vppon the ſeruaunt that had taught them. And calling for his man, hee came ſtreight with a Sparrowe hawke on his fiſt: who was no ſooner come before hys Myſtreſſe, but ſhee ſayd vnto him. O wicked ſeruaunt thou, what haſt thou taught theſe Birdes to ſay? Nothing, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he. They ſpeake lyke beaſtes of vnderſtanding, what they ſee and knowe. Why then ſayth the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and is it ſo as they ſpeake? Yea ſir, ſayde the naughtie ſeruaunt. With that the Sparrow hawke on his fiſt beganne brokenlye to ſpeake: Beleeue them not maiſter, for they lie in their throtes euery one of them. Theſe wordes were no ſooner ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but the Merchantes (kinſefolkes to his wyfe) roſe vp and pulled out both the ſeruaunts eyes: and then to late hee reſtored to his miſtreſſe hir good name agayne, which fell out to his vtter vndoing.</p>
               <p>Beholde therefore ſayde the Moyle, ſee what
<pb facs="tcp:4853:119"/>
hate reygneth in mens breſtes. O ſacred Prince, bee not offended with your good ſubiectes for ſyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter information giuen you. Neither determine any thing that is to the hurt and ſhame of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, through the accuſations of the enimies of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. The Court doth willingly giue eare one to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy another, if the iuſtice of the Prince ſteppe not in betweene. And euery man that can preferre and exalt himſelfe, (at leaſt as long as he hath meanes to doe it) careth not for the loſſe, hurt, or ſhame, of friend, kinſman, or brother. For ſuch is the priuilege of auarice and ambition. Euery one that heard the Moyle (knowing his wickedneſſe) could not abyde any longer to heare him: and ſeeing his vnreyned arrogancie, the Lybbard ſtepped forth, and gaue eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before the counſell of that hee had heard and knowen. The Woolfe followed alſo with true and euident tokens, and the Foxe with his owne ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed will confirmed his great treaſon. The Kinge gaue ſentence his ſkinne ſhould bee turned ouer hys eares, his carkas left for the Rauens, and his bones ſhould be burned for ſacrifice, done in memorie of the Bull, and in teſtimonie of his innocencie: and lo this was a worthie puniſhment for ſo vile a carkas, that had wrought ſuch miſchiefe.</p>
               <p>We muſt all therefore indeuor, great and ſmall, high and lowe, to worke well, and to liue with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of minde, and an vpright conſcience.
