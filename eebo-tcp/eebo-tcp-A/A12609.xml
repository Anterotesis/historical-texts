         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

pleased your Grace
in the beginning of

of me a question touching the Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saes
and Visiers belonging to the

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Ven as for Princes that would learne
wel to gouerne and maintaine them
selues, aswell in time of peace, as of
warre, there is no one thing more
necessarie, then the knowledge, first
of their owne affaires, and next of
the state of other principalities, (as
those do write, who haue the greatest vnderstanding in ciuil
causes, &amp; as Experience it selfe doth manifestly declare:) so
is it most fit and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient for them, to vse their vttermost
care &amp; diligence, that they may haue perfect skill &amp; discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to iudge betweene truth and falshood. For if the second
part of their knowledge, I meane touching other mens states
&amp; Principalities: (for of the first it is not my purpose to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course)
bee not founded and established vpon truth, it will
neuer be possible that their counsailes shall sort to any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
or aduauntage, because it is well knowne, that a false
information, either of a speech, or of an Astion, or of a
place, may oftentymes breed no lesse damage, and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
then a Counseller that is either of small capacitie, or
else a lyer, or a Captaine that hath neither wisdome nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
And therefore verie greatly are those Princes to
be commended, who not onely endeuour to enforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
of the wittes and loyaltie of their owne seruants, but
also for the more certaintie how matters do passe in truth,
maintaine either at home in Court, or abroad in forreine




<pb facs="tcp:18221:7"/>
places, Men of learning, and of practise: the one for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Historie, and properly appertaining to good ciuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
and the other for the knowledge of the estates,
inclinations, designements, interests, treasures, armour,
weapons, confederacies, preparations, and all the forces of
other Princes: whereunto may be added also as a matter of
great impertance to know those Countries, which haue not
onely beene knowne many a yeare ago, but also those that
haue beene lately dicouered, or may hereafter bee made
knowne to the world. In respect whereof, assuredly aboue
all other <hi>Don Iohn</hi> king of Portugall, and <hi>Isabell</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,
are most worthie of eternall memorie, for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie
of the East Indies, and of the new world, which was
performed by their fauour and assistance. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of that which hath beene said, is this, touching the first,
because such matters hauing beene reported or written, for
the most part either to please, or for some adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, or falsly
penned by persons that neuer were present at the Action, or
for feare haue concealed the truth, their reports and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
haue need of great caution &amp; censure, before they be
beleeued: and touching the second, because one eye-witnes, as
the Poet sayth, is more certaine &amp; worthy of beleefe, then a
thousand eare-witnesses, as they do most manifestly approue,
who by the view of their own eies, which they haue made in
diuerse Prouinces, do find &amp; acknowledge, that in bookes of
Cosmographie, Geography &amp; Chorographie, there be many
faults and errors to be noted in the gouernement of sundry
principalities, in the maners and customs of diuerse peoples,
and in the true situation of seuerall places and Countreyes:
besides many other tales and fables, which are here and
there dispersed, as well in writers of old, as in writers of late
times, and onely because the Authours of them haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten




<pb facs="tcp:18221:7"/>
and recorded either all these matters, or at least verie
many of them, without euer seeing any part of them, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
themselues wholy to the ancient descriptions, which
in deed do not fully answere to the knowledge and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of these dayes, and without iustifying the same by such
persons as haue not onely seene them, which euery common
Curseters and prating cousener, can also do: but also such as
haue had the skill to obserue euery action, and an intent
truly to report it againe. <hi>Homer</hi> called <hi>Vlysses</hi> a wise
man, (which is the goodliest title that can bee giuen to a
Prince, or to a Captaine) not because he had heard, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee noted and obserued the manners and customes
of sundrie peoples, and sawe many Cities. And peraduenture
it was the reason which moued <hi>Plato</hi> to make a law, that
none of his Citizens should trauaile abroad before hee was
xl. yeares olde, to the end that being growen wise by age, he
might with more iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t obserue the affairs of the world,
and then report them to his Countrey for the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
thereof. True it is that those Princes, which doe not
willingly admit any trafficke with straungers, contrary to
the law and course of all Nations, as for example the Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couite,
and Presbyter Iohn, but especially and aboue al other
the Princes of China, who being strengthned by fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and keeping continuall watch and ward for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
will not suffer their subiects to passe or trauell into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
Countries, because they hold <hi>Platoes</hi> opinion to bee
true, which he setteth downe in his common wealth, that
strange fashions and customes may corrupt home-borne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
such princes (I say) haue no neede in deed, to be any
diligent inquisitors or searchers of other mens actions. But
for other states, that with all humane intertainment and
entercourse do admit all forreiners, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerse kindly with




<pb facs="tcp:18221:8"/>
them, and embrace their enterests and confederacies, and
therfore are more strongly &amp; entirely enforced of necessitie
to guard themselues from their neighbors that are of great
power &amp; might, to the end they may the better maintaine

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uries and dominions: for such states (I
say) it is great reason &amp; verie conuenient, that they should
throughly informe themselues, &amp; endeuour to their vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
not only ingeneralitie, but also in euery particularitie
to vnderstand all matters whatsoeuer which may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not vnto priuate Interestes and commodities, such as,
matters of trafficke, and marchandizes be, but to the state
of the whole common wealth, which are properly belonging
to Princes themselues. For as we do read written Hystories
to the end we may learne how to gouerne and manage mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
aswell present as to come, by vnderstanding and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
how things haue fallen out, that haue beene hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
recorded in particularitie: so ought we also to knowe
how the affaires of the world do presently stand, to the ende
we may prouide remedies in time, and meete with all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences
according to the generall knowledge which
we haue learned by our reading: for such is the course and
order of our knowledge, that by singularities we proceede to
the notice of vniuersalities. And therefore the Venetian
Magnificoes, who are not meanely exercised and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
in matters of state, do not onely send vnto other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
such Embassadors as are of quicke wit and conceit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the custome of other principalities, but also haue
established for a lawe, that at their returne they shall in the
Senate make a true and particular report of the Prince and
state, with whom they haue beene Ledgers during the time
of their Embassage: and so by that meanes they shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
the yonger sort, which are trained vp in the studie of




<pb facs="tcp:18221:8"/>
politike affaires, to be the better enabled for the seruice of
their Countrey. And to the same purpose, that their Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon-wealth
may be also better gouerned, as well by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of such matters as haue alreadie passed, as also by the
fresh information of things presently in action, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
and keepe the said writings with great faithfulnesse
and secrecie in a Register especially appoynted therevnto.
And this was the cause, that I perceyuing how the actions of
the Turkes, were publikely either too much extenuated and
diminished, or else beyond all truth magnified, and enlarged
rather vpon want of true instruction and information, then
vpon any sting of passionate affections, which oftentimes
make report of many matters to diuerse priuate persons ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
indiscreetly, and inconsiderately, began to bethinke my
selfe, that it could not choose but proue verie profitable to
the state of Christendome, if I would take vpon me the care
to examine the present estate of the Turkish Empire, and
endeuour to discouer the disignements which that Prince
hath plotted against the Christians, in the best manner I
could. And forasmuch as it is not alwayes good, to giue too
much credite to auncient Records, though they be neuer so
true, because Principalities and states are easily altered and
chaunged, either vpon the nature or disposition of the new
succeeding Prince, or vpon condition and circumstance of
time, or vpon some other accident: (yea and so much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for that the Venetian records which were woont to be
most faithfull and sincere, are not now imparted or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to any man by a speciall prohibition which they
haue made amongst themselues, the auncient reportes also
beeing now to no purpose, and the briefe that is ordinarily
deliuered abroad, being rather imagined and full of errors
then containing matter of truth) I haue resolued with my




<pb facs="tcp:18221:9"/>
selfe, to be more diligently enformed, as farre as possibly I
could, of all those particulars which I thought meet and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
to bee knowne in these times, because I am verily
perswaded, that the present warre now in hand, is a matter
of the greatest consequence that is at this time currant in
the world. All which I haue done vpon speciall and priuate
conference that I haue had with persons of great experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and iudgement, who are lately come out of those parts,
not trusting mine owne selfe in such matters, which I haue
heretofore seene, and oftentimes verie deeply considered of.
And so at last I haue reduced the whole into a briefe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
Method, for the benefit and seruice of Christian
princes, &amp; specially of those, who in regard of their interests
with the Turke, haue greatest neede of such information.
For seeing I was not able, by reason of mine infirmitie, to
follow the warres, as <hi>I</hi> ought to haue done, after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Benedict Soranzo</hi> my father, who died at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of <hi>Gorzolari</hi> in fighting against the Turkes, yet had
I a desire at the least to doe some seruice to the common-wealth,
which alloweth it to be a matter lawfull for euerie
man to labour and write, as <hi>Polyaenus</hi> of Macedonie
writte to the Emperours <hi>Antoninus</hi> and <hi>Verus,</hi> rather
then by choosing to liue idle and free to my selfe, I shoulde
seeme altogither vnprofitable and vnfruitfull to all others.
So did <hi>Diogenes,</hi> when the rest of the valiant and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
Citizens were verie busie in defending the walles
of their Countrey, he went vp and downe in the Market
place, rolling his Tunne to and fro, because he alone would
not be idle (as he said) whiles other were valiantly labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with their weapons.</p>
            <p>And therefore in this discourse or report, I will entreate
of the Ottoman Empire and specially vnder <hi>Mahamet</hi> the




<pb facs="tcp:18221:9"/>
third, vntill the yeare 1597. The time I do of purpose set
downe, because I know verie well, that the euent and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of warre may alter many things, according to the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie
of the Prince, or necessitie of sundrie occasions,
which euen to this houre haue altered and changed sundry
matters. And this will I doe principally and chiefly regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that which apperteyneth to the knowledge of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
warre, which the Turke now wageth agaynst the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
and the Transiluanian, or any other matter, which
by occasion of the same warre may fall out to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
For if I would haue vndertaken a longer course, I
should haue too much enlarged this volume, peraduenture
to the griefe and tedious conceits of other men. Besides
that a great part of the remnant of this hystorie, I haue at
large extended in other my writings, and part thereof I
may perhappes performe in other occasions. Howbeit I will
not forbeare to tell you of many matters, especially of such
as may be at all times profitable and beneficiall to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome:
to the ende, that aswell those which liue at this
day, as also those which shall succeede vs in posteritie may
in some sort reape some benefite and pleasure of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
wherein that I may proceed methodically, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
I will distinguish and diuide this present relation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
three parts.</p>
            <p>In the first it shall be entreated of the Head, of the
Members, and of the forces of the Ottoman Empyre.</p>
            <p>In the second, of the Cogitations and Designements of
the Turkish Prince: of the causes of this present warre, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the beginning and proceedings thereof: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
for the better vnderstanding of euery thing, the original
of the said warre shall be fetched and repeated, euen from
<hi>Amurath,</hi> father to this liuing <hi>Mahamet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>


               <pb facs="tcp:18221:10"/>
In the third and last, it shall be discoursed, that suppose
the Grand Turke will be reconciled, whether it be good for
the Emperour, and the Transiluanian, to entertaine peace
wiih him. Wherein also many matters shall be discouered,
which (if the warre shall continue) may be plotted agaynst
him by the said Princes, and which at all times may bee
practised by other Christian Princes, to meete with such
perils and dangers as are now imminent, or any other
which may hereafter light vpon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome
by the Ottoman
forces.</p>

as both in regard of the common ambition of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring

not change his course. Whereof being oftentimes
aduertised by the Ladie <hi>Sultane,</hi> his mother, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
aduised by her to plucke this suspition out of his

was so farre giuen ouer thereunto, as either altering

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18221:13"/>
other things, what were the forces of his state. Hee
did well know the dislikes and braules which were
amongst the Bassaes, and especially betweene <hi>Sinan</hi>
and <hi>Ferat:</hi> in whose handes remained at that time
the whole management of his Empire, as in due
place we shall shew hereafter. There was in <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
a verie great dearth of all things necessary for
vittaile, and specially of bread. He perceiued that the
subiects were much discontented for many debts,
which his father had not payed, but afterwards
he satisfied them himselfe. He was not fullie perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
what stirres the <hi>Persian</hi> might make, for the
death of the young hostage <hi>Haidar,</hi> sonne to <hi>Emir
Hamze,</hi> who was eldest sonne to <hi>Mahamet Coda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banda:</hi>
which was thought to haue happened not
without some suspicion of poysoning. Besides that
his principall Captaines promised, that they would
follow the warres without his presence: (for they
thought, that so they might the more easily enrich
themselues.) He gaue exceeding credite to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
counsel and aduise of <hi>Sinan,</hi> who had vowed
the vtter ruine and destruction, not onely of the
Prince of <hi>Transiluania,</hi> but also of the Emperor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any great difficultie: (and all this, because by
continuing still in that supreme degree of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which he then enioyed, hee might make his
perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the greater.) Moreouer, most true it is, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamet</hi>
loueth peace: for that fiercenesse and crueltie
which is naturall in him, and yet mollified by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and ease, as Iron is by fire,<note place="margin">Why he killed one of his dearlings.</note> is rather the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a tyrant, then the hardinesse of a true warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
And that was manifestly declared on a time,




<pb facs="tcp:18221:14"/>
when one of his dearest women, with teares &amp; most
affectionate praiers besought him in his gardens,
that he would not go forth to the warres, by reason
of a certaine strange and wonderfull dreame which
she had the night before: but hee, growing into a
great rage, for that shee went about in such sort to
hinder the glorie, or rather, (as he said himselfe) the
safetie of his state,<note place="margin">He threatned his mother.</note> with his owne hand slue her: and
did not sticke likewise to threaten his mother, that
he would also kill her, though otherwise shee was
greatly esteemed and dearly beloued of him.</p>
               <p>True also it is, that it was most conuenient for
him to applie himselfe to the necessitie of the time,<note place="margin">How the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the visiers was diminished.</note>
because he was but little esteemed, and not so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
obeyed by his subiects, as the most part of the
former <hi>Ottoman</hi> princes were: by reason that the
authoritie, which in times past was wont to be in the
chief <hi>Visier,</hi> he suffered to be communicated and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
among the other <hi>Visiers:</hi> so that whensoeuer
any fauour or benefite was graunted to any by one
of them, it was verie often repealed and reuoked by
the rest: <hi>A course that of all other doth soonest abate loue,
and ingender contempt.</hi> And so much the rather, for
that his father <hi>Amurath</hi> had taken order that the
<hi>Visiers</hi> might bee remooued vpon euerie light occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and had also brought vp a new custome to
create many for money, and increased the number
of them from foure to nine. Lastly, hee was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
thereunto by the often chaunge and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which he vsed to make of his Heades and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
either vpon some wrong information, that
he had of the state, and of their natures, or else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause




<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18221:14"/>
it is a naturall propertie belonging to the Turks
to chaunge their honours, and also their purposes,
according to the euents of fabulous Fortune. For
hauing receiued diuerse and sundrie discomfitures,
he was of opinion (and indeed he doth alwayes put
it in practise) that with the alteration of the head,
hee shoulde make the members more couragious
and hardie.</p>
               <p>But against all these reasons aboue rehearsed,<note place="margin">How he gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the good will of the Souldiers.</note>
there were other respectes that preuayled indeede
with him, and caused him to goe forth to the warre:
and in particular, because the Souldiours being

Where hauing now at the last appeared in
person, hee hath obteyned great reputation, hee
hath cancelled the dishonourable opinion that was
conceyued of him, and he hath yeelded a singular
satisfaction to his subiects: and so much the more,
for that he endeuoured himselfe to gaine the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence
of his Souldiours, by shewing himselfe not
onely verie liberall in bestowing largely vpon them,
but also prouident and circumspect in walking on
foote and visiting their lodgings. For which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being reprooued by some of his Counsellers,
for that hee exposed and offered himselfe too much
to manifest daunger, contrarie to the custome of
his predecessours, hee aunswered them with the
wordes of <hi>Cyrus, That all those which followed him in

account of them as of himselfe.</hi> Another action of
his there was, which did greatly reconcile their

such as scatteringly went abroade from their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginges:

Whereupon he thought him worthie not onely of

ceased not daily to entreate her sonne, that he would
cause him to be put to death, because shee could not
endure that a slaue should be so bould, as to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

feare, and great reason he had so to do, not onely in
regard of the vnstayednesse and inconstancie of the
Prince, and the great affection which he bare to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

of this foresaid account, because they haue had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration

this came to passe especially by reason of the heauie imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

truth, because it was good siluer, and so by coyning it againe
somewhat baser, the Treasurie and the Officers did gaine
greatly thereby. But now (forsooth) they are not so supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

would haue deserued great commendation for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that he hath disclosed in many Turkish matters.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Giannizzaries</hi> then (as it hath beene sayd) are
the best souldiors on foot,<note place="margin">The Giannez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries.</note> that the Turkish Empire
hath. They serue as the <hi>Praetorian</hi> souldiours did,
and the <hi>Mamulukes,</hi> for the sauegard of their Lord,
and as did those valiant youths that alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
the kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> who were called also <hi>Iani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores,</hi>
or <hi>Porters,</hi> as saith the Authour of that booke,
whose title is <hi>De mundo,</hi> amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the works of <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
And thereupon it pleased some peraduenture to
think, that the <hi>Giannezzaries</hi> were so called of <hi>Ianua:
i.</hi> a Doore,<note place="margin">Not so called of the worde Ianua.</note> alluding to the word <hi>Porta<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that is to say
the Court of the great Turke, because his Court of
Audience is ordinarily kept in the gate of his Palace.
But in truth, they are greatly deceyued therein: for
a Gate in the Turkish language is called <hi>Capi,</hi> and so
is not <hi>Ianua. i.</hi> a Dore: and therefore the chiefe Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is called by the Turkes <hi>Capisi Bassi.</hi> The word <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annizzaro</hi>
is compounded of two Turkish wordes,<note place="margin">The true Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologie of the Giannizzaries.</note>
                  <hi>Iegni-Zeri,</hi> which signifie <hi>Noua Militia,</hi> a new Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierie:
New, not because it was newly brought in,
(for it was instituted euen by <hi>Osmanne Gasi,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

and enlarged by <hi>Amurath</hi> the first, vpon the aduice
and counsell of <hi>Cara Rustem,</hi> who was then helde by
the Turks to be a verie holy man:) But new or fresh
they are called, because the <hi>Giannizzaries</hi> are the
sonnes of Christians, taken from their fathers whiles
they are but children, by the Officers of the great
Turke, as it were for a tribute, euerie fift or seuen
yeare, and sometimes oftener: beeing of the age




<pb facs="tcp:18221:26"/>
some peraduenture of eight, some of ten, some of
twentie yeares, and some aboue. And afterwardes
they are for the most part destributed among the
Turkes in <hi>Natolia,</hi> to the end they may be instructed
betimes in the lawes of <hi>Mahamet,</hi> learne the fashions
and language of that Nation, and accustome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to labour and hardnesse, and then are they
called <hi>Agiamoglani,</hi> as it hath beene told you before.
When they are growne fit for the warres, then they
are sent to the Court, to be admitted into the order
of the <hi>Giannizzaries.</hi> Those that are not found fit for
the warres, are sent to the Shippes, and to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
that they may be employed in the Arte of Sea-faring.
But they that are of a pregnant wit and good
Spirit, are at the verie first shut vp in one of the
<hi>Serraglioes</hi> of <hi>Andrinople,</hi> or of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> or
of <hi>Pera,</hi> and so by means they come to be employed
in the seruice of the great Turke about his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
vnder the rule and subiection of certaine parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
gouernours.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Giannizzaries</hi> haue for their stipend betwene
fiue and sixe <hi>Aspres</hi> a day,<note place="margin">The Gianniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries wages. &amp;c.</note> and so haue the <hi>Agiamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glani</hi>
likewise: but they are distinguished by liueries.
For the <hi>Giannizzaries</hi> haue two liueries euery yeare,
and the <hi>Agimoglani</hi> haue but one. The <hi>Giannizzaries</hi>
doe handle the Arquebuse very well, and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called the Arquebusiers of the great Turkes
guard. They will fight resolutely for honour. Some
of the <hi>Giannazzaries</hi> remaine in the frontiers, and in
Garisons: some of them also keepe on the sea, and
serue in the Gallies, but the greatest part of them are
resident, where the great Turke is: and hereupon




<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18221:26"/>
it commeth that there are so many in <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
where principally they may sooner become <hi>Gian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizzaries.</hi>
But those that are made <hi>Giannizzaries</hi> at
<hi>Damasco</hi> at <hi>Cairo</hi> &amp; elswhere: perhaps, when they
come to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> vnlesse they be there confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

the last time that they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out to wars with their
<hi>Aga</hi> (a thing not verie vsual) they rather caused great

by the <hi>Persian</hi> word they call <hi>Ser-Dar,</hi> and by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabike

not onely towards priuate persons, who greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

principall forces of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and being
verie seldome, or verie sclenderly chastised for any
fault and thereupon knowing themselues to be very
mightie and greatly feared, they haue not forborne
many times to threaten, that they would depose
their great Lord and Maister, and set his Son in his

throne: yea and verie oftentimes they haue violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with most barbarous furie enforced their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to yeelde vnto them in most vnrighteous cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
As for example, (to leaue those that are aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,)
they so dealt with the last <hi>Amurath,</hi> as they
compelled him to giue them into their handes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quicke or dead, the chiefe <hi>Dephterdaro,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamet
Bassa</hi> the <hi>Armenian,</hi> (a man whome hee loued

two are as Collegues or Assistants in the Exchecker.</p>
               <p>It hath fallen out also, that they are thus become
the more sedicious and insolent, because the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them is greatly encreased and multiplied, and
that through the default of the officers that are sent
to make the choice of the youthes: for they doe not
choose the best and the most able for warfare (as it
was wont to be vsed in times past,) but such as they
may haue for want of better men, shuffeling in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes,
by fauour and bribes, many natural borne
Turkes, and sonnes of the <hi>Giannizzaries</hi> themselues:
as indeede it came to passe in these last yeares, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they haue had no consideration of any other

reported them to be, then in truth they are: for as

               <p>Secondly that the horsemen, in whome principally
consisteth the power of that Empire, are not at this
day so lustie, resolute, and painfull, and to be shorte
nothing at all such as they were wont to be, for that
they haue been greatly wasted and consumed in the

where barley was so scant, and all other kinde
of victualles, for men, horses, cammels and other

               <p>Thirdly, that the <hi>Spahi,</hi> who are the best horsemen
that the great Turke hath, haue not had any meanes
to buy good horses, not only by reason of the dearth
of all things, (which I tell you was verie great) but
also because all their good horses are spent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
neither haue the <hi>Spahi</hi> any commoditie or
benefit to maintaine them withall, or to buy them
any new, but only that which they defaulke out of
their <hi>Timari.</hi> Moreouer, they beeing become men
now a dayes greatly giuen to ease and to gaines, do
not sticke to take money to interest, rather to the end
they may buy some <hi>Timari</hi> withall then buy any
horse-flesh with it, yea and to lend it out at vsurie
to others that afterwardes become banckrouts. And
although peraduenture it may seeme to some, that
in these last yeares, the horses were many: the cause
thereof was this, that the Turkes are now become so
tender and effeminate, (especially since the <hi>Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
of the <hi>Persians</hi> haue wrought euen the very selfe
same effect in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which riot and excesse wrought

(for sooth) will carie with him to the wars, so many

greatly enlarged, those Turks, who in times past for
the straitnes of rowme &amp; narrownes of the countrie,
ran all to the wars like the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> haue now got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
more ease, greater pleasure, &amp; better countrie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they had before, so that they do not verie willingly
resolue with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to leaue their own houses, &amp;
to go to the Campe. 2. Moreouer the countrey by
reason of the largenes thereof is so far distant &amp; as it
were diuided fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the places where they must fight,
that it breedeth great tediousnes in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to go to the
wars: &amp; to people or to replenish it al with inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
it is a very hard matter, especially co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering that the
<hi>Ottoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> Princes haue alwaies vsed to extirpate &amp; (as
a man may say) vtterly to root out the ancient inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
of any new Prouinces, which they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
&amp; gotten into their possession: or at least to
transport the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into some other countries. 3. Ye may
also adde hereunto, that the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie &amp; encrease
of the countrey hath opened a way to the Turks for
diuers other, and greater traffiques then they had in
times past: wherin the greatest part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
they cannot so easely bee resolued now to
leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; to go to fight, vnlesse they bee enforced




<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18221:29"/>
to it against their willes: because by that course
they must seeke to enrich themselues with more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie
and greater hazard of their liues, then by
this of traffike. 4. Besides all this the Turkish
armies consist (for the most part) onely of Rinegate
slaues, and those, Christians: for the Turkes doe not
make any slaues of the Persians or Tartarians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they will not part or diuide with them their
Militarie honours and aduauncements, wherein all
the riches, credit and authoritie of their estate doth
wholy consist, and wherewith that Empire doth
counterpoise the perill and daunger, whereunto it
might bee subiect, if they should admit so great a
number of armed <hi>Rinegadoes.</hi> 5. Those of <hi>Asia,</hi> who in
times past were wont to execute all Militarie func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
are now held in small reputation, or none at
all, euen as the naturall Turkes are, and esteemed to
be verie base minded and cowards, no lesse tender
and effeminate, then the auncient <hi>Asiatici</hi> were
thought to be: and therefore they graunt vnto them
onely the honours of <hi>Cadileskieri</hi> and <hi>Cadi:</hi> excepting
some few, that are admitted to be souldiours, and do
serue the <hi>Sangiacchi,</hi> and the <hi>Bassaes,</hi> who ordinarily
and for the most part are themselues slaues of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and sent to be gouernours in diuerse places of <hi>Asia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Cadiliskieri</hi> (or as the Arabians call them)
<hi>Casiaskeri,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Cadiles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kieri, and the Cadi.</note> that is to say, chiefe Iudges in the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Empire, and the ordinary Iudges of causes both Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
and Militarie, are two, the one in <hi>Natolia,</hi> and the
other in <hi>Romania.</hi> He of <hi>Cairo</hi> is not properly called
<hi>Cadiliskiero</hi> (as some haue written) but the <hi>Graund-Cadi,</hi>
and was instituted by <hi>Selem,</hi> after that he had
subdued a great part of the Armenians, the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,




<pb facs="tcp:18221:30"/>
the Sorians, and the Arabians.</p>
               <p>And although there be some,<note place="margin">Why Greece is not now so well peopled as it hath bin.</note> that do attribute
the want of Turkish Souldiers, to the diminishment
of men, by example of the <hi>Arcipelago,</hi> and of Greece,
which is for the most part disinhabited, and of all
Macedonia, which is the best part of the Turkes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions:
it may be answered, that Greece euer since
those times wherein the flower of her greatnes and
Maiestie was extinguished, hath also remained so
barren &amp; void of men, that it was neuer so reinhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as it was before. <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> in one onely day
destroyed threescore and ten Cities in <hi>Epirus:</hi> and
many Ilandes there be, which are vtterly waste, and
not habitable for barrennesse. Besides that, the Ciuill
warres of the Romans, the simplicitie of the Greeke
Emperours, the <hi>Armadaes,</hi> and fleetes of the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens,
and also of the Latines, and last of all of the
Turkes, togither with the notorious iniuries of ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
and Pirates, haue neuer suffered those Ilandes,
and the rest of that most populous Countrey, so
much as to take breath.</p>
               <p>True also it is,<note place="margin">How it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe that the Turks countrey is so much disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited.</note> that a man may walke many a mile
through the Turks Countrey, and find neither men
nor houses. But the reason of this is, for that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
hauing left the townes and walled places,
which are situate either vpon the beaten and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
high wayes, or very neere vnto them are eloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
afarre of, and haue scattered themselues further
within the countrey, and retired into places among
the Mountaines that are more strong, where they
haue setled themselues in verie populous numbers,
because they would be safe &amp; secure from the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,




<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18221:30"/>
and robberies of the Souldiers: who are wont
euen among the Turks (I would to God it were not
so also among vs Christians) to liue at their owne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
without all discretion, spoyling and wasting
whatsoeuer they can attaine: for such is their vse
and wickednesse, not the profession of true Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
as more at large I haue shewed in my booke cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Militia Christiana,</hi> Christian Souldierie.</p>
               <p>And these are in mine opinion,<note place="margin">Why the Turks armies are so full of poore rascals.</note> the most certaine
and true reasons of the Diminution of the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
armies: but why they are now so full of people that
are poore, and as it were vtterly spoyled, this reason
may be yeelded, viz. for that onely men of euill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and such as are the basest persons, and of no
woorth, runne headlong to their warres. And so
much the rather, for that the <hi>Spahi</hi> themselues doe
send thither in their owne rowmes their seruants &amp;
knaues, who togither with the rest of the Souldiers,
haue no sooner taken a bootie (or peraduenture no
sooner want an occasion to catch a bootie) but they
will flie out of the campe, and returne home againe.
As for example, the souldiers of <hi>Sinan</hi> did in <hi>Wala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia</hi>
the last year, who hauing nothing left, but their
shirt-sleeues, and being almost vtterly spoyled: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they would not die for cold and hunger, and
because they found nothing to steale for their relief
in the fieldes, began almost euen at the first to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
him: yea and at the returne of the great. Turke
himselfe from <hi>Belgrado</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> all the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
almost would needes follow him, and none of
their Captaines were able to hold them.</p>

where the countrey being verie plaine and euen,

altogether vnfruitfull, not onely because they

haue beene, but also beecause that little which
the grounde yeeldeth, is purloyned by men,
and trampled with horses. Beesides that, the
<hi>Walachian</hi> and the <hi>Moldauian,</hi> who beeing as

woont to bee verie plentifull of corne:) which they
may easily do, because the Country is partly plaine,
and partly hilly, but without any stones. They may
also take the same way of <hi>Salonicchi,</hi> by passing
through the Champaines of <hi>Moraua</hi> in <hi>Seruia,</hi> not
farre from the most fertile plaines of <hi>Cossouo,</hi> which
our writers do call the Champaines of Black birds,
by reason of the great multitude of them that were
seene there before the battaile, wherein <hi>Amurath</hi> the
first was slaine. Whereupon I do note by the way,
that the ancient writers were in an errour,<note place="margin">An errour of the auncients touching Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia and Seruia.</note> whiles
they thought, that a man coulde not possibly
passe through all the Mountaines of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and

passed, excepting onely that part of them, which out
of <hi>Epirus</hi> entreth into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> for that is in deede
vnpassible with carriages.</p>
               <p>Now touching the point,<note place="margin">How the Turk may be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from his vittailes by sea.</note> how to hinder the
Turkes vittailes, that they may not be conueighed
and brought into those Countryes, where the wars
now are. I doe thinke that it will proue a verie diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
and hard matter for vs Christians to bring it to
passe, either by sea or by land. The vittailes of <hi>Asia,</hi>
which come out of Aegypt, and are embarked at
<hi>Alexandria, Damiata,</hi> and other places, cannot be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
or stayed, without an Armada, or a fleete
of shippes, nor without fighting also with the fleete
of the enemie. Besides that the <hi>Arcipelago,</hi> where
this must specially and principally bee attempted,
hath many channels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18221:38"/>
And by land,<note place="margin">By land.</note> they can be stopped but in one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
case (vnlesse the Turke might bee debarred and
kept out of his owne Countrey, which is the hardest
thing of all.) And this onely way is for the <hi>Transil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanian,</hi>
togither with the <hi>Walachians,</hi> to passe ouer to
the hither side of the <hi>Danowe,</hi> and interpose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
betweene <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> and <hi>Seruia,</hi> which in times

comes to all, there is no remedie but we must looke

the eight battail against eightie thousand of them, as
(among others) <hi>Thomas Bozius</hi> writing against <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiauel</hi>
hath at large described.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, euerie man that hath warred with the
Turkes doth know well enough, that they lodge at
large: and that in their marching they go verie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly,
so that they may verie easily be endamaged
in the tayle of their Armie. <hi>George Castriota,</hi> was
one of the most famous Captaines, that euer fought


<pb facs="tcp:18221:42"/>
with the Turkes,<note place="margin">Scander-Beg.</note> and was otherwise called <hi>Iskander-Beg,

years of age: (for the Turkes at circumcision change
the name, as we vse to doe at baptisme.) This man
fighting thus with the Turks being in this disarray,
had such victories of them as were most worthie of
triumph.</p>
               <p>Besides all this the Turkes, when they do fight,
put more confidence in their Multitude, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that they haue of <hi>Destinie,</hi> in the noyse of

of their barbarous shoutings,<note place="margin">Good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among the Turkes.</note> then they haue in any

good things they haue, as namely, a Supreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
in their Captaine Generall, an obedience in
the souldiers, though now it be somewhat dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
forces alwayes readie,<note place="margin">A fault in Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces.</note> so that they shall not

they do of their own, and to make a leauie of souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
are enforced to euacuate and emptie their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suries
and to consume the greatest part of their time
vnprofitably. The Turkes spend their treasure
either in matters of greatest importaunce,<note place="margin">Good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Turkes.</note> or in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
liberally vpon their souldiers: which is a
most sharpe spurre to animate and encourage them

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18221:42"/>
no action, but with order and great militarie
preparation: and for the most part they fight not
out of season.</p>
               <p>And although some be of an opinion,<note place="margin">Engyners.</note> that the
Turkes want Engyners, yet it is daily seene, that with
great facilitie and ease they ouerthrowe the greatest
fortes and fortresses of the worlde, whereof they
make no account at all: for sometimes they will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the enimies officers, with honours, with gifts,
and with prouinces, and sometimes they will make
breaches into the walles with continuall batteries,
working with the mattocke, filling vp the trenches,
and other whiles also ouerwhelming Citties, either
with huge artificiall mountaynes of earth, or with
vndermining: and lastly, disquieting the inhabitants
with perpetuall and importunate assaults and neuer
giuing ouer the enterprise till it be performed.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, they do not want any munition,<note place="margin">Bullet Artillarie.</note> of
Bullet, Artillarie, Powder. For Bullet, they alwaies
make it when they haue neede of it. For Artillarie,
they haue great quantitie of it, at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> at
<hi>Pera,</hi> at <hi>Belgrado,</hi> and at <hi>Buda:</hi> the most part of it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the Christians. They haue also learned
to cast Artillarie: the more shame for vs, who haue
not beene contented to transport our arrant cruell
enimies out of <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>Europe</hi> in <hi>Amurathes</hi> time,
but haue also become Maisters vnto them in this
Arte: and I would to God, that we did not likewise
carrie them great store of Armour and weapons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides:
nothing regarding or fearing the wrath of
God, the excommunication of the Popes, nor the

                  </note> it is

(which is a place not farre distant from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople:</hi>)
and elsewhere in great aboundance.</p>
               <p>The Turkes do also greatly practise militarie stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagemes,<note place="margin">Stratagems.</note>
or wilie pollicies in warre, whereby they
do vse to mingle deceite with force, according to
the commandement of <hi>Mahomet</hi> their law-giuer:
neither do they want meanes and ministers, that
are cunning and skilfull to practise the same, both
because all such, as among them do attend the Arte

knowe whatsoeuer is necessarre for the good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of an exployte, and also because fraud and
deceite is a thing most proper to the Turke. Much

hereof, let him read, (among others that haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

sundrie Princes, and specially by the Christians, by
his owne seruiters and subiects, and by all such as
haue any thing to deale with him, not permitting
any person to come before his presence with emptie

well consider the nature of the whole generation of

otherwise, especially in that most abhominable sin of
lecherie, and chiefly for many yeares before the end

memoriall of all his businesse, of all his reuenues or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie

which he kept in a booke appointed by him for that

may be peraduenture, that by reason of these his too

deed by his naturall inclination, he was for the most
part verie full of melancholie: which besides that it
made him somewhat still and sparing of speech, and
oftentimes irkesome and tedious to himselfe, it also
procured him to be exceedingly suspitious of any

hold opinion, that the said Simple or Drugge doth

that he who hath once eaten of it, cannot any more

many Dwarffes and many dumbe persons,
whom hee would cause to fight togither one with
another, to the end hee might take some pleasure in
the sight of so vaine a pastime. Hee made warre ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for religion and exercise of his people, then for
that he was giuen to warre by Nature: and that also
he folowed not by himselfe, but alwayes by his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.

had enlarged the confines of his Empire, euen as

and by the execution and exployte of his saide

                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:18221:51"/>

that Empire lasted and continued. That so likewise
had the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperours done in times past, who
doe not holde the end of warre to bee peace, as the
Princes of Christendome, and other weake princes
doe, but they take the onely ende of warre to bee
warre, whereby the Turkes haue not onely ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and enlarged their Empire to that huge great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
wherein now it is, but haue also kept their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
occupied and busied: and so haue diuerted
them from ciuill seditions and insurrections, which
for the most part are bred &amp; nourished by ease and
idlenesse. To be short, that the subiects, whiles they
continue in peace, some grow to be cowards, some
apply themselues too greedily to trades and traffike,
and some to spoyling and robberie, insomuch that
thereby there will be vtterly lost the knowledge of
the Sea-warres, which hath now a long time beene
almost abandoned, and of the land-warre also, if for
any long space they should ceasse to make warres.
And consequently they should want Captaines, and
valiant or hardie Souldiers, because the onely vse
of war doth inure men to become good warriours,

And first, touching the renuing of the warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Persia</hi> (a kingdom which the Turks comprise
vnder the name of <hi>Azemia:</hi>) they argued, that when
soeuer the king should see the great Turk entangled
in other enterprises, he wold surely break the peace,
as well for the recouerie of his Country, which was
lost with smal honour &amp; credite, as also to be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
at one time or other, of all the olde griefes and
iniuries that he had receyued of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours.
That hee should be prouoked thereunto
and assisted therein by the Christian Princes, and
specially by the king of Spaine, who could verie wel
doe it by the way of the Indies, and by sending vnto
him (as at sundry other times he had done) enginers,
Gunners, and such other helpes. That the Countrey
was not yet well setled, the fortresses were new, and


<pb facs="tcp:18221:53"/>
the Inhabitants (lately planted) in great danger, and
somewhat too farre off, to be relieued in time. That
if the Persians would do nothing else, but ransacke
and forrage the Champaine, the said Inhabitantes
should be compelled and inforced to yeeld and giue
place, vnlesse they would perish for hunger. That
not to atchieue or obtaine, but to prosecute and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a victorie, is the true glorie. That the Turke
should take good heede, not to offend the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> nor to moue him to indignation or
wrath, considering that he had obtained greater vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
agaynst the enemies of his Religion, then euer
his predecessors had obtained in former times: and
therefore it was fit and conuenient, and it was also
the dutie of a religious and thankefull prince, not to
omit the iniuries that were done both to God and
man. There was added to this, that <hi>Vsbegh-Han</hi> had
voluntarily offered to serue him in this warre, and so
had the prince of <hi>Geilan</hi> also.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Vsbegh-Han,</hi> is the Prince of those Tartarians,<note place="margin">Who Vsbegh-Han is.</note>

                  <note place="margin">What Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians are called Ketzie-Bassi and why?</note> because they weare Caps co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

victorie, considering the good successe that he hath

yet verie lately he had held secrete intelligence

the Spaniards doe vtterly refuse euen for their

also as <hi>Tratan</hi> the Emperour was minded to haue
done in his time. Againe, that the passages into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica
might be much troubled, especially if the Turke
would set vpon the Spanish coast in the Mid-land
sea, which would bee a great contentment to the
subiects, who doe continuallie make humble peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and supplication for it, as well in regard of the
safetie of their traffique and pilgrimages, as also that
the poore Moores might once bee deliuered from
the dominion of the Spaniard,<note place="margin">The Moores wearie of the Spanish go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</note> as <hi>Selim</hi> at the lest

for that the said Moores, who are now multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
into a great number, although they keepe
close both for feare, &amp; also for their traffique, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are growen to bee verie rich, yet as well by
nature, as also for Religion, doe beare a mortall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
against the Spaniards. Moreouer, that this
course might easily bee performed by reason of the
conueniencie of the hauens in Africa, which lie neer
at hand: and also because the said Princes of Fraunce
and England, haue offered to continue their warres,
with him: the King of France, by disquieting him
in the parts of <hi>Nauarra,</hi> for the chalenge which hee
hath thereunto: and the Queene of England (as it
hath beene said) not onely by setting vpon him in
the West Indies, and in the Ocean, which she may
doe both by North and by West, but also by raising
againe some new stirres in Portugall, where there
doth not want great store of Mal-contents. For that


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18221:56"/>
people doth thinke, that with the losse of their last
king, they haue also lost all their wealth and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie:
because that as vnder his gouernment they grew
rich by the peace that he intertained with the said
princes of France and England: so vnder the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
dominion they do find, that by the warres they
liue in continuall perils and daunger. Againe, there
be many banished and discontented persons, not
onely of the kingdome of Portugall, but also of the
kingdome of Aragon in France, in England, and in
Constantinople, who togither with many Moores,
(which also were in Constantinople) haue offered
many aydes and helpes both secretly and openly:
and haue promised that the enterprise will be verie
easie, when so euer Spaine shall be set vpon, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if it bee done vpon a sudden. For the greatest

               <p>THe fift opinion,<note place="margin">The fift opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to break peace with Venice: &amp; the reasons therof.</note> was to breake the peace with
the state of Venice: For this said they, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured
to perswade the great Turks mind there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
rather with apparent reasons, then with such
as were true in deede: (though peraduenture, <hi>euery
man easily beleeuing that which he desireth,</hi> they might
seeme verie probable and likely to the Turkes:) that
no enterprise happily would proue lesse hard and
difficult then this, as it might be found by the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
and examples of such actions as had passed
heretofore: especially seeing the Turkes not many
yeares agoe hauing warred with the Venetians, and
surprised somewhat of theirs, had receiued many
and great satisfactions at their hands to make peace
with them. That the said Common-wealth &amp; State
of Venice, accounting peace to be the end wherat it
shooteth, it should seeme that the people is time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and cowardly, and by their ancient ordinances
and customes, do neuer prepare themselues to war,
but when they are drawne vnto it by force: that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
they will thinke to be ouercome, before
they looke for it, as it fell out with them for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Cyprus. That if the said state would make
resistance by it selfe alone, perhaps it hath not forces
sufficient: if ioyned in confederacie with others,<note place="margin">The king of Spaine cannot helpe Venice against the Turke.</note> it
could not performe any great matter in haste, by
reason of the many difficulties, that depend vppon
leagues: and namely of the seuerall cogitations and
interestes, wherewith the Spanish king is now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled:


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18221:57"/>
in regard whereof it was inforced at last to
make peace with <hi>Selem.</hi> Moreouer, that it was a hard
matter, if not impossible, that the said king, being so
greatly occupied in his other warres, could at this
time ioyne in league with that state: and also that
without him all other confederacies, to ake warre
by Sea, were of no importaunce or consideration.
And as for the Pope, though it be very likely, that he
will do al that possibly he can do,<note place="margin">What reliefe the Pope can yeeld to Venice.</note> to keepe the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
princes from annoying the said state, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will aduertise and admonish them to ayde and
succour it: yet the most that he can doe himselfe is
onely that he may yeeld it some assistance, either of
moneys, or of some Ecclesiasticall profites, or else
peraduenture hee may send to ioyne with their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada,
his fiue Gallies, which togither with the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of <hi>Malta,</hi> of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> and of <hi>Florence,</hi> can make no
mo but twentie in all, at the most. And besides, that
the said state of Venice hath not happily that good
intelligence, with all the rest of the Christian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which in such a case were needfull for it, (but
the Turkes are therein greatly deceiued.) And to be
short, seeing it hath spent great store of golde in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
the debtes of the Treasurie, whereinto it
had runne by the last warres, and by building many
fortresses, it will be found peraduenture not so well
prouided and furnished with money. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that all that state being verie full of forts, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible

because the warre of Hungary succeeded
not according to his mind: (and yet some thinke ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

was accused to haue practised intelligence with the

to the Turkish campe, because <hi>Ferat</hi> himselfe was

               <p>Some other Bassaes were of opinion, that the

all along the coastes of the Adriaticall sea, with a
full resolution to surprise that part that should bee

Which course they did thinke would very easily sort
to verie good purpose, because they presumed, that
all the places which lay vpon the sea, might verie
fitly bee annoyed also vpon the land, for that the
Turkes haue almost all that Countrey in their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.
These Bassaes likewise aboue all other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,<note place="margin">Others Pola.</note>
propounded the easinesse and also the great
importance of possession <hi>Pola,</hi> and <hi>Ragugia.</hi> The one
because it is a Citie, which is altogither disinhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and hath a verie faire hauen, and is situate in

with Souldiers and inhabitants, nor greatly streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened

it seemeth that the said City of <hi>Pola,</hi> is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from Venice, aboue a hundred and twentie


<pb facs="tcp:18221:60"/>
miles. And the other, that is to say <hi>Raegugia,</hi> because
it is (as it were) the second Gate,<note place="margin">Others Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gugi.</note> (for the first and
chiefest is thought to bee <hi>Corfu</hi>) whereby you
may enter into the Maritimall and Sea-state of
the Venetian Common-wealth in the Adriaticall
sea, and also because the situation therefore, is most
fit and conuenient for preparation to be made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
for annoying of Italie, if they should meane so to
do in good earnest: especially, for that the state of
<hi>Rugugia</hi> hath within it most safe and spacious portes
and hauens, whereof indeed the Turke hath great
want in that quarter of the sea.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Durazzo</hi> hath not any hauen able to receiue
foure Gallies,<note place="margin">What ports the Turke hath in the Adriatike sea.</note> and also in the entrance thereof, there
are many flattes and shelfes which are verie daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.
Twelue miles beyond <hi>Durazzo,</hi> vnder the
Cape or Promo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>torie of <hi>Lacchi,</hi> there is an other har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough
for twenty gallies, or there aboutes, but it is
not verie safe: neither are there any great good wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
about it. In the Gulfe of Velona, there is also an
other harborough vnder the land for so many gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes
likewise. Somewhat nearer on this side, about
some eight miles, is the Hauen called <hi>Porto Raguseo,</hi>
where may lodge some thirtie Gallyes, but not verie
safely on the North, on the Northwest, nor on the
West. Without the Gulfe, at least in the coast of
<hi>Albania,</hi> or rather within the Gulfe (for the ancient
Authours doe bound the <hi>Adriaticall</hi> Sea with the
mountaines of <hi>Cimmeria</hi>) there is first the Hauen of
<hi>Santi quaranta (i.</hi> the fortie Saints) where likewise
they may entertaine some few Gallyes. And a little
on this side of that, is <hi>Neribo,</hi> sometimes called <hi>Orico:</hi>


                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:18221:60"/>
where the Romanians touched, when they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from <hi>Ottranto,</hi> to the end they might afterwards
saile all along that coast. And this Hauen is able to
receiue fortie Gallies: but it is not verie safe. The
onely hauens of <hi>Ragugia,</hi> which be fiue or sixe,<note place="margin">The hauen of Santa Croce.</note> are of
the greatest receyte: in three whereof especially in
the Hauen of <hi>Santa-Croce,</hi> there may be intertained
and harboured all the Armadaes of the world, much
more the fleete of the Turkish Shippes. The same
place also is verie fit and conuenient for the Turkes,
because they may easily conueigh thither their tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
for ships, from the Mountaines of the <hi>Duca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gini</hi>
in <hi>Albania:</hi> which cannot so commodiously
be brought into the other portes aboue mentioned
as I haue somewhat more at large declared in other
writings that I haue penned vpon the occasion of
this warre.</p>
               <p>But the greatest part of the Visiers enclined most

not otherwise bee brought to passe,<note place="margin">What the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirs are, and why they wear a greene Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bante.</note> but by one of
these two wayes, as a captain of the <hi>Emirs</hi> once said.
(<hi>These</hi> Emirs <hi>professe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to be of the right &amp; true
descent from their Law giuer</hi> Mahomet, <hi>and therefore
they weare a greene</hi> Turbante:) that is to say, eyther by
binding the Venitians, that they shall not onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
to giue entertainment to the saide Gallyes
within there Seas, but also make satisfaction for all


<pb facs="tcp:18221:61"/>
losses, that the Turkes shall sustaine, as often as they
shall not safely guarde their said ships from all such
dangers. Or else by causing the Venetians to suffer
and permit a good companie of Turkish Gallyes to
be resident at <hi>Candie</hi> for that purpose. Herevnto
they added also, that this attempt would proue the
better, &amp; come to good successe, because that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is diuided in it selfe, by reason of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
which is betweene the Greeke Religion, and
the Latine, and for the great discontentments, which
some (but falsly and vainly peraduentur) do report,
to be growen betwene the noble men of Venice,
and the Noble men of Candie, betweene those that
are priuiledged persons, and those that are tied to
impositions and taxes, and betweene the Clownes
and the Gentlemen there. And so much the rather,
for that it is a verie easie matter to set vpon it with a
Turkish Armada, seeing it is (as it were) compassed
about with <hi>Natolia,</hi> with <hi>Caramania,</hi> with <hi>Barbarie,</hi>
with <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with <hi>Morea,</hi> and with the <hi>Arcipela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
which are all Countreys belonging to the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
Empire: so that they may easily from hand to
hand ayde and succour those that should first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to disturbe therein. Moreouer, that by the
purchase and winning of this most fruitfull Island,
they should obtaine the absolute commaund and
rule of the Sea, for that it is (as it were) the verie Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the world, considering that it is almost equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distant in situation from <hi>Asia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi>
so that it was by the auncient Authours adiudged
the most fit and conuenient seate of all the worlde.


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18221:61"/>
And this also might so much the more easily bee
brought to passe, for that thereby the number of
the Venetians Galleyes should be diminished, and
the Ottoman Empire should encrease the meanes to
make many moe Gallyes, then now they haue. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
seeing there are many <hi>Candiotes</hi> remayning in
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> they may haue good information,
and some aide also of them, and so much the more,
because many of them are banished persons, and
haue eyther withdrawne themselues into that Citty
to get their liuings, by labouring in the <hi>Arsenall,</hi> and
in <hi>Pera,</hi> or else are come thether with marchandises,

these, That if they were minded indeed to attempt

it first obtayned the Rule and Lordshippe of <hi>Italie:</hi>


                  <pb facs="tcp:18221:62"/>

That the Romanes became to bee Lordes

of <hi>Italie</hi> in possession. That the <hi>Hunnes</hi>
did alwayes direct all their designementes to that

by <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and by <hi>Carso.</hi> That the <hi>Alanes</hi>

that it is the Prouince, which is Queen of al the rest,<note place="margin">The praise of Italy.</note>

most famous and noble Cities, for riches, for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Sea, and seate of the Christians religion, for the
auncient Glorie and mightinesse of that Empire,
and for many other respects. That it would also bee
a verie easie matter to bring to passe, for that <hi>Italie</hi>
is at this day ruled and gouerned by manie Princes
which are diuided among themselues, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
of their owne priuate interestes, as also of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
nations, whereof they are proceeded: and that
peraduenture they are not all verie willingly and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly
obeyed of their Subiects and peoples, who
by reason of the peace, which they haue so many
yeares enioyed, will proue to be but cowards and
weakelings: and for that also they are growen to
such a huge multitude, as if entraunce should bee
made into the Countrey, either in one part or in
many, at such times as their corne were yet ripening
in their fields, as the Turks should on their behalfes
want no vittailes, so should the Italians be of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
constrained either to shut vp themselues within
their fortresses, or else to perish for hunger. Which
thing will be made more manifest and cleare, if yee
shall consider, that now whiles they liue in peace,
they haue not corne sufficient for their sustenance,
but are enforced to prouide the some abroad, and to
cause it to be brought to them from <hi>Morea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians prouide themselues of Corne.</note> from
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> and euen as farre as from the Ocean.
Moreouer, that the Italians are accustomed for the

or with traffique, in such sort, as if their trades were


<pb facs="tcp:18221:63"/>
hindered, they should bee compelled so much the
rather to yeeld to such conditions as the conquerour
shall impose vpon them, or at least to become tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,
and acknowledge the <hi>Ottomans</hi> power. And
besides, that the Turkish Souldiers would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
goe thither, because they are not to passe through
Countryes, which are barren, frozen with Ice, and
disinhabited, or through thicke bushes and woods,
or mountains vnpasseable, but as it were in the sight
of their own houses, and through their own proper
Countryes. And lastly, that if the Turkes haue ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
therinto at other times, when their borders and
confines were not so conuenient, nor so near as now
they are: much more may they, or rather ought to
attempt the same at this time, seeing they haue them

               <p>THE seauenth opinion was that they should
make war first in <hi>Polonia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The seuenth opinion, to warre against Polonia, and the reasons thereof.</note> and then afterwardes
in <hi>Hungarie</hi> and <hi>Germanie.</hi> The reasons thereof
were these: That forasmuch as it did not stand
with the dignity of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> maiesty, to suffer the
king of <hi>Polonia</hi> so often to refuse the payment of his
Tribute, it was very fitte, that all forcible meanes
should bee vsed to recouer the same. That for the
many discontentmentes, which haue passed in that
Kingdome, there was very good hope that hee
might the more easily bee enforced to pay it. That
the warre should be verie conuenient and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
for the <hi>Turkes,</hi> because <hi>Polonia</hi> was so neare, &amp;


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18221:63"/>
bordered vpon <hi>Moldauia,</hi> and vpon the <hi>Tartarians,</hi>
and also vpon the <hi>Sangiackeshippes</hi> of <hi>Achermano,</hi> &amp;
of <hi>Bendero,</hi> and vpon <hi>Vosia.</hi> Againe, That the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
and quiet possession of <hi>Moldauia,</hi> and <hi>Walachia,</hi>
could neuer be kept &amp; maintained, vnlesse the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
boldnes of the <hi>Polackes</hi> were brideled: and so
much the more for that the <hi>Vaiuodes</hi> of those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces,
although they were greately enriched, yet
could they neuer recouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in any distresse,
nor bee relieued any where but in the <hi>Turkes</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
That by these meanes also the iniuries
might bee reuenged, which were wrought against
the <hi>Turkes</hi> by the <hi>Cosacchi,</hi> when they sacked <hi>Coslou,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Cosacchi Coslou.</note>
a place in <hi>Taurica</hi> belonging to the <hi>Turkish state:</hi> that
therby likewise the passage should be eased for their
Marchandises, that goe from the <hi>Turkish States</hi> into
<hi>Moscouie:</hi> that the <hi>Moscouite</hi> himselfe should bee
put in a bodily feare, (and that peruaduenture to his
great losse and domage) because his Countrey laye
so neare, especially, considering that hee was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment,
why the <hi>Ottoman Empire</hi> atchieued
not the to rall conquest of <hi>Persia.</hi> That growing in
this sort so nigh unto <hi>Germanie,</hi> it may bee that one
onely discomfiture would vtterly ouerthrow the
Emperour, for that hee should see his Countrey the
more easily compassed about with the <hi>Ottoman For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi>
That to bee short, all the Countrey of <hi>Polonia</hi>
is very open and without Fortresses, and that the
<hi>Polackes</hi> themselues were not now to bee accounted
any great warriours, because they haue liued so long
in peace. For the wars which they made with <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi>
were but of small continuance, and the other


<pb facs="tcp:18221:64"/>
warres which were made before by King <hi>Stephen</hi>

an <hi>Hungarian,</hi> and rather with <hi>Hungarian</hi> Souldiers,

               <p>THE eight and last opinion was,<note place="margin">The eight o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to war against the Emperor: and the reasons thereof.</note> that warre

whome the <hi>Turkes</hi> call, <hi>The King of Betz,</hi> that
is to say, of <hi>Vienna,</hi> in times past peraduenture <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doniana.</hi>
Those which were of this opinion, were
moued thereunto: for that the <hi>Vscocchi</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
so insolent in praying vpon the <hi>Turkes</hi> both
by land and by sea,<note place="margin">The insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Vscocchi.</note> as not only in regard of the losses,
which they continually wrought, but also euen for
the honour of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> maiestie, they could no
lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger be endured: &amp; so much the rather, for that the
marchants subiect to the Turke, both to the publike
and to their owne priuate detriment, haue beene
constrained to change the Port of <hi>Narenta,</hi> and to go
to <hi>Spalato,</hi> a Countrey belonging to the Venetians,
to the end they might carrie their Marchandizes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Christians Countryes, and bring backe other
Marchandizes for them into Turkie. And yet they
could not by that course goe and come safe, neither
notwithstanding the peace, that hath beene conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
with the Emperour and the Venetians. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
that they also ranne vp and downe by land,
stealing mens cattell, burning townes and villages,
and taking children euen out of the verie armes of


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18221:64"/>
their naturall mother. So that there is great reason
to feare, least in time they wil be able to become the
Lordes and maisters of some neighbour-Fortresse,
which would be a matter that might turne, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the great losse, but also much rather to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
shame and dishonour of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
Againe, that forsomuch as the Emperour had
carried so slender a respect towards the grand-Turk,
whiles he was busied in the warres of <hi>Persia,</hi> as that
he delayed in deed for a long time to send him his
tribute:<note place="margin">The easinesse of this warre.</note> (for so the Turkes call it) hee made shew
thereby that hee was rather minded to breake the
peace, then to maintaine it. That the victorie would
proue both easie and certaine, for that on the one
side he might be assaulted in <hi>Croatia,</hi> and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side in Hungarie, and in Austria. That the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
was fruitfull and abounding in all things, verie
commodious and fit for the Souldiers, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the neerenesse thereof, and also because they
should passe thither (almost all the way) by their
owne houses. That the principall Holdes of the
Kingdome of Hungarie, namely <hi>Belgrado, Buda,</hi> and
<hi>Alba-Regale,</hi> and the rest that are of the greatest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
were possessed and garded vetie well with
the Turkish garrisons. And that although some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfiture
might peraduenture happen, yet would
they be most conuenient receits for the Reliques of
the armie, where they may be as well defended and
preserued, as also repaired and renued with such
helpes and aydes, as are there nigh at hand. That
the Emperor seemed to be inclined rather to peace
then to warre: and it may be also, that hee is not so


<pb facs="tcp:18221:65"/>
well esteemed and obeied by all the Princes of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,
as his degree requireth. That all the Princes
of Germanie were diuided, as well in regard of
their interest in Religion, and in state, as also particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in respect of the election of the Newe King of
Romanes. That they are almost wearie (as some of
the Protestant Princes doe seuerally reporte) of the
gouernement of the house of <hi>Austria:</hi> and that
they are also too much giuen to the loue of their
treasures and riches. And finally, that seeing there
are many yeares passed since the Germanes haue
handled neither Launce nor Arcubuse, they cannot
now tell how to take Armes, nor to vse them: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that they will hardly bee obedient to their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitanes.
Lastly, That euen as the saide Almanes
themselues would alwayes dwell in murmur and
distrust with the Hungarians, with the Italians and
with the Spaniardes, as often as they should goe to
the warres together, because those nations are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
not well liked, (I will not say hated) by them:
So the sayde Dutchmen, being enemies among
themselues for the diuersitie of Heresies which they
follow, will alwayes bee afrayde, least if the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
should obtaine the victorie and remaine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
that then they shall bee compelled to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
their licentious liberty, and to obey the Pope:
So that there is no doubt, but that they will rather
forbeare to fight, then to helpe their prince and
themselues.<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour can haue no aid of other Princes.</note> To bee short, that there could be no
feare of any aide or succours, which the Emperour
might haue of other princes. Not of the Polacke,
nor of the Transyluanian, aswell in regarde of the


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18221:65"/>
peace, which is between the Great Turke and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
as also for that they will be in doubt, least they shold
drawe all the tide and force of the warre into their
owne States and Dominions. Besides, that the
one of them would be afrayde, least hee should bee
enforced to abandon the Frontiers, and retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to the frozen Sea, and the other least he should
bee depriued of that Estate, which hee possessed by
the Graunt of the Ottoman House. Moreouer, that
the King of Spaine, who is the onely Man that can
helpe the house of Austria in deede, is otherwise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
and busied. That the pope cannot yeeld sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
for all, that shall bee needefull in this busines.
That the Italian princes will not runne in haste to
spend their Treasures, nor consume their subiectes
for an other mans benefite. And for conclusion,
That the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> doubting that it shoulde
thereby prouoke the Ottoman Forces against it
selfe, would rather stay to see the issue and successe
of the warre, then it would put it selfe to a certaine,
or at least to a doubtfull danger of ouerthrowing it
selfe.</p>
               <p>And these were the seuerall opinions of the
Visiers, inconsiderate no doubt for the most parte,
and agreeable to their barbarous temerity and rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
whereby they faine vnto themselues that those
thinges are easie, which afterwardes by experience
they proue not onelie to bee difficult and hard, but
also very dangerous and pernitious.</p>

also, that may in any sort doubt of the varietie
and truth of the things, which I haue spoken, I will
adde hereunto in briefe, how the Turkes come ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with our matters, and how wee come ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qainted

the like consultations are proper to all Princes,<note place="margin">The consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man &amp; Selim.</note>

for spies and priers into our actions and affaires they
shall not only secure themselues of their goods, their
owne persons, and their children, but also that they
shall reape great gaine and commoditie of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
whereby they doe much gratifie and pleasure

for a truth, that hee imparted and commnnicated
with <hi>Amurath</hi> many secretes of Pope <hi>Xistus Quintus</hi>
which he by espiall had found and learned whiles
he remained in <hi>Rome.</hi> Lastly, it is not to be doubted,
but that the Turkes doe also keepe diuerse Spies in

they thinke by these meanes the more easily to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe
the designements and purposes of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites,
as peraduenture the aforesayde Bassaes did,
and as <hi>Sinan</hi> and <hi>Ferat</hi> at last were wont to doe. Or
to be short, they are verie oftentimes moued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
because all Turkes generally are beyond all
measure greedie of bribes and gifts: as for example
among the Bassaes, that same <hi>Hassan</hi> shewed himself
to be,<note place="margin">The cunning knauerie of Hassan Bassaes</note> who was a Venetian of the <hi>Cilestri,</hi> and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of the Sea before <hi>Cicala.</hi> For when one of the
Visiers had offered in Councell to the great Turke
that he would surprise the Citie of <hi>Venice,</hi> and was
not hearkened vnto, but rather reproued for his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
vanitie, hee went straight to the Venetian
Bailo, or Agent, and told him, that whereas such a
matter was propounded in the Councell by others,
he withstoode it, for the naturall affection which he
carried towardes that Common wealth: for the
which he receiued a most rich present. Lastly, it is
true also, that the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Counsellers do rewarde


<pb facs="tcp:18221:68"/>
their seruants, and enrich them by imparting their
secretes vnto them, to the ende that they may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
acquaint such withall, as vse to bee most libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
to them.<note place="margin">The Ladie Sultanes.</note> And so doe they likewise to their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
whereupon it commeth to passe, that the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi>
Ladies (who are either the Kins-folkes or the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorites
of the great Turke, dwelling continually in
the <hi>Serraglioes,</hi> where al principall businesses are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
and handled) become acquainted with these
secretes, which afterwardes for verie rich gifts and
presents that are sent to the said Ladies, from the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and Agents of such Princes as the secretes doe
concerne, by the Eunuches that wait vpon them
and keepe them, are verie easily disclosed and reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Moreouer they do sometimes indeuour with all
their studie and industrie, to performe some notable
seruice towards some Prince, to the end they might
receiue the oftner and richer Gratuities from him.
The mother of the now reigning Turke, pretendeth
to honour the state of Venice, and craueth of it verie
many times some reward for the same. It is not long
ago since all the <hi>Sultane</hi> Ladies requested of the sayd
state,<note place="margin">Feathers made of Glasse.</note> that it would forbid the carrying out of certain
feathers that are counterfeited and forged of glasse,
at <hi>Murano:</hi> which being ioyned and set togither, do
much resemble the plumes made of a Hero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fethers.
And this request they made, because the said coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
or forged feathers, were sold so good cheape
at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and yet did so please and satisfie the
people, that the said <hi>Sultane</hi> Ladies could not sell at
so high a rate, as before they did, the goodly bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and bundles of feathers of seuerall birds, which


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18221:68"/>
were sent vnto them for Presentes, from diuerse
quarters in great quantities:<note place="margin">The vse of wearing fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, how and where it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</note> for it is the vse not
onely of men, but of women also, to weare such
feathers on their heades: following therein the
manner of the Tartarians, (from whome it came to
the Turkes:) for that <hi>Zingi Chan</hi> (who by some is
not rightly called <hi>Chan-gio,</hi>) was saued aliue by
the meanes of an Owle: for this Birde hauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
vpon a certaine thicket of young trees, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
which <hi>Zingi</hi> had hidden himselfe, for feare of
his enemies that pursued him, they did verily thinke
that there could not be any body there, because the
Birde remayned there so quietly. Whereupon the
Tartarians (sayeth <hi>Haytho</hi>) do holde the sayde Birde
in great reuerence, so that hee, which at that time
could get any of her feathers, accounted himself a
happy man. And euer after, all the other Tartarians
from hand to hande haue still continually vsed to
weare the like feathers on their heades in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
of that action, and for a kinde of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence.</p>

a man rather temerarious and headdie, then valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:
(if yee consider what he did in <hi>Croatia</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie
solicited <hi>Amurath</hi> to the same purpose:
both for the selfe same end, which is common to
all the Turkes, that is to say, to enrich himselfe by
the meanes of warre, and also because hee verilie
beleeued, that by this course he should safely attaine
and come to those supreme honours and dignities,
which were foretold him by the superstitious South

of such diuinations: Whereupon to satisfie <hi>Sinan</hi>

the Turke of the losses and domages that were
wrought by the <hi>Vscocchi,</hi> and by the Subiects of the

they committed whiles they ouerranne the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:

an exceeding feare, and so to reape and bring home
most rich and wealthie spoyles. Yea he solicited him
so farre, that at the last hee obtained licence of the

seene and knowne that hee was in the confines of
the Emperour: but yet with secret commission,
that he should not say he did it vpon his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.

               <p>BVt because I haue oftentimes made mention of
the <hi>Vscocchi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What the Vs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocchi be.</note> it will not be farre from the purpose,
before I passe to other matter, briefly to tel you, who
they be, and so much the rather, because they were
the occasion of so great a warre. It is not true, that
those whom wee call <hi>Vscocchi,</hi> (which signifieth by
the Sclauoine worde <hi>Scoci,</hi> Skippers, or Leapers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they skip and leape like Goats, with their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
shooes vpon the toppes of the Mountaines.) It
is not true (I say) that they are Inhabitants of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera,</hi>
as <hi>Iouius</hi> and others that follow his opinion do
beleeue. For the <hi>Vscocchi</hi> do dwell about fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
miles distant from the <hi>Chimeriottes</hi> (and yet they
are both people of <hi>Albania</hi>) in the Mountaines that<note place="margin">The Vscocchi and the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meriotti not all one people.</note>
are called <hi>Acro-ceraunii,</hi> in the mouth of the Gulfe,
right against the Cape of <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> the vttermost
Promontorie of all <hi>Italie.</hi> The <hi>Vscocchi</hi> speake the
Sclauoine speech, but the <hi>Chimeriottes</hi> the Albanian:
The one liue after the Romish rite, the other after
the Greeke. The one are a companie gathered togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that but of a few, the other naturall by cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and many in number. Among the <hi>Vscocchi</hi> there
bee many <hi>Murlacchi,</hi> which cannot stay vnder the
Turke, and many that are banished by the state neer
to the Venetians and other Princes therabouts, and
fled to the <hi>Vscocchi</hi> for verie pouertie.<note place="margin">What the Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>telossi are.</note> There are also
among them many <hi>Martelossi,</hi> that are Spies, and
theeues in those quarters: for so in deed signifieth
the worde <hi>Martelos,</hi> so that it is the name of a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18221:70"/>
and not of a Nation,<note place="margin">What the Mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lacchi are.</note> as some haue thought.
And because I haue also made mention of the <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacchi,</hi>
I will not omit to tell you what they be. The
<hi>Murlacchi</hi> are called in those partes all the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that dwel in the Mountaines, but specially those
that inhabit the mountaine <hi>Lica,</hi> which is betweene
<hi>Nouigrad</hi> and <hi>Segna.</hi> The originall of the Sclauoine
worde <hi>Moralacchi,</hi> was at the beginning, when the
Barbarians came into <hi>Italie,</hi> because after that they
had passed <hi>Walacchia,</hi> they called the peoples that
dwelled at the Adriatike Sea by that name, as if they
would say, Dwellers on the Sea. For euen as the
Turkes do call all the Italians by the generall word
<hi>Franchi,</hi> of the particular nation of the Frenchmen,
so did the Barbarians terme all Italians likewise by
that tearme of <hi>Vulacchi,</hi> or <hi>Vuloschi,</hi> as though they
were Walacchians.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vscocchi</hi> doe dwell vpon the Sea at <hi>Segna,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Where the Vs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocchi do dwel</note> and
<hi>Buccari,</hi> and within the land of <hi>Othozaz,</hi> and ouer all
<hi>Vinodol,</hi> which is a territorie belonging to the Conte
of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rim.</hi> And although they runne vp and downe
all those quarters, spoyling and robbing, and stealing
all that they can get, no otherwise then the <hi>Turco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni</hi>
did in times past among the Grecians, yet are
they tollerated by the Imperiall Officers, because
they would not loose the deuotion and beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of that people, who without any expences or
charges of those estates, and with great brauerie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
those Frontires, euen as the <hi>Cosacchi</hi> do in <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why they are tolerated by the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists.</note>
of whom I will speake more hereafter. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are thus tollerated and also protected,
contrarie to the couenaunts and agreements that


<pb facs="tcp:18221:71"/>
haue passed betweene the Imperialistes and the
Turkes,<note place="margin">The Turkes greeued with this tolleratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and also concerning the sea betweene the
Venetians and the Turkes, they haue oftentimes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
occasion to the Turkes to put handes to their
weapons, for the defence of their subiects and of
their marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dises, which they carry to <hi>Ancona,</hi> &amp; to
Venice:<note place="margin">The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans greeued at it also.</note> yea &amp; the Venecians the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues haue bin oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
to do the like, as wel for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of
the iurisdiction which they pretend to haue in the
Adriaticall sea, as also because they would take away
al occasions fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Turks to come with an Armada,
for reuenge of the iniuries and losses, which they
haue receiued by thesaid Vscocchi: and finally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they would not bee troubled with the great
Turke, as alwayes they are, when his subiectes are
spoyled, by demaunding amendes for the same.
Moreouer, the Vscocchi haue within this little time
laid their hands to robbe the Christians also of their
marchandizes, and particularly the Venitians, not
(as their Vaiuodes and Arambassi do say) for the los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
which they receyued these last yeares, whiles
they were besieged in <hi>Segna,</hi> but in truth to enrich
themselues, by all the iniurious wayes and meanes
they could. Wherevnto they doe the more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applie themselues, because they know verie well
that they cannot be hindred or at least verie hardly,
by the said Venetians, for that they come backed
and assisted by the Imperialistes, and can quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recouer their owne home, as in deede they doe
both safely and securely, and whensoeuer they list.</p>
               <p>These Vscocchi, may come forth into the Sea,
to pray and spoyle by foure wayes: that is to say,


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18221:71"/>
betweene <hi>Fiume, Veghia,</hi> and <hi>Cherso:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How many wayes the Vs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocchi may come forth to the Sea.</note> betweene

last passage hath somewhat a straite Channell, and
may bee of some 100. paces.</p>
               <p>The Venetians do keepe diuerse Gallyes, and
Barkes armed,<note place="margin">How the Vs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocchi may be hindered from their Theeuing.</note> that walke continually vp and down
these Channels to hinder the <hi>Vscocchi,</hi> but by reason
of the many disorders, that haue hetherto hapened,
there are now but some Gallyes onely, or at least ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a fewe Barkes of small auaile. It
were verie necessarie, principally to multiplie the
number of Barks, which being backed behind with
Gallyes, might easily set vppon the <hi>Vscocchi:</hi> and
then without all doubt they might make the passage
for Marchantes to bee more safe and secure: and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
the better if there were appointed certaine
watches, euen in such places as were fittest for that
purpose. And although to doe this, the costes and
charges would be of some moment, yet they might
well bee borne, considering they shall bee vsed but
for a small time: for the <hi>Vscocchi</hi> being once seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and scattered, they cannot so easily vnite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
together againe: And the Marchants also no
doubte, would willingly contribute to the charges,
forasmuch as it concerneth their benefite and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
principally. There might also a remedy be had
against their Theeueries in another sort, that is, by
contributing to the chiefe Captaines of the said <hi>Vs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocchi,</hi>
a certaine summe of money competent, to the
end they should abstaine from doing any domage
by Sea, eyther to the Turkes or Christians. For to


<pb facs="tcp:18221:72"/>
hinder theeues from robbing, especialy such as these
bee, who are very couragious and hardie, is a thing
almost impossible, vnlesse it might bee performed in
deed by an open warre. And if any man should
thinke, that this course would displease the Turke,
for that hee could not but suspect that the Venetians
did not effectually employ themselues against the
<hi>Vscocchi,</hi> so long as their owne Marchants did passe
to and fro in safety: and forasmuch also, as this deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
and agreement could not be kept so secret,
but that it must needes come to the knowledge of
the Turkes: I doo thinke verily, that it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
for by one of these two meanes: eyther by
signifying so much to the great Turke himself whose
satisfaction is principally respected, or else by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
supplication to the Pope, that in regarde of the
publike quiet he would enterpose himselfe to cause
payment to bee made to the said chiefe Captaines,
with the monies of the state of <hi>Venice,</hi> or of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes,
to bee deliuered to his Holines secretlie.
Moreouer the Emperour himselfe might be treated
withall, that his Emperiall Maiesty would bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to accept of a conuenient Garrison for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and custody of <hi>Segna,</hi> and of those Confines.
Or rather, which would be the true remedie indeed,
they might by generall consent and agreement bee
driued quite out of those Countryes, considering
that they are publike and common theeues, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of the greatest troubles in Christendome: yea
and so much the rather, for that otherwise they can
neuer be diminished, much lesse vtterly extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
aswell because they are not forbidden or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

point of breach of faith, although in truth no prince
can in reason feare, yet certaine it is,<note place="margin">The Transil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uanian is to feare breach of faith in the Turke.</note> that the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siluanian

feare it, because the <hi>Ottoman</hi> house thinketh, that
from him onely it hath receiued all the iniuries

the warre should come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him alone, hardly could
he defend himselfe from so mightie an enemie, if
he should not be ayded and succoured, neither by
the Polacke, nor by the Emperour: for of himselfe
alone he is but a poore and a weake Prince. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it may seeme, that he hath a state fortified by


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18221:79"/>
nature, and therefore might peraduenture be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for some time, yet in the ende he should of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie

for number of people, and also for treasure, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of all maner of furniture for warre, almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible.</p>
               <p>Neither should the Emperour be free from feare

with the Turke: because it would be inough for the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperour onely to haue these princes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
for a time. For hee knoweth verie well with
how great difficulty Souldiers are brought togither
againe vnder their ensignes, after that they are once
returned home: and especially how hard it is for the
Emperour, who is constrained to make warre rather
with auxiliarie Souldiers, then with his owne, who
also cannot come to succour him without some
time, and the meeting togither of circuites and
dietes, which are to be holden, before any thing can
be done.</p>
               <p>And thus vpon these reasons that haue beene set
downe, it may be concluded verie resolutely, that to
make peace on this fashion, would not onely not be
helpefull to the two Princes, but also much more
daungerous and pernicious to both their estates, for
that the enemie may shortly after take vp armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and renue the warre with greater aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
whensoeuer hee shall thinke it fit and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

               <p>THE third and last consideration, which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
not so much to the aforsaide Princes,<note place="margin">Where it is likely the Turk will bend his forces next.</note> but
to all Christendome togither, is, that suppose the
Turk do make peace, and keepe it for a while, where
may we thinke in reason, that hee will hereafter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
his arrowes? For we haue established this for
a most certaine ground and foundation, that the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire doth keepe her Subiects alwayes
occupied and emploied in new warres, against some
state or other, as hauing had her originall and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
by force and armes.</p>
               <p>Of truth it is not to be thought, that he will renue
the warre against the King of Persia,<note place="margin">Not against the king of Persia.</note> at the least as
yet, and not being prouoked thereunto: because
the Souldiers of Europe, who are the sinewes and
strength of his Armies, doe abhorre to go thither, by
reason of the length of the iourney, the want of vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes,
the roughnesse of the wayes, and the braue
valour of the Persians. And so much the lesse is it
likely that he will renue the warre there, because it
is but a while agoe since hee made peace with that
king, and for that he hath not as yet fullie established
the foundations of his new Fortresses. And to bee
briefe, the Persian indeed wanteth no Souldiers
for there are three sortes of Souldiers that goe
to warre vnder him: The <hi>Turcomanni,</hi> who are
vnto him as Feudataries be with vs, and hold their
landes of him. The <hi>Corizzi,</hi> or <hi>Coridschi,</hi> who are sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendaries

               <p>Besides it is verie likely and credible, that the

most goodly and rich Countries, which most vniustly that
most cruell and outragious Tyrant doth now possesse) were
of no long time heretofore, Cities further distant, then were
those Christians that haue beene lately taken, and are now
most cruelly and miserably tormented by our enemies. Oh
that you might bee moued, yee religious and godly Princes,
with the incomparable bond and obligation, wherein yee
are bound to Christ our Lord, who hath not onely freed and
deliuered you from the iawes of the auncient Serpent, but
also hath appointed you to be Princes of his people, to the end
that like watchfull and charitable Pastors ye should coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
keepe the same from the mouth of the Wolfe. The
blessed God hath put into your handes the Scepter, and the
sworde, because it should bee your care, as well by doing iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and shewing mercie to maintaine his people in peace,
as also by warre to deliuer those that are vnduly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly
oppressed. Let your perticular interestes cease, when
the Interestes of God commeth in place. Let the discourses
of mans wit giue place to the cause of God. Nay rather,
euen your owne peculiar and proper interestes, and humane
respects also do perswade you of themselues to take weapons
into your hands, and to represse and daunt the pride of this
most cruell and fierce wilde beast, who like a Lion raungeth
about continually, ouer all the Champeine and field of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome
greedily to deuoure some part either of our owne
Countries or of our neighbours. Alas, let vs learne by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens expences and losses. Let vs quench the fire of our
brethren, least we burne vp our selues also with them: Let
vs in time meete with this great tide, that like a headlong
streame is like shortly to surround all our Countreys. Vp ye

generous &amp; noble champions of Christ, resolue couragiously
with your selues (to the end that our age be not thought to be
lesse glorious then former times) in some sort to imitate &amp;
follow <hi>Godfrey, Baldwyn, Boemound,</hi> and those other
famous Argonautes, who to recouer out of the prophane
handes of the enemies of holy fayth, the sacred Sepulchre of
our Redeemer, sold their owne proper goodes, abandoned
their landes and houses, passed ouer the Seas, and for a long
time endured exceeding great trauailes and troubles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they thought that they could not better employ their
treasures, ther weapons, and their valour, then in so holy
and laudable an enterprise, who then will bee the first man
that will take the Crosse, and giue example to others? Who
will he be, that will be Captaine and guide herein? Where
be the Souldiers of Christ, that will follow this glorious
standard and Ensinge? And finally who will shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
so impious, that he will not lay aside all priuate iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and hatreds, for the common safetie?</p>
               <p>But hereof let it be inough for me to haue spoken, being
carried therunto out of my determinate discourse and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
by a iust zeale that I beare towardes the honour of
God, and the saluation of so many soules, which are redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the bloud of Christ, and liue at this day in the
most miserable thraldome and slauerie of the <hi>Ottoman</hi>

               <p>And therefore if the great Turke shoulde
mooue warre agaynst the Common-wealth of
Venice:<note place="margin">Why Venice should bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued.</note> (which God forbid, because the saide

and preserued a perpetuall Virgin through all
ages, as well for the comfort of her subiects, for the
ornament of the worlde, and for the defence of


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18221:85"/>
Christendome, as also for the pietie thereof, and for
the excellent manner of gouernment therein vsed)
the daunger would be of great importaunce, and it
would then bee verie necessarie (if the loue of my
Countrie doe not deceiue mee:) that all the princes
of Christendome should earnestly and throughly
aduise themselues, how to maintaine it in her former
estate, so that no notable damage may light vpon it:
and so much the rather, for that enioying her lawfull
and auncient libertie and neutralitie, with her pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
consultation it doth neuer offend any Prince in
the world. And aboue all the rest,<note place="margin">Specially by the king of Spaine.</note> it behoueth the
king Catholike so to doe, either by combining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with the Venetians, or by succouring them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise:
as well because it is verie likely, that the
Turke will not imploy his forces, onely for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
of the Venetian estate: but thereby to haue a
more easie way to attempt Italie, wherof the crowne
of Spaine dooth possesse the fairest and goodliest
partes: as also because the other Princes are not
peraduenture altogither sufficient by Sea to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
the enemie with any securitie, vnlesse they
shall helpe one another with monies, with vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes,
with Souldiers, &amp; specially with Gally-slaues,
and Marriners, which certainly is a matter very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable:
For without doubt the true way &amp; means
vtterly to defeate and destroy the enemie,<note place="margin">The true way to ouerthrow the Turke, is by sea.</note> will bee
to vanquish him by Sea, especially in these times,
wherein hee hath not an Armada of any account,
and is also greatly destitute of Marriners, and men
of commaund, that are skilful and couragious in that
profession. Moreouer, the Turkes do abhorre these


<pb facs="tcp:18221:86"/>
battailes by Sea, both because they are most cruell
and daungerous, and also for that in such fights they
are alwayes discomfited and ouerthrowne, and doe
know full well, that afterwardes they shall bee the
more easily vanquished and ouercome by land. So
<hi>Euagoras</hi> of Cyprus, and <hi>Conon</hi> of Athens counselled
the kings of <hi>Persia</hi> to doe against the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
So <hi>Augustus</hi> hauing defeated <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi>
by Sea, subdued also his olde and victorious armie
consisting of eightie thousand footemen, and two &amp;
twentie thousand horsemen, without any fight. The
like was done by <hi>Roger</hi> the Calabrian, Admiral to the
king of Aragon, who notwithstanding that his king
was vppon the land ouerthrowne by the king of
France, yet assaulting the French Armada by Sea,
discomfited the same, recouered that which was
lost, and carried away the fruites of both the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
And who knoweth not, what might haue beene
done, after the Turkish fleete was dispersed and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne
in the yeare, 1571. And when it ranne
away of it selfe in 1572. If at the first occasion and
oportunitie that was then so happily offered, there
had beene made a choise of the best Gallies, to haue
gone presently and met with the enemie in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipelago,</hi>
and in <hi>Morea,</hi> and euen as farre as <hi>Cyprus:</hi>
and if in the second good oportunitie we had follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
the happie and iudicious courage of <hi>Soranzo,</hi>
the generall Prouidatorie of <hi>Venice?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verie true it is,<note place="margin">The strength and power of Venice.</note> that the state of <hi>Venice</hi> is at this
day become so potent and mightie, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the great store of golde which it hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
in this long peace, and of the debts payed,


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18221:86"/>
whereunto it had runne in the last warre, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
before that time: but also in regarde of the
manie Gallyes, munitions, and other preparations
for warre, which it hath prouided in this time:
that if occasion so fall out, it will peraduenture bee
well able to defend it selfe of it owne selfe: and
specially, if it would resolue it selfe at such time, as it
dooth little feare the enemie, to bee the first that
should assault and strike him, yea and to doe it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
(as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was wont to say to the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)
by sending forth a mightie Armada to annoye
him, and vpon a sodaine to surprise some of those
places, which I will name in the ende of this thirde
Parte. Moreouer it hath also at this present so wel
fortified her estate, that in all reason it neede not
greatly doubt the conceites and designementes of
the Ottoman.<note place="margin">Corfu. Catharo. Zara.</note> 
                  <hi>Corfu, Cathara</hi> and <hi>Zara</hi> are among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fortes esteemed to bee inexpugnable, and so
much the rather, for that by reason of their mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and reasonable distance from <hi>Venice,</hi> they may
easily bee succoured and relieued, and being as it
were the keyes of the Adriatike Sea, they may also
hinder the entrance of the enemy, or enforce him of
necessitie to returne backe with all speed, least hee
remayne entangled and caught in the nette.<note place="margin">Candie.</note> The
Isle of <hi>Candie</hi> is likewise so wel prouided for defence
and is thought to bee so strongly guarded with
Garrisons and Munition, as it cannot bee attempted
by the Turke, without incurring his great hazard
and daunger, yea and so much the more, for that if
the enemy shoulde endeauour to disbarke his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
there, one great part of the Island hauing no


<pb facs="tcp:18221:87"/>
hauens or Harboroughes, is defended by nature it
self &amp; the other part may be so well kept both by
the valour of forrain souldiers, and also by the braue
manhood of the Countrey-inhabitantes, who are
no lesse tender and carefull of their owne wel-fare,
then faithfull to their prince (prouided alwayes
that they bee by iust proportion and good aduise
distributed and deuided, some for the defence of
the Hauens, and some for the defence of the shore,)
that hee shall neuer bee able to disbarke there, or
if hee doe, it will bee to his great losse. In which
accident it will bee an easie matter to disperse the
Reliques of the enemies armie, partly because they
can very hardly bee succoured by the Turke, in
regarde of the farre distance of his Countrey and
States? and partly because his Fleete of Shippes
cannot well brooke those Seas, eyther without
daunger of breaking and rending in pieces, or
fighting with the Venetian Armada. Lastly, the

The warre is not altogether inconuenient or incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,

our Souldiers issue foorth into the field before our
enemies, wee may attempt to recouer eyther by

beene lost: yea and so much the rather, for that it
will bee a harde matter for the Turkes to succour

                  <note place="margin">Toccai. Vienna.</note>
of purpose to hinder the vnion of the Emperour
and the Transyluanian, or to <hi>Vienna,</hi> as he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to haue done, not long ago by <hi>Sinan,</hi> who
shewed vnto him the easinesse of winning it, the
glorie that would redound vnto him thereby, and
the great importance of the enterprise:<note place="margin">Why the Turk withdrew his armie out of Croatia.</note> 
                  <hi>And also
for that from the languishing of the head proceedeth the
weaknesse of the members.</hi> And it may be, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
his armie to retyre out of <hi>Croatia,</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because he knew the iealousie which the Italian
Princes doe carrie of their owne affaires, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Venetians, who in that respect haue put
themselues in defence with their new fortresse of
<hi>Palma:</hi> but also because hee would vnite all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
togither, &amp; so become the stronger to performe
the said enterprise. But howsoeuer it bee, certaine it
is that he hath not withdrawne it for any giftes or
rewardes which he hath receiued from the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
as some haue falsly beleeued. Againe, that wee
may thinke the better of this daunger, it is a matter
worthie of good consideration, that <hi>Mahamet</hi> was
enclined to this enterprise from his childhoode, in
so much as euen at that time hee made humble sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to his father, that hee would reserue that
glorie for him: which without all doubt, if (as God
forbid) it should so fall out and come to passe in
deed, would not onely proue to bee a most notable
losse to the Empire, but also in particular to all Italie.
For so hauing gotten the possession of that key,
which is of greatest importaunce to open him the


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18221:91"/>
way into the entrance of all those Countries, he shall
also haue a more readie and easie passage into the
fairest and goodliest part of the world, which is the
verie vttermost scope and end of all the <hi>Ottoman</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signements.<note place="margin">The way for the Turkes to come to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna.</note>
For that, euen as he hath a free way to
come to <hi>Vienna,</hi> by passing betweene the <hi>Danow</hi> and
the <hi>Draua,</hi> in lower Hungarie, and so without any
impediment to <hi>Giauerino</hi> (a Fort, that by the aduice
of <hi>Alfonso</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> was caused to be made at
the verie selfe same time that <hi>Soliman</hi> arriued there
by the selfe same way, and where at this day also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
possessed by the Turks in maner and sort (as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippo
Pigafetta</hi> hath written) they may easily passe to
trouble and vexe both <hi>Astria,</hi> and <hi>Stiria.</hi>)<note place="margin">Three other wayes for the Turke (if hee obtaine Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna) to come into Italie.</note> So if hee
should be possessed of Vienna, hee may without all
doubt the more easily assault Italie by two other
wayes, which I haue not as yet named. The one is,
by the way of <hi>Tiroll,</hi> descending by the Alpes of
<hi>Trento</hi> into the Champaignes of <hi>Verona,</hi> where <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico</hi>
entered: or by those of <hi>Bassano,</hi> which is a way
that hath beene often vsed by the Dutche: the other
is, that of <hi>Villaco,</hi> wich commeth directly from Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,
and meeteth either at <hi>Frioli,</hi> or at <hi>Venzone,</hi> or
at <hi>Ciuidale.</hi> The Turkes also in such a case may take
another way, which was heretofore made by the
Barbarians, that is to say, the way of <hi>Tolmezo</hi> in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
which may also meete at <hi>Cadore:</hi> but that shall
not be to any great purpose for them.</p>
               <p>But for as much as among those things, which hinder
the Emperour from such aydes and succours as he desireth
and as without all doubt would be most sit and conuenient
for this present businesse, there are three especially that are


<pb facs="tcp:18221:92"/>
worthy of greatest consideration: it shall not be amisse to

            </div>
            <div n="17" type="section">
               <head>§ XVII.</head>
               <p>THe first thing is,<note place="margin">The speches that hinder the Emperour from necessary aydes of the Christian Princes.</note> the voice that runneth amongst
the many Protestants of the Empire: that if his
Emperial Maiestie should become the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queror of
the Turke, they shall bee of necessitie enforced to
yeeld obedience to the Pope of Rome (as they call
him) a matter that is abhorred by the common sort
of people, but much more by the great Princes and
Potentates there: by the great Princes especially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they haue vsurped a dominion vpon the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Ecclesiasticall liuings and reuenues: by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, because they are perswaded therevnto
by the Protestant Ministers, as namely by the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinists
and Lutherans, who doe resolutely aduise
them rather to obey the Turke then the Pope, <hi>and
therefore Caluanisme is a kind of disposition to Mahame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
as many very learned men haue written.</hi> Besides
that both the great Potentates, &amp; also the common
Subiects there haue suffered themselues most easily
to be perswaded to this impietie and vngodlinesse,
onely in regarde of the most sensuall and licenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
life, which they are thereby permitted to lead.</p>
               <p>The second thing is (which is so peremptorily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by many) that the Emperor is to make peace
with the Turke, because the Empire sheweth it selfe
so backewarde and faint to relieue him: as well for
that it feareth to spend her treasure to no purpose, as


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18221:92"/>
also for that it being of it selfe enclined to peace,<note place="margin">The backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes of the Empire in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing the Emperour.</note>
it doeth willingly take aduauntage of this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
which also ministreth matter to many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Princes, especially to the Polack, and to the
Venetians, that they doe not stirre eyther little or
much against the Turke, because they suspect they
shall bee abandoned and forsaken, when the
cause is at the best, and that they shall spend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
without any gaine or profite. And it seemeth
that it is made the more credible by this, for that
it is malitiously giuen out and published to the
world by those Imperialists, which haue no greate
inclination towardes that most religious house of
<hi>Austria,</hi> vz. That the Emperour is not greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to warre: That hee keepeth himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
retyred in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in <hi>Prage,</hi> in his pallace
because hee feareth some violent death? whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hee is the rather induced eyther by reason of the
conspiracie which was lately discouered, or of that
which a certaine Englishman called <hi>Dee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Iohn Dec.</note> foretold
him (a matter in sooth no lesse superstitious then
vnworthie to bee apprehended and beleeued by a
Prince that is so wise and feareth God.) But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
if it were true, that the Emperour either for
these or for som other reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s did now incline toward
peace, it had beene more safe counsell and aduise
for him, to haue resolued on it, euen in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and at the first, rather then at this time, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
of such reasons as I haue heretofore declared,
and also more at large in a certaine discourse, which
I haue made vpon this point euen to this day. And
thus also was Archduke <hi>Ferdinando</hi> aduised by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>


                  <pb facs="tcp:18221:93"/>
the Vaiuode of <hi>Moldauia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The aduise of Peter the Vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uode of Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauia.</note> who if he had not dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the yeare 1594. in the mountaines of <hi>Bolzano</hi>
was vtterly resolued (though hee was a man of the
Greekish sect and religion) to haue come and kissed
the feet of our Pope, as I haue declared in due order
and place.</p>
               <p>The thirde and last thing is, That if the
Empire on the one side bee not willing to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to so great expenses,<note place="margin">The difficultie of the requests made by the Imperial prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> vnlesse the Conquestes
that may bee made and atchieued, become vnited
to the Empire it selfe: and if the Emperour on the
other side will not consent thereunto, by reason of
the pretenses and challenges, which hee hath to
<hi>Hungarie,</hi> being a state of his own, it seemeth that
both the one partie and the other, doe propound
matters so difficult, that none of them are likely to
bee effected. True it is, that wee ought to thinke
and belieue that the Emperour knoweth full well,
if hee should shew himselfe contented to doe that
which the Imperiall Princes doe request at his
handes, hee should thereby preiudice himselfe, &amp;
yet those Princes would afterwardes forbeare to
doo that in deedes, which they offer in wordes.

(say what they list of him, such as either are

most cleare and manifest testimonie, that hee is no

in his courses, then fortunate in his actions, and
euen such a one as the auncients required a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to be. And this not by the fauour of fabulous
fortune, but in truth by the grace of that Lord, who
in the holy Scriptures is called the Lord of Hostes,
by whom like a new <hi>Dauid</hi> or <hi>Iudas Machabaeus,</hi> hee
is louingly defended and protected.<note place="margin">Why the Turks feare him.</note> He is also great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feared of the Turkes by reason of certaine popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

they be in deed but light and vaine, yet doe
they make a great impression in the mindes of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and base people, and specially of the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metanes,
who do absolutely beleeue <hi>Fatum,</hi> or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinie.
Among these their diuinations and Foreboa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,<note place="margin">A Prophecie of the Turkes for Transyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uania.</note>
they hold this one to be of great account and
reckoning, which saith, That from the cliffes of the

come forth a Prince, who shall ouercome and bring

his commaund and gouernment. And the like
also is read in <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> of the Emperour
<hi>Galba (For neuer yet did Princes want their flatterers.)</hi>


                  <pb facs="tcp:18221:94"/>
Moreouer the Turkes doe also constantly beleeue,<note place="margin">Another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the end of Mahamets sect. Musulmani.</note>
that the Sect of <hi>Mahamet</hi> is not to last any longer

(besides all that which hath beene touched
before) that he hath secrete intelligences, euen with

are their spoyles, prayes, and booties sufficient to
feede them, and keepe them contented, nor their
Haruestes and Collections, to supply the wantes of
so great a number, especially in the times of warre,
wherein all things grow from worse to worse.<note place="margin">How his want is to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</note> In
such sorte as I doe conclude, that forasmuch as our
Christian Princes haue no better means to maintain
this warre against the Turke, and that in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
place, and farre distant from their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes
and States, nor a more easie and safe waye to
ouercome him, then by obeying and following e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the very selfe same counsell which <hi>Demosthenes</hi>
gaue to the Athenians,<note place="margin">The Counsell of Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, apply<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose by the Author.</note> when the people of <hi>Olinthus</hi>
(a Cittie of <hi>Thracia</hi>) craued their aide and succours
against <hi>Philip,</hi> the Father of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and King of

which can be giuen them for the common good, is
with all speede to succour and relieue this couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
youth (as in part the Pope, &amp; the most religious

king of Spaine haue done) with some part of those
treasures which they haue receiued from God, to
be spent in the seruice of his diuine Maiestie, and
their owne saluation. For there is no one thing that
doth more hinder the propagation of the Gospell of
Iesus Christ, and the good successe of their actions
against the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon enemy, then to want money suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for his necessities, or rather not to make some
greater preparations and prouisions for so weightie
an enterprise. And so much the more, for that hee is
compelled to spend a good portion of that little,
which he hath in mainteyning his forces that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided,
partly in Walachia to keepe them in awe for
feare of their reuolt to the Turkes, and partly in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
places of Transyluania towards Moldauia, for
feare of the Moldauians, of the Tartarians, and of
other his enemies.<note place="margin">The Transyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanian may peraduenture be forced to take some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corse that may be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to Christendom.</note> Besides that it may be with great
reason suspected and feared, least if this Prince shall
want meanes and habilitie to maintaine himselfe
with forces in the field against the enemie, rather
then he will yeeld and submit himselfe againe to an
Infidel Prince, he wil resolue vpon some such course
as he thinketh more godly and pleasing to God, and
more safe and secure for himselfe: which peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may redound to the great damage and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Christendome, for the losse that it should

               <p>And now for as much as I haue shewed, that it is not

               <p>FIrst the Turke feareth least the Princes of Italie
will resolue in earnest to succour the Emperour
and the Transyluanian either with men,<note place="margin">The Princes of Italie. The Duke of Florence. The Pope.</note> or with
money. He seeth, that the great Duke of Tuscane
hath sent his brother and his Neuewes to the one,
and Capitaines and presents to the other. That the
Pope sent the last yeare his Neuew with a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
into Hungarie, by meanes wherof the Garrison
of <hi>Strigonia</hi> and <hi>Vicegrado</hi> was the sooner yeelded:
and moreouer that he furnisheth both the one and
the other with money: yea, and likely it is, that as
he is able, he will do so still, vntill the warre bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
He perceiueth also, that the going of the Duke

that the other Italian Princes would likewise
make some stirre. He doubteth, least the Venetians
will be at the last of necessitie compelled to take vp
armes against him, either for their owne proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
and benefite, or by the continuall and instant
motions of the Pope, as they did in the times of Leo

the 2. of <hi>Galixtus</hi> the 2. of <hi>Clement</hi> the 3. of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi>

for the singular benefites which they haue done to

verie great preheminencies and priuiledges, at the

their pietie and obedience to the Sea Apostolike,
but also by common consent to bee called the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
and fortresse of Christian Religion. And
hereupon it commeth that the Turke dare not at
this time minister vnto them any occasion of the
least discontentment in the world, but doth readily
satisfie them in any matter, which they request of
him.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="22" type="section">
               <head>§ XXII.</head>
               <p>MOreouer hee doubteth that <hi>Polonia</hi> also will
rise vp against him:<note place="margin">Polonia.</note> knowing for certaintie,
that the Pope offereth to furnish it with good store
of money, whereof the meaner and poorer sort of
the people in that kingdome are verie greedie, and
desirous. For they think, that they cannot in any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort purchase desert to themselues from their
Prince, for which they may afterwards in conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
time craue reward at his hands, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to serue him
in his warres. This suspition and doubt of his, is the
more encreased in him, because hee knoweth that
the king of Spaine did not answere the letters of the
King of Polonia, but vntill now at the last, when hee
was somewhat discontented with the peace which
<hi>Maximilian</hi> had concluded with that kingdome.
And further,<note place="margin">Three reasons why if Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia rise against the Turke, hee shall be forced to make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue warre.</note> the Turke knoweth full well, that if
<hi>Polonia,</hi> should once in earnest resolue vppon this
point, he should of necessitie be compelled to make
a defensiue war, rather then an offensiue, to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great disaduantage, and that for 3. reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18221:98"/>
1 The first, because thereby he must needes loose
<hi>Moldauia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hieremie the Vaiuode of Moldauia.</note> for that the Polack hath appointed for
Vaiuode of that prouince, one <hi>Hieremie,</hi> who is a
man that sheweth himselfe not altogither alienated
misseaffected towards our affaires of Christendom:
and who also in respect that hee may in good time
vnderstand any stirres that the Turke shal make, and
minister good store of vittailes to the campe is one,
that will be worthie of no small regard and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
in this present warre. And therefore I may
not forbeare in such an important poynt to tel you,
that it shall alwayes be good for our Lord and his
Ministers to maintaine good intelligence with the
said <hi>Hieremie,</hi> and that they be carefull to looke what
sort of persons they send to treate with him, and
how they write vnto him: for these people, who be
the verie <hi>Daui</hi> &amp; <hi>Getae</hi> in <hi>Terence,</hi> are by nature most
suspicious. It will be good also to honour him greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and to seeme most willing to visite such as he shal
send either to Rome, or to treate with the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioes
Apostolike. For the Turke endeuouring by
diuerse and sundrie meanes to bind him to himselfe,
or wholy to alienate him from vs, or else at the least
to cousen and deceiue him: (all cunning fetches
much vsed by the Ottomans) it cannot bee but
verie helpefull and beneficiall to vs, to maintaine
him, as much as may be, in good loue and amitie
with vs.</p>
               <p>2 The second reason is,<note place="margin">The Cosacchi</note> because thereby, he shall
haue the <hi>Cosacchi</hi> more openly to oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
against him, as wel for that they be subiects of
the K. of <hi>Polonia</hi> (as the <hi>Vscocchi</hi> be of the Emperour)


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18221:98"/>
and receiue their Generall from him, whome the
Souldiers doe ordinarily obey: as also for that
they may at their pleasure burne and destroy
<hi>Vosia,</hi> which is a Fortresse of the Turkes,<note place="margin">Vosia. Boristhenes</note> situate
at the mouth of the Riuer Boristhenes, called by
the Polackes <hi>Occhiacouia,</hi> and by the Moldauians
<hi>Dassoua:</hi> as in the yeare 1583, they burnt <hi>Bendero,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bendero.</note>
their Generall being then <hi>Ianzo</hi> the Hungarian,<note place="margin">Ianzo.</note>
who was appointed ouer them by K. <hi>Stephen</hi> of
<hi>Polonia.</hi> Many other harmes and annoyances they
may also doo vnto him, as they did vnder <hi>Suita</hi>
the Russian,<note place="margin">Suita. Gonte Ianus.</note> and vnder <hi>Conte Ianus</hi> sonne of <hi>Basilius</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Ostroua,</hi> and other their Captains, which
they likewise receyued from the Polonians. These
<hi>Cosacchi</hi> doo dwell in an Island of <hi>Boristhenes,</hi> almost
foure dayes iourneyes aboue <hi>Vosia.</hi> The Island is
called <hi>Chirches,</hi> and the Riuer <hi>Boristhenes</hi> is by them
termed <hi>Nis,</hi> which is the <hi>Niepro.</hi> They are Arcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers,
and excellent Archers, and both by nature
and open profession verie greate enemies to the
Turkes. Many of them doo serue at this day the
Transyluanian, the foresaid <hi>Hieremie</hi> and <hi>Michael.</hi>
Others doo attend and goe with the Chanceller of
<hi>Polonia:</hi> and others are also dispersed and scattered
in <hi>Podolia.</hi> But all of them with great courage doo
shewe their faces to the Tartarians, and Turks.</p>
               <p>3. The last reason is, because the Polacke onely,<note place="margin">The passage more easie to Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note>
or at least more then any other Prince, is able to
make the passage to <hi>Constantinople</hi> more easie for
our people: for that is the place, whether we must
needes goe at the last, if we meane to doo any good
in deed. And so much the more, for that if the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lack,</hi>


                  <pb facs="tcp:18221:99"/>
doo shew himselfe to bee an enemie to the
Turke, then the Transyluanian shall not neede to
feare the passage, which his Armie must make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Walachia. For the way of Moldauia without
touching Walachia, would bee verie incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
for it, aswell because it runneth too neare
vnto the sea, as also because if hee would passe
into <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> hee must returne backwardes to
goe into the Countrey, that they may keepe and
feede his horses, and to auoyde the vnlucky place
of <hi>Varna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here by the way, I will not forbeare to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
you of an errour, which is of no small moment, as I
haue also endeauored my selfe to doe, in sundry fitte places
of this narration, of diuers others which peraduenture
will not proue altogether vnprofitable, to such as are
delighted with the like studies.<note place="margin">Errors touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Moldauia, and Walachia.</note> And the error is this,
that <hi>P. Iouius</hi> describing the said Prouinces of <hi>Wala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia</hi>
and <hi>Moldauia,</hi> beeing deceiued by the ambiguous
and doubtfull worde of <hi>Polackes,</hi> confoundeth the one
of them with the other. And so are others also decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
who doo thinke that to bee <hi>Walachia,</hi> which the
Hungarians call <hi>Transalpina</hi> the lesser, whereas in
comparison of <hi>Moldauia,</hi> it should bee called <hi>Transal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina</hi>
the Greater. Those are likewise in an error, who do
hold, that <hi>walachia</hi> called by the Turkes <hi>Islakia,</hi> deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the name from the ancient Romane <hi>Flacci,</hi> is also ter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med
by them <hi>Bogdania</hi> &amp; <hi>Cara Bogdania,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Islakia. Bogdania. Cara Bogda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</note> for by that
name they terme <hi>Moldauia</hi> (and not <hi>Walachria</hi>) eyther
because it is very plentifull of that kinde of graine, which
wee call <hi>Saracino,</hi> and <hi>Formentone,</hi> that is to say, Wheat,
whereof Formentie is made, Or because one of those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18221:99"/>
of Moldauia, with whom the Turkes had some long
warre, was called <hi>Bogdano,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Deodato. i.</hi>
Gods gift, adding therevnto for his <hi>praenomen</hi> or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
<hi>Cara,</hi> which signifieth Blacke. And it is called also
<hi>Moldauia</hi> of the <hi>Daui,</hi> who were the frist inhabiters ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and rather for the softnesse and fatnesse of the moulde
of that soyle, then for the blackenesse of it, as he thought,
that called it <hi>Mori-Dauia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But returning backe againe to <hi>Polonia,</hi> I will here
set downe also the aunswere, which the Chanceller
of that kingdome made to <hi>Sinan</hi> Bassa, at such time
as he required and demaunded the tribute, which he
wrongfully pretended to bee due to his Lord and
maister: to the end that thereby may be knowne the
benefite and profite, that in all reason is to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bination, if the Polonian will yeeld
vnto it.<note place="margin">The answer of the Chanceller of Polonia to the demaunds of Sinan.</note> 
                  <hi>Sinan</hi> caused a message to be deliuered to

the said tribute: or else he would force him to leaue
the Frontiers, and to retire to the Icie Sea. The
Chanceller caused answere to bee redeliuerd backe
vnto him, that hee would not stay for him in his
owne Countrey of <hi>Polonia,</hi> but that he would enter
into the <hi>Ottomans</hi> Territories, and proceed with all
speed euen to the banks of the <hi>Danow,</hi> &amp; fortifying

               <p>MOreouer,<note place="margin">Why the Turke feareth Moscouia.</note> the <hi>Ottoman</hi> not only esteemeth the
Pope to be the head and chiefe of all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Christian, so that by his auctoritie hee may easily
vnite now some, and then some of them against him
but also accounteth him to be as a temporall prince,
in regard of that which he possesseth in Italie:<note place="margin">By whar names the Turkes, and Persians call the Pope.</note> and
thereupon he calleth him <hi>Franch-Beg,</hi> the Prince of

Vicar of God, a title, which most impiously the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Agarenes</hi> began to appropriate to themselues.
So that the Turke dooth greatly feare, least the
Pope should send some person of credite into <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couia,</hi>
to solicite the vnion of that prince with the
Emperour, which would bee a matter of great losse
vnto him: or at least that he should perswade him
to let or hinder the comming foorth of the Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians:
as we haue shewed before, how hee may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
doe it.</p>
               <p>He also feareth the armies and power of the <hi>Czar</hi>
or <hi>Zar</hi> of <hi>Moscouia,</hi> for so the Moscouites doe call
their prince: besides the reasons before alledged, as
well for that he doth absolutely commaund and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
his subiects, and therefore it seemeth that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
al the princes of the world, he is the only man


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18221:100"/>
that may compare with him: as also for that he doth
verie well remember the discomfitures which the
Moscouites haue giuen to the Turkes (for the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish

of their ancesters) and in particular, when thy went

it would so much the more encourage and

were not of purpose negociated and handled, rather


<pb facs="tcp:18221:101"/>
by such cunning and craftie deuises the more easily
to enlarge Dominion and Schisme, then for any
thing else: euen as the Turke vnder the amitie and
friendship, which hath beene sought and offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him by many Princes, hath entred and pierced
into the bowels of Europe. But of this point we doe
not nowe stande in feare: and therefore I wish that
we would hope in the Lord, and pray that he would
take away from their eyes that vaile of obstinacie,
which hath hindered them from seeing the goodly
light of the euangelicall truth, and that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in the great duke now liuing, or in his successors
those spirites,<note place="margin">Basilius.</note> which were in that same <hi>Basilius,</hi> who

                  <note place="margin">The submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion likewise of the Russiou Bishops.</note> But much more is he dismayed at the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

themselues to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the viii. whereof Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
<hi>Baronius</hi> hath more particularly written in

the conuersion and vniting of the Moscouites,
may exceeding easily bee procured: and also for
that with lesse expenses and danger, passage may be
made by <hi>Moscouia</hi> into <hi>Asia,</hi> for the sowing and
planting of the Faith of Iesus Christ, then by all the
other parts of the world besides.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the Turke feareth the Moscouite,<note place="margin">The Mosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors to the Emperour.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

those that are free, as those that are subiect to

giuing Money to certaine chiefe persons, which are
of greatest reputation among them (as it is vsed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
among the <hi>Swizzers</hi>) they should prouide, that


<pb facs="tcp:18221:102"/>
they stirre not out of their own Countrey: with an
open publication of the Popes name, as at other
times it hath beene done. For all the Tartarians
are of an opinion, that the Pope hath exceeding
store of treasure, and is a man of great power and
authority,<note place="margin">Why the Tar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tarians haue come in so smal a number to aide the Turke.</note> and therefore they will bee very readilie
resolued to pleasure him in any thing. And it is
holden for certain among the Turkes, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
and the Transyluanian did so this last yeare,
because the Tartarians came vnto them in so small
a number, and not in that multitude, as they had
prouided, and as some of vs (Christians) did vainely
and falsly belieue. And so much the more is our
vaine opinion confuted, because it is notoriously
known, that <hi>Alipe Chan,</hi> treating with Visconte the
Nuntio for some aide, that hee might bee preserued
in his State against his Brother <hi>Hirach,</hi> was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to procure many of his owne people to be sent
foorth out of his owne Countrey. I know it wel
that some haue attributed the cause of this defect of
the Tartarians to the discontentmentes,<note place="margin">Why the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians were disconted with Amurath.</note> which they
haue conceyued against <hi>Amurath,</hi> for the peace
which hee made with the Persians: For (say they)
they had thought to haue gotten vpon the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
before this peace had beene concluded, so safe
a passage to goe to <hi>Mecca,</hi> as without passing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the Turkes Countrey, they might freelie
haue gone thether. But I know that these men are
greatlie deceyued. For they were not the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians
of <hi>Crimo,</hi> that were so greatlie discontented
with the Turke: but those that were vnder the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of <hi>Vsbeg-Chan</hi> (of whome I haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18221:102"/>
spoken before:) and those also not for that
cause which they alledge. For (if I be not in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour)
although they would haue gained and gotten
into their handes all the whole Persian Estate and
kingdome, yet they must algates of necessitie passe
through the Countrey of the Turkes, when so euer
they would go to <hi>Mecca.</hi> But the reason thereof was
because <hi>Amurath</hi> had concluded a peace with the
Persians, without making them acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall,
and to the exceeding great detriment of
their designements and affaires.</p>
               <p>And in sooth euen as true is it,<note place="margin">The difference and quarrell betweene Alip Chan, and his brother Hirach</note> that the Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
did forbeare to come to the Turks in so great a
multitude as they expected, because they were kept
backe by the Moscouite, although the Tartarians
themselues did vse it for an excuse: but the verie
truth is, that the Tartarian two brethren being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
great enemies, the one to the other. <hi>Alipe Chan</hi>
to maintaine himselfe in the state, and <hi>Hirach</hi> to
driue him out of it, they held all the Countrey in a
faction, and busied wholy in the defence of their
owne priuate quarels, as yet they doe. For <hi>Alipe</hi>
though he be the King now reigning, is not obeyed
by all the Tartarians: and <hi>Hirach</hi> is acknowledged
to be king, onely by such as haue serued him as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
in this warre. Who although it is verie likely
that in the end hee will get the victorie, because the
Turkish Emperour <hi>Mahamet</hi> hath commaunded
them all to obey him, and acknowledge him for
their king, and the greatest part of the Souldiers doe
follow him: yet is the contrarie opinion holden by
such as haue the best intelligence of the Tartarian

doubt, are by a certaine pricke and eagre desire to
dominere and rule, which they haue had by nature
most desirous of Nouelties: and because the Turks
doe so greatly tyrannize ouer them, they doe
willingly and readily embrace any alteration or
tumult, hoping by that onely meane to shake
off the heauie yoke of their most miserable slaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
And this is chiefly and especially desired by the
Greekes of <hi>Morea</hi> and of <hi>Thessalie,</hi> and by those
rather which dwell towardes the sea, because for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
aides and helpes may more easily bee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed

by the <hi>Seruiani,</hi> being a Nation that inhabiteth

Albanians that liue after the Romish rite. And
these be they, that because they haue a strong site for
dwelling, and are by nature verie fierce and hardie,
haue not as yet suffered themselues to bee subdued
by the Turkish forces. And therefore they did (at
the last) attempt to withdraw themselues out of the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> tyrannie.<note place="margin">Rebellion of the Greekes in Plaua vnder Gardan Vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uode.</note> For hauing vnderstood that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamet</hi>

God, being brought to the knowledge of his error
wherein hee liued, caused himselfe to be carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Presence of the Great Turke, and there with
a Christian courage and boldnesse told him, That if
he would preserue his soule from the eternall fire

that impious superstition of <hi>Mahamet,</hi> and humble
himselfe vnder the obedience of the true law of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

committed a most heynous and grieuous offence,
condemned publikely to bee spitted aliue vppon a

words to all the people, with such effectuall termes
replenished and enflamed with the fiery spirite of

put you in mind of that in any case,<note place="margin">Haytho the Armenian</note> as soone as the
Christians shall bee resolued to doe any good, they
doo warily and curiously keepe secret their intents
and counsels, to the end that the enemie be in no

For the Christians in times by-past, because they
would not conceale their designementes, found by
experience, that they fell into many disaduantages,
whereas on the contrarie side, the enemie hath auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
many daungers, and so bereaued the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of their opportunities, to bring their wished
desires to effect. To leaue the examples of the
Gentiles, when <hi>Iudith</hi> was resolued with a coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
minde to goe and kill <hi>Holofernes,</hi> for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
of the Cittie of <hi>Bethulia,</hi> it is written in the

I will not haue you to enquire of my Act, and vntill
I declare it vnto you, Let no other thing be done,
but prayer for mee to the Lorde our God. This
course if it were practised in our times with true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
and Faith, certainely it would not fall out,
that our Princes should haue any neede at all to
feare a happy and prosperous issue of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
and deuises, and thereby they might also more
curiously search and find out the designementes of
their enemies. For euen as God doth neuer aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

are to bee found in plentifull manner in some that
liue at this day, and would be verie apt and meet
instrumentes to bring greate enterprises to good

that <hi>Selim</hi> would haue passed into Italie, not vnlike
to that which other Popes haue done, as <hi>P. Iouius</hi>
writeth in his counsell giuen for the warre against
the Turke, and sundry other Authours likewise. The
Pope (saith <hi>Guicciardin</hi>) like an vniuersall father,<note place="margin">Frances Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciardin.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
himselfe of the Common good of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
after hee had first caused verie deuout
prayers and supplications to bee celebrated to God,


<pb facs="tcp:18221:116"/>
whereunto hee went himselfe bare-foot: he sent
writtes or Brieffes to all the Princes Christian,
warning them of the great daunger that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
and at hand, and comfortably exhorted
them, that laying aside all discordes and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they would readilie attend vpon the defence
of religion, and their owne common safety, by vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their mindes and their Forces against the
Turke, and by going to assault him, euen at his own
home: Hee published vniuersall and generall
truces betweene the said Princes, with the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the heauiest censures of the Church to be
inflicted vppon such as gainesaide the same, to the
end, that onely such matters as belonged to so
great an enterprise, should bee entertayned and
handled. He dispatched vnto them for the same
purpose diuerse Legate-Cardinals, men of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
and renowned aswell for their experience
in this businesse, as also for their opinion of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
He aduised and consulted with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
of euery Prince, and examined the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
conceites and iudgementes of militarie
men, and of such persons as were well acquainted
with the Countryes, with the disposition of the
Prouinces, and with the Forces and Armes of that
Empire. Last of all hee resolued with himselfe,
that it was most necessarie to prouide a very great
summe of Moneyes, partly by a contribution vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie
to bee made among the saide Princes, and
partly by an vniuersall Imposition to bee leuied
vpon all Christian Nations: and therevpon the
Emperour accompanied with the Hungarian and


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18221:116"/>
Polonian Horsemen (who are verie warlike Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and well exercised with continuall warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

Horse and Foote, as were requisite for so great an
Enterprise; to sayle by the Danowe into <hi>Bossina:</hi>
(hee would say into <hi>Seruia,</hi> for so was the vpper

Secondly, that the king of <hi>France</hi> with all

Footemen of the Swizzers, should passe from the
Hauen of <hi>Brindes,</hi> (aunciently called <hi>Brundusium,</hi>)

assault <hi>Grecia,</hi> which is full of Christian inhabitants
who both in that respect, and in regarde of the
crueltie of the Turkish Empire, are very ready and
well disposed for a rebellion. Thirdly, that the
Kinges of <hi>Spaine,</hi> of <hi>Portugall,</hi> &amp; of <hi>England</hi> should

for that the Turkes doe principally build vpon this
