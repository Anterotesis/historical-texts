            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

17. At the request of such men I haue
yeelded to the publishing of those
<pb facs="tcp:17179:3"/>
Lectures which I made vpon the
Lords Prayer: notwithstanding the
labours of other reuerend &amp; excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
men, which haue both trauailed
farre, and waded deepe in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And if any man looke for any
new matter at my hand, he doth but
loose his labour: for I must confesse
that I haue walked by their lights, &amp;
trode their steps for the greatest part
of my iourney: neither haue I taken
vpon me to performe any thing by
my self more then others haue done,
but to ioyne with others in the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the spirituall temple, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
I haue brought such as I had.
And for my owne part, I thinke my
selfe most highly bound to praise his
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ly Maiestie, that hath vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
me (the most vnprofitable of al) a
place amongst his builders, though I
bring but lime &amp; morter to the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and a place amongst his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
though I doe but now &amp; then
<pb facs="tcp:17179:3"/>
strike a stroke, or carrie their armour
after them, and a place amongst his
skilful Archers, though my selfe doe
but giue aime at the marke as it were
in respect of them that haue pearced
it, and gotten the victorie: they are
gone before with the vintage, I come
after with the gleanings, which may
bee as acceptable to some as the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
is to others. And seeing as the
Lord blesseth whom he will, and by
whom he will, I knowe no cause of
disconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tednes to remaine vnto any,
seeing it is lawfull for euery one to
doe what good he can, both by spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and writing, especially in these
dayes wherein Sathan beareth such
sway, and by his seruants laboureth
by all meanes possible to hinder the
growth &amp; thriuing of Gods church,
to destroy the faith of Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>,
to hold al men in miserable blindnes
&amp; ignorance: yea, and if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
to bring to passe that God shuld
<pb facs="tcp:17179:4"/>
haue no true worship, yea no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
at all done vnto him amongst
the sonnes of men. I am bolde my
good Lord to offer this small treatise
vnto your Honor, both in respect of
my bounden duetie, as also for the
worthines of the matter handled
therein, which sheweth both the
matter of prayer, and also the right
order and maner of calling vpon the
name of God, amongst all estates, at
all times, in al places, &amp; for al wants,
which is such a poynt of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as who so hath attained vnto
the true knowledge, &amp; right practise
of the same, hath obtained a great
matter, if not the greatest of al in this
life. For such a one may haue free
accesse to the throne of grace, and
stand in the presence of the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
when another shall flie from his
presence: such a one may batter and
beate downe the walles, the cities,
and the holdes of mightie enemies,
<pb facs="tcp:17179:4"/>
when other shall not dare to come
neere them: he shall breake the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
doores, and make yron gates to
open of their owne accord, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
shall lye by it: he shall doe as
much with one man, as others shall
doe with a hundred, and more too:
for he shall be able not onely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
against men, yea though they
bee many, and mightie, and craftie,
but he shall preuaile with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
like Iacob, vntill he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
against Sathan, and all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of hell, and gotten the masterie
ouer himselfe, euen to the deniall of
himselfe, for the trueths sake, which
is the greatest victorie that can bee
gotten: he shall haue power &amp; skill
to tame his owne affections, which
is more then the taming of wilde
beasts: he shall finde patience in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie,
and thankfulnes in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and contentation in euery triall:
he shall see the mountaines couered
<pb facs="tcp:17179:5"/>
with heauenly souldiers for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Gods people, as Elisha did:
he shall raise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he dead, and water the
earth with aboundance of raine, as
Elias did: he shal stop the mouthes of
the hungrie lions without any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
as Daniel did, and quench the
flames of fire without any water, as
Shedrach and his fellowes did. In a
word, the effects of prayer are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
and infinite: for what may
not he haue and effect, that shall but
aske and haue?</p>
            <p>Who were euer more honoured
of men, then they that haue giuen
most honour vnto God? And who
doe more honor the Lord, then they
that doe truely call vpon his name by
prayer? who more renowned, and
beloued then the godly, and zealous
in true religion? And what godlines
or religon can there be without the
true knowledge and right practise
of prayer? who were euer more vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb facs="tcp:17179:5"/>
in warre, more milde in peace,
more cherefull in prison, more sober
in libertie, more painefull in health,
more comfortable in sicknes, more
godly in their life, or more happie in
their death, then the faithfull? And
who were euer faithfull without
prayer, which is the chiefest fruite of
faith, &amp; borne with faith, both borne
together like twinnes? To whome
doth the Lord giue his grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
but to the humble and lowly?
And who were euer truly humbled,
but those which by prayer vnto God
in the bitter feeling of sinne, haue
most confessed, and acknowledged
their wantes, their weaknesses, their
imperfections, and al their iniquities?</p>
            <p>Where did euer the manifolde
graces of God meete and dwell, but
in the soule of the faithfull, which
haue still beene conuersant in calling
vpon the name of Iehouah? For hee
that hath the spirite of prayer, hath a
<pb facs="tcp:17179:6"/>
speedie messenger continually in a
readines, at all needes, to trauell for
him betweene heauen and earth, and
sometime bringeth with him liuely
faith, and true repentance, sometime
ioy in the holy Ghost, sometime pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
in affliction, sometime assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Gods eternall fauour, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce out of danger, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
wisdome and discretion, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
zeale of Gods glory, and loue
to the brethren, sometime one grace,
and sometime another, &amp; sometime
it causeth all these graces of God to
meete together in one man, where
they doe reioyce one in another, and
one embrace another, like friendes
mette at a feast, but the partie that
doth entertain them is euer the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
gainer. The heauenly art of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
(if I may so call it) is an arte of all
artes. He is counted the best Orator
that can best perswade, &amp; most moue
the affections of men, but hee that
<pb facs="tcp:17179:6"/>
hath learned to praye well, shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
not men perhaps, but GOD
himselfe, and moue him that is the
mouer and perswader of all mens
heartes and affections. Philosophie
searcheth out much by argumentes
and demonstrations, but all groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon naturall reason: but prayer
seekes out those thinges that reason
doubteth, yea and despaireth of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is grounded not vpon reason
but vpon faith, which is farre aboue
all naturall reason, and is then most
busie, &amp; liuely in working whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> is at her wits end. Grammar
teacheth to speake well, but not the
language of Canaan, that is, the holy
language of God, as prayer doth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticke
helpeth a man to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
many thinges: but by the arte of
prayer we may learne to number our
dayes as Dauid desired, which is to
apply our heartes to true wisedome,
and that is the best numbring. The
<pb facs="tcp:17179:7"/>
best Arithmetician cannot number
that which is infinite, not by all his
wit and skil compasse all to himselfe
that hee hath alwaies numbred: but
he that hath learned the arte of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
may comprehend by faith (which
doth accompany his prayer) the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
mercies of God, and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to himselfe. Geometrie mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth
out landes and Lordshippes,
countries, and kingdomes, and the
whole earth: but what is that to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?
which measureth out heauen and
earth and the land of the liuing, but
yet no more then faith perswadeth
her to bee her owne. Astronomie
looketh aloft, and yet no hyer then
the starres, measuring out the causes
and effects of thinges by the course
of nature: but the faithfull which
haue the spirite of true prayer, looke
vp to God himselfe which is exalted
farre aboue the starres, and iudgeth
not of thinges by the course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:17179:7"/>
but by the grace, and gracious
promises of God, which doe ouer

In a worde, a man may bee a good

a good Astronomer and coniecture

a good Politician and liue well, a

and a good Diuine and preach well,
and in all these excell, and yet goe
to hell when all is done: but they
that haue these, and the spirit of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
and grace to teach them
the right practise of prayer, are most
happie: for they haue the key that
openeth the doore of Gods liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which will bring them to the
full possession of happines. Therfore
my good Lord, sith prayer is an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise

of his sacred worde and Gospell, and
the aduancement of his glorie, in
furthering the building vp of his

what one more holie,

necessarie then true prayer? And yet what
is more neglected, and prophaned as that
is?<note place="margin">Psalm. 14.</note> Not to call vpon the name of God at
all, is a note of a wicked man: and to pray
though much and often without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
or care to pray aright,<note place="margin">Esai. 1.</note> is a badge of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17179:10"/>
an hypocrite: Yet who almost for the
whole neglect of so great a duetie, feareth
the censure of a wicked man? or for the
horrible prophaning of the name of God
in abusing an exercise so heauenly and
necessarie, suspecteth himselfe to be in the
way of hypocrites, which leadeth to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
destruction both of bodie and soule?
Some care not whether they pray or no, &amp;
thinke it a needles labour and vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

there were in <hi>Iobs</hi> time.<note place="margin">Iob. 21. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which their outragious blasphemie, or
blasphemous outrage, is their aboundant
prosperitie, and great wealth, wherein
they put their confidence, and in the pride
of their wicked hearts sticke not either to
deny God, or to defie him.<note place="margin">Psalm. 55.</note> Some thinke
prayer to bee needfull, and doe sometime
vse the same, being forced thereunto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the biting of conscience, or extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie

and if God will not take their lazie, drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
colde, slouthfull, ignorant, and idle
prayers, he is like to get none of them: as
though the halt, the lame, blinde, &amp; skur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
sacrifices were good enough for him,
when the diuell hath the best. Some are
a little more deuout &amp; earnest in prayer,
but yet very preposterous and prophane,
preferring earthly things before heauenly
blessings like <hi>Esaw,</hi> who preferred pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
before an inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce: and when they
craue such things, it is likewise as S. <hi>Iames</hi>
saith,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.</note> to spend them vpon their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
Some pray, but not in charitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are all for themselues, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
quite the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>munion of Saints, which
yet they say they doe beleeue. But if their
praiers did proceed from that faith which
worketh by loue, and by that loue which
seeketh not her owne things,<note place="margin">Galath. 5.</note> then would
they also remember the afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of poore.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note>
                  <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and the wants of their Christian
brethren in all places of the world. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
haue more charitie in prayer, for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17179:11"/>
they will not stick to pray for all Christian
soules liuing or dead, like beggars which
strawe their prayers at euery mans doore
they come at. Some againe neuer pray for
any man vntill they bee dead, and then
they are merueilous pitifull, and painfull
in throwing the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whom in their life time they neuer regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Some againe are growne to be more
charitable in prayer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> God would haue
them to be, like the Papists, which wil doe
more worke for their wages, then euer the
Lord required at their handes, because
they wil not be beholding to him for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
but he shal be beholding to them for
their works of supererogation. Such are
they that holde wee ought to pray for all
men, according to the very letter of the
scripture, without any exception, liuing or
dead, elect or reprobate, for the enemies
of the Gospell as well as for the friends of
the Gospell, that God would blesse them
in al their enterprises, whatsoeuer they be,
whether with God or against him, with
Prince, or countrie, or against them, all is
one: and for the reprobate likewise, that
they may bee saued, as well as the elect,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17179:11"/>
whatsoeuer God hath decreed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie:
and some thinke it a poynt of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
too, to pray for the diuels, and it may
be in good policie that they doe it, for by
this meanes, if they should chance to goe
to hell, they may finde more fauour at the
diuels hande, then others, because they
were so charitable as to pray for him whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
they liued. Now as touching those that
of their charitie are so good as to pray for
the saluation of the reprobate (whosoeuer
they bee that is knowne to GOD) what
warrant, or example out of Gods booke
haue they to beare them out in this super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
and foolish charitie? I cannot yet
finde of whom they should learne to bee
so pitifull, except it be of Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> of
whom in the Popes Legend there is this
storie recorded, to his euerlasting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
as they thought, <hi>viz.</hi> That on
a time going through the Market of
<hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>Traianns</hi> Market, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
that <hi>Traianus</hi> was in Hell torments,
because he dyed a Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>nime or Infidell:
and all on a sudden he betooke him to
his deuotions, and in great pitie fell to
prayer for <hi>Traianus</hi> being in Hell, and (as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17179:12"/>
the storie sayth) a voyce from heauen
told him that his prayers were heard, and
<hi>Traianus</hi> should bee deliuered from the
paines of Hell, but not from the prison of
Hell: and he for his part (because he was
so sawcie and bolde with God as to pray
for one that God had decreed to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
must needes bee punished, and two
penalties were appoynted him, of which
he was to take his choyce, &amp; that was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to lye two dayes in Purgatorie, or to
suffer sicknesse while he liued. He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the paines of Purgatorie very well,
would none of that, but chose rather to
endure sicknes al daies of his life: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
he presently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ell sicke, and diseased,
and was euer after to his dying day trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with feuers, or the axes, or head ach,
or sore eyes, or gow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>e in the feete, or with
one disease or other. And well enough
serued, to teach him to pray for a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
another time. And surely if all those
that are so charitable as Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi>
was, that is, to pray for the saluation of all
men, without exception, if (I say) they
were sure to be inioyned Pope <hi>Gregories</hi>
penance, it would make them take heede
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17179:12"/>
how they prayed against the will of God
for reprobates and all, while they liued.</p>
               <p>But now for the better satisfying of
those which haue been troubled about
this matter, and desired resolution at my
hands for the remouing of their doubts,
wee will a little further consider of the
matter, and see what we are to iudge of
it by the word of God, which is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest
rule that wee can goe by.<note place="margin">The state of the question.</note> Your
question (beloued in the Lord) is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be lawfull to pray for al men or no:
yea euen for the very reprobate whom
God hath reiected in his eternall counsel,
that they may bee saued in the day of the
Lord: for that is the state of the question
indeede. To which my answer is, that all
men being taken in that sense, we are not,
nay we ought not to pray for all, because
all shall not be saued. Indeed some of the
ancient writers haue thought that al men
shall be saued,<note place="margin">Origen.</note> and that the diuels and all
shall bee saued in the day of iudgement.
But that was their error: for it is euident
by the whole course of the scriptures, that
al men shal not be saued.<note place="margin">Matth. 7.</note> There is a broad
way, and there is a narrow way, sayth the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17179:13"/>
Lord Iesus, the one leading to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
the other to saluation. Many walke
in the one, fewe finde the other. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once in hell there is no redemption.
Againe, many shal striue to enter and shal
not enter: to shew that all shall not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
And the Apostle saith, that the church
is like a Noble mans house,<note place="margin">2. Timoth. 2</note> wherein are
vessels some appoynted to honour, and
some to dishonor, and the Lord knoweth
who bee his: as if he should say, also the
Lord knoweth some that be not his: and
all to shewe that all shall not bee saued.
The whole world standeth of beleeuers
and vnbeleeuers; they that beleeue passe
from death to life;<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.</note> they that beleeue not
are condemned alreadie: therefore all
shall not bee saued. When the Sonne of
man commeth to iudgement, who shall
stande before him? Goates and sheepe
sayth the Euangelist,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> to whom he shall
say, Depart ye wicked into hell fire: to the
other, Come ye blessed, &amp;c. therefore all
shall not bee saued. This doth Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>
also plainly shewe,<note place="margin">Apocal. 21.</note> when hee sayth, that
there is a burning, lake without the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Ierusalem; wherein the whore of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17179:13"/>
Babylon shall bee tormented, and with
her dogges, that is, dogged people, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters,
whoremongers, lyers, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
the fearefull and vnbeleeuers, &amp;c. all
which places doe crye lowde enough, and
tell vs that all shall not be saued. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<hi>Paul</hi> rendereth a reason for it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
he sayth, that it pleased the Lord to chuse
<hi>Iacob,</hi> and to reiect <hi>Esau,</hi> that he might
shewe his wrath,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 22, 23.</note> and make his power
knowne in the vessels of wrath prepared
to destruction: and that he might declare
the riches of his glorie vpon the vessels of
mercie, which hee hath prepared vnto
glorie. But you will say, that we know not
who be reprobates, and who be not, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ought to pray for all. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
that no man knoweth certainly
who are the Lords but the Lord himselfe,
doth it therefore followe, that wee must
pray that all may bee saued? What? for
those whom God will not haue saued?
God forbid. Our Sauiour Christ (that was
as wise and as charitable as they that hold
this poynt) hath taught vs to pray other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
<hi>When you pray, say<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Thy will be done:</hi>
that is, Lord saue those whom thou wilt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17179:14"/>
saue, and not whom thou wilt not saue. So
that our prayers wee see must bee groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon Gods will, and not vpon our
owne willes. If then he will not saue all,
we must not pray against his will, that he
would saue al: For then in stead of saying,
thy will be done, wee should pray thus or
to this effect: Lord wee knowe that thou
hast decreed, and appoynted from euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
whom to glorifie in thy kingdome,
and whom to cast downe to hell for euer:<note place="margin">Esai. 46. 10.</note>
and we know that thy counsell shal stand,
for so sayth thy word: but yet for all that
wee haue a minde and desire to haue all
men saued, therefore alter thy decree, and
change thy purpose, that is, bee contrarie
to thy selfe, and so not thy will, but ours
be done. From such kind of praying, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
blasphemous and presumptuous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
the Lord deliuer vs, &amp; giue vs grace
to pray as his word doth teach vs to pray,
that is, in our prayers to referre our willes
to Gods will, and not to presume to craue
that which God will neuer graunt. But
for as much as God hath his number in al
parts of the world, who are knowne to
himselfe, and Christian charitie which is a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17179:14"/>
most liuely fruite of faith, bindeth vs to
pray for the whole Church of Christ,
which is Catholike, that is, scattered vpon
the face of the whole earth, which Church
likewise is sometime visible, &amp; sometime
inuisible vnto men, and sometime more
visible, and sometime lesse visible, as in the
dayes of <hi>Elias,</hi> when the Lord had 7000.
in Israel more then <hi>Elias</hi> sawe, as sharpe
sighted as he was: and because all are not
called at one houre, but some to day,
some to morrowe, some at one time, and
some at another: therefore it is lawfull
for vs to pray for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> thus: That in <hi>Spayne,
Portingale, Rome, Turkie, Iewrie,</hi> and in al
other places of the world, yea, and of those
which doe now persecute Gods Church,
as sometime <hi>Paul</hi> did, so many of them as
doe belong to Gods eternall election, it
would please his Maiestie to conuert by
the preaching of his word, and the effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
working of his holy spirite in their
hearts, or by such meanes as shall seeme
good to his diuine Maiestie in his best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
time. And as for the rest, which
doe not belong to his eternall election,
and couenant of grace, we are to pray that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17179:15"/>
his will may bee done vpon them, and he
may bee glorified in his iudgements vpon
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, as he was glorified in the ouerthrow
of <hi>Pharao,</hi> and his host.</p>
               <p>But the matter must not bee so lightly
carried away:<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> for they that hold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
seeme to haue scripture to beare
them out: which if they did vnderstand
and apply so well, as they can auouch it, al
should bee well. The common alleadged
place is out of 1. Tim. 2. 4.<note place="margin">1. Timoth. 2. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>God wil that al
men shall be saued, and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the trueth.</hi> Now for an answere,
this I say, that, that place must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
bee vnderstood either of the reuealed
will of God, or of his secret will. If this
place bee vnderstood of Gods reuealed
will set downe in his word, then the sense
is this, that God doth call all men by the
preaching of his word to the knowledge
of his trueth, and to eternall life, if they
beleeue in Christ: and this saluation is
offered to all men, though al men beleeue
not. For by this meanes the reprobate and
vnbeleeuers, are shewed what they shuld
doe, and so are left without excuse in the
day of iudgement. But God doth not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17179:15"/>
giue them grace to repent, and beleeue, as
hee doth to the elect, because he hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
decreed of them, and if he doth
not, who shall compell him so to doe? or
who shal complaine iustly against his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Maiestie, seeing as the Lord is bound
to no man? If that place be vnderstood of
the secret will of GOD, then the sense is
three-fold: First, <hi>God will that all men shall
be saued:</hi> that is, God in his eternall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
according to his good pleasure, hath
decreed of all sorts and degrees of men to
saue some, of Iewes and Gentiles some, of
Kings and Princes some, of subiects and
commons some, of learned and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
some, of rich and poore some, of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and soldiers some, of Marchants &amp;
Marriners some, of Craftsmen and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen
some, and of all sorts, of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
and of all degrees, and conditions
of men some shalbe saued: which agreeth
with the saying of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who sayth,<note place="margin">Reuel 7.</note> That <hi>he sawe a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of all nations, and kindreds, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
follow the lambe,</hi> that is, Iesus Christ,
<hi>and stood before the throne, and praised him
that sate vpon the throne.</hi> And the cause of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17179:16"/>
the Apostles writing thus to <hi>Timothie,</hi>
was for that the Church of God liued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
vnder <hi>Nero</hi> a wicked Prince and cruell
tyrant, and an enemie to the Gospell of
Christ, in so much as some doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were to be prayed for or no: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apostle puts them out of doubt
for that matter, and sheweth that prayers
must be made for Kings and Princes, and
all men, and therefore for their Prince,
though he were a wicked enemie, for that
of all men and all sorts of men God hath
his number, and what could they tel whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were one of that number or no?
therfore they were to pray for him. There
is a seconde sense or meaning of those
words deliuered by the learned, and that
is this: <hi>God will that all men shall be saued,
&amp;c.</hi> That is, so many as are saued, are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the will of GOD, for as much as
none are saued against his will. And that
this may likewise bee the Apostles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
it may appeare by another place of
scripture like vnto that. It is in Iohn. 1. 9.
where the Euangelist speaking of the
Sonne of God, he sayth thus: He was the
true light that lighteneth euery man that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17179:16"/>
commeth into the worlde: meaning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
that whosoeuer is lightened, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
by the Sonne of God; not that
euery one particularly that commeth into
the world is lightened, none excepted:
for there bee some in the world which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in darknes, and the Gospell is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
from them,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 3, 4.</note> such as the god of this
world hath blinded, that is, the diuel hath
blinded their eyes, that the light should
not shine vnto them, as the Apostle shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
And this is no otherwise spoken, then
wee vse in our common manner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:
For if there bee but one man in a
towne that reacheth Grammar, wee say,
such a man teacheth all the towne Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
meaning, that all that are taught of
that towne are taught by him. Or if there
be but one way into a Noble mans house,
and suppose by one gate onely the way
lyeth into the house: if any man aske of
vs whether he may not goe into the house
another way, wee will answere and say:
No, al men go in at this gate, or the Noble
man hath giuen commandement that all
shall come in at that gate: meaning, that
so many as doe goe in, doe enter by that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17179:17"/>
gate. So in God there is but one will, by
which all men doe enter into heauen, that
is, all that doe enter into heauen doe passe
by that will of God, and not without it,
nor besides it, nor against it. But yet there
is a third sense of that place in Timot. <hi>God
will that all men shall be saued, &amp;c.</hi> That is,
God hath certainly decreed, that all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and chosen people shall be saued, but
not euery particular man in the worlde.
And wee are to consider, that this word
<hi>(all)</hi> is not put alwayes in the scripture for
euery particular man, woman, and childe,
but sometime for the greater part, and
sometime for the elect only. For the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

but yet they are to be restrained
onely to the godly and faithfull people of
the Lord, of them onely they are to bee
vnderstood, and cannot be applyed to the

which be as vniuersally propounded,
but are to be vnderstood only of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and vnfaithfull, and not of the godly:

                  <hi>Ye shall be hated of

There bee many moe places like vnto
these, which must bee restrained to their
proper kind: but this may suffice for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17179:18"/>
to that obiection out of Timothie.</p>
               <p>There is another obiection as common
as the former,<note place="margin">Obiect. 2.</note> and to as great purpose.
And thus they reason: So many shall bee
saued as Christ dyed for: but Christ dyed
for all, therefore all shall bee saued. To
which obiection some answere as the
Schoolemen doe, that Christ dyed for all

worlds, in respect of the merite of his
death, by reason of the worthines of his
person, if all did beleeue in him: but all
doe not beleeue in him, therefore all shall
not be saued. But this distinction of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie
and efficacie, is thought, and that
of very learned Diuines, to bee a very idle
distinction, and too weake to beare away
the burden of the question: for if Christ
dyed sufficiently for all, he dyed effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for all: and if it be not effectuall, how
is it sufficient? And they hold that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie
of his death, and the sufficiencie of
his death be all one. But to this replie will
be answered againe, that it is sufficient, in
respect of his owne merite, and should be
effectuall for all if all did beleeue. But all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17179:19"/>
doe not beleeue, and for them it is not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall.
True it is, for vnbeleeuers it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
effectual, nor sufficient. And whereas
it is effectuall for the faithfull, it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the infinite merite of his death &amp;

Ioh. 6. <hi>Esau</hi> is sayd to finde no place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,

that he wold change his decree &amp; receiue

but indeed prayer for the dead, &amp; prayer
for the reprobate, are much alike, the one

That it is not lawfull to pray for such

out of his sight, that is, out of his fauour,
and will not bee entreated for them, for
such we must not pray, but such are all the
reprobate, therefore we must not pray for
them, I meane for their saluation. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
like words we haue againe in Ier. 11. 14.
(speaking of obstinate Idolaters in the

to the Prophet: <hi>Therefore thou shalt not

and stand with his sacred will: and wee
doubt not but that God hath his number
amongst them all, which are knowne best
to himselfe, for he knewe 7000. in Israel
that were no friends to <hi>Baal,</hi> more then
<hi>Elias</hi> saw. Againe, amongst our selues that
professe the Gospel, an vnbeleeuer to day
may be a beleeuer to morrow, if his houre
be come which God hath set: for all infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
or vnbeleeuers, which is all one, are
not reprobates, for some may be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
neither are all called at one houre:
therefore charitie bindeth vs to liue in

hope of him so long as he liueth, and in
hope of his conuersion (if hee belong to
God still I say, which no man knoweth
but God himselfe) we are to pray for him,
but still referring our prayers to the will
of God. And againe, wee hold it a most
necessarie and Christian duetie of loue, to
pray for the confirmation of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and the proceeding and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vp of the faithfull in faith, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines:
therefore there is great oddes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the heresie of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and our
doctrine.</p>
               <p>There is no lesse difference in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
then there is in the propositions: the
reason why they denie the prayers of the
Church for the conuersion of infidels, and
the encreasing of the faithfull, is for that
man hath (as they say) this grace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting,
and abilitie of beleeuing, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
&amp;c. of him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>elfe, which wee vtterly
both denie and defie. But our question is
of praying for the saluation of reprobates,
and of all men without exception, and
our reason is grounded vpon the will of
God, and the vnchangablenes of his will.
And thus you see beloued, that wee are as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17179:24"/>
farre from the heresie of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> as they
which would charge vs with heresie, are

of this matter, but the large and full hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
therof I leaue for those that are more
able to performe it then my selfe, as God
shall giue them occasion to deale therein.
In the meane time, this may serue as a
plaine confession of that which my selfe
beleeue of that point, according to the
worde of God, both for the cleering of my

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> It shoulde s√©eme by this preface,
that we ought not to pray to the second
nor third person in the Trinitie, (that
is to say) to the Sonne, and the holy
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17179:50"/>
Ghost, but only to the first person, that
is the Father: for so are wee taught
to pray, <hi>Our Father:</hi> what say you to that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For the better vnderstanding of this
poynt, wee must consider that this word
<hi>Father,</hi> (being spoken of God) is put two
wayes in the Scripture, sometime perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
sometime essentially.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What doe you meane when you say it is put personally?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is taken personally, when it is put
but for some one of the three persons or
beings in the Trinitie, and cannot bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to any of the other persons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What doe you meane when you
say it is put essentially?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is taken essentially when it doth
extend to the whole essence of being of
the Deitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> (If you can) make your meaning
more plaine?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Then more plainly this is my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
that wheresoeuer this word <hi>Father</hi>
is attributed vnto God, being ioyned in
the same sentence, with the Sonne, or the
holie Ghost, or both, then it is taken per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17179:51"/>
that is, it is restrayned to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Father only. But when it is not
coupled, nor compared with any of the
persons, but is taken simply, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the other persons, then it is taken
essentially for the whole Godhead, and
for all the persons in the Godhead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Where is it taken personally?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In these places following:</p>
            <p>The comforter which is the holy Ghost,

               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:17179:51"/>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How is it taken in this prayer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In these words: <hi>Our Father which
are, &amp;c.</hi> it is taken essentially, for the whole

the Sonne and the holy Ghost, the they
are all one in nature and substance with
the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> If they bee all one in nature and
substance, then the second person, Iesus
Christ, is called father too, is he not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, he is so called by the Prophet

this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> My reason is this: We cannot pray
aright<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> except God be our father in Christ;
if God be our father in Christ, then we be
his children; if wee bee his children, then
are we also brethren to his children; if we bee brethren to them; then haue wee true
faith and loue; if wee haue true faith and
loue, then are we knit to Christ, and one to
another: if we bee so, then are wee of the
true Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is wee were not of the Church?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> They that are not of the Church, can

not make this prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why then belike of necessitie we
ought to haue vnitie with the true
Church, in faith, and doctrine, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is very true: for as wee haue our
father adopting vs, and making vs his
children, so here we professe that we hold
our faith with all the members of Gods
Church, and holde one and the selfe same
true religion and worship of God with
them: yea, and all that can say this prayer
truely, are ioyned in vnitie of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes as in sicknesse, pouertie, &amp;c. so
that wee haue a care of others aswell as of

of the simplest, if they feare God, and

God their father, and (to deale plainly) no
superiour can vse this prayer aright, before
they so abase themselues, that they take
the most simple, and meanest Christians
that are for their brethren, and so likewise
vse them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Some will not be called brethren,
nor call others by that name: for they
hold this name of brother or sister, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially

in scorne and reproch, accompting them
Puritanes, &amp;c. Which vse such kinde of

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Surely, I thinke that they doe much

                  <hi>Q.</hi> If superiours must so abase them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
as to take the simplest and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest for their brethren, and so their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals,

betw√©ene the Prince and subiect, the

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No sir, that is not my meaning, farre
be it from me, for there must bee degrees
of persons, of callings, and of estates, and
there must be a distinction between Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
and inferiours, for the auoyding
of disorder, and confusion, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of peace, which is Gods ordinance,
or els all should be head, or all should be
foote, &amp;c. which were as monsterous and
absurd in the bodie politicall, as it would
be in a bodie naturall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If that bee not your meaning,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17179:54"/>
then what is your meaning?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This I meane, and affirme, that all
those which haue any prerogatiue aboue
others, should consider, that though they
bee aboue others in things of this world,
yet others may be aboue them in heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, and equall with them in respect
of their heauenly father, who hath called
vs all with a heauenly calling to a heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inheritance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How may this poynt bee confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the testimonie of holy scripture.
When S. Paul would perswade masters to deale well by thier seruants,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 9.</note> he vseth this
as a reason: that they haue a master in
heauen, with whom is no respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. And this is the Apostles meaning,
when he sayth: <hi>There is neither Iewe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Galath. 3. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>nor
Grecian, there is neither bond nor free, there
is neither male nor female, for you are all
one in Christ Iesus:</hi> In the 26. verse hee
sheweth the reason why, and how: For, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>e
are all the sonnes of God by faith in Christ
Iesus.</hi> And for this cause it is sayd:<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 18. 19. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>The
King shall haue the booke of the law by him,
that he exalt not himself aboue his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:17179:55"/>
For want of the true knowledge of this
poynt, the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s despised the poore,
and would not receiue the Lords Supper
with them: and therefore the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth
them,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 33.</note> and willeth them to tarrie
one for another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How can his equalitie and supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie
stand together, and be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
on both sides at one time, and in
one place, and in one action busines?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Very well: as they do in the publike
assemblies and exercises of the Church,
where: 1. That a distinction &amp; difference
of persons &amp; degrees may appeare, (for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding
of confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, &amp;c.) euery man hath
his place appointed according to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines,
in respect of office, or calling, or
learning, or degree, or birth, or wealth,
&amp;c. then 2. That it may likewise appeare
that we are all brethren, hauing one God,
whom we call <hi>(Our father)</hi> in the merites
of Christ, and because all by one faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
one Sauiour, and look all by him for
one kingdome, therefore there is also in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
thereof a communitie &amp; equalitie of
diuers things, without any respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:17179:55"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How doe you meane that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not as the Anabaptistes, which
would haue all things common: but my meaning is this: There is not one place for
the poore, &amp; another for the rich, one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
for the greater learned, and another
for the lesse learned: one Sabboth for supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
&amp; another for inferiours: one water
for the baptizing of great mens children,
and another for poore mens children: one
bread and wine for the veluet gowne, and
another for the frize gowne: But on the
contrarie in the reformed Churches of
Christ, there is one place of meeting for
all, one pastour to instruct all, one Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both
to bee kept of all, one font, and one
water for the baptizing of al, one time for
the receiuing of all: and at the Lords
Supper, all receiue together, all partake of
the same bread, and wine, all drinke of
the same cuppe, and all giue thankes by
the same spirite, for the same benefites:
and where it is not so, it should bee
so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> You haue satisfied mee for that
poynt: but haue you any thing els to
note vpon this word <hi>(Our)?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:17179:56"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea,<note place="margin">5. Doctrine.</note> it teacheth vs further, that if we
bee of the number of Gods children, then
all the faithfull in al places doe commend
vs to God in their prayers, euen as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
and amongst those there are some
Abrahams, some Moses, some Elias, some
Iobes, &amp;c. whose prayers are more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
then others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What? and is this such a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, it is a great benefite: for if wee
feele not that zeale, and power of faith,
&amp;c. in prayer, which we desire, yet we are
not to bee discouraged, for that is euer in
some of them which is wanting in vs: and
Christ hath so framed this prayer, that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, wee cannot chuse but pray as well
for others, as for our selues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But will not this make men neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in prayer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, this is not to make any neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t
in prayer, but to strengthen those that are
diligent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If you haue any thing els to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
from these wordes <hi>[Our father]</hi>
note it briefly that wee may goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:17179:56"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> But one thing more I drawe out of
them,<note place="margin">6. Doctrine.</note> and that is a confirmation of two
maine poynts:
<list>
                     <item>1. Concerning particular faith in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
Christs merites vnto our felues.</item>
                     <item>2. The certaintie of our saluation.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For the first, when I say <hi>Our father,</hi> I am
taught to call GOD, my father, and so
Christ my redeemer, &amp;c. for when I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
my selfe, I cannot truely say, <hi>Our
father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the second, I know that God being
my father, he loueth me, and that I shall
be partaker of saluation: for whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
once he loueth for euer: therefore
my saluation is certaine and sure.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why are these words added?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In the former words wee are
taught what the Lord is concerning vs,
<hi>viz.</hi> a louing father.</p>
               <p>In these words wee learne what he is in
himselfe, <hi>viz.</hi> a God of all maiestie, power
and dominion.</p>
               <p>The 1. sheweth his willingnes to help vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:17179:57"/>
The 2. sheweth his abilitie to helpe

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why doth the Lord Iesus speake
of his willingnes and abilitie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To shew that of those two we must
be perswaded in prayer, or els we cannot
pray aright. Some came to Christ doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his willingnes,<note place="margin">Matth. 8. 2.</note> as the leper, <hi>Master,
if thou wilt thou canst make mee cleane.</hi>
Some doubting of his power, as the man
whose sonne had a dumbe spirit:<note place="margin">Mark. 9. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou
canst doe any thing for vs, helpe vs, &amp;c.</hi> But
here we are taught not to be like either
of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> God is euery where, why then is
he sayd to be in heauen?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because he is euery where, therfore
he must needes be in heauen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But why is hee sayd to haue his

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For two causes.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Because his glorie is most apparant
there.</item>

signes of his properties, and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
more then in other places, as of his

                     <item>1. They teach vs that God hath power

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I gather it thus: As the heauen is
hier then the elementall world, so he that
sits<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> in the heauen, must needes haue all
things in subiection vnder him.<note place="margin">Psalm. 2. 4.</note> And as

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They teach vs that God is no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

therefore not subiect to alteration in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
nor change in his purpose, as men be.
And this makes much for the certaintie of

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To relieue our infirmitie: for we do
not so easily pray for heauenly things, as
for earthly things.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a meanes to make vs pray for
heauenly things better then wee haue

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How may that be?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Very well: for when we haue triall
of Gods goodnes in the thinges of this
life, wee neede nothing to doubt of his
mercie in the things concerning another
life. And hauing found him friendly in
lesser matters, we may fully accoumpt of
his fauour in greater matters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> This shall suffice for the order of
it, now let vs come to the particular
view of euery word, and shewe what
w√©e are to learne from the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For the right vnderstanding of this
petition, two things in generall are to bee
considered of:
<list>
                     <item>1. The thing it selfe which wee are
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17179:81"/>
taught to aske.</item>
                     <item>2. The manner how we must aske it.</item>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What say you of the thing it self,
or the benefite that we doe craue in this
petition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is described by two adiuncts, or
circumstances:
<list>
                     <item>1. Of the qualitie, or nature of it.</item>
                     <item>2. Of the quantie, how much we must
aske.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Of what nature or qualitie is
it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is corporall, temporall, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and is called by the name of daylie
bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What quantitie, or how much
must we aske?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The quantitie is noted in these
words, <hi>our,</hi> and <hi>this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What meane you by that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I meane that we must aske, first, no,
more then our owne: secondly, no more
but for the present time and neede.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> After what manner must wee
aske it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Concerning the manner of asking
I obserue two things:
<list>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:17179:82"/>
                     <item>1. Wee must aske it as a gift, not as a
merite, or a thing bought or solde, or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed,
or changed, but as a free gift.</item>
                     <item>2. We must aske it, for vs, that is, not for
my selfe alone, but for others aswell as my
selfe.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> This is briefe and plaine, but yet
I would haue euery thing made as
plaine as may be (if it were possible) that
no doubt might remaine: therefore,
now shew first what is ment by bread
in this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This word bread is put in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
three manner of wayes.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Figuratiuely, for other things besides
bread, as sometime for Christ himselfe, in
Ioh. 6. 51.</item>
                  <item>Sometime for the benefites of Christ,
Matth. 15. 26.</item>
                  <item>Sometime for hunger, or a small por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
1. King. 22. 27.</item>
                  <item>Sometime for liberalitie to the poore,
Eccle. 11. 1.</item>
                  <item>2. Properly, for bread it selfe, Matth. 15.
33. 34.</item>
                  <item>3. Both properly, for such bread as we
eate, and figuratiuely, for whatsoeuer is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:17179:82"/>
necessary to the sustentation of this life, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as in Gen. 3. 19. Psal. 41. 9. and in
this petition.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> By bread then I see the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
meaneth, all necessary thinges for
this life: but why are they set downe
vnder the name of bread?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For two causes,
<list>
                     <item>1. Because bread is most vsuall and
necessary.</item>
                     <item>2. To teach vs that wee must stint our
immoderate desires, and be content with
a little.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What if the Lorde send vs more
then bread?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If the Lord giue more, we must bee
thankfull,<note place="margin">1. Timot. 6. 8.</note> and vse it well, and if he giue vs
but bread, that is to say, a little portion,
we must be content.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it not lawful to pray for riches?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Whatsoeuer is needfull to the life of
man, is included in this word, <hi>bread,</hi> and
prayed for here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But what call you needfull?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This needfull is to be measured and
iudged of, according to mens seuerall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and charges.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:17179:83"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If mens necessaries be great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
then great abundance is here pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for: but if we goe from necessaries to
superfluities, then wee haue no such war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> As w√©e haue no warrant for it,
so you can she wenothing against it,
can you?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, both the precepts of God, and
examples of Gods children are against it.
See Deut. 8. 7. &amp;c. Prou. 30. 8. 9. Iob. 31. 24.
&amp;c. 1. Timoth. 6. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> With what minde and affection
must we desire things necessary for our
calling?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Wee may craue such thinges as are
necessarie and conuenient according to
our calling, alwaies prouided these two
rules:
<list>
                     <item>1. That it bee with condition of Gods
will, and pleasure.</item>
                     <item>2. That the end bee to serue God, and
our neighbours by them and with them.
See Iames 4. 3.</item>

               </p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> To teach vs, that wee must not

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> No? how then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Euery man is to vse such honest
meanes as he may eate the laboures of his
owne hands, and nothing to bee found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
vs, for our selues or oures, but that we
haue good right vnto, and we may truely
call our owne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What then doe wee praye for
here?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In calling for our bread we pray:
<list>
                     <item>1. That we may be contented with that
portion which the Lord giueth vs.</item>
                     <item>2. That we may not bereaue any of that
which is theirs.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How doth that follow vpon this
word <hi>our?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It must needes follow, because that
which is another mans, is not ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But by your leaue many do racke
and robbe, and pull from other men
their right, and yet say this prayer too?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, it is too true, but they say
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:17179:84"/>
it to their owne condemnation. For their
own tongues haue giuen sentence against
themselues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But many will seeme to doe it by
law, &amp; then it is well enough, is it not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, and it may bee by such a lawe
too as the Iewes put Christ to death by,
and that was a law of their owne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Can you name any whome this

to consider of?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Whether that which they get in this

               <p>

by Gods ordinance and allowance, hee
may goe in, lie downe, and eate, &amp;c. with

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why? its conscience such a matter?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, a good conscience (saith the
scripture) <hi>Is a continuall feast,</hi> Prou. 15. 15.
and it is that which makes a little so sweet
to the children of God.</p>

               <p>

wee want our dayly bread, our sinnes are
the cause, for when sinne entred into the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17179:90"/>
worlde, the curse entred. See these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

to doe away our sinnes, and not to deale
with vs in iudgement, for sinne is the stop
of Gods blessings, and when our sinnes
are remoued, then is there a way made for
daily bread.</p>

is the cause.</item>
                  <item>2. That when we want any temporall

of sinne, and of some speciall sinne
that God is angry with, which hath depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

A. <hi>By the testimonie of the Scripture,

hearts, let vs now feare the Lord our God,
that giueth raine, both early and late in due

weekes of the haruest, 25. Yet your iniquities
haue turned away these things, &amp; your sinnes
haue hindred good things from you.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> I conclude, that therefore it is very

may be satisfied.</p>

also sayd it was not lawfull to put it into

not a satisfaction for Iudas his sinne, for
to shew that his money did him no good,

money, and therefore ought to restore
it againe.</item>
                        <item>2. If hee had come by it lawfully, yet

againe, for hee went presently and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himselfe.</item>
                        <item>3. The Iewes did not take him for a
traitour, or an offender in that hee did, for
if they had, it is like his money would not
haue saued him from their censure and
iudgement: nay they were as deepe in the
sinne as he was.</item>
                        <item>4. When they had his money againe,
it was not lawfull to cast it away, being of

                  <p>

the name of Iesus, and the signe of the

of Iesus, hee would not haue tempted the
Lorde Iesus himselfe: and how little the
diuell feared the name of Iesus appeareth
more largely and fully in Act. 19. 13. 14.
15. 16. by those vagabonds which tooke
vpon them to vse his name without any

of the worde, he gaue them those bables
to play withall, and made them beleeue
that he was afraid of them.</p>
