            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SO many and ſo various have been the Relations and Reports, concerning the finding and diſpoſing of the Crucifix <hi>and</hi> Gold-Chain of St. Edward the King and Confeſſor, and thoſe ſo fabulous and uncertain withall; That in Honour to Truth, to diſabuſe the miſinform'd World, and to ſatisfy the curioſity as well as importunity of my Friends, I think my ſelf under an
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61866:4"/>
Obligation to ſet forth this plain Narrative of the matter of Fact, from whom all others (tho' never ſo Erroenous) pretend to have it. In order thereunto (to avoid confuſion, prolixity, and what is worſe, Tedious Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and digreſſions) I ſhall take this ſhort Method to perform it.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I ſhall give an account of ſome things previous (or what went before) in order to the diſcovery.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the deſcription of the place it ſelf from whence theſe things were taken.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the manner of finding and ſecuring the ſame, the diſpoſing thereof, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to his preſent Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, an Exact deſcription of the ſaid <hi>Crucifix</hi> and <hi>Chain</hi> with other dependencies thereon.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, Some material Remarks, and Hiſtorical Obſervations on the whole. For the firſt, you are to underſtand that behind the High-Altar or back of the Communion-Table, in the <hi>Abby Church</hi> of St. <hi>Peters-Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> there are two doors, one on the right
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61866:4"/>
and the other on the left hand, and both leading into a ſmall Chappel, Dedicated to St. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the King and Confeſſor,</hi> and till this day known by that name, tho' ſometimes (by reaſon many Kings and Queens of this Realm have been Interr'd therein) call d <hi>the Chappel of the Kings.</hi> Into this Chappel and thorough one of thoſe doors it is that when the Solemnity of our Kings and Queens <hi>Inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations or Coronations</hi> are perform'd in this Church, that they withdraw after the Unction, Benediction, and other Ceremonies are paſſed at the High-Altar, where they not only repoſe themſelves for a time, but are diſmantled of their former Princely Robes and Accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to be re-inveſted with more Noble, more Stately, and thoſe of greater Grandeur and Magnificence: <hi>The Arch-Biſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, the Lord High-Chamberlain of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the Dean of Westminſter</hi> officiating; on which occaſion ſeveral Boards, Scaffolding, Traverſes, Tables, and other cumberſome materials are there ſet up, covered and adorned with coſtly Tapeſtry and other rich furniture;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61866:5"/>
All which (as heretofore) was likewiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the Solemn and Happy Coronation of our Royal Sovereign his preſent Majeſty, <hi>King James the Second,</hi> and his moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Conſort our Gracious <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> whom God grant long and happily to Reign here, and Eternally in Glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of the aforeſaid <hi>Chappel of</hi> St. <hi>Edward</hi> there is a very lofty and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tomb ſtill remaining, built after the manner of a Shrine, and for which intent it was erected by King <hi>Henry the Third.</hi> The Baſe (placed on a very curious floor, inlade with all ſorts of fine coloured Agats and Marbles) raiſes it ſelf about ſix or Seven foot from the Pavement, ſupported at each corner by twiſted or Serpentine Pillars, and the whole Compoſure of <hi>Moſaick Work.</hi> (Tho' of late much injured and defaced by picking out the coloured Glaſs and Stones) On the North and South-ſide hereof are three Niches or Arches, with one at the Eaſt-end, ſo ordered and contrived that the Sick and Infirm might here repoſe without
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61866:5"/>
offence or injury to each other: On this, as a pedeſtal, (for it is ſolid throughout) is a more Sumptuous <hi>Cabinet or Repoſitory</hi> made of Wainſcot hollow within, (and formerly covered with plates of Gold and Silver with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out) but at preſent nothing remains but the <hi>Wooden-frame or Casket</hi> only. Within this Hollow place or Caverne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it was that I have often obſerved (by the help of a Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) ſomething reſembling a <hi>Coffin</hi> made of ſound, firm, and ſtrong Wood, and bound about with bands of Iron, and during the Eighteen years I have belonged to the Quire of this Church, it was a common Tradition among us that therein were depoſited the Body or Remains of <hi>Holy King Edward the Confeſſor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it happen'd not long after the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Preſent Majeſties, that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Coffin or Cheſt</hi> was found to be broke, and an hole made upon the upper Lid thereof, over againſt the Right Breaſt, about ſix Inches long and four broad, ſome eſteeming it an Accident, (thro' the Careleſneſs and Neglect of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61866:6"/>
in removing the Scaffolds) others thought it done out of Deſign; but be it the one or the other, thus it continued for almoſt ſeven Weeks, and often viewed by divers of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was my good Fortune to go thither; <note place="margin">☞</note>when (on <hi>St. Barnaby</hi>'s <hi>Day,</hi> In the Year of our Lords Incarnation <hi>One Thouſand Six Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Eighty and Five)</hi> I met with two Friends, (between Eleven and Twelve of the Clock after Morning Service) who told me they were going to ſee the Tombs, ſo I went along with them, Informing them that there was a Report that the <hi>Coffin</hi> of St. <hi>Edward the King and Confeſſor</hi> was broke; and coming to the place, I was deſirous to be ſatisfied of the Truth thereof: In order thereunto, I fetched a Ladder, lookt upon the <hi>Coffin,</hi> and found all things anſwerable to the Report; And putting my hand into the hole, and turning the Bones (which I felt there) I drew from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Shoulder-Bones a <hi>Crucifix</hi> richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned and enamelled, and a <hi>Gold Chain</hi> of four and twenty Inches long, unto which it was affixed, the which I immediately ſhew'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61866:6"/>
to my two Friends, they being as much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized and equally admired the ſame as my ſelf. But I was afraid to take them away wirh me, 'till ſuch time I had acquainted the <hi>Dean,</hi> as the <hi>Governour</hi> and Chief <hi>Director</hi> of our Church; And thereupon I put them into the <hi>Coffin</hi> again, with a full Reſolution to inform him. But the <hi>Dean</hi> not being to be ſpoke with at that time, and fearing this <hi>Holy Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> might be taken thence by ſome other Perſons, and ſo concealed by converting it to their own uſe, I went (about two or three hours after) to one of the Quire, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with what I had found, who immediately accompanied me back to the <hi>Monument,</hi> and from whence I again drew the aforeſaid <hi>Crucifix and Chain`</hi> and ſhew'd them him who beheld them with admiration, preſently adviſing me to keep them 'till I ſhould gain an opportunity to ſhew them to the <hi>Biſhop of Rocheſter</hi> our <hi>Dean;</hi> ſo I kept them for the ſpace of three Weeks and five days, as having no opportunity in all that time to ſpeak with him, by reaſon of his

            <p>Once more <hi>this Sacred Body was removed</hi> from it's Old Habitation and Repoſe, and that was about the Year of Grace, 1226.

on the back-ſide of the High Altar) at this day. In the midſt of this Chappell there was likewiſe prepared <hi>a Noble and Magnificent Shrine, the upper part covered with Plates of fine Gold,</hi> ſo Artificially workt by the hands of the moſt cunning Goldſmiths, and ſet about with Precious Stones (all at the Kings coſt) that it amounted to an ineſtimable value: but the under-part (with the curious floor round about it) was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the command, and at the charge of <hi>Richard de Ware</hi> the then <hi>Abbot of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> with a part of thoſe Stones, and by the ſame Workmen who compos'd the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the High Altar; and which he brought out of <hi>Italy</hi> in his way to <hi>England,</hi> when he came to the Government of this Abby. <hi>The King</hi> likewiſe <hi>commanded a Coffin to be made</hi>

Action, on that day, the King made <hi>a moſt Royal &amp; Magnificent Feaſt at his Palace at Weſtminſter,</hi> where all comers and goers, as well Rich as Poor, were liberally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> treated or rewarded.
