         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Plea for Moderation
TOWARDS
DISSENTERS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AMongſt the many <hi>Stratagems</hi> Satan has invented and
made uſe of to hinder the <hi>progreſs</hi> of <hi>True Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
his engaging ſome <hi>Pretenders</hi> to it, to appear
extreamly concern'd and zealous about <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nneceſſary
Rites and Ceremonies,</hi> has not been the leaſt <hi>fatal.</hi>
For by advancing this <hi>Point,</hi> he hath induced many
carnal, vicious, and ſenſual men to embrace this <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> with
(as it is very probable) a particular deſign to ſupplant its <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is undeniably evident, that the <hi>Primitive ſtrict Diſcipline</hi> of the
Church, with relation to <hi>Manners,</hi> did decay anſwerably to
the proportion of warmth, and zeal, men were allowed to lay
out about <hi>little Indifferences.</hi> And when the Church was ſo far cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
as to buſie her ſelf mainly with making and executing
ſuch <hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> as did only relate to ſome <hi>external</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
Circumſtances,</hi> ſhe did apparently decline the vigorous
proſecuting thoſe things in which <hi>Religion</hi> doth indeed conſiſt.</p>
            <p>And I am perſwaded, one of the Principal things which hath
hindred good men from an univerſal concurrence, in obſerving the
ſame <hi>Orders</hi> about <hi>Indifferent things,</hi> is their obſerving that by this
means, that ſtrictneſs of practice, and holineſs of converſation,
which ſhould moſt of all be minded, was in a great meaſure neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
and almoſt decry'd as a <hi>needleſs ſingularity</hi> and <hi>preciſeneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99767:3"/>
It is certain this did open a very wide door for thoſe to enter
into the Communion of the Church, and prevailed very much for
the continuing of them in that Communion, and for the having of
them <hi>incouraged</hi> and <hi>careſt,</hi> whoſe vicious courſes made <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
evil spoken</hi> of by <hi>Strangers;</hi> and who according to the <hi>Ancient
Rules and Canons</hi> of the Church, ſhould have had the Cenſures of
the Church inflicted on them, to the caſting them out of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
not any more to be admitted, without giving extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
evidences and demonſtration of their being brought to better
minds.</p>
            <p>And this ſort of People having thus inſinuated themſelves into
the Church, did ſoon obtain ſo great an intereſt, as to alter the
very <hi>Deſign, Intention</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of thoſe <hi>Inſtances</hi> which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by Chriſt Himſelf. They procured ſuch <hi>Reſtrictions</hi> to be
laid on Peoples communicating in <hi>Divine Ordinances,</hi> that whereas
before none were to communicate, but ſuch as had in the courſe
of their lives given good evidence that they <hi>feared God, and worked
Righteouſneſs,</hi> now none muſt communicate but only thoſe who
would obſerve ſuch <hi>Outward Orders, Humane Conſtitutions, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
Rites.</hi> And whereas anciently the Cenſures of the Church,
eſpecially <hi>Excommunication,</hi> was not inflicted on any, unleſs they
were <hi>ſtubborn oppoſers</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> or were guilty of ſome
<hi>great Immorality</hi> in their Practice, they had now brought the
Chriſtian Religion to conſiſt mainly in two Points, viz. <hi>Dignity</hi> and
<hi>Outward Rites,</hi> and conſequently the Cenſures of the Church were
inflicted principally for peoples not being implicitely and blindly
obedient.</p>
            <p>There was now nothing known to be <hi>diſorderly walking,</hi> but not
obſerving <hi>appointed Rites;</hi> nor no <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> but when people
would not own their Authority in every thing they injoyn'd. And
then men might be as vicious as they pleas'd, <hi>ſwear,</hi> and be
<hi>drunk,</hi> and commit all manner of <hi>lewdneſs,</hi> and yet be admirable
<hi>Zealous Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe they were for the Church. But if a
man were ever ſo pious, ſtrict, chaſt, and every way truly Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
yet if he would not pay them every Groat they did unjuſtly
demand, or would not obſerve every Ceremony they did injoyn,
they preſently ſummon'd him, and if he would not then yield a
blind obedience to their Order, they forthwith gave him to the
Devil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99767:3"/>
Men, tho extreamly vicious, yet having not worn away all ſenſe
of Religion, are willing to ſtrike in with that way, which has moſt
publick countenance, eſpecially if they perceive that ſome <hi>Outward
Formalities</hi> are by that part moſt <hi>Rigidly</hi> inſiſted on, and that by
ſhewing a great zeal for theſe things they may both <hi>ſatisfie</hi> for
their <hi>other Immoralities,</hi> and be reputed, according to <hi>common
Vogue,</hi> Religious to a <hi>High Degree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And no wonder then, if ſuch as theſe do in any Age give out
themſelves for the only Sons of the Church, when they find the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of theſe outward Ceremonies is very conſiſtent with the
Luſts and Vices they are moſt fond of, and that much profit will
accrue, by proſecuting others who are not ſatisfied in theſe
things,<note place="margin">Dr <hi>Stilling.</hi> Pref. to his Iren.</note> and whoſe exemplary lives are a reproach
and ſhame to them. <q>Men being very loath to put
themſelves to the trouble of a Holy life, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ready to embrace any thing, which may but diſpence with
that; and if but liſting themſelves under ſuch a Party may but
ſhelter them under a diſguiſe of Religion, none more ready than
ſuch to be known by diſtinguiſhing Names, none more zealous in
the defence of every Tittle and Punctilio that lies moſt remote
from thoſe eſſential Duties wherein the Kingdom of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts,
<hi>viz.</hi> Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But that Church is undoubtedly under very unhappy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
which cannot have any owned for her Children, who will
not imitate the worſt of men in their groundleſs zeal, their inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
barbarity, and their deteſtable and moſt enormous Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
And as I have hitherto been ſpeaking of what has been done
in former Ages, ſo I will adventure to ſay at preſent concerning
pretenders to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> if there be any who go under
this Character, who would willingly bring this Church under the
ſame unhappy Circumſtances I have before mentioned, they are
the greateſt Enemies ſhe can poſſibly have.</p>
            <p>As Satan has proved too ſucceſsful formerly, in endeavouring to
fill the Church with wicked ſuperſtitious men, ſo he has done
himſelf great, ſervice, by inſtigating people to force others to
comply in the uſe of <hi>needleſs Rites,</hi> by great and preſſing <hi>Penalties.</hi>
For this hath proved a very powerful Expedient to advance two
of thoſe Deſigns he doth principally endeavour to have furthered
in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99767:4"/>
1. It yields a very plauſible pretence, under which wicked
men may vent their wrath, and envy, and malice. For tho theſe
Bigots talk of the Church and Religion, yet they give too much
evidence in their carriage, that what they do is the Fruit of that
Rancour they have long cheriſhed in their Breaſts, and which
has quite Cankered their Spirits. The pretences theſe men do
make, are but Colours under which they may more decorouſly
vent their venom and malignity.</p>
            <p>2. It tends much to the utter extirpating of that Love, and
Charity, and Meekneſs, which are commended by Chriſt and his
Apoſtles as the <hi>Vital Parts,</hi> the Honor and Glory of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion.</p>
            <p>Satan has created the Church much trouble by cauſing Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
amongſt Chriſtians. Sometimes he has ſuggeſted <hi>Errors</hi> and
<hi>Falſe Doctrines</hi> to ſome who have profeſſed Chriſtianity, and then
has irritated them to make Parties, and adhere reſolutely to
thoſe <hi>Tenets</hi> againſt all the Demonſtrations the <hi>Orthodox</hi> could
give them both of the falſeneſs of their <hi>Opinions,</hi> and how perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
they would be in their <hi>Conſequences.</hi> But I think he has done
Religion more Diſſervice by hurrying men into <hi>undue</hi> and <hi>peeviſh
Heats</hi> about <hi>Humane Devices,</hi> than he has been able to do, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigating
men to broach and publiſh ſuch Doctrines as have had an
immediate plain and direct tendency to overthrow Chriſtianity.
For under a pretence of the Innocency of theſe former Inſtances,
and the great Benefit ſome pious men have concluded would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from the uſe of them, and the plauſible Arguments they
might eaſily urge for them, he has firſt of all prevailed with men
to lay out too much of their Zeal about theſe things, and then
by degrees has gone ſo far, as to obtain thoſe very Inſtances,
which were at firſt deſigned by good men to be uſed only as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
and <hi>Comely Ceremonies,</hi> to be taught and injoyned as <hi>Doctrines
of Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have too many Inſtances of this in the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> I
will mention but one. There is no great doubt to be made, but
that the primary deſign of thoſe who firſt brought <hi>Pictures</hi> and
<hi>Images</hi> into Churches, was innocent; but theſe had not been long
there, before Satan corrupted mens minds, and drew them to
pay them a Divine and Religious Worſhip. Yea he prevailed with
the Leading and Governing part of the Church to eſpouſe that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99767:4"/>
Cauſe ſo heartily, the did contend and declare that Images not
only ought to be ſet up, but to be worſhipped.</p>
            <p>Every man who hath taken any tollerable notice of the Hiſtory
of former times, muſt certainly know the Church of Chriſt has
been often very miſerably torn and rent, and divided, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Indifferent Ceremonies. Some have ſtubbornly refuſed
to comply in the uſe of thoſe Rites for which others have had an
extraordinary kindneſs, and theſe being impatient of that Denial,
have been too fierce and rigorous in impoſing what they have
ſaid they did believe would be very uſeful.</p>
            <p>And what has been juſt matter of complaint in former Ages,
is thorough the Craft of Satan, and wicked Hypocriſie of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
men, a more than ordinary ground of <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Trouble</hi> to
this <hi>preſent Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We who profeſs our ſelves Proteſtants, have ſtood a great
while at ſome diſtance, and of late our Difference has been excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
heightened, nay it is to be feared many attempts have been
made by ſome ſort of People, to render us wholly unreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>This is the more Deplorable, and has a more Direful Aſpect,
becauſe we do on both ſides lie under more then ordinary ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to unite as ſpeedily and firmly as we can. Beſides the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and tendency of our Religion, and all that excellent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
Chriſtianity doth make to keep its Profeſſors from Jars
and unſeemly Quarrels, making Meekneſs, and Peace and Love,
and Condeſcention, and mutual Forbearance, ſome of its Vital
Parts. Beſides this, and all the ordinary inducements to Union, we
are now in a very audible and viſible manner called on, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned
to do all we can on each ſide to unite. <hi>We muſt either unite, or
we muſt periſh.</hi> It is high time to leave off inſiſting on little <hi>pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilio's</hi>
of Honour; we ought duly to weigh our circumſtances,
and the nature of the things we Contend about, and if our Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
be <hi>unmeaſurably great,</hi> and the things we differ about ſuch
as will not bear ſo great a weight, as the <hi>loſs</hi> of our <hi>Religion</hi> and
<hi>all our Rights,</hi> we muſt yield ſomething on either ſide, and that
ſide muſt be willing to part with moſt, that can do it with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
eaſe, and moſt innocence.</p>
            <p>Many eminent perſons have imploy'd their thoughts to find
out Expedients by which our Common Enemy, the Papiſts, may be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99767:5"/>
hindred from getting ſo much advantage by our Differences as
they expect. No doubt the Papiſts have had a great influence in
increaſing our Diviſions. They have been Induſtrious in labouring
to exaſperate men, and work their Paſſions beyond all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Moderation. Nay tho ſome of our <hi>Make-bates,</hi> who
do wholly imploy their Talents to widen our Differences, do
pretend to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> I am verily perſwaded they are
either <hi>Real Papiſts,</hi> of very <hi>Miſchievous Inſtruments</hi> in <hi>Popiſh hands,</hi>
to effect and bring about the <hi>common Ruine of Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The weakening of the Proteſtant Cauſe, be it under what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
ſoever, is undoubtedly very ſerviceable to the Papiſts; and
whether this be done, by keeping up mutual Animoſities and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
amongſt us, to the weakening and impairing the ſtrength
of both ſides, or by irritating the ſuperior and prevailing part
to ſqueeze and ſubdue the other by their power and might, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
acceptable to them. This latter cuts off that ſupply the
ſtronger part would undoubtedly have from the other, when aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
by the <hi>Common Enemy.</hi> It is Policy in the Papiſts to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
ſome of their own Party to counterfeit, and feign, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
themſelves of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and then ingage them
and others under that pretence to endeavour the ruine of thoſe
they call <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> not only becauſe they hate them, but becauſe
they know that having done thus, they ſhall be more ſucceſsful
in attempting the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, they are certain, if they can make us the <hi>Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
of their <hi>Rage</hi> againſt <hi>our fellow Proteſtants,</hi> they ſhall be better
able to grapple with, and <hi>execute</hi> their <hi>own wrath</hi> on the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> when ſingle and <hi>by Her ſelf.</hi> He that incouraged the two
Countrymen in their Quarrel, and provoked them to fight with
one another, till they were both abſolutely tired, and when
they were thus wearied, did murder them both, would no doubt
have taken his <hi>Revenge</hi> on the <hi>Survivor,</hi> if one of them had killed
the other.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the many Methods and Expedients found out for
effecting a firm and laſting Union amongſt Proteſtants, I think
Dr. <hi>Stilling-fleet</hi> in his early years did hit on a very clear and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
one, if it might be univerſally attended to, and
countenanced by thoſe in power.<note place="margin">Ireni<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Moderation is not only a Chriſtian Duty, but a peculiar Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

therefore thoſe who do labour to repreſent the <hi>Church of England</hi>

The ordinary matters, in diſpute between us and other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
are not of that <hi>Moment</hi> we ſhould be ſo zealous and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
about them. Chriſtian love and charity muſt not be loſt
and thrown away for ſuch things. Indeed where theſe are in
any conſiderable Degree, they will do very much to allay and
quench thoſe Heats, into which paſſionate and inconſiderate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are too apt to be unduly hurried.</p>
            <p>We have at this time greater things which call for our zeal
and concern to be imployd about: And the dangers we are in of
loſing them ſhould mightily operate on us, and make us cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
leſt by any unſuitable carriage we ſhould be any way inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to make that <hi>breach wider,</hi> through which <hi>Popery</hi> is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
labouring to thruſt her ſelf in amongſt us. The great and

And therefore whilſt in danger of having ſuch <hi>Innovations</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99767:6"/>
It is true and pure Chriſtianity we muſt mainly diſcover our
Zeal for; and for other matters we muſt reduce them to their
proper Sphere and place, and allow them no more of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Zeal, than in their own nature they deſerve, and the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the Church doth call for. Our Saviour lays no ſtreſs on
any thing but Real Practical Religion; he does rather Caution us
againſt too much Zeal about <hi>Mint and Cummin</hi> (leſt this ſhould
eat up the heart and life, and ſpirit of our Devotion) than
oblige us to a particular and eminent diſcovery to great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
warmth about thoſe things in which Real Religion is
not immediately concerned.</p>
            <p>We find the Apoſtles upon mature deliberation, and when
they had the immediate aſſiſtance and guidance of the Spirit,
would lay no more on the Diſciples, than what was then Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And it would be no difficult thing to ſhew that they were not
Rigid towards thoſe who did omit, and even refuſe, afterwards
to obſerve ſome of thoſe Injunctions they concluded neceſſary to
be obſerved in that Juncture of Affairs, when they made that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</p>
            <p>I know ſome do inſiſt very much on this Queſtion, Whether the
Apoſtles had not power to determine Indifferent Ceremonies,
ſo as to oblige the Church in her ſeveral Adminiſtrations to
the uſe of ſome, and to forbear the uſe of all others; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
if any Profeſſors of Chriſtianity ſhould obſtinately have
refuſed to comply with thoſe Orders, the Apoſtles might not
innocently and juſtly have Excommunicated them for their
Contempt?</p>
            <p>Such kind of Queſtions as theſe are very unneceſſary, and I
am affraid thoſe who are ſo frequent in propoſing theſe things
in Company, as ſome in the world are, have a deſign to trepan
and inſnare the unwary. I will ſay no more to this Point at
preſent than</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> Firſt of all, That I believe the Apoſtles had as much Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Power, as any of thoſe have who pretend to be their
Succeſſors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> That they had ſo great a meaſure of Divine Grace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
of them, as did effectually reſtrain them from uſing
their Authority arbitrarily, or in an inordinate and hurtful
way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:99767:7"/>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> They never made uſe of their Power, that we read of,
about theſe indifferent and unneceſſary points. And therefore
whether they would have proceeded to ſuch Cenſures as ſome
talk of, if they had appointed any number of Rites, and had
not been obeyed, is not evident enough, to convince and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
inquiſitive men.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion lies mainly here, Whether if they had exerted this
Power, without Divine Direction, they would have reſented
every thing, Imperious and Haughty men have in after Ages
called Contempts, with the ſame paſſion they have done? 'Tis
plain they thought it, if not more Chriſtian, yet more prudent,
to forbear laying Snairs in peoples way, and choſe rather to
ſuſpend the exerciſe of their Authority about theſe things, than
to make any unſeaſonable uſe of it, and than vindicate it by ſo
ſevere a courſe, as their delivering men unto Satan did amount
to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> I think it will be very difficult for any man to make it
appear, that for ſome hundreds of years after the Apoſtles, the
Chriſtian Orthodox Church did ever require any thing more
than common Chriſtianity as a Term of Church-Communion.
Or that any Ceremony was for ſo long a time impoſed on the
Church.</p>
            <p>This is not deſigned in the leaſt to reflect on the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> or to expect againſt any of Her Orders; it is deſigned
only to ſhew,</p>
            <p>1. That neither Chriſtianity in the general, nor the Being
of a particular Church, is concerned in our Diſpute; and
that therefore, conſidering our preſent Circumſtances, there is
no need of diſcovering ſuch immoderate heat in this buſineſs,
as ſome men do manifeſt, and expect that all who pretend to
the Church ſhould approve.</p>
            <p>2. That ſome of thoſe who do diſſent from
us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jacobus Acontius</hi> is of the opinion, that God doth not allow the Church to uſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere courſes, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Hereticks, leſt theſe, when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the power and government, ſhould treat the <hi>Orthodox</hi> in the ſame manner. His <hi>Stratag. Satan.</hi> and the Book called the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and thoſe Tracts called, <hi>The Conformiſts Plea for the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts,</hi> which do all ſavour of a moſt <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> moderate, and Healing Spirit, do particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be read, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and conſidered, over and over again, by thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſuffer their haſty and paſſionate Tempers to have their whole ſwinge. Theſe would do them much more real Service, if attended to, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved, than thoſe trivial ſcraps of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per can, which they do weekly dote upon, and which at beſt can only furniſh them with a few jejune, puerile, and nauſeous Notices, and for the moſt part do impoſe on their beliefe the moſt ſcandalous and enormous untruths.</note> may have more plauſible pretences for what
they do, than ſome, who are inconſiderately
furious againſt them, do imagin.</p>
            <p>But allowing that there may ſomtimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
ſuch caſes, that the Church may, and ought
to proceed to great ſeverity with ſome offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
we cannot reaſonably conclude hence,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99767:7"/>
that every difference about outward Rites and
Ceremonies, eſpecially if managed with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and other Chriſtian Virtues, by thoſe who
do diſſent, muſt be treated and proſecuted in
that manner. This would be to make the
Church tranſcribe that Quack's folly, who
perceiving a skilful Chyrurgeon had ſaved a
mans life, and done him great ſervice by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off his Legg, when deſperately gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green'd,
did adviſe one who was troubled with
the Head-ach to have his Head cut off. The
ſame Medecine will not cure every Diſeaſe,
nor may the ſame Remedy be applied to every
part.</p>
            <p>Moderation in theſe leſſer things is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
very deſirable; it may do the Church great
ſervice. And whilſt we are not obliged by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Law to proſecute and ruine thoſe who are
not of our Judgment in theſe things, either
unneceſſarily to turn Informers our ſelves, or
to wheedle or threaten others into ſuch Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
is very unbecoming any who profeſs they
have a deſire to befriend the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<hi>in this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> is undoubtedly a
very ſtrong, and would be (if it were not for
theſe violent and headſtrong Bigots, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
the ruining the Proteſtant Religion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a glorious name and pretence) an Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Bulwark againſt Popery. But ſhe is not
ſo by her injoyning any Ceremonies, in which
point ſhe and other Proteſtants do difler, but
in her cloſe and immovable adhering to thoſe Doctrines and
Practices which are common to us, with the generality of our
ſober and only ſcrupulous Diſſenters, and which are directly
contrary to and deſtructive of Popery.</p>
            <p>I dare affirm, That if the Rites and Ceremonies now in uſe
in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be altered, ſome chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and ſome laid wholly aſide, by the ſame Authority which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99767:8"/>
did at firſt injoyn them, the Church of <hi>England</hi> would ſtill
be as Impregnable a Bulwark againſt Popery, as now ſhe is.
And I am fully ſatisfied there is no man will deny this, unleſs
he be either a Real Papiſt, or an Ignorant Superſtitious Fool.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all that may be alledged, why we ſhould be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of dealing harſhly with thoſe who differ from us in theſe
things, and againſt whom we have nothing elſe to except. For
the very Conſideration of the Fruit and Effect the continued
impoſing of theſe things has had on many, ſhould both abate
our vehemence againſt Diſſenters, and make us generally more
inclinable to deſire that ſome Abatements might be <hi>legally</hi> made
in theſe things, for the ſatisfying of thoſe, who ſtill remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>There are two dreadful Events, which have followed theſe
Impoſitions.</p>
            <p>1. Many worthy, pious, and otherwiſe every way qualified
Perſons, have been hindred from either entering or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Lords Vineyard, to labour and work publickly there.</p>
            <p>2. The conſtant impoſed uſe of theſe things hath almoſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
begot in the minds of ignorant and vulgar people, a
belief that they are indiſpenſably neceſſary, and undoubted parts
of thoſe Ordinances to which they are annexed. I have known
ſeveral who would as willingly have had their Children and
Relations not baptized at all, as not to have the Sign of the
Croſs added. And this, not becauſe it is required by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but becauſe (as they have profeſſedly and openly owned)
they thought the Baptiſm not good and valid without it. Nay
I have known when many Arguments would not ſatisfie people,
that private Baptiſm without the Croſs (and I know not how
any man can juſtifie the uſe of the Croſs in that caſe) was ſound
and true Baptiſm, tho they have profeſſed they did believe the
Child could not live half an hour. And in ſuch caſes the Sign
of the Croſs is I think at leaſt <hi>Contradictio in Adjecto.</hi> And ſome
of theſe were ſuch I ſhould ſcarce have believed had been ſo
ignorant or ſuperſtitious, if I had not had a particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it.</p>
            <p>And however both theſe Effects might happen directly contrary
to the primary deſign in appointing them, yet when theſe
Fruits do apparently ſpring from thence, whether naturally or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99767:8"/>
only by accident, they may be enough to make thoſe who
have the greateſt zeal for the power of godlineſs, deſire that
no more ſtreſs may be laid on theſe things, than their own
Nature will bear.</p>
            <p>For notwithſtanding all the caution the Church hath uſed to
prevent theſe ill Effects, by declaring her own deſign, and
the true uſe and importance of theſe things, that has not been
univerſally effectual to anſwer her Deſign. Neither her Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks,
her Canons, no nor the Admonitions of her Clergy,
have been ſo effectual to prevent miſtakes and falſe conceptions
about theſe things, as the conſtant, uninterrupted, and Injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
uſe and practice of them, has been to ingender and create
them in ſome mens minds. Nor is it altogether improbable,
but more minds would have been leavened with ſuch falſe Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as thoſe mentioned before, if theſe things had been univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
ſubmitted to, and the conteſts and differences about them had
not awakened people to conſider them more diſtinctly, and get
themſelves acquainted with the proper deſign and true uſe of
them.</p>
            <p>Nor have I only obſerved, that ſome do miſunderſtand the
Church in injoyning the uſe of theſe Ceremonies, by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
knowledge I have had of their laying too much ſtreſs
on theſe things, and looking on them as aſſential parts of
Ordinances, but I am inclined to think that many others are
ſenſible what kind of thoughts ſome pretenders to our Church
have of theſe things. And this from the Reaſons ſome active
men gave, why they would not yield to any alteration, when
that admirable Project of uniting us was on foot, and was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by thoſe eminent and glorious Members of this Church,
Lord Keeper <hi>Bridgeman,</hi> Sir <hi>Matthew Hale,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wilkins,</hi>
afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> One reaſon why
ſome zealous Clergymen would not yield was,<note place="margin">Life of Sir <hi>Math. Hale.</hi> p. 43.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<q>many ſuch Conceſſions might alſo ſhake thoſe
of our own Communion, and tempt them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
us, and go over to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> pretending that we
changed ſo often, that they were thereby inclined to be of
a Church that was conſtant and true to her ſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am for my own part well enough ſatisfied of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the ſeveral things required, but I ſee not any reaſon
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99767:9"/>
why I ſhould be angry with others, becauſe the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which do Convince me, have not the ſame influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on them. There are ſeveral Arguments made uſe of
to commend Conformity in theſe things, and to prove the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of them, as now in uſe; but they have not all that
force and power on me, that ſome of them have. And it
may be thoſe Arguments which ſway moſt with me, are not
ſo prevalent with others as ſome of the reſt, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſcern to be ſo concluding. Now as it would be very
abſurd and ridiculous, if I and another, who are full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts,
ſhould quarrel, becauſe we are not equally affected
with the ſame Arguments; ſo it would be very unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
according to that meaſure of light I enjoy, if I ſhould
be teſty with, and fierce againſt another, becauſe he is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
in this unneceſſary point by any of the Arguments I
can alledge for it.</p>
            <p>The Church has ſaid a great deal to ſignifie her own ſenſe
of theſe things, and to acquaint the world how innocent her
deſign is in the uſe of them; but ſeeing this declaration has
not been of force to open ſome mens eyes, or to remove their
ſcruples, 'tis certain the removing ſome of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
which are moſt inſiſted on, and ſcrupled by Diſſenters,
would more effectually convince them (if Authority ſhould ſee
fit to try that Expedient) how Indifferent ſhe doth eſteem them.
This brings to my Remembrance that Apologue <hi>Beza</hi> made
uſe of, after <hi>Grindal</hi> had acquainted him with the import of
the Rubrick which was deſigned to prevent thoſe ill Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi>Beza</hi> did ſuſpect. The Apologue was very much to this
purpoſe, A certain Nobleman having finiſhed his Houſe, did ſuffer
a very great ſtone he had no occaſion for to lie before the houſe,
at this ſtone People did very often ſtumble, when they walked
that way in the dark, which occaſioned ſome Complaints; the
Nobleman would not ſuffer it to be taken away, but ordered
a Lanthorn ſhould be hung over it. This not effectually ſecuring
People from the inconveniences which happened by its ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there, the Nobleman was at laſt intreated to remove both
the ſtone and the Lanthorn, by doing of which he would both eaſe
himſelf of much Trouble, and do the People good Service.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid thus much in general, by way of Plea for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99767:9"/>
towards ſome who do diſſent from the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> I will add ſomething more particularly, being as it
were loudly and earneſtly called to it, both by the <hi>Dorcetſhires</hi>
Grand Jury's preſenting, at the laſt Aſſizes holden at <hi>Sherburne,
my Sermon againſt Perſecution,</hi> and by the noiſe and ſtir ſome
who would be thought Great Men do make about that <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi>
in which I have ſaid but little in Compariſon of what
may truly be ſaid for ſome Diſſenters. For there I have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accidentally faln on that point, and have engaged no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than to warn ſome haſty and inconſiderate people, that
they do not raſhly and furiouſly engage in Proſecuting their
Quiet, Religious, Honeſt and Peaceable Neighbours, leſt by
ruining them on the account of ſome Differences they do not
rightly underſtand, they ſhould at laſt be found guilty of ſuch
a Sin, as cannot be expiated by the little, ſleight, and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
pretences they are at preſent inclined to urge for their
own Vindication.</p>
            <p>What I will further ſay in this matter, I intend to bring
under theſe heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> I will ſay ſomething of the matter in diſpute between
us and the Diſſenters. 2ly, I will give both a general and
particular account of the people I plead for. 3ly, I will very
briefly anſwer thoſe Objections I underſtand are ordinarily in theſe
parts raiſed againſt my Sermon. And here I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to ſhew, that the exerciſe of that Moderation I plead
for, will very well comport with True Conformity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> I will ſay ſomething of the matter in diſpute betwixt
us and the Diſſenters. I do not doubt but there are ſome
who do except againſt the Form of our Church Government,
pleading a <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> for ſome other. But I do not intend
to meddle much in this Controverſie; for I never yet found
any Argument pleaded by the ſeveral Pretenders that way,
that could fully ſatisfie and convince me of the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi>
of any one particular Form of Church Government. Very
Learned and Pious men do diſagree in this point, yea they apply
ſome of the beſt Arguments they can joyntly agree in for
the evidencing of what they aſſert, with great ſtrength, to
their own different ways. Nay the Learned'ſt who have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
for the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> have in their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99767:10"/>
on this Notion, ſuſpected each others Arguments, and have
therefore found out different Hypotheſes on which they would
ſuperſtruct this common Notion, and prove it undeniably to
the world. And indeed the ways they have taken to clear and
confirm this Notion, are ſome of them directly deſtructive of
others.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Hierom's</hi> Account of Original of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,<note place="margin">Vid. Hieron. Comment. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. ad Titum, <hi>v.</hi> 5.</note>
does in the Judgment of very learned men
carry a great deal of probability with it. And the
Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> has ſcarce given a full, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and ſatisfactory Anſwer to all that <hi>Blondel</hi> offers
in vindication of that Notion. No nor does Mr.

               <note place="margin">Vindication of the Primitive Churches.</note> to invalidate his Notion, render it ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
and uncooth, as he ſeems to fancy.
But allowing Dr <hi>Hammonds</hi> notion, it quite throws the Prieſthood
out of doors, and makes the middle Order a meer Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
and ſo degrades the Prieſts more than thoſe
did,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 85. ad Evag.</note> who occaſioned St <hi>Hierom's</hi> advancing them (as
ſome think) too high, and making them to differ
very little from Biſhops. The truly eminent Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> who is
equally famous for his Univerſal Learning, as for his excellent
and extraordinary Hiſtorick Talent, and who above moſt Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
is ſolid and victorious in his Reaſonings, does in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
offer the moſt plauſible account for the
<hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Epiſcopacy.<note place="margin">Prof. to his Rights of Princes.</note> But I think I ſhall
ſcarce ever be made an abſolute Proſelyte to
that Doctrine, till I ſee a more clear, full, and diſtinct Anſwer
to Dr. <hi>Stilling fleets</hi> moſt Rational and Elaborate <hi>Irenicum,</hi> than
any yet extant. And the naming of this laſt Book will be enough

            <p>Some who inſiſt very much on this <hi>Jus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum</hi>
run their Notion a great deal too far,<note place="margin">A Notion, the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſtudious <hi>Mr. Dodwell,</hi> has taken a great deal of pains about, in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Schiſm.</note>

to ſome men, unrecoverable doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99767:10"/>
all our Miniſtry, and the validity of all our Adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>There has been a great diſpute concerning the poſſibility of
perſonal aſſurance of Salvation. This Doctrine of Succeſſion will
go a great way to determine the Queſtion in the Negative.
And indeed it offers too great occaſion (if we allow the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
to queſtion the validity of moſt Miniſtrations in the world.
For, ſuppoſing that ſome were anciently made Biſhops by Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
as the moſt learned Arch-Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> durſt have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to have proved, and for a belief of which, we have
a great deal of ground from what St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith
of the Biſhops at <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grium.</note> For theſe not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their power in a Regular way, <hi>viz.</hi> not from
thoſe who had Authority and Commiſſion to Communicate and
give it, all the Ordinations they did afterwards Celebrate, will
prove null (according to this Principle); and of how vaſt and
wide an extent this might be, or how long a time this ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Communication of Orders did continue, is too difficult a
point for the moſt curious and exact Critick to reſolve. Nay,
for ought any one can tell, ſome of the Ordinations, which now
go for currant, might appear, if they could be run up to thoſe
Ages, to derive from ſome of thoſe impotent and unautho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
Biſhops.</p>
            <p>'Tis a very hard task for people to undertake to prove to
themſelves, the Adminiſtrations they partake of are valid, by
proving the valid Ordination of him who Miniſters. For, it
is not enough that one who is called a Biſhop, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
according to the Rules of a particular Church, did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
him who officiates, but you muſt prove that that Biſhop's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers,
and ſo upwards, till you come to them who were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by the Apoſtles, had every one of them a True, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
Epiſcopal Ordination. And it will be a very unſafe, tho
it may appear to be an eaſie way, to perſwade people to be
ſatisfied with a belief that the Providence of God is obliged
to maintain this Succeſſion unblemiſht in the world. For he may
do that, and yet the greateſt part of thoſe Ordinations, which
are called Epiſcopal, be notwithſtanding <hi>Invalid,</hi> becauſe of
ſome <hi>Mixture,</hi> either further diſtant, or nearer at hand.</p>
            <p>But tho this Notion obtains very much in theſe days, our great
Church-men, and thoſe who were high enough for Epiſcopacy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99767:11"/>
formerly, had other thoughts, and abhorred to ſtrain their
Opinions to countenance ſuch Uncharitableneſs, as this Notion
doth include.<note place="margin">A. B. <hi>Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's</hi> Hiſtory.</note> 
               <q>For, when ſome were to be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Biſhops for <hi>Scotland, An. Dom.</hi> 1609. Dr.
<hi>Andrews,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> propoſed a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning the Conſecration of thoſe Biſhops, Whether
they muſt not firſt be Ordained Presbyters, becauſe they had
not received Ordination from a Biſhop? But Dr. <hi>Bancroft,</hi>
Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> maintain'd there was no need of
it; for the Ordination given by Presbyters, when Biſhops
could not be had, muſt be owned lawful. And then the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Ely</hi> did acquieſce, the other Biſhops being of that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That which I deſign to take notice of, as the matter in
diſpute between us and the Diſſenters, is the Ceremonies we
uſe, and they do ſcruple. And I muſt needs ſay, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it a very great unhappineſs that ſuch Diviſions ſhould
be amongſt us, and continue ſo long, whilſt occaſioned by ſuch
things as are but trifling and frivolous, when compared with
the great things in which we agree.</p>
            <p>Tho I plead for Moderation towards thoſe who cannot come
up to us in theſe things, and that buſie intemperate People,
who lye under no obligation to interpoſe and make themſelves
Acceſlary to the cauſing of Fines and Mulcts, or heavier Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
to be inflicted on their ſober, honeſt, pious, but ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Neighbours, may not have any incouragement in their
doing thus, but may meet with thoſe Checks and Reprimands
as ſhall prove effectual to reſtrain them from that courſe;
yet I do heartily wiſh all could be fairly ſatisfied concerning the
lawfulneſs of the ſeveral things which are now appointed. But
I think much may be ſaid by Them who are ſatisfied concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
theſe things, to ſhew the great reaſonableneſs of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and tenderneſs towards them who do at preſent diſſent.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I perceive that by the ſerious and diligent uſe of
thoſe methods which are univerſally acknowledged moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with a Chriſtian Church and Miniſtry, many of thoſe
for whom I plead may be prevailed with to a conſiderable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
in a little time. For I have known ſeveral, who have
been wholly proſelyted to our Church, by the practical Sermons,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99767:11"/>
exemplary Lives, and the rational ſerious Diſcourſes of ſome
of our Clergy, and by the calm and meek Endeavours they
have uſed to ſatisfie their Judgments, and remove their Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
And I do not doubt but if theſe and the like courſes
were every where duly obſerved and incouraged, it would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
appear there is not the thouſandth part of that need
to uſe more ſevere Methods, which ſome apprehend there
is.</p>
            <p>But it is a great unhappineſs, we have ſo many who pretend
to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who are her greateſt diſgrace, and
who will not allow we make any Proſelytes to the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we do prevail with them to ſit, ordinarily ten times as
long in a Tavern or Alehouſe, as the longeſt Service appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for any day in the year, and a Sermon of near an hour long
at the end of it, will oblige them to ſtay at Church. It would
undoubtedly be a great honour to our Church, if all who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to her, would lay out the chief of their zeal for Real
Religion, and then labour to win on, and proſelyte thoſe who
do diſſent in theſe leſſer things, by condeſcending and yielding
what they may, and treating them with meekneſs and love.
<q>The very appearances of a calm temper have a Charm in
them, but the Effects of them in concurrence with other pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Methods, are moſt irreſiſtible. In ſum, it is better to be
over-run and ruined in the ways of meekneſs, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
all the world by cruelty. In the one we bear the Croſs,
and ſuffer for Righteouſneſs ſake; in the other we Triumph
in the Garments of Antichriſt, died red with the blood of
thoſe, who, tho in Errors, yet may be good
Men in the main, for ought we know.</q>
               <note place="margin">Exhortation to Peace and Union. p. 16.</note> Thus
ſpeaks the learned Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> who in all his

            <p>I might mention many things, now I am taking notice of
the great Matter in diſpute between us, which may incline ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and pious minds to diſlike all unneceſſary heat and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
towards thoſe who are not able to attain to ſo great
a Latitude in Relation to theſe things, as we are ſatisfied
with. But I will neither multiply inſtances to an irkſom num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
nor inſiſt on thoſe I ſhall name, ſo as to make them te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99767:12"/>
I will name but ſeven things, and they are ſuch as
will conduce ſomething to abate that violent and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Peeviſhneſs ſome have allowed themſelves in, if conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with that candor and equanimity which becomes every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and every man who would judge fairly of things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> It is unqueſtionably certain, that the cloſer any Church
doth keep, or the nearer ſhe approach to the firſt Churches,
in their ſimplicity, and fredom from Humane Inventions, the
more juſtifiable ſhe will be. She will be the freer from thoſe
Contagions which are too apt to prevail when way is given
to every thing that either a ſubtle man can repreſent as plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
or a pious affectionate man may apprehend uſeful.</p>
            <p>I do not plead for reducing the Church to its ancient and
primitive Poverty, nor do I in the leaſt incline to that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that there may not be ſome external difference in the Church
when under Proſperous Circumſtances, from that ſhe obſerved
when perſecuted and under ſtorms. But undoubtedly, there is
no abſolute neceſſity of making new Terms of Communion,
becauſe the outward face of Affairs is altered. The leſs there
is of Humane Inventions mixed with the Worſhip of God,
the more genuine and the liker it is to that which the Apoſtles
and Primitive Chriſtians did obſerve. Nor do we find that
outward Circumſtances were very much inſiſted on by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,
till very Conſiderable Corruptions were crept into the
Church. And tho this doth not argue or conclude againſt
the lawfulneſs of any thing the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
(for I do not urge it for that end) yet it may induce
us to have much Charity and Tenderneſs for them, who have
ſuch a regard to what was only obſerved and injoyned in the
firſt Churches, they are almoſt afraid to deviate from them,
even in ſuch particulars as are innocent and free.</p>
            <p>The firſt Churches were ſo taken up with the great, neceſſary,
and ſubſtantial Parts of Religion, they had no time to fall
out and quarrel about Indifferent, Circumſtantial Appendages.
Indeed we do not read of any contendings about theſe things
till ſome, either very ill, or very weak men, had a mind to
lay an unneceſſary and uneaſie yoke on the reſt of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
            <p>There ought to be a great deal of care taken, when ever
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99767:12"/>
any unneceſſary Inſtances are admitted ſo much as to border
on the Worſhip of God. For God is very jealous of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and we can ſcarce be too wary in giving way to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Inventions in Divine Service, becauſe our minds are
too prone to adhere over-much to what is ſenſible. Nay, we too
eaſily give more way and room to thoſe particulars which
are at firſt commended under very ſpecious, colourable, and
innocent pretences, than we can afterwards juſtifie to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
However, this is apt to lay us too open to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
inſinuations with which cunning and ſubtle men will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to commend to us other Inſtances which be directly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
But we muſt take heed not only that we yield not in
things really evil, but that we do not tranſgreſs due bounds
in the uſe of thoſe things which are Harmleſs.</p>
            <p>A very ill uſe has been made of many things
which were without doubt Originally well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;<note place="margin">Our preſent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign doth in his Declaration concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Affairs take notice, that ſome Ceremonies may even leſſen that Piety and Devotion, for the improvement whereof they might happily be firſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may well be diſpenſed with p. 4.</note>
yea, thoſe very particulars which
devout and Holy Men have found ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to them in the raiſing of their affections
to the beſt things, have been of ill Conſequence
when peremptorily injoyned on all.</p>
            <p>There ought not any thing to be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
required of all men in the Service of
God, but what has either equal agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to all mens tempers, or a direct and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
tendency to advance the intereſt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
more or leſs in all men. For, ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which are proper to excite and quicken Devotion in
ſome mens breaſts, have not the like tendency in reference
unto others; And the goodneſs of the End will not juſtifie
an Univerſal Impoſition, till you can firſt of all make all men
of one Complexion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Teaching that Humane Authority has an unlimited
Power to impoſe any thing on the Church which is not
expreſly forbid in Scripture, may be of dangerous conſequence.
It is generally acknowledged (I think) by moſt <hi>Parties,</hi> that
it doth pertain to Humane Authority to determine thoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
relating to the Worſhip of God, which do belong
to thoſe Acts, conſidered as they are Humane Acts. Some Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99767:13"/>
muſt unavoidably accompany every external Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligious
Performance, becauſe it is impoſſible for man to act,
and his Acts be ſtript of all Circumſtances; and therefore it
is generally allowed, that thoſe Circumſtances without which the
joint Celebration of Divine Ordinances cannot be obſerved,
ſhould be determined by Humane Authority. As to other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
which are not neceſſary to theſe Performances, ſome
do apprehend they are left free by Chriſt, and therefore ſhould
not be conſtrained and compelled by men.</p>
            <p>There have been great Diſputes in the Church about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And ſome have declared their ſenſe in very large words, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſo as to make way for the bringing of very ſtrange In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations,
into the Church. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> It is not Demonſtrably certain, that Humane Authority
has power any further, than to reſtrain and puniſh diſorders,
and indecencies in the Church. And if ſo, tho we our ſelves
may be ſatisfied to ſerve God in the way appointed by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
we cannot thence fairly conclude it lawful to ruine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who ſerve God without our Ceremonies, but in a way
that is grave and decent as well as ours. For, if it ſhould at laſt
happen, notwithſtanding all the Probabilities we have on
our ſide, that the extent of Humane Authority in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
is only to keep men within Decent and Comly bounds,
and to puniſh them when they are diſorderly, irreverent, and
Rude; and that it doth not reach to determine one way De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and Orderly, ſo as to make all other wayes, (which are
in themſelves equally Decent) unlawful; I ſay, if it ſhould thus
fall out at laſt, then all thoſe who do unneceſſarily engage
themſelves in the immoderate courſes I am diſſwading from,
may wiſh, when it is too late, they had followed the ſafeſt
Advice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> The Limitations uſually preſcribed to the Exerciſe of
this Power, by thoſe who yield it in a great meaſure, are ſuch
as will not ſecure us from all the dangerous Inconveniences
which do attend this Power when unlimited. Indeed, if Humane
Authority has ſuch a Power belonging to it of Right, as ſome
do affirm, there cannot be very much ſaid on the point. And
therefore I will only propoſe two Queſtions for ſuch to think
upon.</p>

from having all thoſe Popiſh Ceremonies injoyned which were

the Publick and Governing Judgment and Conſcience muſt
be undeniably the Rule and Standard in theſe things for all the
Governed, I cannot diſcern how we can be excuſed from an
obligation to obſerve all thoſe Rites and Ceremonies that were
then appointed, if we be ever ſo unhappy as
to be caſt under the influence of a Prince who
can be prevailed with to be ſuperſtitious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> The things we contend about, are of ſuch a Nature,
they cannot bear ſo much weight as ſome would lay upon
them. There have been in moſt Ages a ſort of Pretenders to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
who, like <hi>Aeſop's Dog,</hi> have parted with the ſubſtance for
an empty ſhadow; only in this they appear worſe, becauſe he
catching at both, loſt what he had, they willingly part with the
ſubſtance, and aim at no more than an outward ſhew. It was thus
in our Saviours time. The Scribes and Phariſees, yea the Prieſts
and <hi>High-prieſts,</hi> the Ruling <hi>Clergy</hi> in thoſe days, did ſuffer, nay
teach men to break Divine Laws, if they would appear zealous for
their Doctrines and Superſtitions. For ought I can perceive, men
might then commute for as many ſins, by crying, <hi>The Temple
of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> as ſome hope to do now
by crying, <hi>O the Church, the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things are at beſt but meer accidental and ſeparable
Appendages. They may (if Authority ſee fit) be removed,
and Religion remain as entire and pure at it is with them.

men acknowledge due only to the Prince himſelf. But
when men can no more trample Religion under foot, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
regard its Doctrines, nor live agreeably to its Precepts,
and yet will be peeviſh and fierce againſt all who are not as
Ceremonious as themſelves; when they will ordinarily ſwear,
and be drunk, and commit all ſorts of wickedneſs with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs,
and yet expreſs an Extraordinary Zeal for theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials;
this is to imitate him, who when he has cut his

reſpectful to his Page or Footboy. How unſeemly
a thing is it, to hear a drunken ſwearing Debauchee, declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt Diſſenters, and crying out, <hi>The Church, The Church?</hi>
'Tis much more fit the Cenſures of the Church ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on ſuch men, to the throwing of them out of her
Communion, till they obtain more Grace, and learn more
Modeſty, than that they ſhould patronize and defend their

            <p>Theſe things are not matters of ſuch Moment, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
and Pieus men ſhould lay forth much of their Zeal
about them. Men on both ſides may go to Heaven, and when
they are there, they will not quarrel about ſuch things; why
then ſhould thoſe things create ſuch Diſtances at preſent? Nay
ſufferings and the ſight of Death can reconcile and unite
their Hearts and Affections, who may at preſent be unduly
Hot either way. <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Hooper</hi> were perfectly reconciled,
notwithſtanding their former Differences about ſuch matters as
theſe, when they were both to ſuffer for the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
yea <hi>Ridley,</hi> who was on the Conforming ſide, does now
write to <hi>Hooper,</hi> who had ſcrupled ſome things, That now he
was entirely united to him, tho in ſome Circumſtances of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
they had formerly jarred a little. And he adds, it was
<hi>Hooper's wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>his own ſimplicity,</hi> that divided them, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

will reflect more on the ſenſe they had of them, when they

moderate. <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>They are like the <hi>Roman</hi> Senators Glaſſes,

to the Feaſt he heard a horrid Outcry,
and ſaw ſome company drawing a Man
after them that made that noiſe. The Emperour demanding
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99767:16"/>
the cauſe of that violence; it was anſwered, their Maſter had
condemned him to the Fiſh-Ponds, for breaking a Glaſs
which he ſet a high value and eſteem upon. <hi>Caeſar</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a ſtay of the Execution, and when he came to the
houſe, he asked the <hi>Senator</hi> whether he had Glaſſes worth a
mans life? who anſwered (being a great lover of ſuch things)
that he had Glaſſes he valued at the price of a Province. Let
me ſee them (ſaith <hi>Auguſtus</hi>). The Senator then brought him
to a Room very well furniſhed: The <hi>Emperor</hi> ſaw them beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the eye, but knew withall they might be the cauſe
of much miſchief, therefore he brake them all, with this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,

            <p>Did thoſe we call Diſſenters refuſe to yield as ready and
free a ſubmiſſion and obedience to any of the Laws we look
on as purely Civil, as any amongſt our ſelves, I do not know
any man that would plead for them, tho they
were proſecuted with great ſeverity. But if
their Conſciences are ſo ſtrait they cannot yield
in theſe other inſtances relating to Religion,
it will be generally allowed they are not to be

placing your ſelves in God's Throne, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
too much upon you, but it is every jot,
as uncharitable, as ſome mens proceedings
are ſevere. Eſpecially conſidering they are
made of fleſh and blood, as well as we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
be; and they know (it may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> I never yet met with any Argument (eſpecially that I
can at preſent call to mind) for the abſolute inforcing of
ſome particular needleſs Ceremonies to be obſerved in the Church
by all who live under one Civil Government, but what would
be of the ſame force if it were applied to all the Churches
in the world. There is as much Reaſon (I think) that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Church, and every <hi>Congregation</hi> for the Service of God,
throughout the world, ſhould obſerve the ſame Ceremonies
(if we only reſpect the Obſervations and Reflections Heathens,
Strangers, and Enemies to our holy Faith will make, when
they ſee that in one and the ſame Nation People profeſſing
the ſame Religion do obſerve Different Rites) as that all the
Congregations in one Nation ſhould: Becauſe the Enemies
of Chriſtianity have the ſame ground to make the very ſame
Reflections on our Religion, when they obſerve that thoſe
who profeſs the ſame Religion, and own the ſame Faith, and
uſe the very ſame Ordinances in different Nations, have ſuch
a Diſagreement amongſt themſelves, they cannot conſent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the uſe of the ſame Rites. For the Reaſon of their
Reflection in this caſe, is grounded on the Unity of their
Faith and Religion. And it is univerſally acknowledged they
make up but one Church, in how many Kingdoms and Nations
ſo ever they be.</p>
            <p>Now what <hi>peculiar Reaſon</hi> can be given, on the account of
Religion, why it is more unſeemly, and will give greater occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of one and the ſame <hi>Particular Church,</hi> or for ſeveral <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Churches,</hi> which are but parts of the National <hi>Church,</hi>
to obſerve and uſe different <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> than for ſeveral Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal

And ſeeing the Notion of Catholick Communion is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
inſiſted on at this time, and urged with ſome earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſome ſolid and weighty Reaſon, (ſuch as may ſatisfie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive

where the Providence of God doth place them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> Long and often Experience hath made it undeniably
evident, that the putting of <hi>Penal Laws</hi> rigorouſly in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt humble, modeſt, conſcientious Diſſenters, (and I
plead only for ſuch) hath not anſwered the Deſign and End
for which they were intended. And therefore it may be more
excuſeable, if thoſe who were formerly very warm for the
Proſecution of Diſſenters, do now after ſo many years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
begin to be more moderate, and deſire that a more
amicable Expedient may be found out to compoſe our Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences;
ſeverity is not a proper method for the ſatisfying of
mens Judgments, or the removing of their Scruples. And tho'
the uſing of ſuch courſes may hinder people from aſſembling
ſo publickly as they deſire, nay may make ſome comply in
oppoſition to their own Judgments, yet it never made any
real Proſelytes; it has rather prepared the minds of others
to have a greater compaſſion towards, and liking of them.
And therefore when ever by accident, neceſſity, or of choice
the Reins have been let looſe, and they have found any Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
thoſe very perſons, who according to ſome Mens thoughts
were reclaimed, have faln off, and multitudes of others have
diſcovered an unwonted inclination towards them. This is
evident in all the Inſtances Hiſtorians do relate, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in all thoſe a late Author hath taken notice of, with
a deſign to urge and promote the ſevere
and rigid proſecuting of all Diſſenters,<note place="margin">Remarks on the Growth and Progreſs of Nonconformity. Some are great Admirers of that Book. But I muſt affirm, and ſo will every Intelligent &amp; unprejudiced Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the Author has neither diſcovered that candor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in the manner of his writing, nor that evidence of truth and faithfulneſs in his Hiſtorical Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor that ſtrength and clearneſs of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Logick in his Arguings, which might juſtly be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from one who would attempt to treat on ſuch a ſubject.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Difference. Severity has conduced as
much as any thing to the growth and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Nonconformity, as all thoſe Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
do demonſtrate. For the more any tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99767:17"/>
party is afflicted and frown'd upon, the
more is that party admired and owned, if ſuch
occurrences do happen, that any favour and
kindneſs muſt be ſhewed unto it.</p>
            <p>And the true Reaſon why the Nonconformiſts
did multiply ſo numerouſly when the Publick
ſtate of affairs did require them to be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
was not becauſe they were then tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
but becauſe they had been before trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
with obvious roughneſs and ſeverity,
and under that uſage had demeaned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with a very becomeing and graceful
exemplary carriage. If you will abſolutely
vanquiſh and root out Nonconformity by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
methods, there are two things at leaſt
which you muſt have a peculiar regard to,
and be able to effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> You muſt lay an invincible check and reſtraint upon
Gods Providence, ſo that he may not ſuffer any publick oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
to intervene, which will make it Neceſſary to
tollerate and indulge thoſe who do Diſſent, till you have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
ſubdued them all, and abſolutely deſtroy'd both Root
and Branch. For if there ſhould be a Publick Neceſſity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
them, after they have been vigorouſly proſecuted for a
time, their numbers will undoubtedly be much greater than
they were before. And there is ſcarce an inſtance to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of Moderate Diſſenters being proſecuted with great warmth
and uneceſſary Heat, but, in a little time after, there has been
ſome or other very notable Emergency which has rendred it
very neceſſary to have them entertained with great Clemency
and Gentleneſs.</p>
            <p>2. If you deſtroy them all, with an indifferent, undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
hand, you muſt keep a ſtrict and conſtant watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them after they are dead, leſt a greater Generation
of the like ſort do ariſe and ſpring out of their blood and
aſhes. Nay, you muſt be able to ſtop and ſtifle the Cry of
their blood, leſt otherwiſe the Nation being ſo throughly
drench'd with it, the clamorous noiſe of that blood com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into Gods ears, do provoke him to pour out ſuch dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99767:18"/>
Vials on us, as will make us at once to ceaſe being a
Church or People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is an excellent, true, and very uſeful Obſervation which
Biſhop</hi> Taylor <hi>made concerning Force and Extremity in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epiſt. Ded. before his Treatiſe of Holy living, &amp;c.</note> viz. When Religion puts on

the Power of the Sword, but not the Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
and we may complain of this to God, and amongſt them who
are afflicted, but we have no remedy but what we muſt expect from
the fellowſhip of Chriſts ſufferings, and the returns of the God of
Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly.</hi> It was never known that any Indifferent Ceremonies
were univerſally impoſed in a knowing Age, and the Judgments
and Opinions of all good men did conſent and agree to them.
Indeed I think there never was ſuch an attempt made, till Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
had got a great influence over the Chriſtian world. I am
perſwaded there never was an univerſal compliance in Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Indifferences, till Popery had involved people in a more than
<hi>Egyptian</hi> and almoſt inextricable Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Some do think it would be as commendable to oblige
all men to have the ſame Face, as to have in every reſpect
the ſame judgment. Indeed men would have juſt ground to
wonder, if a Law ſhould be made, requiring all men to be
of one <hi>Bulke,</hi> and <hi>Stature,</hi> and forbidding them to eat and
drink (at leaſt in Company) if they fail to obſerve it. But I am
ſure I have ſome where read of a certain Expedient that was
ſometimes made uſe of to make Dwarfs, and breed them to be
all of one Bigneſs. It was not any ſuch Stratagem as <hi>Procuſtes</hi>
uſed to make his Friends and Viſitants of one length, <hi>viz.</hi>
Cutting off their Heads if they were too long, and racking
them ought of joynt if they were too ſhort. This looks like
the perſecuting way made uſe of in ſome Forreign parts of
the World, when mens Judgments and Conſciences do not
anſwer the <hi>Politick Standard.</hi> The way I ſpeak of, differs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much from this. For it will let People grow till they be
of a juſt ſize, and then ſtops them that they ſhall not increaſe
one jot. 'Tis couping them up at firſt, and then Dieting them
proportionably, and never ſuffering them to ſtir out of their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99767:18"/>
firſt encloſure, till they have not only ſtuft it quite up, but
are quite paſt growing.</p>
            <p>If you would have all men of the ſame mind in every thing
relating to the Service and Worſhip of God, and what men
call ſo, the moſt effectual Expedient will be to involve them
in the ſame Groſs Ignorance in which their Anceſtors were
held under the <hi>Romiſh</hi> yoke. There is no way ſo likely to
make men to entertain any thing without Scruple, as keeping
them in ſo much darkneſs they cannot ſee, or making them
ſo dull they cannot examine things. People are never brought
to a ſervile ſubmiſſion to all kind of Impoſitions, till they have
for ſome time been inured to an Implicite Faith, and then
you may obtrude on them what you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly.</hi> Very great and conſiderable Alterations have been made
in our Rubricks, our publick Service, and our Articles, in
order to the bringing of the Papiſts to join with us in our
Worſhip, and to prevent our giving them ſo much as the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of a pretence for their withdrawing from our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
And if ſo much might be parted with to gratifie our
worſt and moſt implacable Enemies, even them who differ
from us in the very Subſtantials of Religion, is it not highly
Reaſonable we ſhould expreſs ſome Moderation and Tenderneſs
towards them, who are in every thing of the ſame Religion
with us, and do only differ about ſome unneceſſary Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies?</p>
            <p>But there are too many who pretend to this Church, who
diſcover they are of the mind that we cannot manifeſt too
much Complacency in thoſe who are avowedly of the Popiſh
Perſwaſion, nor appear inexorable enough towards our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
fellow Proteſtants. How many are there who pretend to
be Sons of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and yet dare openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
they have a greater averſion to Proteſtant Diſſenters than
Popiſh Recuſants? What <hi>hopeful Church of England men</hi> will
theſe be, if the Sins of this Nation ſhould riſe ſo high as to
provoke God to pour on us the Vials of his diſpleaſure, and
to imbitter, nay poiſon them all, by adding the greateſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>I offer theſe things to peoples conſideration, not to except

doth injoyn and practiſe, but only to mind ſome who do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99767:19"/>
themſelves Chriſtians are liſted under, as pernicious <hi>Devices</hi> of
the Devil to help forward <hi>Diviſion,</hi> and to moleſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
that <hi>Common Chriſtianity</hi> we do all pretend to. I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
any who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians do lay ſo much ſtreſs
on any thing in which Chriſtianity is not immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
as to give occaſion for people to coin any other Name,
by which they may be diſtinguiſhed from others, than that
by which the Diſciples and Believers were firſt called at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och.</hi>
I do not conſider people by the Names of Reproach
Atheiſts and Prophane men do ſet on them, but by what I do
really find them in their open profeſſion and general practice.
But that you may know more diſtinctly who they be I plead
for, I will now ſay ſomething to the ſecond point I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.
Which is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> To give both a general and particular account of
the people for whom I plead. And in general, I plead for
all who deſerve the Character I gave in the Preface to my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
againſt Peſecution, of many Diſſenters with whom I had
particular acquaintance. I believe there are many of the ſame
Stamp and Merit amongſt them, with whom I never had any
acquaintance. Let people come under what Denomination ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
if I can diſcern no juſt ground to doubt but God will
accept them, I think I owe them a very great Reſpect and
Deference; and therefore I do profeſs I rejoyce in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of all whom I apprehend I have good cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>do Fear God and work Righteouſneſs,</hi> and I mourn to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how Differences are kept alive and heightened betwixt
them and other Good men. We all ought to have a great
tenderneſs for, and regard to all thoſe who are vigorous
Proteſtants (that is, who profeſs and own all the Doctrines
of Chriſtianity the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth, and do oppoſe
and reject all thoſe Tenets which are truly Popiſh: For it is
not mens owning or renouncing ſome Indifferent Ceremonies,
which makes them Proteſtants, or of the Reformed Religion)
who are exemplarily pious and virtuous in their Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and who live peaceably and ſoberly, and do not indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
any unlawful Alteration in the Government.</p>
            <p>I plead for Moderation towards ſuch as were known ſome
time ſince to the Kings Majeſty, and all who anſwer that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter

looked on as the moſt able and principal
Aſſertors of the Presbyterian Opinions, with
whom we had as much conference, as the
multitude of Affairs which were then upon
us would permit us to have, and to our great ſatisfaction
and comfort, found them perſons full of Affection to us,
of Zeal for the Peace of the Church and State, and neither
Enemies (as they have been given out to be) to Epiſcopacy or
Liturgy, but modeſtly to deſire ſuch Alterations in either, as
without ſhaking Foundations might beſt allay the preſent
Diſtempers which the Indiſpoſition of the Time, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
of ſome mens Conſciences had contracted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe Nonconformiſts do deſerve a peculiar reſpect and
kindneſs from our Church, who really ſcrupeling ſome things,
do comply with us as far as poſſibly they can under their
preſent apprehenſions, and do publickly declare themſelves
againſt erecting <hi>Altare contra Altare,</hi> nay who are particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cautious of preſſing others <hi>not to Conform.</hi> Indeed if all
who do at preſent Diſſent, and are capable of examining the
matters in difference betwixt us, would carefully lay aſide all
<hi>Partiality</hi> and <hi>Prejudice,</hi> and not dare to indulge themſelves
in <hi>making Parties,</hi> or in ſuggeſting <hi>unneceſſary Doubts</hi> to any,
but would rather comply themſelves to the utmoſt they are
able, and perſwade others to joyn with us in <hi>Divine Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
by removing and anſwering thoſe <hi>Objections</hi> and <hi>Scruples</hi>
which are ſometimes alledged, and which they themſelves are
ſatisfied are of <hi>no force,</hi> I am perſwaded they would do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
great Right, the Church of God much Service, and
be greatly inſtrumental towards the compoſing thoſe Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
which have long weakened the Proteſtant Intereſt, and
given too great Advantage to the Common Enemy. And ſuch
as theſe there are undoubtedly amongſt them we call Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Nay I am perſwaded the Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> (tho' by
ſome Reproachfully and very Deſingenuouſly called the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
of the Proteſtant Schiſmaticks) hath by his Writings,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99767:20"/>

Theſe and many more have given the world undeniable and

Generation, and very ſhining Lights in the Church of God.

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Now what Crime is it for a Conformiſt to plead for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
towards ſuch men as theſe? or for a Son of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> to endeavour to give ſome check to the
immoderate Heat and Peeviſhneſs of thoſe furious and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong
Bigots, who by unneceſſary ingaging themſelves in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
their Peaceable Religious Neighbours, do indanger the
weakening the Proteſtant Intereſt, and the making the Church
of <hi>England</hi> her ſelf a Sacrifice to the Rage, and Trophy of
the Conqueſt of her moſt inveterate and indefatigable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
But however innocent and juſtly commendable the thing
is in it ſelf, the practice of it does not appear ſo ſafe, and
to have ſuch general Countenance as it deſerves. This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
enough by the treatment the late Sermon againſt
Perſecution hath had amongſt men of certain Characters.</p>
            <p>But the World will in time be ſatisfied that Places and
Garments do not make men better. They may yield them
greater opportunities than they had before to diſcover what
they truly are. Tie Aſs was an Aſs as well when he had
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99767:21"/>
the Lions skin on his back, as when it was off. Nay that Lions

               <hi>then may ye who are accuſtomed
to do evil, learn to do good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding ſuch a ſtir is kept about the Sermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
named, the Exceptions ordinarily alledged againſt it, by
the very Dons themſelves, are very pitiful and trifling, ye
I muſt acknowledg they do better become them, whoſe faces
would flatter the world into a belief they pretend to be men,
than Indictments and Deprivations (which are now talked of)
do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> The Objections pretended againſt the Sermon are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
theſe two.</p>
            <p>1. How can I who am a Conformiſt, and conſequently ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied
of the Lawfulneſs of every thing required by the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> be againſt puniſhing them, who will not comply
with what I my ſelf acknowledge Lawful, and do practiſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> That it is very unbecoming one who receives Profits
from the <hi>Church of England</hi> (and to uſe their own canting
Phraſe) ſucks the Churches Breaſts, to Apologize and plead
for them who diſſent from the Church.</p>
            <p>Now any man who hath either eyes or any thing elſe in
his Head, may eaſily perceive theſe Exceptions are not ſo
much againſt the Sermon, as againſt my ſelf. And therefore
I will take the leſs care in anſwering them. For I think all
ſuch abſurd and feeble Reflections are beſt confuted by a
due contempt.</p>
            <p>The firſt Objection is propoſed by way of Query, and asks
How I who am a Conformiſt, and conſequently ſatisfied of the
Lawfulneſs of every thing required by the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
can be againſt puniſhing them who will not comply with
what I do acknowledg Lawful, and do practiſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. 1ſt.</hi> There may other more agreeable Methods be
uſed to make Proſelytes, againſt which I never ſpake one word.
<q>Solid Arguments, ſtrong Reaſons and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
are more fit for confutation of an
Error,<note place="margin">Whitlock's <hi>Memor. An.</hi> 1650.</note> and ſatisfaction of Different Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> There is a great Difference betwixt a mans being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied
of the Lawfulneſs of things, ſo as to direct his own
Practice in the uſe of them, and his being convinced of the
Neceſſity of them, ſo as to be induced thereby to juſtify or
approve the unneceſſary head-ſtrong and furious courſes, ſome
prophane looſe Fellows do take againſt them who are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
ſatisfied with him, by the Evidence he hath. There is
no Reaſon I ſhould pull a mans eyes out of his head, becauſe

            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> The Greateſt, the Wiſeſt, and the Learnedſt men this

great care to cover them all he could from

and diſcouraged thoſe who were inclined to ſtretch the Laws
too much againſt them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is very well known that Dr. <hi>Wilkins,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi>
was a man of as prodigious Univerſal Learning, and of as
clear and ſolid a Judgment, as any man the Chriſtian world
was ever adorned with; And it is as well known that he was
equally Famous for his Moderation towards Diſſenters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99767:22"/>
he was made Biſhop, as for any of his other Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Accompliſhments: And after he aſcended the Epiſcopal
Seat he continued the ſame man he was before, and made
that Dioceſs (as it is very well known there, and in moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Places) the moſt flouriſhing and truly Religious part (I
think I may truly ſay) of all Chriſtendom, by the happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
under Divine Grace his eminent Moderation, Zealous
Piety, and moſt Chriſtian Government had in thoſe parts. And
the Eminent and Reverend Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> in his Preface to the
Reader before that Biſhops Sermons lately publiſhed, has
this moſt remarkable Paſſage concerning his Moderation.
<q>And I purpoſely mention his Moderation, and likewiſe adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to commend him for it, notwithſtanding that this virtue,
ſo much eſteemed and magnified by wiſe men in all Ages,
hath of late been declaimed againſt with ſo much Zeal and
Fierceneſs, and yet with that good Grace and Confidence,
as if it were not only no Virtue, but even the Sum and
Abridgement of all Vices; I ſay, notwithſtanding all this,
I am ſtill of the old Opinion, that Moderation is a Virtue,
and one of the peculiar Ornaments and Advantages of the
Excellent Conſtitution of our <hi>Church,</hi> and muſt at laſt be the
Temper of her Members, eſpecially the <hi>Clergy,</hi> if ever we se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
intend the firm eſtabliſhment of this <hi>Church,</hi> and do
not induſtriouſly deſign, by cheriſhing Heats and Diviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our ſelves, to let in Popery at theſe Breaches.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> They are generally the worſt men (eſpecially if they
be <hi>Clergy</hi>-men) who are moſt for violence in relation to thoſe
who differ about ſome little Indifferences. Nay, what is more,
if you conſider all Perſwaſions, you ſhall find they are the moſt
Illiterate, Unſteady, Prophane and Debauched Pretenders to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Perſwaſion, who are moſt for ſeverity towards Modeſt Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Even amongſt the Papiſts, who were ſo hot and furious
as <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and <hi>Bonner,</hi> Men who were not only flagitious
in their Lives, but had no more than an empty ſuperſficial
Learning. But <hi>Tonſtall,</hi> who was truly a Scholar, abhorred that
ſeverity towards mens perſons the others were
fond of practiſing. <q>It is obſervable (ſaith
Dr.<note place="margin">Hiſt. of the Rights of Princes, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 257.</note> 
                  <hi>Burnet</hi>) that the beſt <hi>Clergy</hi>-men have
been always the moſt gentle to thoſe who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99767:23"/>
from them; for they confiding in the goodneſs of their
Cauſe, and in that true merit of which every one that has
it, muſt be conſcious to himſelf, and yet without Pride or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
are perſuaded that by the methods of love and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
they ſhall, with the help of ſome time, and the uſe of
all due prudence and caution, overcome Errors and Schiſms:
But the unworthy, who know that a good Cauſe may be
ſpoiled, but is not likely to prevail in their hands, and
who will not trouble themſelves with the ſlow and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Methods of conquering Errors, are always apt to fly to
extream and cruel courſes; ſince they know they muſt either
prevail by theſe, or by none at all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Objection ſaith, It is very unbecoming one who
receives Profits of the <hi>Church,</hi> to plead for them who diſſent
from the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, <hi>firſt</hi> of all, That there is no unſeemlineſs at all in
any ones countenancing and pleading for that which all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Equity and Reaſon do juſtifie and prompt men to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> They are extreamly ſtupid and dull, who cannot diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
betwixt pleading for Peoples Diſſent, and pleading that
they may be treated with more mildneſs, than ſome are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to uſe. I do not plead for their Diſſent, to juſtifie
that, but do only endeavour to ſhew that much may be ſaid
for Moderation towards ſome who do Diſſent, againſt the
fierce debauched People who are their greateſt oppoſers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> They diſcover no good Opinion of the <hi>Church,</hi> who
would perſwade the World ſhe maintains her Miniſters for no
other end, but either to Preach up ſeverity againſt all who
ſcruple ſome Indifferences, or to keep them ſilent, that they
do not decry the violent courſes ſome lewd prophane Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
to her do put in practice: Would not this be to
make our Miniſters like that old Regiſter I have heard of in
one of the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, who would not ſuffer a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Church-Warden</hi> to be at reſt, till he would Preſent his
Neighbours who came not to the Sacrament? The <hi>Church-Warden</hi>
being at laſt overcome by his importunities, did get a
Preſentment drawn out, and amongſt thoſe Names which were
ſet down, there was one which had Mr. before it. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter
ſpying this, thought it would be very convenient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99767:23"/>
with this Man: And accordingly had him Summoned
to the Court, and began to mannage the buſineſs very briskly.
But another who had a great veneration for the Court, being
preſent, and hearing that Man called, applied himſelf immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to the Regiſter, and ask'd him what he meaned to do?
Why, ſaid the Regiſter, I will make this Man go to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before I have done with him, for all his <hi>Maſterſhip.</hi> Nay
then, ſaid the other, you'll ſpoil all; for this Gentleman is <hi>ONE
OF <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> he will <hi>Swear</hi> and be <hi>Drunk</hi> as well as the <hi>BEST</hi> of
us. Say you ſo, quoth the Regiſter, then the caſe is altered.
And immediately he called the <hi>Church-Warden,</hi> and child him
very ſharply, telling him he was a moſt impudent and villanous
Rakehell, in that he durſt adventure to Preſent ſo worthy a
Gentleman as that was. Why, <hi>ſaid the Church-warden,</hi> he did
not come to the Sacrament. Why Sirrah, <hi>anſwered the Register,</hi>
you are not to Preſent all who do not come to the Sacrament, but
only thoſe who ſcruple to receive the Sacrament on their Knees.</p>
            <p>Some do lay a great ſtreſs on this, That ſeveral who are in
eminent Places in the <hi>Church</hi> are againſt both my Sermon
and my ſelf. But for my own part I do not
much concern my ſelf for that,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 3.</note>
