         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Sir Ralph Hoptons Answer to the Marquis.</head>
            <p>May it please your Lordship with humble
pardon, according to my weake ability I
have considered your worthy advertisements and
to vindicate my selfe and Country of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
mistake, I shall make it appeare, that
my actions and those under my Command
have bin concurrant to your Lordships Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and I have in briefe devoted my selfe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
to every particuler of your Lordships
Letter.</p>
            <p>First, whereas your Lordship condemned our
endevours and cowardly behaviour at <hi>Miniard</hi>
and <hi>Dunstar,</hi> your Lordship may well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and saw three to one of the Earle of
<hi>Bedfords</hi> forces forsaken him, then those of our
County under your Lordship might see that his
Majesties forces under your Lordships command
had good successe considering the great odds (five
to one.)</p>
            <p>Secondly, that whereas your Lordship remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
me of the Generall his speech of <hi>Ostend,</hi>
that our Nation stood too much upon our owne
strength and valour and that he would with a few
experienced soldiers run through our Kingdom.
My Lord, the question herein is not disputable,
for nature at home bindeth filiall affection, and
one Brother or one Nation to fight against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is not warrantable by Gods lawes, and in that
respect there might be faint-heartednes in our
Nation, but my Lordlet the Generall of <hi>Ostead</hi> or
any other forraine Princes invade this our land.
<pb facs="tcp:61280:4"/>
I know that your Lordship beleeves that our
Nation will not runne, or give one foot of ground
to such an Enemy, for we are all sencible with
whom we quarrell, the father against the Sonne,
and the Sonne against the Father, and if <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the great, or the Emperour of <hi>Persia</hi> were
now alive, whose Armies dranke Rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yet my Lord it would daunt the hearts of
these gallants to destroy their owne bloud.</p>
            <p>3. Whereas your Lordship hath desire to know
the number of our Forces in these parts, my
Lord since the Earle of <hi>Bath</hi> his apprehending,
our souldiers have revolted, yet wee have
a considerable strength at <hi>Peasants, Foy, Lances<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and other places, about the number of
5000. and upwards, and upon all occasions we
can betake our selves to Sea, and so to land where
we please, therefore your Lordship may stand
upon firme ground in these parts, if you please
to hazard your noble person among us.</p>
            <p>My Lord, Nature and Nature, Fortune and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
Action and Action, State and State, Time
past, and Time present, your Lordship now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
I will here breake off, for I find that I have
exceeded the convenient length of a Letter, and
come short of such discourse at this Subject
doth deserve, your Lordship may perhaps find
many things in this Letter superfluous, and most
of it lame, J will as well as I can supply that
defect upon your Lordships second writing, if
your Lordship call me to an accompt, what
confusion soever your Lordship finds in my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:61280:4"/>
and method, is not onely my fault, whose
wits are confounded with too much businesse,
but the fault of the season<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which confusion and
disorder hath not onely bin wincked at, but
warranted, if there be but any one thing which
your Lordship may make use of, J thinke my
paines well bestowed in all, and howsoever my
Councell may be weake, yet my wishes shall
be as strong as any mans for your Lordships
happinesse.</p>

into his Majesties hands, though the Earle of
<hi>Essex</hi> commanded him to use his endeavour to
resist the Cavaliers but one 4 houres and he
