         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DECLARATION
OF THE
Lay Catholikes of England,
concerning the Authority
challenged ouer them, by
the Right Reuerend
Lord Bishop of
CHALCEDON.</head>
                  <p>WEE Lay Catholickes of the
realme of <hi>England,</hi> haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
from ſundry parts
of the Chriſtian world, that a foule aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion
is caſt vpon our honour &amp; repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
for that we are iudged to frame a
leſſe reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d conceit of Epiſcopal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17863:4"/>
and iuriſdiction, and not to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it that Obediecne, which may be
thought fit. The only cauſe of this, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from thence, that we refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our ſelues to that power &amp; Authority
which the Right Reuerend Lord Biſhop
of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> hath long ſince pretended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as
due vnto his place; and to the which (as
we are aſſured vpon ſtrong motiues) he
ſtill layeth clayme, taking it as graunted
him from the Sea Apoſtolike. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Authority of his, hath byn main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
by ſundry Treatiſes, as well writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
as printed, which warrant his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nariſhip,
and aſſure him of as much po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
as is granted to other Ordinaries, in
what Catholike Dioceſſe ſoeuer, and
warne vs that the ſame Obedience is to
be performed towards him on our part.
Moreouer we are told, that hitherto we
were not a Church, as long as we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a particular Biſhop; but a flocke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Paſtor, an Army without a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
a Ship without a Pilot, a ſpirituall
kingdome without a ſpirituall king, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
without the good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the houſe;
in a word, no true, or perfect Chriſtians.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17863:4"/>
And although, as ſoone as we had retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
an anſwere to a Letter ſent vs from
my Lord Biſhop, preſently diuers ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
wrytings (which his Lordſhip ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſought to ſuppreſſe, nor ſeemed to
diſlike of) were ſpread abroad, and we
therin traduced with no ſmall diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to our reputation, and preiudice
to our cauſe, eſpecially in the opinion
of the vnlearned; yet we choſe rather
to forgoe our proper, and priuate inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
then by ſtanding out with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
for our owne right, eyther af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foard
vnto others a ſubiect of ſcandall, or
giue way to the daunger of an enſuing
Schiſme. Wherfore in ſilence we left the
decyding of this matter to thoſe, who by
their Higheſt power in the Church of
God, were as well his Lordſhips, as our
Superiours. But ſeeing there haue not
wanted many both at home and abroad
who in a matter nothing belonging to
them, and who could not ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any Authority ouer vs, haue not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
vſurped the freedome of
giuing iudgment in our cauſe, with great
domage to our fame and honour, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17863:5"/>
we endeare aboue our liues; we haue
thought good to declare and auouch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierly,
and faithfully before God and man
theſe enſuing points.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we ſincerely belie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e &amp; profeſſe
that Epiſcopall Authority in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church was ordained by God, and,
as it beſeemeth good Catholickes, we
honour it with all reuerence; and daily
beg with our beſt wiſhes, that the diuyne
Goodnes will once be pleaſed to ſend a
tyme, in which that authority, which is
truly giuen, and which we account full
neceſſary in the Catholick Church, may
ſafely be eſtabliſhed amongſt vs, and we
without increaſe of perſecution, ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge
it, and as humbly ſubmit our
ſelues vnto it, as they do, who liue in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
not liable to lawes enacted againſt
Religion, of which kind very many, and
thoſe ſeuere and capitall, be heere with vs
in force. Which fauour, if we could but
obteyne of his diuine Maieſty, truly we
ſhould eſteeme our ſelues thrice-happy.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore we declare openly, that
for as much as belongeth to the Right
Reuerend Lord Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17863:5"/>
honour and reuerence him in all duty, &amp;
take him to be a true Catholick Biſhop,
ſent hither by the ſea Apoſtolick to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
the Sacrament of Confirmation, &amp;
as we thinke, to gouerne that part of the
Clergy, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to his charge;
but not to be our Ordinary, either after an
ordinary or extraordinary ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, becauſe
we in no caſe belieue, that any ſuch thing
hath bin hitherto declared by the ſea A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicke,
ſeeing that the tymes, into
which we are fallen, do no wayes permit
vs to obey ſuch Authority, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering
the loſſe of our goods, &amp; ſuch
a loſſe, as cannot be recouered. Neither
do we only thinke, that the Sea Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
hath not as yet, beſtowed any ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
power, or authority vpon the Right
Reuerend Lord Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> but
moreouer we reſt aſſured, that it is not
the intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Holines to grant it him
herafter, vntil thoſe times returne, which
may promiſe, that this power will rather
ſerue to ſupport Religion, then to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
it; and vntill it may be lawfull for
vs to imbrace it freely, without ſo many,
&amp; ſo great difficulties and dangers, which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17863:6"/>
as things now ſtand, is altogeather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,

in the beginning of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
to my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> which
for that the Reader ſhould not peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
light on, or we be inforced, often to
repeate the ſame thing, we thought good
to ſet downe in this place a Copy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

made, and preſented to my Lord <hi>de
Chaſteau-neuf</hi> his Excellency, at that tyme
the moſt Chriſtian Kings Embaſſadour
Extraordinary in <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> before whome
many Catholicks &amp; ſome of chiefe digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

and vnpartiall Reader will eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
the ſtate of our cauſe, which was
the thing we aymed at, by adioyning this

                  <p>In the meane tyme, ſeeing for diuers

our ſelues in perſon, &amp; hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly to lay
downe our owne Cauſe before his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
we beſeech thoſe Catholiks who are
lyke to fynd freer acceſſe vnto him, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17863:6"/>
who ſhall light vpon theſe wrytings, to
be interceſſours for vs vnto his Holines,
that he will vouchſafe to expreſſe his
mind, and giue ſentence of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy,
which we now haue with the Right
Reuerend Lord Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> to
the end, all occaſions of further ſcandall
&amp; diſſention may be entierly cut off, &amp;
quyte remoued; as we hope they will, if
his Holynes will be pleaſed to giue it in
ſuch a manner, as his reſolution may be
publickely diuulged, and openly made
knowne to all. For if it be only expreſſed
in priuate, ech party may eyther affirme

                     <p>In the next place, we do with al reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and humility declare, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17863:7"/>
to the lawes and ſtate of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
as now they are, we conceaue that
the authority and iuriſdiction of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
is not only inconuenient, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſefull,
but impoſſible to be executed, &amp;
ſo dangerous to be obeyed, nay euen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
as that we cannot be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
thereunto. And we do verily belieue
&amp; that vpon many and weighty reaſons,
whatſoeuer hath byn affirmed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
that his Holynes hath had no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to oblige vs vnto it, nor will, after
information how things ſtand heere.</p>
                     <p>There are heere many Statutes of
the Kingdome in force, which make it
highly penall in ſome caſes with loſſe of
goods &amp; liberty, and in others of life, to
acknowledge any other Authority or Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature,
then ſuch as by the ſame ſtatuts
are authorized, which though we are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
not to regard, when there is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
of any doctrine of fayth; yet when
a man ſhall run hazard of vtter ruine,
for admitting and acknowledging of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
iuriſdiction and authority which
importeth not faith, but practiſe of things
not neceſſary but according to tyme and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17863:8"/>
place we conceaue that we cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
to imbrace it.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſayd, that it is Capitall for a
man to receaue a Catholique Prieſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his houſe, and that yet many receaue
them with all the hazard, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we might aſwell receaue an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
into our houſes, acknowledging his
Authority. The anſwere will make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
that the obiection proueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
agaynſt vs. For firſt it is certayne,
that euen for the reaſon of being ſo Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall,
and that there are ſo many lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
examples among vs, not only of
friends who haue diſcouered and betraied
other friends for receauing Prieſts, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for intereſt, licentiouſneſſe of lyfe,
reuenge, frailty, or for ſome other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
but of Seruants, who haue betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Mayſters, Nephews, Vncles,
Grandchildren &amp; children their Parents,
Daughters their very Mothers, yea and
euen Prieſts themſelues ſometymes, who
haue fallen and betrayed Catholikes; we
neyther are nor can by any humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
be obliged to take Prieſts into our
houſes. Many of vs indeed do it out of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17863:8"/>
deuotion and zeale, for the comfort of
our ſoules, by celebrating Maſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing
the moſt neceſſary and daily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and many of vs alſo do it not.
But howſoeuer, we thinke it a very ill
conſequence to inferre, that therefore a
man is, or may be obliged with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of his eſtate of lyfe to acknowledge
or ſubmit to the Authority of an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
for the practiſe of ſome thinges
without which we yet finde by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and Gods grace, we haue alwayes
ſubſiſted in theſe ſad tymes, becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth
out of voluntary deuotion &amp; zeale,
many of vs are conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to run the higheſt
hazards in receauing of Prieſts, for the
ſo neceſſary and dayly exerciſe of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
through want whereof we alſo
find by experience of <hi>Saxony</hi> &amp; <hi>Denmark,</hi>
and many other countries in <hi>Germany,</hi>
Religion hath in effect wholy fayled.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, a Prieſt who is a Perſon of
our owne election, being firſt authorized
as fit and capable by the Sea Apoſtolicke,
may haue entrance into our houſes, and
exerciſe his function, in a much more
priuate and ſafe manner then it is poſſible
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17863:9"/>
for an Ordinary to doe, eſpecially when
he will carry himſelfe as Ordinary. For in
that caſe, beſides ſeruants there muſt be
alwayes Officers, parties and witneſſes,
who do not all, and euer vow ſo much as
diſcretion, or yet to continue conſtant in
the Catholicke fayth. And for our parts
the dangers being ſuch as they are, it will
be impoſſible to ſecure vs in this poynt,
where ſometymes it happeneth that an
vndiſcreet word vttered euen without ill
meaning may turne to our loſſe of goods
and life.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, if we could abſtract from the
danger of offending the State, it is to be
conſidered, that our Mariages and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments,
and the lyke are made lyable
heere to thoſe Eccleſiaſticall Courts and
Tribunals which are ſetled by the lawes
of this Kingdome, and are executed by
certayne Chancellours, and Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for that purpoſe, who may often o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige
and ſentence vs in the affirmatiue,
whereas a Catholike Ordinary, or Iudge
would perhaps do it in the negatiue, and
ſo we ſhould be toſſed betweene two
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

ſhould p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>onounce any ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence, at which
the party might be grieued, which muſt

would be an appeale to <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> which
yet it would be Capitall for him to make,
beſides the charge of proſecuting ſuch a
ſuite, and the impoſſibility for the moſt
part of vs, ſo much as to ſend, or write to
a place ſo diſtant, and ſo contradicted by
the State heere, for the bringing of ſuch a
ſuite to an end. And to ſhew both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences
and impoſſibilities of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the power of a Catholicke Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
in ſuch a tyme and place as this, we
thinke it very conſiderable to reflect vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
many Catholicke Biſhops, who ſuruiued
the Reigne of Queene <hi>Marie</hi> of happy
memory, and liued heere many yeares in
Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> tyme, after the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
of Religion, and yet there is no memory
that any of them did euer practiſe any
power of Ordinary, within his owne
Dioceſſe <hi>in foro externo contentiosè,</hi> which
yet it is cleare he had, and whereof he
could not be depriued without perſonall
demerit: &amp; if hauing this Authority they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17863:10"/>
were ſo far from excuting it, it is moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
certain, that if they had not had it, they
would neuer haue ſought it in theſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.</p>
                     <p>And thus much, to auoyde greater
length, for the ſhewing, that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a Catholicke Ordinary in this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
and place is impoſſible, eyther to be
impoſed or obeyed, and extremely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient
withall, euen if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
To w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> this only word may alſo be
added, that euen in the moſt cleare caſes,
&amp; which might appeare to be moſt eaſy,
and might be carryed in the moſt priuate
manner, as namely when any Catholike
ſhall lead a ſcandalous life, or that men
ſhall diſſent from their wyues, or the like,
we leaue it to conſideration, whether as
the lawes ſtand heere, a Catholike Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
as an Eccleſiaſticall Iudge can now
diſcreetly thinke it fit to reduce this man
by any compulſory way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaſt thereby he
may be made worſe. But we heare ſome
of the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedons</hi> Officers
ſay, that although he be Ordinary, and
haue the authority and iuriſdiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to that quality, yet he will not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17863:10"/>
exerciſe the ſame.</p>
                     <p>To this we anſwere, firſt, that if the
authority be not to be executed, no reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
can be giuen why it ſhould be graunted,
when ſo many reaſons are to be f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lt, why
it muſt be ſo inconuenient and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Secondly, we conceaue it not inough
to ſay it ſhall not be executed, becauſe if it
be exta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the ſtate is put into iealoſy ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
as appeareth by the laſt Proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
agaynſt the Lord Biſhop: and it will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne
this anſwere at our hands; We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
ſuch an Authority, but the
Ordinary who hath it, giueth his word
that he will not execute the ſame. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ſtatutes of the Kingdom fal <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naly
as hath byn ſayd not vpon ſuch only
as ſubmit themſelues to the execution of
the ſayd Authority, but vpon ſuch alſo
as acknowledge the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Catholique Ordinary
may reſolue this day not to execute his
Authority, yet may to morrow thinke fit
to do it, with euident daunger to vs of
the Laity, whereof it muſt be intended,
that wee our ſelues can iudge beſt, as
whome it concerneth moſt. Fifthly, this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17863:11"/>
kind of Authority is not to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
or ſo much as ſecretly admitted,
though vpon promiſe to forbeare the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
becauſe the State is euer wont vpon
any new Bul, or the declaring of any new
authority, or any occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like this to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
Catholikes who ſhall come before
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with great rigor, how far they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
of the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of ſuch a Bul, or con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ent
to any ſuch Authority. Many haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
beene entrapped &amp; greatly preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced,
vpon ſuch occaſions; and ſo may
probably be heerafter vpon this: and if it
ſhould be denyed and forſworne, which
all men who may be examined will not
eaſily do, if indeed they approue ſuch a
thing; yet will not that denyal or oath be
any way auailable where proofe may be
made to the contrary. Beſides that, if this
Authority ſhould be conceiued to be heer
on foote, the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Biſhops would be
much more actiue in perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks,
as finding their particular intereſt to
be more immediatly touched by this, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by any other thing forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the lawes
of the Kingdome: and we palpably find
by experience, that vpon their knowledg
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17863:11"/>
that there is a Catholike Biſhop heere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who calleth himſelfe Ordinary of this
Kingdome, the Purſuiuants are authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to be much more buſy, &amp; vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of ſearching for the Biſhop, to ſearch
many houſes, &amp; to take many Prieſts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whome otherwiſe they had not loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
                     <p>Theſe few Conſiderations we haue
choſen out of many which occur fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
vnto vs, but which for breuities
ſake we haue omitted that ſo your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
may be briefly informed of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayre;
beſeeching you, to procure our
peace and ſafety, by keeping ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience
ſtill from vs, as it would be,
for vs to acknowledge the authority of
an Ordinary in this time &amp; place, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
theſe Lawes; &amp; that you will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

of his Body, are men very remarkable for
piety, prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, conſtancy in the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
faith, Birth, Eſtate, and Reputation
heere, with all good men we meane, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be but euen morally good of
both religions; and that they are no ſuch
kind of people, as very paſſionately and
iniuriouſly they haue beene traduced to
be; and the ſame we are informed hath
been manifeſted to your Excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy ſince
your arriuall, by perſons of the greateſt
ranck of our religion heere in England.</p>
                     <p>We leaue this point alſo vnto your
Excellency to iudge off, whether thoſe
Catholiks, if any ſuch there be, who think
it fit, to admit of the Authority of an
Ordinary in this Kingdome, as things
now ſtand, may be compared with vs, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for degree, quality, or number, who
think the contrary. Nay we are ſure, that
though ſome, when peraduenture they
be asked, whether they wil acknowledg
the Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> for their Paſtour,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17863:12"/>
or Ordinary, or the like, will anſwere,
they wil; either becauſe they haue nothing
to looſe, or becauſe the ſtate of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is not rightly propounded vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
or els not explicated, what that power of
Ordinary may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyne in it ſelf, or what
penaltyes may thereupon enſue: Yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe who vnderſtand the matter,
and are men iudicious, and withall of
meanes, there will hardly be one found,
who will not thinke as we do.</p>

of foure points, whereof we conceiue

which is of your Authority as Ordinary,
deliuered by you vnto vs in theſe words:
<q>As for the Authority, wherewith I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded

whole ſcope of the ſecond part of your
Lordſhips letter, argue your Lordſhip to
aſſume your Authority ouer the Lay Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques,
to be as great in England and
Scotland, as any Ordinaries exerciſed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17863:13"/>

exerciſed in Cath. Countreys. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of this aſſumed Authority concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Laity, we ſhall humbly craue
leaue to lay open to your Lordſhip. Firſt,
an Ordinary hath power of queſtioning

are to be taken vpon oath, and
ſentences and cenſures will follow. Now
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies of this nature haue mixture
with temporall Authority, concerning

by our temporall Lawes &amp; Statutes ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
altered, and directed both in the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

as hath ſeemed conuenient to the Church
and ſtate of theſe Kingdomes from tyme

as innouation is moſt dangerous, as being
contrary both to diuers ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
lawes. Now, ſince the erecting of a
tribunal about the adminiſtring &amp; courſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17863:14"/>
of iuſtice eyther diſtinct, and much more
if it be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to our lawes, is an offence

Treatiſe intituled, <hi>The Iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a</hi> Deuine
<hi>vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 3. Gentlemens Letter to my Lord
Biſhop of Chalcedon,</hi> I tooke and read it,
thinking to find ſomewhat more then Ordinary
in it. For hauing heard much talke of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(being now in euery mans mouth) &amp; ſeene
alſo ſomething written, but not to much pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
now finding a Booke, with the Title of a
<hi>Deuine,</hi> I preſumed he would ſay ſomething
more then others had done. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I came to
read him, I found him, but like other men of
his owne ſyde; and particulerly ſo like the Lay
Gentleman, T. M. his Iudgement vpon the
ſame Letter, that I began to thinke it might be
<pb facs="tcp:17863:22"/>
the very ſame man; the style, diſcourſe, and
as I may ſay, ſpirit, wherewith both are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
being the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And that becauſe then, that ſeeming to
be but ſome Lay Gentlemans doing, men made
ſmall account of it, not vouchſafing it ſo much
as one word of anſwere; Now the ſame party
would ſpeake a little lowder to be heard, writing
ouer the ſame ſomewhat more dilatedly, and
inſerting a little Latin in ſome places, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vpon him the perſon of a <hi>Deuine,</hi> for the
ſubstance of both, is the ſame; and accuſing
worthy Catholique Gentlemen of <hi>Paſſion, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity,
Pretenſe of daunger, Partiality
to Regulars, want of reſpect to Epiſcopal
Authority,</hi> and the like: and all this vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with ſo litle reaſon &amp; truth on the one ſide,
and ſo much gall and bitternes on the other as
that I could not but be ſorry, and aſhamed to
ſee ſuch a thing with the Title of a <hi>Deuine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if ſuch manner of writing ill be ſeeme
any Christian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how much worſe a <hi>Deuine,</hi>
who is to be a light of the world, teaching men
ſobriety, and temper, by word and example, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
truth and reaſon with him, in what he
ſayth and writeth; and deliuering it in ſuch
ſort, as the manner may not betray the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb facs="tcp:17863:22"/>
by ſhewing any distempered affection. For
euen that will much derogate from his writing,
though what he writeth ſhould otherwiſe be
true. For euery man knoweth what a myst Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is wont to cast before mens eyes, and how
hard it is for a paſsionate man to ſpeake truth,
and nothing but truth. And this is ſo much
more daungerous, where it concerneth the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
&amp; reputation of other men: which how nice
a point it is, and how ſoone, &amp; how grieuouſly
a man may offend in it, no <hi>Deuine</hi> can be
ignorant; and eſpecially, when the party diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth
but ſo much of himſelfe as may gayne
himſelfe credit, and thereby giue more force
to the ſlaunder, or imputation (as the wryter
doth, stiling himſelfe <hi>Deuine;)</hi> and on the
other ſyde ſo concealing his particuler perſon,
that the partyes grieued know not of whome to
complayne, nor where to haue remedy.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it was to be expected of a
<hi>Deuine,</hi> that he ſhould handle the matter
ſubstantially and ſolidly, I found no ſuch thing
heere, but euen the very mayne Queſtion for
the most part mistated. For the Controuerſy
being of the Authority of <hi>Ordinary,</hi> as <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi>
how it may stand with the ſafety of
Catholiques in theſe tymes, and vnder theſe
<pb facs="tcp:17863:23"/>
lawes; the writer flyeth from it to Epiſcopall
Authority in generall, Obedience to lawfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours,
Gouernement of the Church, and the
like; whereof no man maketh any doubt. Or if
he happen a litle to touch the point, he doth but
touch it, and ſo ſlenderly, that any man may ſee
he hath not much confidence in his cauſe, but
ſeeketh rather to carry it by the Title, then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a <hi>Deuine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore finding my ſelfe euery way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
of my expectation, both for the matter
and manner; and conſidering on the one ſide
the harme, which euen the bare Name, or Title
of a <hi>Deuine</hi> might do, among many that looke
not farre into things, and the wrong that it
might do to thoſe three worthy Perſons, and
zealous Catholiques in particuler, agaynst
whome this writyng is chiefly intended, and to
the cauſe of Catholiques in generall; I thought
best to make ſome anſwere to it, though I be
both least fit of a thouſand, &amp; that this courſe of
writing be for the moſt part diſallowed by wiſe
men, as being a thing that doth miniſter more
matter of diſſention, and keepeth thoſe things
longer on foot, which were better buryed.</p>
                  <p>For ſome anſwere must be ſometymes made,
leaſt ſuch men thinke they haue wonne the field:
<pb facs="tcp:17863:23"/>
and indeed the ſilence of the one ſyde, ſeemeth
to haue made the other take more hart, and to
ſpeake, and to write more freely, becauſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they thinke men will still be as temperate
of their pennes, as they haue beene, and are
still, of their tongues. But they muſt think that
this extreme heate of writing will force men
ſomewhat to alter their courſe: hoping that the
neceſsity of a iust defence may plead their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
&amp; that the end of this Warre wilbe Peace,
which is my deſire alſo, &amp; intention in this my
Anſwere: which the God of Peace vouchſafe
to graunt vs. And ſo I come to the matter:
which as the <hi>Deuine</hi> diuideth into fiue Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
the first ſhewing the Letter to proceed
from paſsion; the 2. from Temerity; the 3. the
motiues to be humane and worldly; the 4. that
the temporall daungers are meerely pretended;
the 5. that their cauſe of publique diſauowing
the Biſhops Authority, is pretended &amp; feigned:
ſo ſhall I endeauour in ſo many Sections, to
ſhew all the Contrary.</p>

in it. The one is the word <hi>Iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> which
doth ſound ſomewhat authoritatiuely,
inſinuating, as if the writer were a Iudge
or Superiour; for to ſuch only it properly
belongeth to giue iudgment: whereby
though perhaps he would gayne himſelfe
and his writing credit, ſo to further my
Lord Biſhops cauſe, which he handleth;
yet he is beſt to looke he do him not more
harme. For by making himſelfe a man of
ſuch Authority, he may make it to be
thought, that he is my Lord Biſhop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
or ſome one of his officers, but only
that men preſume more of the diſcretion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17863:25"/>
of ſuch Officers, and much more of my
Lord Biſhop himſelf, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they would
write, or euer ſuffer ſuch a thing to be
written with their priuity. Wherefore
though he take vpon him to giue iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
yet I will take him not to be a man of
iudgement: I meane, that hath any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Authority, then his knowledge of
Diuinity will affoard him, and ſo I ſhall
in this anſwere ſpeake to him as to a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,</hi>
not as a Iudge. The other thing of
the Title, is, that he calleth the Letter of
the Lay Catholiques, the Letter of the 3.
Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who vndertooke the deliuery
of it. Wheras it is well knowne that moſt
Catholiques of worth in, and about Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
at the tyme of the deliuery of it, were
priuy to it, and that theſe 3. were but
choſen out of a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, as men moſt
fit in al reſpects to vndertake the deliuery
of it; wherof I ſhall haue occaſion to ſay
more hereafter in this anſwer. Only this
I ſay here, becauſe hereupon as he calleth
it the 3. Gentlemens Letter, I meane to cal
it more truly, the lay Catholiques Letter.</p>

proceed from paſſion.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Deuines</hi> firſt Section, is wholy
to proue this Letter to proceed from
paſſion. Wherin a man might aske him,
what paſſion? But becauſe I will not
ſtumble him to much at firſt, nor intend
ſo much to vrge him as anſwere, I let that
paſſe. His firſt reaſon is, becauſe theſe Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
take no notice (as he ſaith) of
any thing but that which diſliketh them:
to wit, my Lord Biſhops Ordinaryſhip,
and exacting approbation of Regulars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
there being diuers other things that in the
<hi>Deuines</hi> iudgment imported them more:
as the validity of their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſions, which
concerned their ſoules good; the Biſhops
care of not increaſing their temporall
troubles, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerned their fortunes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the preſeruing the Biſhops honour &amp;
Authority, which concerned the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
good of our Engliſh Church. This is the
ſubſtance of the firſt paragraph, wherin
he taxeth theſe Gentlemen as if they had
only a mynd to quarrell with my Lord
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17863:26"/>
Biſhop; for ſo he ſaith in the marginall
note. But how falſe this is, may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
if a man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider how many things
there were in that Letter very ſubiect to
exception; which, a man that had bene
diſpoſed to picke quarrels, might haue
made matter of; and among others that
bitter imputation of practiſing and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling,
wherwith his Lordſhip chargeth
Catholiques in generall in his common
Letter 16. October 1627. Which though
no man could but reſent, yet euery man
forbare to ſpeak of, becauſe it was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to that end, which they ſet before
them in writing this Letter: which end
of theirs, if it had beene, as this <hi>Deuine</hi>
imagineth, this had beene the firſt thing
in the whole Letter to take hold of: and
this is the very reaſon why they medled
not with thoſe other matters, wherwith
this <hi>Deuine</hi> would faine haue had them
trouble themſelues. Beſides that, there be
other reaſons, which a man might eaſily
bring: as for that of the validity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
that they ſaw not any colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
reaſon of doubt; yet they prayed
his Lordſhippe (in whoſe power it was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17863:26"/>
with a word ſpeaking, or rather not ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a word) not to bring them into fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
trouble, then they had bene in his
Predeceſſours tyme and before. And for
their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall ſtate, they ſaw wel inough,
all my Lords aduiſe would nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
them, ſo long as he had the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he challenged. Beſides that, in their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
matters they can better aduiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
then any man els can; that being
their owne element. And laſtly, for the
not belieuing euill ſpeaches againſt the
Biſhop, they ſaw it was a needles thing
to mention it, being a knowne point of
Chriſtian duty, not to heare any man ill
ſpoken of, much leſſe a Biſhop, if they
ſhould cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to meete with any ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
which they neuer do, they and
their friends abhorring ſuch way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond proofe of paſſion is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Biſhop offering further ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
concerning his Authority to any
man that would aske it, theſe Gentlemen
did not aske it. It is true indeed; hauing
ſeene my Lord Biſhops publique clayme
of that Authority, it was no tyme for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:17863:27"/>
to go, and aske a priuate gloſſe or Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which would little auaile them,
when ſuch a Letter ſhould be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them. But let this <hi>Deuine</hi> aske my
L. Biſhop, Whether he were neuer deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to make it knowne, what Authority
he had? I am ſure his Lordſhip wil not
deny but he was many tymes: but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
would, til he declared it in this publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
manner. If my Lord then meant to
giue them ſufficient ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in priuate,
why did he not do it in priuate, while me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
did deſire it, and while there was tyme?
Beſides, ſuppoſe my Lord would haue
written a Letter, he might haue forborne
to ſpeake ſo plainly of his Ordinaryſhip,
only inuiting thoſe that deſired to know
his Authority to come priuatly vnto him.
And for that which this <hi>Deuine</hi> ſaith, that
my Lord could not informe them ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
of his Authority in ſo ſhort a Letter,
I ſe not what reaſon there is for it. I dare
ſay his Letter is 5. tymes at leaſt as long as
his Patents, or Breue, and Inſtructions,
the ſight whereof would haue ſerued the
turne without all this writing &amp; doing.
Which being ſo eaſy a matter, &amp; th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t yet
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17863:27"/>
his Lordſhip would not do it, they might
well deſpaire of further ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>The third proofe of paſſion is, that as
this <hi>Deuine</hi> ſaith, this Letter ſtretcheth my
Lord Biſhops words vpon the Tenter-hookes,
or rather addeth vnto them, in
ſaying, that the particuler paſſages cyted
and the whole ſcope of the ſecond part of
the Letter, argue his Lordſhip to aſſume
his Authority ouer the lay Catholiques,
to be as great in England and Scotland, as
any Ordinary exerciſed here in England
in Catholique tymes: Whereas my Lord
Biſhop neuer ſpake of Authority ouer lay
Catholiques in Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d; but only to proue
himſelfe Ordinary, brought the Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Letters from ſome Cardinals thus
<hi>Ordinario Angliae &amp; Scotiae.</hi> In which the
<hi>Deuine</hi> complaineth of two Additions,
the one that the Letter ſayth, my Lord
challengeth Authority ouer the laity of
Scotland; the other that it ſayth my Lord
challengeth as much Authority here in
England, as Ordinaries haue had in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyke
tymes. But firſt, the Letter nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtretcheth, nor addeth to my Lords
words; but only maketh a manifeſt and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17863:28"/>
immediate inference vpon, or out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
For it ſaith, his Lordſhip words argue him
to aſſume &amp;c. Which plainely ſhewes
that they do not charge his Lordſhip with
ſaying ſo in expreſſe termes, but ſaying,
that out of which, as antecedent, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
is manifeſtly gathered. Now there
is great difference betweene an inference
and an Addition, as euery body know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Secondly, if the <hi>Deuine</hi> would haue
anſwered, and not cauelled, he ſhould
haue ſhewed the Concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to be wel
&amp; truly deduced out of his Lordſhips an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent,
&amp; then he had ſayd ſomewhat
to the purpoſe. But that he cannot do. For
if my L. Biſhop out of the Inſcription <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinario
Angliae</hi> do proue himſelf Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
&amp; out of this inferre, himſelfe to haue
authority ouer Lay Catholiks of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
why may he not do the lyke of the words
<hi>Ordinario Scotiae,</hi> which Title his Lordſhip
vſeth continually, and ioyntly with the
word <hi>Angliae</hi> thus, <hi>Ordinarius Angliae &amp;
Scotiae?</hi> Thirdly his Lordſhips pate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts make
no difference betweene the faithfull of
England and Scotland. Wherfore if he
challenge authority ouer the one, he may
do it ouer the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:17863:28"/>
For the other Addition, as this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine</hi>
ſayth, or Inference, as in truth it is,
of aſſuming the ſame Authority, which
Ordinaries haue exerciſed heere in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
tymes, what can the <hi>Deuine</hi> ſay
to it? Is it not truly and euidently infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?
My Lord Biſhop ſayth the Pope ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
him as abſolute Ordinary in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
as other Ordinaries in their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes;
and this <hi>Deuine,</hi> acknowledgeth
him, to haue as much as any Ordinary
hath, or can haue in his Dioceſſe. But our
Ordinaryes heere in Catholicke tymes
were no more, but as other Ordinaries in
their Dioceſſes, nor had more then any
Ordinary hath, or may haue in his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> my Lord Biſhop (ſuppoſing
theſe his Lordſhips premiſes) hath the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
Authority, that Catholique Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
haue had heere in England in Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
tymes: Or by the challenging that
Authority of other Ordinaries, or what
they haue, or may haue, he challengeth
the ſame that Ordinaries haue had in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
tymes. What fault is there in this
Argument? Why then doth this <hi>Deuine</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ryfle thus? As if theſe two were not all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17863:29"/>
one; The Authority which an Ordinary
hath, or may haue in his Dioceſſe; and
which an Ordinary had in tymes paſt
heere in England? Had our Biſhops more
heere, then an Ordinary may haue elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where?
Did he perhaps thinke, that no
man would euer vouchſafe to anſwere,
or perhaps read this paper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Where is now
the paſſion in ſtretching, and adding of
words? But becauſe it may moreouer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
that this inference of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which Ordinaries had heretofore,
did not proceed from paſſion, I will ad
a reaſon why mention was made of our
Ordinaries of former tymes in England;
which is this: That they, who wrote the
Letter, came better to be acquaynted
with what belongs to the Authority of
Ordinary, and how farre it extendeth it
ſelfe, by that which Ordinaryes were
wont to do heere in England, and which
for the moſt part they do ſtill in the ſame
Courts heere eſtabliſhed, then what Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries
do abroad, which we heere, are
not ſo well acquainted withall.</p>
                     <p>And from hence commeth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
to another obiected Addition, in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17863:29"/>
that this Letter ſaith, that ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
as were ſpoken of immediatly before
in the Letter, haue mixture with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Authority, and concerne temporall
fortunes, and receiue alſo temper from
our temporall lawes &amp;c. This the <hi>Deuine</hi>
according to his former ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ſpeach,
calleth an Addition to his Lordſhips
words; who, he ſayth, ſayd nothing of
temporall fortunes, nor Authority of
temporal Princes. As for the word <hi>(Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition)</hi>
it ſuteth yet farre leſſe in this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
then before. True it is, the Biſhop
did not ſpeake of temporall fortunes and
lawes; but he ſpake of that, which hath
neceſſary connexion with them: which
is his Ordinaryſhip. Which connexion,
though the Biſhop perhaps did not ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
reflect vpon, as a thing, that
might hinder the exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his power; yet
Lay-men, whome it concerned, could
not but looke about them, to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
hooked in, vpon a ſuddayne, by
Tytle of an Ordinary, which bringeth
after it all this, that is mentioned in the
Lay mens Letter, and which with all reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
they repreſent to the conſideration
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17863:30"/>
of my Lo. Biſhop, of whoſe loue towards
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were ſo well perſwaded, that
they did not doubt, but vpon the very
firſt repreſentation of the inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes,
perplexityes, and daungers, which
that Authority did bring with it, his
Lordſhip would preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly deſiſt from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
claime of it. Howſoeuer theſe daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to them, were a very ſufficient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement
to diſclaime from it as they
did. Now where is this Inference forced?
Doth not my Lord Biſhop ſay abſolutly,
he is Ordinary, or hath as much power,
as any Authority may haue in his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe?
May not others then ſay, what the
power of ſuch an Ordinary is? and what
inconuenience may come to themſelues
by it in ſome particular circumſtances?
What force or ſtrayning is heere? Oh,
my Lord Biſhop (will the <hi>Deuine</hi> ſay)
ſpake only of his Authority, to vrge ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of Regulars. True; that is the
occaſion indeed. But doth not his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
by that occaſion, chalenge the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and full power which an Ordinary
hath, or may haue? Doth not all that he
bringeth, proue his Ordinaryſhip abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17863:30"/>
without limitation of cauſe, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
if his proofes were good? Might
not Lay-men plainly ſay; my Lord meant
more of them, whome he tooke to be his
proper ſubiects, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hen of them, who were
exempt? And if his Lordſhip had meant
only to clayme Authority ouer Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
in the matter of approbation, he
might haue anſwered plainely and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely,
reſtrainyng all to them. But I
ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake more of this
by and by.</p>
                     <p>The 4. argument of paſſion is, that
they deny my Lord Biſhop all Authority,
not onely temporall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſpirituall; and
vnder pretence of their temporall For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
they would be <hi>Oues ſine Paſtore.</hi> If
I would be captious with this <hi>Deuine,</hi> I
could aske him, where this Letter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth
my Lord Biſhop to be Ordinary;
or where it ſpeaketh of his Lordſhips te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
Authority? But I will not preſſe
him further in that. But for his ſpirituall
Authority, or rather the power in <hi>fore
interno</hi> (for indeed all the power of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
as he is a Biſhop, is ſpirituall, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
properly) where do they deny it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:17863:31"/>
Or if they do not ſpeake of it, hauing no
occaſion, and it being from the purpoſe,
doth it follow that they deny it? He may
haue that, though he be no Ordinary,
nor haue power in <hi>foro externo.</hi> How then
doth the deniall of the former infer the
deniall of the latter? Is not heere ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of wordes, or forcing inferences?
And much more in that, as this <hi>Deuine</hi>
ſaith, we would be <hi>Oues ſine Paſtore.</hi> Haue
we beene <hi>Oues ſine Pastore</hi> now aboue. 60.
yeares, wherin we haue had no Biſhop?
Nay, haue we not ſo much more had a
Paſtor, as we haue more immediatly been
gouerned by the Paſtor of Paſtours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing
immediate influence from the
ſea Apoſtolique? But more of this anone.</p>
                     <p>The 5. Argument of paſſion is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they omit the principall point,
which the Biſhop handleth: which was
his full Authority to exact approbation
of Regulars, and take hold of the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary,
which was his Ordinaryſhip. And
neere the Deuine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineth, they tooke
no notice whether he had ſatisfied them
or no. Well, what paſſion was it for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
to leaue that, that concerned
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17863:31"/>
them not ſo immediatly, though it were
the principall point, and touch that,
which concerned them more, though it
were but ſecondarily intended? To what
end ſhould they take notice of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in a thing, in which they needed
none, as making no doubt of it? For, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
there had been any litle ſhaddow of
probability of my Lord Biſhops pretence,
yet ſo many good and learned men, as
there were heere, of Regulars, nay and
of all moderate and learned of the ſecular
Clergy, affirming the contrary, &amp; euen
my Lord Biſhop not ventring, to ſay to
the contrary, at leaſt to ſome perſons, but
that Confeſſions made to Regulars were
good; what doubt could any prudent
man make, of the validity of his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions?
The Authority of any one or two
learned men, being ſufficient for a wiſe
man to lay aſide all ſcruple of that kind:
what needed therfore all that ado? And
the rather becauſe it was a matter of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
they would not trouble themſelues
further, then to deſire his Lordſhip not
to put them to further trouble then his
predeceſſor, or himſelfe had hitherto put
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17863:32"/>
them vnto: in which they ſhew, though
not in expreſſe termes, how they were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with his Lordſhips Letter in that
point, eſpecially laying his Authority of
Ordinary for grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of that claime: what
paſſion then is heere? But now, if a man
would ſtand vpon it, it might perhaps be
proued that my Lord did intend no leſſe
principally to declare his Ordinaryſhip,
and by this occaſion to make open chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
of his Authority in that kind. For
what elſe doth the greateſt part of his
Letter pretend? Why doth he write ſo
largely to the layty of a matter, which
doth not ſo properly belong vnto them,
but only to put needleſſe ſcruples into
their heads? And with all to make ſome
anſwere to the Laity, who not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had been very inſtant to know his
Authority more preciſely, though his
Lordſhip could not be met withall, to
haue their demaunds deliuered to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?
But becauſe theſe are coniectures,
I will not ſtand vpon them: only this I
may ſay, if his Lordſhips intent had not
been to clayme that Authority, he might
preſently haue diſclaymed it, and there
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17863:32"/>
had beene an end.</p>
                     <p>The ſixt Argument of notorious paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
(our <hi>Deuine</hi> ſayth) is this, that they
incenſe the State againſt the Biſhop, by
ſaying that the execution of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of this new Tribunall, will prouoke
the preſent Gouernmeut vnto an exact
ſearch after it, and ſuppreſſion thereof;
and ſo bringeth a clauſe of <hi>Bulla Coenae</hi> to
proue them excommunicated therfore,
&amp; asketh, why elſe this Letter was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the King? This is a ſtrange point
of Diuinity, that a man ſhall incurre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
for repreſenting vnto
the Biſhop, the daunger which by clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
ſuch Authority he bringeth vpon
himſelfe, and other men. This is a thing
allowable by the lawes of God and man:
and how then doth it deſerue excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication?
Is this to prouoke the ſtate to
perſecute? No ſurely: but to moue the
Biſhop not to prouoke the State againſt
himſelfe and others: &amp; as for publiſhing
the Letter, and cauſing it to be ſhewed to
the King, if it were ſo, this <hi>Deuines</hi> intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
is better then mine. Howſoeuer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it was no more then needed, for men to

declare themſelues ſomewhat in a more
publique manner, that Authority being
ſo publiquely claymed, which would
bring ſo many daungers vpon them. And
ſome great Officers haue been knowne to
ſay ſince, that it was tyme for Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
to do as they did; for that otherwiſe
they might haue ſmarted for it. Wherein
then doth paſſion notoriouſly appeare in
this matter, vnleſſe it be that this <hi>Deuine</hi>
will haue all to proceed from paſſion
which lyketh him not. And ſo hauing
cleered this Letter of paſſion, I might
aske this <hi>Deuine,</hi> what temper he was in,
when be called this graue, ſubſtantiall &amp;
humble Letter, no anſwere, but a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
defy of the Biſhops Authority? What
is there in the whole Letter that hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
a ſhadow of defiance? Doth not the
whole manner &amp; phraſe import as much
reſpect and humility, as ſuch matter can
poſſibly affoard? Can defyance ſtand
with humility and reſpect? Why then
ſhould this <hi>Deuine</hi> call it a defye? What
Law giueth him this liberty? Let him
looke home a litle and ſee whether he be
not liable in what he accuſeth others. I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17863:33"/>
leaue it to himſelf to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, for I wil not
ſo take vpon me to play the Iudge. And
heer is an end of the 1. Section of paſſion,
I pray God there be an end of that paſſion

                     <head>SECT. 2. That the lay Catholiques
Letter is free from Temerity.</head>
                     <p>THE firſt point of Temerity allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by this <hi>Deuine</hi> is, becauſe they
being Lay and priuate men do take vpon
them to iudge publiquely, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
their Paſtor: which is as much as
by fact to iuſtify, &amp; euen far to ſurpaſſe
the Oath of Supremacy, which giueth
power to the Prince to iudge of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
perſons: and heere priuate and Lay
men take the ſame vpon them, in ſaying
the Biſhop aſſumeth Authority ouer Lay
Catholiques, which he interpreteth vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping;
and ſo bringeth a place out of <hi>S.
Ambroſe</hi> to ſhew that Lay-men, euen
Emperors muſt not Iudge. Heere you ſee
the <hi>Deuine</hi> waxeth warme in his Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeat: but let him be carefull he do
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17863:34"/>
not condemne men without cauſe. For
his Diuinity may teach him, that, that is
a dangerous thing. Well; let vs ſee where
is this grieuous crime, worſe then the
Oath of ſupremacy? For priuate men to
iudge a Biſhop, it is true, it is a heynous
matter, but yet by this <hi>Deuines</hi> leaue, far
ſhort of taking ſuch an Oath, which is
the denyall of a mans fayth. And therfore
this I ſuppoſe was but to ſhew a little of
his Rhetorike. But for all that, he muſt
not let his Rhetorike go before his Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſee wherin do they iudg?
becauſe they ſay he aſſumeth this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
which, ſaith this <hi>Deuine,</hi> is as much
as to vſurpe Authority. But if his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
had ſtretched ſo far, he might haue
found out a more benigne interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
conſidering with himſelfe, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of finding a fit word for this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
For the queſtion being, of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
Authority, they could not vſe any
ſuch word, as might importe, that in
their iudgments his Lordſhip had it. For
that were in a ſort to acknowledge it,
contrary to the purpoſe of their Letter;
beſides, they had no ground, but his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17863:34"/>
Lordſhips owne word to thinke that he
had it. In which caſe they might ſay that
he aſſumeth it, as well as to ſay his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
ſayth he hath it: for that would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that they did not build vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
word, which would haue been as
ill taken: and to ſay, he did take it vpon
him, would haue beene worſe taken, as
being neerer to vſurpation. Thirdly they
could not preſume him to haue the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
For though he were Ordinary,
he muſt ſhew his Letters of his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Confirmation, as the Canons
require. Or if perchance his Lordſhip
ſhould pretend difficulties, that he durſt
not bring in ſuch things, &amp; that he may
as wel be belieued as Prieſts that come in
heere without written teſtimonies, yet
there might ſome meanes, or other be
found out and vſed, to giue men ſome
probability of aſſurance. But much more
being a Delegate, as it is certaine he is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For both Canon and ciuill lawes require
that a man in that caſe ſhew his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in writing. For it is an axiome that
<hi>Iuriſdictio delegata non praeſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap>ur, ſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur.</hi>
Now if they cannot preſume ſuch
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17863:35"/>
Authority, his Lordſhip may well be ſayd
to aſſume it. This ſuppoſed, it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne,
that he hath any Authority ouer
them, and conſequently whether he be a
Paſtour or no, &amp; an vncertain Paſtour in
this caſe, is as if he were no Paſtor. How
then do they iudge their Paſtor? Beſides,
what iudging is this, to ſay he taketh ſuch
Authority vpon him? They do not ſay
that he hath it, or hath it not, but ſuppoſe
they thinke he hath it not; the worſt that
any man can make of it, is to ſay, they do
not belieue he hath it. Is this then ſuch a
cryme as to be compared with the Oath
of Supremacy, eſpecially ſince they had
many reaſons to induce them not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
it? Is it not great temerity then in
our <hi>Deuine,</hi> thus raſhly to condemne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
well meaning men, of ſuch a crime
without cauſe?</p>
                     <p>2. The ſecond poynt of temerity is
to teach their Paſtor, what Authority he
muſt not haue; in ſaying that all things
are ſo ſetled, as innouation might breed
daunger, being contrary to diuers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and moderne lawes; ſince the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of a Tribunall diſtinct, or contrary
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17863:35"/>
to our lawes is Treaſon, or <hi>Premunire</hi> at
leaſt, if they haue any priuity or partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
&amp;c. Heere the <hi>Deuine</hi> asketh whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be the part of lay men to tell a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
he muſt haue no Authority contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to a ſetled courſe of ſtate, for matters
of Epiſcopall iuriſdiction; and he asketh
whether this be not to tell him, that he
muſt not haue authority to preach, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm
reconcile &amp;c. And whether innouation
in religion is not as dangerous? with a
great deale more of that kind. But then
he ſayth withall, that thoſe ancient lawes
of <hi>a new Tribunall</hi> are not vnderſtood of a
Catholique Epiſcopall tribunall, but of a
Legatiue, and that therefore the chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of this tribunall is no innouatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but
a reſtitution of ancient Epiſcopall iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
&amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To all which I anſwere; that firſt this
<hi>Deuine</hi> taketh it for granted that my Lord
Biſhop is our Paſtor, certayne and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute;
but of that I ſay nothing til anon, &amp;
ſo I let him vſe his owne la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage in that.
But I muſt tell him heere, he taketh to
much liberty to call the humble aduiſe of
lay Catholiques, or declaration of their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17863:36"/>
owne eaſe, Teaching: which is nothing
but to make them odious, as if they tooke
vpon them with Authority to teach his
Lordſhip; whereas in the very beginning
they humbly craue leaue to declare their
minds, and ſo continue throughout the
whole letter. This is not good dealing for
any honeſt man, much leſſe a <hi>Deuine:</hi> for it
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not come from a good meaning. But we
muſt beare with a hundred ſuch things as
theſe, at this <hi>Deuins</hi> hand. Secondly wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he inferreth <hi>à paritate Rationis,</hi> that
the Biſhop muſt not preach, confirme,
reconcile &amp;c. becauſe theſe are againſt the
ſetled courſe of ſtate, he is miſtaken. The
reaſon is not a like, for theſe are neyther
againſt our ancient lawes, neither do, or
can hinder the ordinary Courts of Iuſtice
heer, &amp; withall theſe things are more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for ſauing of ſoules, for eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and preſeruation of Catholique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Biſhops court, which as things
ſtand, will rather hinder then help. Now
for our auncient lawes which our <hi>Deuine</hi>
ſayth are not againſt a Catholique Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
tribunal (not according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Law-maker, howſoeuer it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17863:36"/>
may be againſt the ſound of the words) I
ſay firſt, that as times ſtand, it is enough
to be againſt the letter of the Law: &amp; our
Proteſtant Iudges and men in Authority
who thinke themſelues fitteſt to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
of the Law, will haue great adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
againſt vs, if they ſhalbe able by the
very words of the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t lawes to bring
vs with in compaſſe of Treaſon, or <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire.</hi>
And if now by word, &amp; writing
they publiſh to the world that we dy not
for Religion, but for Treaſon, although
we ſuffer but by the lawes made in this
time of Proteſtancy, how much more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourably
would they thinke to do it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we ſhall ſuffer by the auncient Lawes,
made and practiſed in Catholique tymes,
and not diſallowed, or contradicted by
the Sea Apoſtolique? And it may be this
very thing, if it had been ſo knowne to
his Holines, as the Catholiks Letter ſaith
well (for it is no diſparagement for any
man to ſay, that he doth not know all
particular Lawes, and Ordinances of all
Countryes) it is moſt probable his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
would neuer haue put the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
into any the leaſt occaſion of ſuch
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17863:37"/>
offence: eſpecially being a thing wholy
needleſſe at this time. Secondly, a man
may perhaps alſo ſay it is againſt the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the law in ſome ſort. For though
it were neuer the meaning of our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Aunceſtors, to hinder the lawfull
exerciſe of Ordinary Eccleſiaſticall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
yet their end was, as this <hi>Deuine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,
to reſtrayne the exerciſe of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
power, or Legatiue, by reaſon
of the diſturbance, which it did many
times cauſe in the vſuall courts of Iuſtice
of this kingdome. Why then may not a
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay, they meane of ſuch power as my
Lord Biſhop would haue heere, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſtate of things? For, heere
be now vſual Eccleſiaſtical courts of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries
or Biſhops: but they are Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
Biſhops, ſay you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I graunt it, but yet in
their Courts they retaine the ſame forme
of iuſtice in great part, the ſame kinds of
cauſes they had aunciently; and though
it be true that they haue not true Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
iuriſdiction, as being Branches cut
of from the roote which is the Sea Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique,
yet they exerciſe it <hi>de facto,</hi> by
the Kings authority, ſo as all, both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17863:37"/>
and Catholiques muſt be ſubiect
vnto them, ſo much as concerneth the
outward gouerment, or <hi>forum externum.</hi>
Now my Lord Biſhops Authority in this
caſe (ſuppoſe it Ordinary for the preſent
for diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſake) is of no leſſe hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or diſturbance to the Ordinary
Courts, and courſe of Iuſtice, then was
Legatiue in ancient times; nay more: for
the Legatiue court was a Superiour court
and therfore did not medle in Ordinary
and dayly matters, but in ſome particuler
caſes and euents.</p>
                     <p>Whereas my Lord Biſhops Court, if
he were Ordinary, would anſwere <hi>ex
aequo,</hi> as I may ſay and directly to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
ſpirituall Courts heer, and might
challenge the hearing and determining
of all cauſes, as due to it ſelfe, excluding
the other, as vſurper. In which reſpect I
thinke, that as this <hi>Deuine</hi> ſayth the law-makers
neuer intended to hinder the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Catholique Epiſcopall iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
ſo I am of opinion with him
thus farre, though they would not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it when tyme ſhould be for it, ſo yet
that in ſuch tyme, and circumſtances as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17863:38"/>
now we are in, and ſo long as it were not
in their power to hinder, but that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
ſhould b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>are the ſway as they do,
they would neuer haue lyked the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, in ſuch manner as his Lordſhip
deſireth. To which though I am the rather
induced by conſidering how the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Biſhops, who in Queene Maryes ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
exerciſed their Authority, and kept
their courts, vpon the ſuppreſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and their Authority, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of others in their place, forbare
the exerciſe thereof, as hurtful rather
then any way vſefull; nay euen impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Thirdly, not to ſtand gueſſing what
would haue been the mind of the Law-makers
in this particular caſe, ſuppoſe
my Lord of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> were Ordinary
heer; to come to the true playne meaning
of the Law, which this our <hi>Deuine</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth,
to wit, that by it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
the exerciſe of a legatiue tribunal;
I ſay, this law preciſely and directly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
his Lordſhips Court, which he
would erect. For though be not a legate <hi>à


latere,</hi> yet he is a Delegate of the Sea A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique,
and his power is of the ſame
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17863:38"/>
kinde with Legatiue, though inferiour
vnto it. And this is manifeſt by the words
of his owne Letter, ſaying, he is <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
not <hi>Ordinario modo,</hi> but <hi>extraordinario
modo,</hi> as Legats, <hi>Nuncio's,</hi> and the like,
though he be not yet ſo truly Ordinary as
any of them, whoſe power is expreſſed in
the Canon Law, his Lordſhips power
being wholy out of the Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Courſe.
Therfore the law is much more againſt it
then againſt the power of a Legate. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the very manner of conferring
the Authority, by ſpeciall Commiſſion,
doth manifeſtly ſhew him to be a Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate:
for that is proper to Delegation.
Thirdly he hath his Iuriſdiction ad <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placitum;</hi>
which is eſſentiall to Delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But what need I ſtand further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ſo manifeſt a thing, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as both his
commiſſion hath the expreſſe word <hi>Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus,</hi>
and his Holines his <hi>Nuncio</hi> of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
in a Letter vnder his owne hand, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedons
Breue,</hi> ſayth, <hi>Delegationis ſuae Breue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter
ostendit &amp;c.</hi> &amp; by word of mouth,
he did not only tell diuers that will iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
it, that my Lord was not Ordinary, but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17863:39"/>
proued alſo by the Cannons, that he
could not be Ordinary. His Lordſhips
Power then being rather Legatiue then
Ordinary, and euen not that legatiue,
which is expreſſed <hi>in iure,</hi> and whoſe
power in that reſpect is called Ordinary,
becauſe it is belonging to the office of a
legate by law, it is plaine that the ancient
Law doth properly touch his Lordſhips
power and Tribunall. For ſuppoſe when
<hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> was Catholique, a man had come
in hither, (all the Biſhopricks being ful)
with ſuch a ſpeciall title and commiſſion,
and chalenging ſuch Authority heere as
his Lordſhip now doth, what would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Biſhops ſay? In what Ordinary Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall
ſhould he ſit? Muſt he not erect
himſelfe a new one? Nay ſuppoſe his
Lordſhip ſhould haue byn Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
and one come in as he doth Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> by ſpeciall Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
would not his Lordſhip think that
man to offend againſt this ancient law in
ſuch a caſe? And whoſoeuer ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
or ſubmit himſelfe to ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
liable to the penalty there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed?
Certainly he would. And why
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17863:39"/>
not then in this caſe? You will ſay now
there be no Catholique Ordinaries, as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
there would be. What then, ſay I againe?
Doth that alter my Lord of <hi>Chalcedons</hi>
Authority? Doth not that remaine the
ſame in it ſelfe ſtill without cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
the others be? Is not their change
meerely accidentall to his Authority? For
he is ſtill Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> &amp; hath the
ſame commiſſion. If then that would be
againſt that law, now it is. What temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is it then in Catholiks, to aduertiſe my
Lord of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> what danger he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
vpon himſelfe, &amp; others, by erecting
this new Tribunal, which they may truly
call Innouation, as being a thing without
Preſident in our nation, and contrary to
our ancient Laws, &amp; therfore no reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Ordinary Epiſcopall iuriſdiction,
as the <hi>Deuine</hi> would haue it: though ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it were truly and properly reſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Ordinary Epiſcopall iuriſdiction, and
conſequently, not againſt the ancient
Lawes, yet would it be againſt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne,
which threaten ſo many &amp; ſo great
dangers, that a man may very wel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
note of temerity declare them, &amp; vſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17863:40"/>
what means they can to auoyd them. I
could heer note how ſome friends of this
<hi>Deuine,</hi> I meane ſome of the Appellants in
<hi>Clement</hi> the VIII. his time, vrged theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
lawes againſt the Authority of the
Archprieſt, then appointed by that Pope,
though that were no externall iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
nor ouer the Laity; how much more then
may they be vrged againſt my Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Chalcedons</hi> which he prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds? But
I ſay no more of it.</p>
                     <p>3. The 3. poynt of Temerity wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
this <hi>Deuine</hi> chargeth Catholikes is,
in that they cenſure the ſea Apoſtolique,
as he ſayth, and 2. moſt wiſe Popes, by
ſaying, that if theſe their dangers, togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their long ſufferinges, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſtate of miſeries had ben conſidered
abroade, they preſume no ſuch Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
woulde haue beene impoſed vpon
them: as if, ſayth he, the ſea Apoſtolique
had not conſidered the daungers which
might come to Lay Catholiques by Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall
Authority. And then he asketh
why they did not giue, the Sea Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
to vnderſtand theſe daungers, all
that tyme that the Clergy ſtood ſuing for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17863:40"/>
a Biſhop, the Ieſuits oppoſing it? Or all
the tyme that the Biſhop hath been heer,
wherein, as the <hi>Deuine</hi> ſayth, he hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
profeſſed himſelfe Ordinary? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth that it is not the reare
of daunger to themſelues, but their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſionateneſſe
to Regulars, who ſtood in
daunger of Approbation, that moueth
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this. This is the <hi>Deuines</hi> diſcourſe,
and a very good and likely one it is, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth,
becauſe the Catholiques ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
if their daungers had beene conſidered
(to vſe the <hi>Deuines</hi> words) abroad, they
preſume they ſhould not haue had ſuch
Authority impoſed vpon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therfore
they ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſure the ſea Apoſtolike. This man
is ſo much in giuing iudgment, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring,
that all that any man elſe ſayth,
ſeemeth to him to be cenſuring. What is
there heere any way condemning the Sea
Apoſtolique? Nay rather, do not Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
in this, ſhew the great confidence
they haue of the loue and tendernes, that
the Sea Apoſtolicke beareth towards
them? Which induceth them to thinke,
that if their caſe had been fully made
knowne, it would no way do a thing, ſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17863:41"/>
preiudiciall vnto them: where it is to be
noted, that beſides the <hi>Deuines</hi> ordinary
liberty of terming thinges as he liſteth to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; wreſting words to a worſe
ſenſe, heer he corrupteth the text, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to ground his accuſation of Temerity.
For in thoſe copies that I haue ſeen of this
Letter, there was not the word <hi>[Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red]</hi>
but the word <hi>[Vnderstood]</hi> which is
no way ſubiect to exception. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
ſuppoſe the <hi>Deuines</hi> copy
had the word <hi>[Conſidered]</hi> which yet a
man may doubt of, none elſe hauing
ſo, it may very well carry the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.
Which ſuppoſed, what Temerity, or
what Cenſure is it, to ſay, if the Pope did
vnderſtand our caſe &amp;c. May not the
Pope be ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of many particular laws
or Statutes of a Kingdome ſo remote in
place, and ſo different in manners and
language, and eſpecially in this tyme of
Proteſtancy, as this Kingdome is? He
being a man, and hauing none but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
meanes to know thinges, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know our affaire; by himſelfe but by
information of others: and it ſeemeth
they haue beene ſuch men as were more
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17863:41"/>
carefull to proſecute their owne ends,
then ſeeke our good, and therefore would
make no more knowne of our caſe then
might ſtand with their pretences: &amp; now
that we come to ſpeake for our ſelues, &amp;
to make knowne our owne caſe, for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that if it had beene ſo vnderſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
we are calumniated, as if we did
temerariouſly ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſure the Sea Apoſtolique:
What dealing is this? But becauſe this
<hi>Deuine</hi> doth thus grieuouſly accuſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
for Temerity in cenſuring the
Sea Apoſtolique, I would willingly aske
him a queſtion in his eare, whether he do
know a man in the world, that hath been
often heard to ſay, before there was a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
that the Pope was bound vnder
paine of mortall ſinne to let the Engliſh
Clergy haue a Biſhop, and conſequently
it euidently followeth, that in the ſame
<hi>Deuines</hi> iudgment, in not granting one,
he did ſinne mortally. If he do not know
ſuch a man, I can tel him who he is; and
vouch for my ſelfe, one of the Clergy it
ſelfe, and a man of chiefe Authority vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my Lord Biſhop, and of great credit
with him for his forwardnes and zeale in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17863:42"/>
the cauſe. Now whether this be not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring,
let any man iudge? For, what
greater cenſure can there be then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the chiefe Paſtour of Gods Church
of a mortal ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And of a mortall ſinne,
nor ſo much in matter of fact, which
might depend of information, and ſo be
ſomewhat excuſable, but in matter of
Iudgment, or error in a Doctrinal poynt,
which cannot be excuſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as whether
the law of God require the hauing a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
or not, heere in England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at this

to mollify the word, ſuppoſe it had
beene a little harſh. They impute no
crime, they ſhew aſſurance of loue and
tenderneſſe, and of great wiſdome and
maturity in counſel; and yet this is cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring.
And wheras he accuſeth Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
alſo for Cenſuring two moſt wiſe
Popes, of doing what they vnderſtood
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17863:42"/>
not, I might anſwere him likewiſe that
he condemneth all the Popes that went
before theſe two; for the ſpace of three-ſcore
yeares, to wit Ten moſt graue and
wiſe Popes, who for many and very
waighty reaſons would neuer be drawen
to haue a Biſhop heere, as tymes ſtood.
And the two laſt yelded to the hauing of
a Biſhop, not out of any Scruple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
or feare of tranſgreſſing the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine</hi>
precept, but out of other motiues.
Nay it is moſt like, that they would haue
held the ſame courſe, that ſo many of
their Predeceſſours did holde, but that
they were perſuaded by ſome, that the
tymes were altered: ſo that it might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be now then heertofore: which can
be no fault of the Popes, but of ſuch as
care not what they ſay to compaſſe their
owne ends: and ſo vſed ſuch vnder-hand
dealing, as that thinges were wrought,
without any knowledge, or conſent of
thoſe whom it might heere concerne. For
what did Catholicks heere in England,
know what others were working at
<hi>Rome?</hi> And though they ſhould heare ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of a Biſhop, they might well thinke
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17863:43"/>
the Sea Apoſtolicke, knowing ſomwhat
in general the different ſtate of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
from others at this tyme, would
not ſend hither a Biſhop, with like Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
as in other places, as indeed we
finde ſince this controuerſy began, it was
neuer the meaning of his Holyneſſe,
though this <hi>Deuine</hi> would make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
otherwiſe. They might likwiſe think
that no man of thoſe that did ſue for a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
would ſo far paſſe the boundes of
reaſon, as to deſyre a thing ſo impoſſible
as is a Biſhop heere in England, with the
ſame power that Biſhops are of elſwhere,
and haue beene formerly in England: but
that they would be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent at the furtheſt
with a Biſhop, who might Confirme,
bleſſe Holy Oyles, &amp; gouerne his Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
without challenging a further iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in <hi>foro externo,</hi> which would not
any way proue vſefull, but many wayes
harmefull.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> Oppoſition,
I will not ſay much, but leaue them to
ſpeake for themſelues, as I doubt not but
they can very ſufficiently, in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as they haue done heertofore in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17863:43"/>
occaſions, though in this they need
not ſay much for themſelues; for any
man may ſee, by the <hi>Deuines</hi> manner of
ſpeaking, how well he wiſheth them, &amp;
conſequently how litle, or no credit is to
be giuen to what he ſayth of them. Yet
for this matter in particular although I
neuer had fee to ſpeake for them, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out
of the loue I beare to Innocency, I will
tell a thing of myne owne knowledg,
which as it hath made me belieue, all that
ſuch men ſay of the Ieſuits, to be falſe, ſo
it may well do others: and it is this. I
knew a Prieſt, now a Bleſſed Martyr in
heauen, who long had a mind to enter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, and by falſe ſuggeſtions of
ſome, he was with held for many years.
And at the laſt, when being ſtill more
vehemently moued by Gods holy ſpirit
to proſecute his good deſyres, a greate
man of the Cleargy, who ſhall be name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
in this place, to dehort him, tould
him the Ieſuits made a vow, or an oath
(I know not now well whether) to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the hauing of a Biſhop, which thogh
it cooled the good mans deſyre for the
preſent, yet when he informed himſelfe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17863:44"/>
better, and found that falſe, he belieued
all the other fables that were tould him
to be falſe, as indeed afterwards he alſo
found them. So, I hauing ſeene better
proofe for clearing of the Ieſuits in this
point, then this <hi>Deuines</hi> authority for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
them, will forbeare to belieue any
thing he ſayth of them. Only, If they
ſhould haue hindred it, foreſeeing all this
ſtirre &amp; inconuenience which hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſince the Biſhops co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, who can
wonder if they would haue hindred it, if
they could, though I am moſt credibly
informed they neuer medled not ſpake
word all the tyme it was now laſt in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Heertofore indeed when they were
called to Councell they ſpake what they
thought, as it is the part of any honeſt
man. But this laſt tyme being not called,
they did not ſpeake a word, nor mooue
a foot in it. For, what is it to them? Do
not they liue aſwel where ther be Biſhops
as where there be none? I trow they do:
why then ſhould they hinder it? And
thus much for the <hi>Deuines</hi> third poynt of
Temerity.</p>
                     <p>4. The fourth poynt of Temerity, as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17863:44"/>
he ſayth, is that theſe 3. priuate men erect
a new Tribunall, neuer heard of before,
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which there is no Appeale, in ſaying
that the matter they ſpeake of, viz. of
their dangers, admitteth no further que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
which the <hi>Deuine</hi> interpreteth, as if
they would iudge vpon a Biſhop, and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Eccleſiaſticall Authority, ſo as no further
queſtion is to be made. What a friuolous
obiection is this for a man to make? Or
with what conſcience can he transferr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
their words which they ſpeake of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynty
and manifeſtneſſe of their owne
daungers to ſo different ſenſe, as if they
did take vpon them to iudg of Biſhops &amp;
Eccleſiaſticall Authority, ſo, as if from
them there were no appeale? Nay what
affinity is there betweene the bare affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of a thing, by ſaying it is out of
doubt, and, erecting a new Tribunall?
This mans head is ſo filled with Miters,
that he dreameth of nothing but Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.
This is too to groſſe: and as for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that theſe three priuate men erect a
a new Tribunall, as if it were but the act
of three, I haue touched that before, and
ſhall do agayne afterwards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:17863:45"/>
The 5. point of Temerity he ſaith lyeth
in theſe words, from which (he putteh
this parentheſis of his owne) refuſing the
Biſhops authority) we cannot recede for
the reaſon aforeſayd; which, he ſayth, is
a temerarious profeſſion of diſobedience
not only to the Biſhop their immediate
Paſtour, but alſo to the Pope. That, from
which the Catholickes ſay they cannot
recede, is the ſubſtance of the Letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the difficulty of a Catholike Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
and danger which enſueth thereof
to themſelues, which what diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
can it be? Agaynſt what Authority is it?
for there is no obedience, nor diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
but where there is Authority. What po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
is it that commaundeth men not to
ſpeake the truth in matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> that ſo
much concerne them? What Law, what
Superiour, can abridge them of this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
though he were a knowne Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour?
Much leſſe heere where the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, whether my Lord Biſhop haue Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
ouer Catholiks or not, or what
he may haue, as things ſtand? For to be
bound to obey, there be theſe three things
requiſite at leaſt; that the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17863:45"/>
be poſſible; that the party that
commaundeth be a Superiour; and that
others be ſubiect in that kind, wherein
they are commaunded, or in the matter
of command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for men are not ſubiect to al
Superiors in all kinds, but to one in one
kind, and to another in another. So as
this <hi>Deuine,</hi> ſhoud firſt by proofe haue put
it out of queſtion, that my Lord Biſhop
hath the authority he prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly,
that, that authority can ſtand with the
preſent gouernment and ſtate of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes.
Thirdly, that Catholiks are ſo farre
ſubiect to him in matter of life and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
fortunes, as to hazard all for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
and obeying his Authority.
And hauing made good all this, he might
then haue accuſed them of <hi>Temerarious
Diſobedience.</hi> But till then, it were more
honeſty and wiſdome to forbeare his Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.
And this order was more ſuteable
with the order of the Letter; wherin ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
firſt ſayd they were perſuaded they
could not be bound to hazard the ruine
of their ſtate and poſterity, where the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of profeſſing their fayth doth not
oblige them, they conclude co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17863:46"/>
that they cannot recede &amp;c. But the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine</hi>
had an eye in this to his conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy,
reſeruing this poynt for the laſt, therin to
ſhew his Diuinity, which he hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
made litle ſhew of: and ſo now he
commeth to that which followeth.</p>
                     <p>6. Their 6. point of Temerity, ſayth
the <hi>Deuine,</hi> is in their words; neyther can
we be perſuaded that there is a neceſſity
of conforming our ſelues therunto <hi>(Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall
power)</hi> (obſerue theſe two words of
the <hi>Deuines</hi> owne putting in by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis,
and by way of gloſſe) as to a
matter of fayth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or yet, that we can be
obliged to looſe our ſtate, and ruine our
poſterityes, where the neceſſity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Fayth doth not oblige vs.
Vpon which words the <hi>Deuine</hi> deſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:
asking, what is this, but to get vp
into the Biſhops chayre, and teach him
how far they are obliged; where he ſayth
that as long as they taught, what was
common law, they were to be heard; but
that where they come to teach the duty of
a Chriſtian, they paſſe the duty of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.
And then he teacheth, that it is a
matter of Fayth, that there ought to be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17863:46"/>
Epiſcopall power in Gods Church; and
that the Paſtors are to be obeyed, and that
although particulars be not matter of
fayth, yet men are bound out of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Religion to hould them ſo, where
there is no cauſe of doubt. For, ſayth he,
it ſufficeth that they are obliged to obey
theyr lawfull Paſtour, and that they haue
no reaſonable cauſe to doubt but that the
Biſhop of <hi>Clalcedon</hi> is ſuch to them: and ſo
concludeth, that they erre exceedingly if
they thinke that they are not bound to
conforme themſelues to any thing but
matters of fayth; for that they are bound
to conforme their willes to matters of
religion, obedience, or other vertues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
by God, &amp; his Church, as they
do their vnderſtanding to matter of faith.
Thus the <hi>Deuine</hi> diſcourſeth, more it
ſeemeth to ſhew his Diuinity, then to
ſpeake to the purpoſe: for what needed al
this whereof there is no queſtion; as that
it is the inſtitution of Chriſt, that there
ſhould be Epiſcopall Authority in the
Church; that lawfull Paſtors are to be
obayed; that men are no leſſe bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the
practiſe of other vertues, then the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17863:47"/>
of fayth? Who denieth all this? Or
what was there in the Letter, that being
rightly taken might enforce any ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe?
The Catholickes meaning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is playne that the acknowleging or
obaying ſuch Authority, as my Lord
Biſhop now prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth heere in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
as things ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, is not a matter of neceſſity
to the profeſſion of the Catholike fayth,
or exerciſe of any other vertue neceſſary
for a good Chriſtian. But that they may
be good Catholickes without it, as they
haue approued themſelues before God &amp;
the world theſe 60. yeares: which if it had
been neceſſary, the Sea Apoſtolike would
neuer haue ſuffered them to want a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
ſo long. This was the thing the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine</hi>
ſhould haue touched, without going
about the buſh: now what Temerity is it
for any lay man in the world to ſay this?
Or wherin doth he take vpon him more
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhould? How doth he teach the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop?
or, by ſaying this how doth he paſſe
the duty of a good Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? What crime
is it for a man now in time of hereſy &amp;
perſecution, where the profeſſion and
exerciſe of the Catholique fayth, is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17863:47"/>
to his life and fortune, when he
ſhall be vrged by my Lord Biſhop to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exerciſe or profeſſion therof then is
neceſſary, to make anſwere, that he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
he cannot be bound vnto it? Will
this <hi>Deuine</hi> in good company and before
learned men ſay, he can? No, no, hee
will be better aduiſed whatſoeuer he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.
Nay this thing is ſo playne, and ſo
neceſſarily included in the Common
practiſe of the Catholique fayth, all this
tyme of perſecution, as I wonder this
<hi>Deuine</hi> ſhould thinke it ſuch a matter for
a lay ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeake ſo much Diuinity. He
need not; for his willbe neuer the leſſe,
though all the world know it. And on the
other ſide Catholiques haue beene ſo bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to it, that there is no man can but
know it. For what hath made them ſtand
out againſt the oath of Supremacy, going
to Church, the oath of allegia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp;c. but
the neceſſary connexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that theſe things
of their owne nature haue with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of their faith? which were it not,
all Catholiques in <hi>England</hi> know, they
could not by any humane conſtitution be
bound not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme themſelues to our
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17863:48"/>
lawes in this behalfe, the dangers being
ſuch as they are. Now they ſee, that the
hauing of a Biſhop at this time with ſuch
Authority as is pretended, is not of ſuch
neceſſity on the one ſide, as theſe things;
and on the other ſide of no leſſe danger,
and therfore they thinke, they cannot
be bound to it. Is this ſuch a deep point of
<hi>Diuinity,</hi> as a Lay man may not preſume
to know it? Or if he know, not ſpeake?
Or if he ſpeake of it, he muſt be ſayd to
get vp into the Biſhops Chayre? Who
would thinke a <hi>Deuine</hi> would trifle thus?
But let vs ſee more: he enlargeth himſelfe
in this, as being in his iudgement a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall
poynt of temerity, making ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Paragraph of it. But before I haue
done with this, I cannot omit to note the
<hi>Deuines</hi> Parentheſis in the beginning of
this 6. Paragraph, where to the words of
the Letter, which ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Neither can we be
perſwaded, that there is a neceſſity of confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
our ſelues heerunto,</hi> which they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane
playnely of an Epiſcopall Tribunall
as things ſtand. This <hi>Deuine</hi> with his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis
of <hi>(Epiſcopall power)</hi> maketh as
though Catholiques deny conformity to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17863:48"/>
Epiſcopall power in generall: which is a
ſtrange ſlight; &amp; I may ſay plaine corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But to goe on with him, he goeth
forward thus. Like to this, is that other
great errour of theirs, where they ſay they
cannot be obliged to looſe their eſtates, &amp;
ruine their poſterityes, where the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of profeſſion of fayth doth not oblige
them. For ſaith he, they are aſwel obliged
to looſe their eſtates, nay liues alſo, where
the exerciſing of any neceſſary Vertue
doth oblige them, as where the profeſſion
of fayth doth. For example, he bringeth
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> the Patriarch, who was obliged to
looſe his eſtate and liberty, as well when
the neceſſity of Chaſtity did bind him, as
neceſſity of profeſſing his fayth. So he
ſayth, Chriſtians were no leſſe bound to
obay the decrees of the Apoſtles, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
their doctrine. And he brings the
Authority of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> to proue, that he
ſuffereth as a Chriſtian, whoſoeuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
for doing any good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or auoyding
any euill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying withall of himſelf, that
to looſe their liues for acknowledging
their lawfull Paſtor, is to looſe it for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of their fayth. So the Church hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17863:49"/>
them for Martyrs, who would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dy then ſubſcribe to the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of S. Athanaſius &amp;c. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
that the <hi>Deuine</hi> is very free to call
this an errour, which by anſwering what
he ſayth againſt it, ſhall manifeſtly appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are
to be a ſolide truth. For, that which
he ſayth firſt then, that a man is bound to
looſe not only his eſtate, but lyfe alſo,
where the neceſſity of exerciſing any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
vertue doth oblige him, no leſſe
then for the profeſſion fayth, it is true;
but nothing pertinent to our purpoſe,
which is, not to diſpute whether a man
be bound to hazard his lyfe and fortune
for his fayth only, and not for other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:
but whether he be bound to hazard
all for a thing which is not neceſſary for
profeſſion of fayth, &amp; is ſuppoſed not to
fal vnder the neceſſary obligation of any
other commandement, or vertue: and ſo
the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be the ſame of any other
vertu, whether a man be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to exerciſe
it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not neceſſary, with hazard of
his life &amp; fortune; &amp; this the <hi>Deuine</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeemeth to grant by requiring a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of exerciſing a neceſſary vertue to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17863:49"/>
oblige a man: for I would aske him wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is the neceſſity of exerciſing a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Vertue, as he calleth it, by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
and admitting his Authority?
May we not haue all things neceſſary to
ſaluation without it? If not, how haue
we done all this while? If we may, what
maketh this for his purpoſe? You ſee then
the <hi>Deuine</hi> would decline the queſtion,
by ſlipping aſyde to another matter. For
his example of the Patriarch <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> I ſay
there was a neceſſity of exerciſing a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
vertue (to vſe the <hi>Deuines</hi> owne
Phraſe (though it be not very good) &amp;
therfore nothing to our purpoſe. But by
the way I would know what he meaneth
by <hi>neceſſary Vertue</hi> in this place, for my
part I do not ſee what he can meane, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then an act which a man is bound
to exerciſe; ſo as eyther the word neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
or neceſſary in his Phraſe, is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous;
&amp; then the meaning of his whole
ſentence is this. A man is bound to looſe
his life for exerciſing any vertue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
he is bound, and ſo we are where we
were at the firſt, to wit, whether al kinds
of obligation bind at all tymes and in all
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17863:50"/>
circumſtances, and with all manner of
difficulties and daungers. For the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
<hi>Ioſeph,</hi> there is no doubt, but he
was bound to hazard all, rather then his
chaſtity, wherto the law of God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
did bind him in that caſe: not ſo the
hauing of a Biſhop with Ordinary power
in ours. For the Apoſtles Decrees, it is
true, they are to be obeyed: but yet I
would know of this <hi>Deuine,</hi> whether he
thinketh a man bound rather to hazard
his life or liberty, then to eat fleſh in lent,
or vpon a friday or ſaturday? And ſo of
other Apoſtolicall Precepts, which are
not diuine Traditions, but enacted by
them meerely out of their owne Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Onely heere I ſay, by this it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that there is difference betweene the
obligation of profeſſion of our fayth,
which is wholy diuine, and obaying the
Decrees of the Apoſtles, which are but
human. For <hi>S. Thomas</hi> his Authority I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
it, and am therfore ſorry to ſee
it applyed by a <hi>Deuine</hi> to ſo litle purpoſe:
for who denieth, but he ſufferreth as a
Chriſtian, or for his fayth, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
is a Martyr, that ſuffereth for
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17863:50"/>
exerciſe of any vertue, or auoyding euen
the leaſt veniall ſin? For example a man
perſwadeth a yong woman, that hath
many ſuiters to leaue the world, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Religious; ſome one of the ſuiters
who is moſt earneſt, and in moſt poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to haue her, conceaueth a great
hate againſt the party that perſwadeth
her to Religion, and ſo wayting his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
killeth him for it. This man
no doubt ſuffereth as a Chriſtian in this
caſe by <hi>S. Tho.</hi> his rule. But doth <hi>S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
ſay, he is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with foreſight of this
danger to perſwade the woman? No, nay
will this <hi>Deuine</hi> ſay it? What then is this
to that which Catholiques ſay they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be bound to looſe all, where there is
not a neceſſity of profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their faith?
But the <hi>Deuine</hi> inferreth heere; that for a
man to looſe his eſtate for acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
his lawful Paſtor (I ſuppoſe he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes
the Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> with his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of Ordinary) is to looſe it for profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his fayth. Be it ſo: what then? Is
this a matter of neceſſity or obligation as
the caſe ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth? If not, you ſay nothing:
&amp; this I ſay, ſuppoſing it an act of vertue,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17863:51"/>
as the <hi>Deuine</hi> ſayth it is. But now not to
dehort any from this acknowledgment,
but only to iuſtify a man that ſhal not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
it for good reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, I aske whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be an act of vertue to acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
that Authority, which there is no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
ground for, but the Parties owne
ſaying; whereas there is much againſt
it? Is this diſcretion? If not diſcretion,
how can it be a vertue? Beſides, graunt
he haue that Authority, but that this
Authority is on the one ſide not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
and on the other ſyde daungerous,
ſo as the Daunger and Inconuenience
doth preponderate the conueniency or
commodity. Is it diſcretion to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in this caſe, or is this profeſſion of
fayth, as our <hi>Deuine</hi> calleth it, ioyned
with diſcretion? Haue not many beene
condemned therefore, both aunciently
&amp; modernely for want of diſcretion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in profeſſion of their fayth. Is it ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
for men to put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues into need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
dangers, or not prudently to decline
them when they may without offence?
What ſuch ſpecial vertue then is it, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge
my Lo. of <hi>Chalcedons</hi> Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhip,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17863:51"/>
and ſubmit to his Tribunall, being
no way neceſſary to the profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith
&amp; being on the other ſide ſo daungerous
as it is? Neyther doth this <hi>Deuines</hi> exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple
of <hi>S. Athanaſius</hi> his followers help. For
firſt, it was an vniuſt, and wicked thing
in it ſelf to ſubſcribe to the condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of an Innocent man, the which for al the
world a man may not do. Secondly, the
perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> being known to
be for defence of the Catholique Faith &amp;
beliefe, to ſubſcribe to his condemnation
was held in that tyme to be a deniall of a
mans Fayth, concerning the <hi>Diuinity</hi> of
Chriſt. So heere was a neceſſity (to vſe
the <hi>Deuines</hi> phraſe) of exerciſing two ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
vertues, Iuſtice and Fayth. In our
caſe no ſuch matter. So that all this wind
hitherto ſhaketh no corne. Now then I
come to <hi>Caietans</hi> Authority, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth neere the poynt. For he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the queſtion aright, whereas the
<hi>Deuine</hi> leades vs out of the way all this
while. And it is this; <hi>An lex humana ita

concludeth, that it is falſe and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
doctrine to teach that men are not
bound to looſe their eſtates, &amp; ruine their
poſterities where neceſſity of profeſsion
of Fayth doth not oblige them; but that
they are bound to looſe both eſtate &amp; life
euer where the neceſſity of a lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
doth oblige them vnder mortall ſin.
And ſuch no doubt it is to acknowledge
and obey their lawfull Paſtour (as he
ſayth.) Heere you ſee <hi>Caietans</hi> Doctrine,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17863:52"/>
and our <hi>Deuines</hi> Inference. To which I
anſwere firſt, that our <hi>Deuine</hi> cannot be
ignorant how little Authority in many
matters <hi>Caietan</hi> carrieth in ſchooles now
a dayes, though he were a great Doctor
in his tyme, and this in regard of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
in many points of great mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
and freedome in cenſuring other mens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.
Both which faults he ſeemeth
ſomewhat to commit in this place. For
as for ſingularity, he can hardly eſcape it,
hauing but one only man of the whole
ſchoole of <hi>Deuines</hi> to hold with him, who
is <hi>Adrianus,</hi> of his owne tyme, or rather
a little after him; ſo as when he taught it,
it was ſingular among <hi>Deuines</hi> for any te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
that is extant, &amp; ſince, he hath
not any one man but <hi>Adrian</hi> to follow
him: which being ſo, then is it manifeſt
that he falleth fowly into that other fault
of cenſuring Doctrine as erroneous and
falſe, which was approued and taught in
his owne tyme by learned men, and that
it ſeemeth with ſuch likelyhood, that all
<hi>Deuines</hi> of enſuing tymes haue left his, &amp;
followed this. Though in this he be not
ſo much to be blamed, not being able to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17863:53"/>
forſee what men would ſay that came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as our <hi>Deuine,</hi> who liueth now, and
cannot but know it to be allowed and
taught by all learned men. All whom this
<hi>Deuine</hi> in alleadging and approuing <hi>Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi>
cenſure, doth condemne, which is a
great fault in a man of his profeſſion. But
to let that goe; In my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it had beene
more for our <hi>Deuines</hi> purpoſe to haue
alleadged <hi>Caietanes</hi> bare Authority with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his reaſon. This reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth,
being <hi>Caietanes</hi> beſt reaſon, as is to
be preſumed in our <hi>Diuines</hi> Iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (for
ſure he would bring the beſt) and it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
nothing worth, it will appeare that
he hath no reaſon at all: for his reaſon is
this. An humane Law may oblige a man
vnder mortall ſinne, as when a thing is
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded vpon paine of death; but a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d rather to looſe his life then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit
a mortal ſinne: <hi>Ergo</hi> a man may be bound
to looſe his life for the obſeruation of it.
To this I might anſwere firſt that his firſt
Propoſition is not altogether ſo certaine.<note place="margin">Nauar. apud</note>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17863:53"/>
humane ciuill law doth bind vnder mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
ſinne. But I do not build vpon that.
And therefore I anſwere ſecondly, that
<hi>Caietanes</hi> reaſon, is <hi>petitio Principij,</hi> and
conſequently no reaſon, taking the very
thing in queſtion, though deliuered in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
words, for a reaſon of his ſaying. For
it is the ſame queſtion, whether an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
law can bind a man vnder mortall
ſinne, to loſſe of goods or life, but in caſe
where there is ſome higher obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the law of God, or nature:
and whether an humane law can oblige
him to looſe his fortunes and life, where
there is no neceſſity of profeſſion of his
Faith, or other higher bond. And this
is it which <hi>Caietan</hi> with one other <hi>Deuine</hi>
ſayth, and all other <hi>Deuines</hi> gaineſay him
in. And the reaſon is manifeſt. For, a law
being to be for the common good, and
the power by which it is made, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
originally from the people (if we
ſpeake of ciuill or Politicall power) and
giuen for that end, it were a great abuſe
of that power, to force men to ſo great
domage as to hazard fortune and life, but
where it is meerly neceſſary for that end:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17863:54"/>
for men are not ſuppoſed to be ſo voyde
of reaſon, as to caſt away themſelues ſo
freely. Now in that caſe of common good
the law of nature doth come in, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
that bond. The like we may ſay of
Eccleſiaſticall humane power, which
though it come originally from God, not
from the people, yet reaſon doth preſcribe
the vſe of it: and a Law made thereby to
the domage and hurt of mens fortunes &amp;
liues, without a neceſſity, for their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
good, would rather proue preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
then profitable, and therfore no
Law. Nay, to matters of extraordinary
difficulty, though otherwiſe good and
holy, euen Religious men are not many
tymes bound. That Ordinary Example,
which authors bring of a Religious man
entring heere in <hi>Europe,</hi> who, they ſay,
by his generall Vow of Obedience is not
bound vpon his Superiours commaund
to go to the <hi>Indies</hi> through ſo many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
by ſea &amp; land: How much leſſe then
can ſecular men be bound with daunger
of life and ruine of their fortunes, to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
not abſolutly neceſſary to fayth and
ſaluation? Such as is, the not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17863:54"/>
and obeying of my Lo Biſhop of
<hi>Chalcedons</hi> Ordinariſhip. And therfore no
matter fit for ſo great an obligation, as
the loſſe of life, and ruine of a mans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.
Wherefore that muſt needs faile,
which our <hi>Deuine</hi> buildeth vpon <hi>Caieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
Authority, as the foundation: to wit
that men are bound to looſe all, not only
for profeſſion of Faith, but alſo where
the neceſſity of a lawful commaund obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
them, if he meane the neceſſity
which a commaund doth bring with it
ſubſequent, as an effect; which he muſt
meane for his purpoſe. For as I haue ſaid
all this while, all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunds do not bind
in all occaſions, and then there is no ſuch
neceſſity, or rather it is no law or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
in this caſe being not able to bind.
Therfore to auoyd all ambiguity &amp; equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation
of the neceſſity of a lawfull co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,
I diſtinguiſh and ſay: If this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
be antecedent and ſuch as may be
ſufficient to ground ſuch a commaund on
becauſe the thing is of neceſſity of it ſelfe
for the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a mans ſoule or the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique
good this commaund is lawful &amp;
the neceſſity ſufficient to bind a man to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17863:55"/>
the loſſe of life &amp; goods: if not, but only
the neceſſity ſubſequent, that is, becauſe
it is commanded, I ſay, this is no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ground for a man to hazard all; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it a commaund in this caſe, hauing
no power to oblige, as I haue proued. And
ſo much for our <hi>Deuines</hi> Diuinity, which
hath foyled him in this point of Doctrine
contradicting the whole current of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines.</hi>

                     <p>7. The ſeauenth point of temerity
ſaith he (if I may giue it ſo ſharpe a terme)
is in theſe words: <q>We alſo moſt humbly
beſeech your Lordſhip, to belieue, that
this which we heere preſent vnto you, is
the ſenſe of the Laity; whereas ſcarce 30.
Laymen knew of the writing of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
&amp; ſince they knew of it, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
haue diſclaymed from it, &amp; open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proteſted againſt it, ſome of them not
accounting thoſe Catholiques that wrote
this Letter.</q> Hitherto are the <hi>Deuines</hi> owne
words. And then he Rhetorically ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
it: asking whether it be the ſenſe of
the Engliſh Catholike laity, that a Biſhop
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17863:55"/>
lawfully ſent by the ſea Apoſtolike doth
vſurp authority? muſt do nothing againſt
the ſetled Order of the ſtate, in matter of
ſpirituall Iuriſdictition? That a Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
Epiſcopall tribunall is a new Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
in England? &amp; ſo in like ſort he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth
vp Epilogically al his former te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merities,
and prayeth, God forbid that
ſuch preſumption ſhould be the ſenſe of
the Laity. And that rather the quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is their ſenſe, to wit; to accept the
Biſhop for their lawfull Paſtor; to thanke
his holynes for ſending him; to be as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
if not more, to ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture the loſſe of their
eſtate for entertayning a Biſhop their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
as for entayning regular Prieſts: and
this he ſaith many hundreds haue teſtified
by word, writing, and deeds.</p>
                     <p>This point it ſeemeth is a ſhrewd one
in the <hi>Deuines</hi> iudgment: wherfore he
would fayne haue a worſe tearme then
Temerity for it. But let him ſtay, and
ſee whether it deſerue eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, any more
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt that went before. To ſay that
this is the ſenſe of the layty, wheras ſcarce
30. knew of the writing of the Letter, he
ſayth is Temerity. Yea is it euen ſo? Did
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17863:56"/>
30. know of it? how commeth it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
all this while you ſpake but of 3. calling it
the three Lay-mens Letter, in the very
title, &amp; afterwards continually ſpeaking
but of three? It is wel increaſed ſuddainly
from three, to thirty. But meane while
hath not our <hi>Deuine</hi> ſtrangely forgotten
himſelfe confeſſing &amp; confuting himſelfe
out of his owne mouth? For if 30. or neer
30. were priuy to the writing of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and did not diſclayme (as if they had
done, the <hi>Deuine</hi> would not haue paſſed
it ouer in ſilence) it is to be preſumed that
they did conſent therto. If they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
then was it their act, not the act of
thoſe 3. alone: and what theſe 3 did, they
did in the name of the reſt. Therefore
thoſe 30. are ſubiect to al the <hi>Deuines</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of paſſion and temerity no leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thoſe 3. But he thought better to lay al v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
3. becauſe he thought he might be the
boulder in his cenſures, the ſmaller the
number was, therfore he made it leſſe to
himſelfe, though contrary to his owne
knowledge, as is manifeſt by this his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
Well to go on, we haue 30. may
there not be a great many more, that he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17863:56"/>
doth not know of? Will he arrogate ſo
much to himſelfe as to know all that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
in priuate amongſt men? might not
many vtter their mynds ſo priuately in
this matter to their friends, as not only
not the <hi>Deuine,</hi> but no man elſe but the
party, that they ſpake to, ſhall know it?
How then doth this <hi>Deuine,</hi> ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
affirme, that there were ſcarce 30.
priuy to it? As if no man did any thing
but they came preſently and told him: but
he muſt excuſe me for not belieuing that,
but rather it is to be preſumed that if he
could come to the knowledge of 30. there
were fiue tymes as many at leaſt, that
knew of it, &amp; are not knowne to euery
one, conſidering the ſecret manner of
carrying things of this kind among Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques.</p>
                     <p>And ſo much this <hi>Deuine</hi> might truly
haue imagined, at leaſt belieued, when
this Letter was deliuered by 3. ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in the name of the Laity, being euery
one of them of ſuch worth, as might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
credit in a greater matter then this.
For it is no way to be preſumed, that any
one of them would do ſuch a thing in the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17863:57"/>
name of others without very good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from them, eſpecially ſeing they
might be ſo eaſily diſauowed. Nay it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be vnknowne vnto this <hi>Deuine,</hi> that
they were warranted by moſt of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
of honour and quality, in, and
about London, at the tyme of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Letter: for my Lord Biſhop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
did then in a manner confeſſe as
much. For to one Noble man very well
knowne, he writ, that his Lordſhips Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which he had written to diſclayme
from the Lay mens Letter, appeared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him like a ſtarre in a cloud; as if he
were the only man that ſtood for him.
And it can be no leſſe knowne to this
<hi>Deuine,</hi> what a do ther was to haue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Letter written by ſome of my Lord
Biſhop friendes in the name of the laity
to the contrary effect. But it would not
ſucceed; &amp; why? But becauſe that none
that conſidered the ſtate of Catholique
affaires heere in England and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
the Authority of Ordinary
brought with it, and withall had any
care of their owne fortunes or common
good, could thinke it ſafe for them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17863:57"/>
of ſuch Authority. It is true, that if a
man, aske ordinary people that diue
not into the matter, whether they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
my Lord of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> for
their Paſtour, or ſome perhaps who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the matter better, but haue not
much to looſe; it may be they will eaſily
anſweare, they acknowledge him for
their Paſtor. And this is the way which
hath beene vſed, with thoſe hundreds,
which this <hi>Deuine</hi> ſayth haue diſclaymed
from this Letter. But though they were
more, it made not much matter. And
though there ſhould be but 30. that were
priuy to this Letter, might not thoſe 30.
be of ſuch account, as might be more
worth then many of this <hi>Deuines</hi> hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds?
I belieue they might. For they are
the cheif men for honour and eſtate that
are moſt to be regarded in this matter,
as being the men vpon whome the credit
of the Catholique cauſe moſt dependeth;
and who, for a thing that ſhalbe ſubiect
to exception, are moſt like to ſuffer: &amp;
therfore they might well ſay the Laity,
being the cheifeſt and better part; and
what they wanted in number they might
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17863:58"/>
counteruayle in worth. This letter then
is the ſenſe of the Laity, not wreſted and
wrung, not gloſſed and commentaryed
by the <hi>Deuine</hi> at his pleaſure, but in the
plaine and obuious meaning of the very
wordes, farre from paſſion, and teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as I haue here ſhewed. And ſo I come
to the 3. Section, the title wherof is this.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="3" type="section">
                     <head>Sect. 3. That the motiues of the three
men, were not all humayne, and
worldly.</head>
                     <p>IN this 3. ſection the <hi>Deuine</hi> examineth
what the Lay mens motiues were to
reſiſt the reſtoring of Epiſcopall power,
or rather to impugne and baniſh it, as he
ſaith, according to his vſuall manner, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is reſtored by the Sea Apoſtolique,
which ſeing, ſaith he, that it is diuine ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall,
inſtituted by Chriſt, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Holy Ghoſt to gouerne the
Church, obſerued alwayes in the Church
in all tymes of perſecution whatſoeuer,
profitable for adminiſtring Confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
hallowing of Oyles, keeping vnity and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17863:58"/>
good life, the motiues had need be good;
and then he reduceth al to two: viz. feare
of loſſe of worldly fortunes, and troubles
by contrariety of ſentences betwixt the
Biſhops Court and the Proteſtantes. But
then picketh out a third, which he ſaith,
was the true motiue, deliuered ſomewhat
in a couert ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner: to wit, that the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
may be freed from the Biſhops appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Out of which he deduceth certaine
points for the lay men to conſider. 1. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be fit for them to impugne ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
&amp; diuine Authority vpon mere world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
motiues, and ſuch as may better be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
againſt Prieſtly Authority, it being
forbiddden by moderne lawes; Biſhoply
authority being not forbidden by them
expreſſely. Secondly whether it beſeeme
them to reiect Epiſcopall Authority, and
the certaine ſpirituall commodityes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
for vncertaine or rather pretended te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
dangers. Thirdly how farre they are
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Catholique Africans, who would
haue a Biſhop, notwithſtanding the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
threatned by the African King
if they had one. 4. Whether it beſeeme
them to impugne a Biſhop their Paſtor in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17863:59"/>
behalfe of Regulars not their Paſtours
Fifthly, whether Regulars deſerue this at
their handes, ſince for the quiet of their
Penitents conſciences, they would not
aske the Biſhops approbation, though he
offered it vnder his hand and ſeale, that
it ſhould be no preiudice to them, wheras
the Biſhop for quiet of mens conſciences
with his owne preiudice approued Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
though they would not aske it. This
is the whole diſcourſe of this Section.</p>
                     <p>To which I ſay firſt, that he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
a very foule fault for a man of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
in miſreporting and miſtaking the
queſtion, by ſaying that the Lay-men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
impugne, and baniſh Epiſcopall
Authority: whereas it is nothing ſo. For
it neuer came into the hart of any Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
man, much leſſe of any of theſe Lay
men to queſtion or make doubt of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall
Authority in general. But the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
being of my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
who came into England with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
title of a Biſhopricke in Greece, but
with Authority to be exerciſed heere in
England, what Authority is giuen, what
Authority can fitly be exerciſed, &amp; how
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17863:59"/>
far Lay Catholiques ſtand bound, if new
Tribunals with power in <hi>foro externo,</hi> or
Ordinary power be erected. And he clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
ſuch Authority, they whome it
moſt concerned, declared theyr ſenſe and
iudgment co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning theſe points: which
it ſeemeth our <hi>Deuine</hi> would needs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
and draw the queſtion another way
to make himſelfe a little more roome to
diſcourſe at liberty, of Epiſcopall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
crying out a Paſtor, a lawfull Paſtor
&amp;c. becauſe what they ſayd, was ſo iuſt
and conſonant to reaſon, as he could
not impugne it. Wherfore it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that of all this deal, he ſaith there is ſo
litle ſayd to the purpoſe. Secondly for the
motiues, he ſaith not much againſt them:
but only taketh vpon him to iudge of the
ſecrets of harts, by ſaying, the principall
motiue was to free Regulars from appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.
Wherein I might aske him, by
what Autbority he taketh vpon him to
iudge of ſuch matters as are not ſubiect
to the iudgment of the Church it ſelfe?
for, <hi>Eccleſia non iudicat de occultis.</hi> But I
need not preſſe him heere: for it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
with him to cenſure men meerly out
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17863:60"/>
of his owne imagination. Now for his
Corollary demands, I anſwer to the firſt,
that it ſuppoſeth falſly, that they impugne
ſpirituall Authority, which they do not.
Secondly, it may ſtand with very good
reaſon for a man to deſire ſometymes not
to be vrged to the acknowledgment and
admittance of ſuch a ſpeciall Authority
out of feare of temporall daunger of life
or fortunes, which though they be in
themſelues temporall things, yet being
deſired or preſerued diſcreetly with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to a ſpirituall end, as they may be,
and as it may be preſumed good men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
them, they are in a kind ſpirituall.
Thirdly, theſe motiues do not make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Prieſtly Authority ſo much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Authority of a Biſhop, for they
ſpeake only of a Tribunall, or power in
<hi>foro externo,</hi> which doth not belonge to
Prieſts, as Prieſts, and which is againſt
our auncient Lawes, as is ſayd before,
which is worſe then to be againſt our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
lawes. Beſides the Authority of a
Biſhop is more againſt our modern laws,
for he cometh with Authority and iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
deriued from the ſea of <hi>Rome,</hi> not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17863:60"/>
only <hi>in foro interno,</hi> but alſo <hi>in foro ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terno,</hi>
which is much more againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendement
of our lawes, howſoeuer it be
againſt the words: and this may appeare
by the Proclamations, and Perſecutions
which haue been for him in particular.
Laſtly put caſe the daunger were the ſame
yet God doth bind men to the one, as
being a thing of neceſſity for the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their ſoules, but not to the other,
being no way helpfull to their ſoules in
theſe circumſtances, but daungerous to
their Liues and Fortunes.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this <hi>Deuine</hi> maketh ſuch
frequent mention &amp; ſo ſure account that
Epiſcopall Authority is not more, if not
leſſe againſt our moderne lawes then Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly
power, this later being by them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the other not, as he ſaith;
I thinke it not amiſſe heere in a word to
ſhew it to be forbidden both expreſly, &amp;
vpon greater penalty. For firſt the Law
of 27. Eliz. which maketh it felony to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
relieue, and maintaine, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
a Priest, maketh it felony to do the
ſame to any religious or eccleſiaſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Now I preſume the <hi>Deuine</hi> will not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17863:61"/>
a Biſhop to be an Eccleſiaſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
how then can he ſay, he is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
forbidden. It may be he meaneth,
becauſe he is not forbidden by the name
of a Biſhop: true, I graunt the word Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
is not there; no more is the word
monke, or friar; much leſſe Benedictine,
Dominican, Franciſcan &amp;c. and yet who
can ſay that theſe are not expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by the law in the word Religious
perſon? If this <hi>Deuine</hi> ſay againe that they
are forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the word Seminary, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prieſt, ſo ſay I alſo of a Biſhop. It is
cleare then, that a Biſhop is alſo expreſly
inough, &amp; as much forbidden by that law
as a Prieſt: &amp; this our proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
ſhew, as that 1. <hi>Caroli Regis</hi> for ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of Prieſts and Ieſuits, wherein
the word Biſhop was alſo expreſſed. Now
for the penalty of reconcileme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it is true
it is treaſon to be abſolued or reconciled
by a Prieſt. And is it not ſo by a Biſhop
alſo? yea verily as much one as other, for
in the nature of reconcileme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t neither one
nor other is named: where in I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but
wonder why this <hi>Deuine</hi> ſhould ſo ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
note, that it is treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be reconciled
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17863:61"/>
by Prieſts. The matter then for that, is all
one.</p>
                     <p>But to go a little further with him, I
ſay, it is not Treaſon for a man to heare
maſſe, to receiue the Bleſſed Sacrament,
to be baptized, married, annoyled, or the
like, or to do any act in acknowledgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of his Prieſthood, except only abſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;
reconciliation; wheras it is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of a Biſhop. For not only to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
or reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled by him, but euen to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
any obedience vnto him is high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in the Doer, Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſellour, or A bettor,
much more to do any act in conformity
of his Epiſcopal power <hi>in foro externo,</hi> as
to appeare before him vpon his citation,
to obey his cenſures, or the like: &amp; this by
a law of 23. <hi>Eliz.</hi> (to wit 4. yeares before
that other of receiuing, relieuing &amp;c. of
Ieſuits &amp; Prieſts) where it is enacted that
if any perſon ſhall promiſe any obedience
to any pretended Authority of the ſea of
<hi>Rome,</hi> or of any other Prince, State, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tate,
that then ſuch perſon ſhalbe take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
tried, and iudged, ſuffer and forfaite as in
caſe of high Treaſon: in which words is
plainely comprehended Epiſcopal power
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17863:62"/>
as ſuch; for it is deriued from the ſea of
<hi>Rome,</hi> whether it be delegate or ordinary.
Or if it be Ordinary as that of Biſhops in
their dioceſſe, and as the <hi>Deuine</hi> takes my
Lord of <hi>Chalcedons</hi> to be, then it is like it
may be vnderſtood in that word Prince,
for ſuch a Biſhop is a ſpirituall Prince.</p>
                     <p>And that it may yet further appeare
that his Epiſcopall power as ſuch, is ſo
forbidden by this law, I will put this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine</hi>
a caſe thus. Suppoſe there ſhould com
one in hither ſent by the Pope, without
the order of Biſhop, Prieſt, or any other
order, but only with Epiſcopall power or
iuriſdiction, as he might be, to determine
ſuch cauſes heere among Catholiques, as
Biſhops do els where in their ſpirituall
Courts; would this caſe be comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
in our Lawes thinks he, or not? or would
it not be Treaſon for men to promiſe him
obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, come to his Court, obey his ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
&amp;c? certainly it would; &amp; euen by
this law of 23. <hi>Eliz.</hi> How then can this
<hi>Deuine</hi> ſo confidently auerre, that Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall
power is no more againſt our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Lawes then Prieſtly? But heere now
I muſt intreate this <hi>Deuine</hi> to conceyue
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17863:62"/>
me right, for my intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not to inforce
Lawes againſt my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
but only to anſwere his arguments,
which force me to this, to ſhew that there
may be ſome more daunger in Epiſcopall
then Prieſtly power, for auoyding wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Catholiques are not to be blamed, if
they be leſſe willing to admit of the one,
then of the other, now in theſe tymes,
wherein it is but good diſcretion for men
to ſerue God, and exerciſe their religion
with as little hazard of their Liues and
Fortunes as they may.</p>
                     <p>To the ſecond demaund, whether it
beſeeme them to reiect Epiſcopall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and the certayne ſpirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modityes
therof, vpon vncertaine or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pretended daungers. I anſwere as to
the firſt, that it ſuppoſeth falſly, that
they reiect ſpirituall Authority. For they
reuerence it, though nothing ſeemes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
to this man, but yielding to his
will. Secondly, they do not refuſe any
ſpirituall commodity that commeth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
as Confirmation, hallowing of Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
or whatſoeuer elſe doth not concerne
ſuch manner of Ordinary Authority, as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17863:63"/>
they cannot ſafely admit, for the reaſons
alleadged in their Letter; which this man
ſayth, are vncertaine or prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: which
conceit of pretented, ſo much pleaſeth
the <hi>Deuine,</hi> that he maketh a diſtinct ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of it, &amp; therfore if it deſerue any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
I will make it there.</p>
                     <p>To the 3. demaund, how far ſhort
they are of the zeale of the Affrican Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques,
who would rather venture a
perſecution, then want a Biſhop; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
it is well knowne, Catholiques
heere want no zeale to Biſhoply Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
who haue ſuffered ſo long &amp; ſharpe
perſecution for the Authority of the ſea
Apoſtolique, which they haue defended
with loſſe of goods, and life, for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Prieſts ſent by the Authority ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
which that holy ſea conſidering, with
great wiſdome and charity hath ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
things all the tyme of perſecution,
that as on the one ſide it hath ſent Prieſts
with ſufficient Authority for our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
adminiſtration of Sacraments, &amp;
other neceſſary matters: ſo on the other
ſide it hath for borne to preſſe vs further
for the admittance of ſuch Authority, at
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17863:63"/>
is more dangerous then needfull. And
who can blame vs if we deſire the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of the ſame courſe ſtill, till God
ſend better times? And if our zeale be the
ſame to the ſea Apoſtolique (for whoſe
Authority we ſuffer, and vpon whome
we deſire therfore to depend immediatly,
as vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our proper Paſtour) as thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
had to their particular Biſhop,
of what can any man iuſtly taxe vs? Are
we worſe Catholiques? Nay are we not
rather ſo much better Catholiques as we
depend more neerly of the Head of the
Catholique Church? Beſides our caſe is
different from the <hi>Africans</hi> in many reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects:
they had no other meanes of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the ſucceſſion of Prieſts, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of the Sacraments, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation
of the Catholique fayth, but by
a Biſhop of their owne; we haue. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
a Biſhop of their owne; we ſhould
alſo be glad of ſuch a one; as for example
a Catholique Biſhop of Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terbury, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp;c. if it might be; but not a Biſhop of
another Dioceſſe, to come in hither as
Ordinary; for that is againſt our aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Catholique Lawes. Their Biſhops
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17863:64"/>
ſeas were not poſſeſſed by others, ours
are: and the like. This <hi>Deuine</hi> therefore
doth vniuſtly taxe vs of want of zeale to
our immediate Paſtor. Beſides, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the <hi>Africans</hi> is often anſwered, &amp;
proued to make quite againſt the <hi>Deuines</hi>
end.</p>
                     <p>To the 4. demaund, which is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it beſeeme them to impugne a Biſhop
who is their Paſtor, in behalfe of Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
who are not their Paſtors: I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
that ſtill this <hi>Deuine</hi> ſuppoſeth a falſe
ground of impugning a Biſhop. Now for
a Paſtor, we know not what he meaneth
by it. If he meane one with power to
preach, teach and adminiſter Sacraments
without other ordinary forrayne power,
we graunt he is a Paſtour. But then why
ſhould not other Prieſts be alſo Paſtours,
hauing the ſame power? and Regulars as
well as ſeculars? for it is not the name
of a Biſhop only. For any Prieſt that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
heere into England is more our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
then the Biſhop of <hi>Paris, Lyons, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi>
or any ſuch Biſhop who hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do heer, but by ſpeciall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
which if it be no more then is giuen
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17863:64"/>
to other Prieſts, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is he no more Paſtour
then they. Will this <hi>Deuine</hi> ſay my Lord
of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> is a Paſtour otherwiſe? Say it
perhaps he may; but proue it I thinke he
cannot. Sure I am his Breue or Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion
importeth no ſuch thing, but all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
as that he is Delegate, his power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uokable,
that it is only for the ſpirituall
good of ſoules It is ſignified by the word
<hi>Facultyes,</hi> which ſignifieth power in him,
but no obligation on the other part to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
&amp; we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ordinary forme
of creating a Biſhop for ordinary Paſtour
to be this: <hi>Prouidemus Eccleſiae tali, de tali per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſona:
&amp; praeficimns cum in Patrem, ac Paſtore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Amen.</hi> The omiſſion of this ordinary
forme, and auoyding of all words which
might ſignify any power or Authority,
maketh vs verily belieue his Holines ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
meant to make him Ordinary, or
Paſtour, other then in that general ſenſe,
that al that are ſent with power of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
men &amp; adminiſtring of Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
may be called Paſtours. And this power
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17863:65"/>
euery body willingly affoardeth him. As
for that which our <hi>Deuine</hi> ſayth, that the
Laity impugne the Biſhop in behalfe of
Regulars, I ſay, that the one is euen as
true as the other. For they nether impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne
him (but he them) nor do what they
do in behalfe of the Regulars, but of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
&amp; their owne right: for it is their
owne liues &amp; fortunes which they defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d:
and as for the Regulars they defend their
owne priuiledges of another kynd, &amp; no
doubt, will be able of themſelues to do it,
without help of the Laity, being ſo lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as to know how farre they ought to
yield, or not to yield to his Lordſhip, and
ſo vertuous as not to deny him any thing
that is due.</p>
                     <p>To the 5. demaund, whether Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars
deſerue this at the hands of the
lay men, ſince for quiet of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
they would not aske approbation,
though the Biſhop offered to giue it vnder
his hand &amp; ſeale, that it ſhould be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
to them; wheras the Biſhop as the
<hi>Deuine</hi> ſayth, for quiet of lay men conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
approued the Regulars to his owne
preiudice, though they would not aske it.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17863:65"/>
I anſwere that lay mens conſciences were
quiet enough, till my Lord Biſhop bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
to diſquiet them with needles ſcruples: &amp;
that therfore they were not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to him for quieting them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
as they were little beholding to
him for diſquieting them at firſt. Secondly
Lay men ſaw well enough, it was ſome
thing elſe then the quiet of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
which moued his Lordſhip to that
courſe of mouing approbations: to wit, to
haue his Authority which he pretendeth,
therby publiſhed and acknowledged. For
otherwiſe he might either haue approued
all Regulars without more a do at firſt, or
haue dealt the matter priuatly with them:
and they denying to aske approbation, he
might haue expected the award of the Sea
Apoſtolique, without further acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Lay Catholiques, who, he might be
ſure, for all yet he could ſay, would ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely
rely their conſciences vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word
of ſo many, ſo vertuous, and ſo learned
men, as are in the ſeuerall Orders of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars.
Beſides, that they, the Regulars,
giue ſo good reaſon in their owne Letter
to the Biſhop, and there were ſo many &amp;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17863:66"/>
ſo good reaſons alleadged in a ſhorter let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a Prieſt for that matter, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that would be ruled by reaſon, would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doubt of the power of Regulars to
heere co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſions, or thinke that my Lord
Biſhop himſelfe, being ſo learned a man,
could doubt of it, &amp; therfore they might
wel thinke he meant that but by the By,
and aimed at another matter principally:
and ſo they anſwered that which ſeemed
to them the principal matter more largly,
and touched the other but briefly.</p>
                     <p>Now, for Regulars to aske his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
approbation where the matter was
ſo manifeſt, was wholy vnneceſſary; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſids,
that though his Lordſhip ſhould giue
it vnder his hand and ſeale that it ſhould
be no preiudice to them, it is like they
knew it might be preiudiciall in ſome reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
or other: for the very asking it as
neceſſary, argueth a dependency. But for
his Lordſhips approbation, which this
<hi>Deuine</hi> ſaith, he gaue to Regulars with his
owne preiudice, I do not ſee wherein it
can be preiudiciall, for he approued them
but only for a time til the matter be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
&amp; without preiudice of his owne, or
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17863:66"/>
his ſucceſſours right: wherein then hath
he yielded one iot of his right, ſuppoſe he
had any? Nay this manner of granting it
was a putting of himſelfe in poſſeſſion. In
which reſpect the Regulars were wiſe
inough not to make any acceptance of
it. Or wherein hath he more obliged the
Laymen, then the Regulars haue, vnleſſe
it be by diſquieting them with new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences?
And for ſome part of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
approueth all Regulars, whereby he
obligeth Catholiques, like as that man
doth that firſt breaketh anothers head,
and then giueth him a plaiſter. So much
then for that anſwere of this <hi>Deuines</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds,
and clearing what he ſayth of
the Laymens motiues.</p>
                     <p>But what if before I paſſe to another
Section<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhould touch a little vpon the
the motiue which maketh the <hi>Deuine</hi> and
others of his mind to be ſo vehement in
the purſuite of this pretended Authority,
that they will heare no reaſon to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?
They ſay, it is ſpirituall good of
ſoules by adminiſtring the Sacrament of
<hi>Confirmation,</hi> by hallowing oyles, by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
vnity and good life; becauſe it is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17863:67"/>
the inſtitution of Chriſt, becauſe it hath
beene obſerued in Gods Church, in all
tymes of perſecution. But theſe cannot
be the motiues; for as for <hi>Confirmation</hi> and
hallowing of oyles, it is cleare they may
be without the authority of Ordinary, &amp;
therefore cannot be the ground of ſuch
claime. For keeping vnity and good life, it
is as cleare, that Authority can do litle in
it, as things ſtand now, and that it is only
perſwaſion and fayr meanes that muſt do
it. For the inſtitution of Chriſt, ſure it is
not, that in all places, and in all tymes
there muſt of neceſſity be particular Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
in euery particular Dioceſſe, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Country, for if it were ſo, then ſhould
thoſe 10. Popes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Pius</hi> 4. to <hi>Paulus</hi> 5. haue
offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded grieuouſly in not creating a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
heere. Nay theſe two laſt viz. <hi>Greg.</hi>
the 15. and his Holines that now is <hi>Vrba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
8.</hi> ſhould offend in not making ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Biſhops as we haue Biſhopricks. How
then can this Deuine inforce out of the
inſtitution of Chriſt, that my Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> ſhould haue the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Ordinary in England?</p>
                     <p>For the obſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Epiſcopal power
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17863:67"/>
in the Church in all tymes of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is true, there haue euer beene Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
and would ſtill be, though there
ſhould be no Ordinary in England for a
tyme. But where, when, and how, for
particular places, it hath euer depended
vpon the wiſdom of the Sea Apoſtolique,
giuing Biſhops in ſuch manner, and with
extent of power, as time &amp; place hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
So when ſome Citties or Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries
haue beene firſt conuerted to the fayth,
they haue giuen them Biſhops; when they
haue quite fallen away, they haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
to giue them any; &amp; now heere in
our Kingdome which hath fallen away
by Hereſy, yet ſo as there be ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
left, with hope of totall reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Catholique fayth, when Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God ſhall pleaſe, the Sea Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
dealeth moſt prudently, ſending
men hither with ſo much power as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and expedient for Catholiques
at this tyme, reſeruing the fullneſſe of
Ordinary Epiſcopall power, till the full
reſtitution of Catholike Religion in this
Kingdome. For, ſo Catholiques are well
aſſured, that his Lordſhip is not Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17863:68"/>
howſoeuer the <hi>Deuine</hi> cry nothing
but <hi>Paſtour,</hi> and <hi>lawfull Paſtour,</hi> at euery
word. But men giue him the hearing:
only they cannot but wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nder, that he
ſhould ſo brauely carry out the matter, as
if there were no Declaration, or order to
the contrary, when he cannot but know
that my Lord Biſhop hath had more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one to that purpoſe. Nay that my
Lord Biſhop hath acknowledged the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of them elſe where, though heere he
do not, and hath promiſed to ceaſe from
further ſtirring, though we do not yet
ſee the performance of it, vnleſſe it be
that his Lordſhip indeed forbeare, but that
his Officers wil not be obedient to him in
that wherin they may ſoone do his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
much wrong. For their faults wilbe
imputed to him.</p>
                     <p>Now, becauſe this <hi>Deuine</hi> ſayth Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall
power hath beene euer obſerued
in the Church in all times of perſecution
whatſoeuer, inferring thereupon that
here now in England there ought to be a
Biſhop; I would wiſh him to conſider
whether euen in the primitiue Church,
the perſecution were like ours, in ſome
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17863:68"/>
reſpects: for though it were more bloudy<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
and the torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts more various and cruel
yet it was but by fits, and generally the
Chriſtians had their Cripts placed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ground, and howſes dedicated to that
vſe, wherein they had a publike kind of
exerciſe of their faith, &amp; euen by publike
allowance; and Prieſts and Clergy men
were diſtinguiſhed by their habit &amp; ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
or ſhauing of their crowne, as it is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
now generally in the Catholique
Church. But our caſe is farre different,
for heere we haue much ado to heare
Maſſe in a corner, as priuate as may be,
without diſcouery: how much leſſe might
we haue thoſe other things, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Authority of an Ordinary.
But of this againe in another place.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things conſidered, ſince none of
theſe ſpiritual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities which this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine</hi>
ſpeaketh off are neceſſarily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nected
with the Authority of Ordinary, neither
are ſo neceſſary, but that a man may be a
good Chriſtian and Catholique without
them, they cannot be the true motiue of
purſuing the matter with ſuch violence
and heate, to the greater ſcandall and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17863:69"/>
harme of the Catholique cauſe, then all
the Authority my Lord Biſhop would
haue, or this <hi>Deuine</hi> haue for him, wil do
good: and therefore men are induced to
thinke that the true motiue is Ambition,
deſire of Rule, intereſt in the fortunes of
Lay men, diſpoſing of Legacies <hi>in maius
bonum,</hi> as would be pretended, iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of controuerſies betweene party &amp; party
without their conſents; and by little and
little to draw into practiſe a vexation, by
the ſeuerall tribunals, vpon Catholiques.
This I will not ſay, but ſurely there be
great preſumptions for it; for if their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
were good, they would carry things
with more te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per, they would with a litle
more patience endure to heare men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
their reaſons to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary; they
would quietly expect the determination
of the Sea Apoſtolique, and obey it when
it commeth: beſids that, in their very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but bewray ſomwhat
of their minds, concerning Legacies &amp;
monyes for pious vſes. But I will ſay no
more of it, but paſſe to another Section.</p>

daungers are not meerly pretended.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Deuine</hi> in his 4. Section labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by many reaſons to proue, that
the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall Daungers are but pretended;
which is but euen the ſame that he ſaid in
the former Section in other words. For
though he ſayth in the title that their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
were worldly, yet in his diſcourſe
he ſayth, that thoſe were not their true
motiues, but their paſſionateneſſe to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars;
and ſo he ſayth heere: yet I muſt
yield to follow him, though he ſaith but
the ſame things ouer againe. His firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to proue the daungers to be only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
is, becauſe they neuer mentioned
thoſe daungers till approbation was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to Regulars, which was about Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
1627. whereas Epiſcopal Authority
had beene reſtored ſince the yeare 1623.
I anſwere firſt, that wheras he ſayth that
Epiſcopall Authority was reſtored, I ſee
not how that can be ſaid to be reſtored
which neuer was: for when was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17863:70"/>
a Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with
power of Ordinary in England, before
this mans predeceſſour? Secondly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
did little dreame at firſt of any ſuch
Authority, as my Lord Biſhop challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth.
For the forraine title of <hi>Chalcedon</hi>
gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome aſſurance, that he was not
to be a Biſhop, like as in former Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
tymes. And though they heard ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
of the word Ordinary amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſome
of my Lords Clergy, yet they made no
great matter of it, not knowing any great
ground. Notwithſtanding they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to know, what Authority the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
had, and for that cauſe vſed all the
meanes they could to ſee his Letters, or
Faculties, but they could not get a ſight
of them; which made them begin to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ſomwhat, and ſo they began to be a
litle more carefull then before, eſpecially
hearing of diuers things done by my Lord
of <hi>Chalcedons</hi> officers, as Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of ſome, and threatning others; as
alſo comming to ſee the Letters Patents
wherby his Lordſhip did create his. Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons,
true and lawfull Rulers, and
Eccleſiaſticall Superiours of the Laity;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17863:70"/>
which when they ſaw, they began to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
among themſelues what was fit to be
done. And all this was before, that euer
my Lord of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> moued any thing
about Approbation of Regulars. And
without queſtion they would haue done
what they did for their owne ſecurity,
though the matter of Approbation had
neuer beene moued to Regulars. It may
be when they ſaw the flame breake out ſo
ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g againſt Regulars, who were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
exempt, by challenging of a thing
which could not belon<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> but to a proper
Ordinary in his Dioceſſe, it might quicke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
them, &amp; make them go about what they
were doing, with a little more ſpeed, and
therupon they drew certaine points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
my Lord of <hi>Chalcedons</hi> Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in which they were deſirous to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued,
and all of them concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and ſuch as they had heard, many
of my Lord of <hi>Chalcedons</hi> Officers and
friends ſpeake of, as things that were
like to be put in practiſe. But becauſe it
was not fit for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to go vpon vncertaine
reports, they were deſirous to know of
my Lord of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> himſelfe what his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17863:71"/>
Lordſhip did conceiue to belong vnto
him; ſo that this <hi>Deuine</hi> is cleane out of his
way, in making the matter of approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Regulars, the cauſe of the Laymens
ſtirring.</p>
                     <p>His ſecond reaſon to proue the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to be pretended only, is, becauſe no
man hath beene in daunger ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Epiſcopall Authority. For
anſwer to this reaſon, I remit this <hi>Deuine</hi>
to a great friend of my Lord Biſhops, who
is wont to alledge his fauour to my Lord
Biſhop, for a reaſon of the Kings diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
towards him. I might for anſwer alſo
alledge the Proclamations, &amp; much and
continual ſearching for him, which hath
brought ſo great vexation vpon Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,
and vpon many Prieſts taken by his
occaſion, but that I liſt not much to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
in ſuch a matter as this. Only this I may
tell the <hi>Deuine,</hi> that my Lord Biſhop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
as I haue beene credibly informed,
tooke notice and exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the ſpeachs
of ſome Catholiques of worth, who ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
feelingly of what they ſuffered by his
occaſion, and wiſhed he would for auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their trouble, withdraw himſelfe:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17863:71"/>
which ſheweth that Catholiques find the
contrary of what this <hi>Deuine</hi> would make
them beleeue.</p>
                     <p>His 3. reaſon is, becauſe there can be
no greater daunger iuſtly pretended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
one Biſhop, then againſt ſo many
Prieſts, they being forbidden by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
lawes, and he being not forbidden
by either moderne or ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t lawes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
I anſwer, that as I haue ſhewed before,
the daunger is far greater. For Epiſcopall
Authority is ſo much more forbidden, as
it is greater Authority, deriued from the
ſea of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a double Authority. For
beſides the iuriſdiction of <hi>forum internum,</hi>
which Prieſts haue, the Biſhop would
haue another of <hi>forum externum,</hi> which
is much more againſt the moderne lawes,
then the former. Beſides that I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before, that the Authority which my
Lord Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> challengeth, is
truly againſt our ancient Lawes.</p>
                     <p>The 4. reaſon is, becauſe there is no
Law ancient or moderne againſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Epiſcopall Authority: for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
lawes forbid an extraordinary Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall,
as that of Legates, and ordayne
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17863:72"/>
only for Catholique tymes, when there
were true Epiſcopall tribunals, which
they would not haue diſturbed by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Tribunals, and ſo are rather in
fauour of vſuall Epiſcopal Authority, as
the Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedons</hi> is, then any way
againſt it; that they are only againſt a
new Tribunall, ſuch as a Catholique E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall
tribunall is not.</p>
                     <p>For this reaſon I anſwere, it is the
ſame with the former, and hath beene oft
repeated; the often repetition of the ſame
diſcouering the want of matter the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine</hi>
hath. The ſubſtance of the argument
I anſwered fully before in the anſwere
to the 2. poynt of Temerity, where I
ſhewed this Tribunall, which he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
to be new, and to be by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
more neere a Legatiue, then an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall
Tribunall, though indeed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and ſo not onely extraordinary, but
moſt extraordinary. Heere therfore I wil
onely ſpeake of that, which the <hi>Deuine</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cideth
ſo plainly of my Lord of <hi>Chalcedons</hi>
Tribunall, in ſaying the auncient lawes
are rather in fauour of vſuall Epiſcopall
Authority, ſuch as my Lord Biſhop of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17863:72"/>
                        <hi>Chalcedons</hi> is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherin I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but note how
this <hi>Deuine</hi> is a little more free in auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
my Lord Biſhops Tribunall, or
power in <hi>foro externo,</hi> then I belieue my
Lord Biſhop himſelfe or ſome of his more
wary Officers are, when they write, or
ſpeake to men of vnderſtanding.</p>
                     <p>For though my Lord Biſhops words
in his owne Letter did ſeeme very plaine
in this point, as that he was delegated by
his Holynes to an vniuerſality of cauſes
belonging to Ordinaries, and that he was
made a Iudge <hi>in prima instantia;</hi> yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in a certayne Letter, to a Lady,
which hath beene ſeene vnder his owne
hand, his Lordſhip ſayth, that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the new Tribunall, which ſome ſay
he hath erected, it is a meere fiction, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
without ground, for he neuer
thought of erecting ſuch a Tribunall, and
that his Authority ouer them, is meerly
ſpirituall; as the wordes of his Breue are,
<hi>in Spirituale bonum Catholicorum,</hi> to wit, to
adminiſter to them that Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which
they cannot haue, but by a Biſhop &amp;c.
And in conformity hereof, there being a
meeting appointed by ſome of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17863:73"/>
and ſome of the Layty, and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
held concerning this Letter of my
Lords to the Lady, thoſe of the ſayd
Clergy, that were there (and were lyke
to know moſt of my Lord Biſhops mynd)
acknowledged; and conformably them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
ſayd, that my Lord Biſhop neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
any ſuch Tribunall. And it went
ſo far, as that the Lay Gentlemen drew a
certayne Letter to the ſame effect, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of his Lordſhips firſt Letter, in
which he ſayd his meaning was miſtake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
which his Lordſhip might pleaſe to write
to the Laity, expreſſing as much to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as
he had done to the Lady; which though
it were no more then he had already writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and was confeſſed by his owne offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
yet he would not write it: for what
reaſon I know not.</p>
                     <p>Nay, this <hi>Deuine</hi> himſelfe in mayntay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this Tribunall, ſeemeth a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to himſelfe. For in his firſt ſection,
and 3. point of Paſſion, he complayneth
of the Gentlemen for ſtretching, as he
ſayth, my Lord Biſhops words vpon the
Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter hooks, in that they vnderſtood his
Lordſhips words of an Epiſcopall Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17863:73"/>
or power, in <hi>foro externo.</hi> Whereas,
ſayth he, the Biſhop ſpeaketh onely of
ſuch Authority, as Ordinaries haue, or
can hane in their Dioceſſe, and which
was ſufficient to exact of Regulars, that
they ſhould aske his approbation. And a
little after: Where, ſayth he, in all the
Biſhops Letter, is there one word of
temporall Authority, or of Authority
ouer temporall fortunes, or ſuch as haue
beene altered or directed by our Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Princes? What word then of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
enforced them to make this ſenſe?
None ſurely but their owne paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which
made them make this forced ſenſe, this
forced inference. Theſe are the <hi>Deuines</hi>
owne words: which I do not ſee well,
how he can reconcile with his words in
this place. Wherfore, though I will not
take vpon me to teach ſuch a <hi>Deuine,</hi> yet
I may ſay he ſhould haue beene better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed,
and agreed better vpon his tale,
both with himſelfe and with others of his
owne ſayde, before he had fallen to write;
and ſo perhaps he might haue ſaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
all this needleſſe labour of writing,
and me the labour of anſwearing; for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17863:74"/>
neyther he, nor any elſe can well tel what
Authority they would haue for my Lord
Biſhop; onely Authority they would
haue for him, and for themſelues: But
what, or how, they cannot tell. For,
fayne they would haue his Lordſhip to
haue Authority of Ordinary: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that, they cannot ſo well compaſſe
their ends; nor with it neyther, I may
truly ſay. And yet they find ſuch mayne
obſtacles on the other ſyde, making it not
only difficult, but euen impoſſible, that
they are fayne for ſhame ſake to deny all
ſuch pretences. And thence it is, that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metymes
they ſay one thing, ſometymes
another. Sometymes that he is Ordinary,
ſometymes that he hath faculties only for
the ſpirituall good of Catholickes, &amp;c.
And they are ſo nice and wary, when
they ſpeake with people that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
things, or may make any vſe of
their words, that one cannot tell well,
what they ſay; and yet they are more
free of their tongue, then their penne.
For they will not giue halfe that vnder
their hands, which they talke freely. But
if they went vpon a ſure ground, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17863:74"/>
meant nothing but wel and fairely, what
ſhould all this need?</p>
                     <p>Well then; ſo it is, that the <hi>Deuine</hi>
doth heere challenge more Authority for
my Lord Biſhop, to wit, a true Epiſcopall
tribunal, then his Lordſhip doth for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
For in his ſayd Letter to the Lady
vnder his own hand, he ſaith it is a fictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
to which Letter I remit this man for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
to his 4. reaſon. After theſe 4. ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall
reaſons to proue that the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
are only pretended, this <hi>Deuine</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to anſwere that which the Lay men
ſay in their Letter; that the execution of
this Epiſcopall Authority, alloweth no
poſſibility of ſecrecy, by asking, why not
aſwell as the execution of Prieſtly fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
who ſay maſſe, preach, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
before many ſcores of men,
women, and Children; whereas to the
Biſhops Tribunall there come no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
few women, and not many men.
He asketh moreouer how the Biſhop hath
gone ouer almoſt all England, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
many thouſands with ſufficient ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy?
How was ſecrecy kept in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
Church? How is it now kept in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:17863:75"/>
                        <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Holland?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I anſwere, firſt, that it is no
wonder, that ſuch men as this <hi>Deuine,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the caſe of Engliſh Catholiques elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
as they pleaſe to ſtrangers, when
this <hi>Deuine</hi> will tell men heere at home
ſuch a tale as this is in writing. Secondly
I tell him, though he cannot but know it,
the Execution of Epiſcopall Authority
in a Court, is of its own nature publique.
There muſt of neceſſity be a Iudge, and
other Officers; there muſt be partyes;
there muſt be witneſſes, there muſt be
writing; there muſt be records: ſome
muſt be ſometymes grieued; ſome will
complaine, ſome will appeale. Is any of
all this needfull in hearing of Maſſe, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
or receyuing of Sacraments? May
not a man heare a Maſſe, confeſſe, and
communicate without a Iudge, a Summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
a Notary, without an accuſer, a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
without a writing &amp;c? What
then doth this <hi>Deuine</hi> meane to bring
ſuch an argument? Suppoſe there be 10.
perſons at Maſſe, may there not be one
alone? Can a buſines be ſo diſpatched iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>idically
in a Biſhops Court, without
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17863:75"/>
writing, witneſſe, or Officer? Nay againe,
ſuppoſe there muſt of neceſſity be 20. at
Maſſe, and a buſines in the Biſhops Court
might be diſpatched but with the priuity
of 2. men, would not euen this be more
publique in regard the things muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
in writing, with note of place,
tyme, and other circumſtances; or that
one of the partyes may be grieued, as it
falleth out commonly, in matters of
ſuite?</p>
                     <p>For the Secrecy of the Biſhops going o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
a great part of England &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firming,
I am full glad that he, &amp; they haue done
ſo well with it, and wiſh they may do ſo
ſtill. But for all that, it is not good brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging:
and as ſecret as it is, I know many
a right good man, that would be loath to
haue it ſo well knowne, when he hath a
Prieſt in his houſe, as it is knowne wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
almoſt his Lordſhip went: and the
ſecrecy it ſeemeth, was ſo great in ſome
places, that there was a great complaint
made in Parliament, to what bouldnes
the Papiſts were growne, to haue a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
to whome there was ſuch reſort in
a certayne place in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> where he
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17863:76"/>
confirmed many, and ſhewed himſelfe
in his Pontificall Ornaments.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly I anſwere, that ſuppoſe the
Biſhops going vp and downe and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
were as ſecret, and voyd of daunger
as this <hi>Deuine</hi> would haue it, what doth
it make for his purpoſe? Which is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
that a Biſhops Tribunall alloweth as
much ſecrecy, as the exerciſe of Prieſtly
function? For who doubteth but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
may if he will, confirme a man as
priuatly, as a Prieſt may communicate
him? Doth it then follow, that he may
with the ſame priuacy iudge, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
a controuerſy betweene party and
party? What manner of arguing then is
this?</p>
                     <p>Now for the Primitiue Church, which
our <hi>Deuine</hi> ſpeaketh of, I ſayd a word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and it is cleare there is a great deale
of difference. For that perſecution was
more by fits, more violent for the tyme,
but ſhorter; &amp; in the interim, there were
ſuch calmes as Chriſtians had free reſort
to publique places of prayer and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and houſes deputed and dedicated
for that vſe: and that not onely by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuency
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17863:76"/>
but euen by publique allowance
of the Emperours, reſtoring vnto them
their Churches, &amp; permitting of free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
to them, &amp; the Cemiteries or places
of buriall, where the bodyes of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
and Martyrs reliques were buryed
and kept. There was an outward appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
diſtinction in habit and haire, betweene
Clergy men &amp; others. Where hath there
beene any thing like this, all this time of
Schiſme in England? Haue not men
inough to do to heare a Maſſe priuatly in
a corner? Where is there a Church to ſay
Maſſe, or to preach, or an Oratory for
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to meet &amp; pray togeather, or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
for Catholiques to bury their dead?
Or where is there a Prieſt, or Religious
man that goeth publiquely in his habit, or
with his crowne ſhauen? Would not any
man count one halfe mad that ſhould go
ſo, becauſe they did ſo ſometimes in the
Primitiue Church? What wonder then
is it, if in the Primitiue Church Biſhops
kept their Tribunals, &amp; Prouinciall Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
met with many ſcores of Biſhops, as
the <hi>Deuine</hi> ſayth? Though by his leaue,
they met not ſo freely, nor exerciſed their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17863:77"/>
Authority ſo much at all times; to wit, in
thoſe hoate fittes of perſecution. And
what a wonder is it for our <hi>Deuine</hi> who
muſt be ſuppoſed to haue a little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, to bob
men heere in the mouth, with the ſtate of
the Primitiue Church?</p>
                     <p>The ſame is of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
For <hi>Ireland,</hi> Catholique Biſhops haue ſtill
continued in their ſeuerall Seas, with
their proper titles, hereſy hauing neuer
taken ſo deep root there. But heere it is
well knowne, that when our Catholique
Biſhops were ſuppreſſed, they, during
their liues, forbare the exerciſe of that
power which they were in poſſeſſion of;
&amp; the ſtate of things being ſuch as it was
and impoſſible to exerciſe Epiſcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
wherefore the Sea Apoſtolique
did not put any Biſhop in their place, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ſpace of 60 yeares till of late, the
ſtate of things nothing changed but only
that for matters of life &amp; death the lawes
were not ſo rigorouſly put in execution,
vpon informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſome men, who lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for Myters, as if the times were now
for it, <hi>Gregory</hi> the 15. of happy memory
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17863:77"/>
condeſcended to their importunity, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
one with Title of a Biſhop, but not
with that full power, which belongeth
to a Catholique Country: which experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſheweth to be more then the times
can well beare. What compariſon then
betwene <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>England?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for <hi>Holland,</hi> though conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the littleneſſe of perſecution, they
might ten tims better haue a Biſhop there
then we heere; yet they haue only a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
with a forraine Title, and I belieue
with power farre ſhort of that which this
<hi>Deuine</hi> would faine haue for my Lord of
<hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Where if they had Biſhops, &amp;
Biſhops Courts as we haue, ſuch lawes
of auncient and late times as we haue, I
doubt whether they would haue euen
that. But to be brief, I ſay in a word, that
our Kingdome is more different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> then they two are
from perfect Catholique countryes. And
whereas this <hi>Deuine</hi> bringeth a place of
Scripture for proofe of the prouidence of
God, thereby to make men not ſo to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
vpon ſecrecy, I may bring two to the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. One is that of our Sauiour <hi>Math.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17863:78"/>
4. Non tentabis Dominum Deum tuum,</hi> thou
ſhalt not tempt thy Lord God, as they do
that put themſelues into needleſſe perils.
Another is that of our Sauiour alſo which
he gaue to his Apoſtles, when he ſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to preach, <hi>Matth. 10. Ecce ego mitto vos
ſicut oues in medio luporum: eſtete ergo prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
ſicut ſerpentes, &amp; ſimplices ſicut columbae:
Cauete autem ab hominibus, tradent enim
vos &amp;c.</hi> Behould I ſend you as ſhep amid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
wolues, be therefore prudent as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
and ſimple as doues: but beware
of men, for they will betray you &amp;c.
Which admonition is as proper for our
Country, &amp; our tymes, as euer it was for
any. And therefore notwithſtanding our
<hi>Deuines</hi> confidence, I ſhall wiſh ſtill, that
with ſincerity and zeale, men ioyne pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or elſe their zeale may do more
harme then good. And we find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that the prudent ſecrecy of ſome
hath beene a greater meanes of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
Catholique Religion in theſe hard
times, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ouer-hardy zeale of others.
And ſo much for the fourth Section.</p>

                     <head>SECT. V. That their cauſe of publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
diſauowing the Bishops Authority
is not pretended, and feigned.</head>
                     <p>VVHEREAS the Catholiques in
their Letter ſay, that it was vnſafe
for them to haue beene ſilent ſo long to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Lordſhip, ſo clayming &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
his Authority; this <hi>Deuine</hi> ſaith,
that they pretend the cauſe of diſauowing
the Biſhops power of Ordinary, was the
feare of daunger of the State, if they had
not ſo done. Which to be meerely feigned
he proueth by many reaſons, all of them
almoſt alledged, and anſwered before.
But as he alledgeth them heere againe, ſo
muſt I be faine to repeat the anſwers. The
firſt is, becauſe no vſuall Authority of an
Ordinary, which alone the Biſhop clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
but at moſt Extraordinary of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
and ſuch like, was forbidden by the
ancient lawes, without the Princes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.
I anſwere as before, that my
Lord Biſhops Authority which he clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
is not that vſuall Authority of an
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17863:79"/>
Ordinary, but that extraordinary of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and ſuch like; as appeareth plainly
by the wordes of his owne Letter; wherin
he ſayth, he is not Ordinary, <hi>Ordinario
modo,</hi> but <hi>Extraordinario,</hi> as Legats, Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o's,
&amp; ſuch like. Now that is vſuall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
for an Ordinary, which is had in
the vſual manner: therfore that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which he claymeth, is that, which is
forbydden by the aunicent lawes.</p>
                     <p>The 2. reaſon, becauſe thoſe lawes
were made for Catholique tymes, and in
fauour of Catholique Ordinaryes: not
for herelicall tymes, and in fauour of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall
Ordinaries againſt Catholiques. I
anſwere; well, be it ſo. Doth this <hi>Deuine</hi>
thinke in his Conſcience ſuch an Anſw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere
would quit a man that ſhould ſtand at
the barre for acknowledging of my Lord
Biſhops Ordinaryſhippe, or Iudicatiue
Power? Sure he cannot thinke it; For
though the law were made in a Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
tyme, when they litle dreamed of
ſuch a change, as hath beene ſince; yet
now the tymes are changed, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Ordinaryes are come in place of
Catholiques; all the power &amp; priuiledges
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17863:79"/>
of the one conferred vpon the other; and
the Law not repealed, are not men ſtill
liable? What with right, and what with
might, queſtionleſſe, a man would be
found guilty.</p>
                     <p>For his 3. reaſon, he ſaith, he much
ſuſpecteth, that only priuity doth not
make a man guilty, but granteth it of
acknowledgement or participation? But
he asketh, what need they had, to take
knowledge of ſuch Authority? For, the
Biſhop, he ſayth, wrote but one Letter
of this matter, which came to few hands,
and far fewer can be conuinced to haue
ſeene it. I anſwere, that for the priuity,
though this <hi>Deuine</hi> ſay he ſuſpecteth that
wil not make a man guilty, yet I preſume
he cannot be ſo bad a Lawyer as not to
know that priuity in matter of felony or
treaſon maketh a man acceſſary, if he but
onely know it, and not diſcouer it. If ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
then certaynely guilty: and this
is generall in all criminall maters without
exception. Why then, ſhould he make
queſtion in this matter? Or taking know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of it, I would faine heare how could
any man auoyde it? Suppoſe any man
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17863:80"/>
ſhould haue been queſtioned for acknow;
ledgement of his Lordſhips Authority,
could he pleade ignorance of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
clayme, it being made, by a Letter
written to all the Catholiques of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
for their ſatisfaction, and to let
them know, what Authority he had?
Would it ſeeme probable that any Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
ſhould not ſee, or heare of ſuch a
Letter? Now that the Letter was but one,
that it came to few hands; It is true, it
was but one: But that one was inough,
and more then inough. For what he
ſayth, of the Letters comming to few
hands; I anſwere firſt, it ſeemeth by the
matter and manner of writing, to haue
beene my Lord Biſhops intention that it
ſhould come to more. Secondly, it is well
knowne, that there were more copies
made, and ſome of my Lords Clergy had
the care ſpeedily to diuulge it; ſo as it was
diuulged in ſome remote parts of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;
at the very ſame tyme it was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
heere. How then can this <hi>Deuine</hi>
ſay, the Letter came but to few mens
hands? And for being conuinced to haue
ſeene it, in ſo publique a thing as that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17863:80"/>
was, no man will ſtand to proue it, but
preſume it, as any man wel may. For what
Catholique could be ignorant of it?</p>
                     <p>The 4. reaſon is, That many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes
before my Lord Biſhop published
his Authority of Ordinary, theſe Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen
ſent Interrogatories (as this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine</hi>
termeth them) vnto him to haue him
declare whether he was Ordinary or no.
So as he ſayth, they were rather deſyrous,
he ſhould declare himſelfe to be Ordinary
then conceale it. It is true, Catholiques
ſaw many things they could not tell what
to make of; and ſo might be willing to
know certainly, and from his Lordſhip
himſelfe what Authority he had: but
might not the anſwere haue beene pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate,
as the demaunds were? They were
deſirous to know, but not ſo, that all the
world muſt know, they knew; had they
knowne in priuate, they might haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
the inconueniency and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
priuately to my Lords conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But his Lordſhip feared ſome ſuch
thing, and therfore made anſwere in
ſuch publique manner, as to carry the
matter cleere, without reply. But that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17863:81"/>
put men vpon a greater neceſſity of reply.
As for that which he ſayth, that they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
deſirous he ſhould declare himſelfe
Ordinary, it is playne they deſyred it not,
but the cleane contrary. But whatſoeuer
it was that he pretended, they deſyred to
know it.</p>
                     <p>The fifth reaſon is, That the Biſhop
euer ſince his comming auouched him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
Ordinary, and till the matter of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of Regulars, his Ordinaryſhip
was not queſtioned, nor daunger preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
whereof, he ſayth, they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but they had ſome priuity. I anſwere
that heere againe the <hi>Deuine</hi> forgetteth
himſelfe, for he was angry before with
Catholiques, for vnderſtanding the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
owne words in his Letter ſo plainly
of his Ordinaryſhip, and yet he would
haue them take notice of ordinary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certayne
reports. It is true therefore that
they heard ſometymes ſpeaches, as if he
were Ordinary, but they made not much
account of them (for his predeceſſour was
ſometymes ſayd to be Ordinary alſo, and
yet he neuer pretended any Authority
ouer them, that they could heare.) But
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17863:81"/>
when they heard of many things, which
his Lordſhips Officers did, and of perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory,
and Authoritatiue Letters which
they writ, with the Iudicatiue manner of
proceeding of ſome Rurall Deanes, and
ſaw the very Patents or Letters of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Archdeacons playnely ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the ſame, then they beganne to
looke about them, and to enquire a litle
more of that Ordinaryſhippe, what it
meant, and whether my Lord of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
tooke himſelf to haue the ſame power,
which Biſhops had heretofore in Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
tymes, and ſo ſent to his Lordſhip
to know it from himſelfe; ſo that all this
while they had no priuity of it, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
till his Lordſhip publiſhed it by his
Letter,</p>
                     <p>The 6. reaſon: They gaue this Letter
to be ſent to Rome, and as ſome ſay (ſaith
he) long before they ſent it to the Biſhop,
and deſired the Biſhop, that it might be
knowne abroad: Now, to what end was
it ſent to Rome, and deſired to be ſent
abroad, if it were made only for the ſtate?
I anſwere, that the <hi>Deuine</hi> with his (as
ſome ſay) is egregiouſly miſtaken in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17863:82"/>
the Letter was ſent to Rome, before
it was ſent to the Biſhop, for there be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that know better then all his (ſome
ſayes) if there be any beſides himſelf,
which auerre the contrary. Now for the
demaund why it was ſent to Rome, and
deſired to be ſent abroad, if it were onely
made for the State? I demaund againe,
where he findeth that it was made onely
for the ſtate? If he meane that the chiefe
reaſon of writing it, was to declare the
dangers &amp; inconueniences which might
fall vpon them from the ſtate by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
and admittance of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
pretended Authority, it is true: but
that is not all one, as to ſay, that it was
made onely for the ſtate. For it was made
principally for his Lordſhip, &amp; for thoſe,
of whome his power, and the enlarging
and diminiſhing therof doth depend, to
ſee; that conſidering the daungers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences,
both his Lordſhip might
pleaſe to deſiſt from ſuch pretenſions, &amp;
others forbeare to graunt ſuch power as
was ſo daungerous, and ſo peiudiciall to
Catholiques. Now what inconſequence
was there in this to deſire his Lordſhip to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:17863:82"/>
make it knowne abroad? or fearing with
themſelues (for they expreſſed no ſuch
feare to him) that he would not, they
ſent it by ſome other meanes? What a
doughty reaſon then is this, to proue the
Catholiques cauſe to be pretended, and
feigned?</p>
                     <p>The 7. reaſon: When Father <hi>Campian</hi>
came in, and made publique chalenge of
diſputation in print, and proclamations
were made agaynſt him, what Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
did publiquely diſauowe him, or
his Authority, or faculties? My anſwere
to this is, that I ſee not what there is to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere;
for what likenes can there be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
in this argument, ſaue onely the
publiqueneſſe of Father <hi>Campians</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
of diſputation, and the publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of my Lord Biſhops clayme of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?
Which if it be ſufficient, then
I will make the <hi>Deuines</hi> argument a little
better for him, by asking, why Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
do not diſauow al Letters, or Breues
of the Sea Apoſtolike nay al bookes writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of Controuerſies, in defence of the
Catholique Fayth for theſe are publique?
Now, I aſſure my ſelfe there is no <hi>Deuine</hi>
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:17863:83"/>
in the world ſo dull, but can eaſily find a
great deale of difference betweene theſe
two laſt, and my Lord Biſhops Letter,
though one be much more like the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of <hi>Father Campians</hi> challenge. But
becauſe the <hi>Deuine</hi> perhaps will not be
willing to find a difference, I will do it
for him. It was not <hi>Father Campians</hi> doing
nor meaning to publiſh any ſuch chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
but made two Copies of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
one to haue about himſelfe in caſe
he ſhould be taken ſuddenly, before he
ſhould haue time to do any thing, of what
he came for: and another in a freinds
hand, with order to publiſh it when he
ſhould be taken, if by chaunce, as it was
moſt like, his aduerſaries ſhould ſuppreſſe
that which he ſhould haue about him.
But his friend not obſeruing this order,
goeth and publiſheth it of himſelf. So the
publiſhing was not his doing. Beſides it
was a particular acte, which concerned
himſelfe only, without relation to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques,
no matter of Authority, or
iuriſdiction eyther <hi>in foro externo</hi> or <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
but a neceſſary defence of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
fayth at that tyme, no exerciſe ſo
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17863:83"/>
much as of Prieſtly function, but a thing
which any Layman, for the thing it ſelf,
might do. What need then of diſauowing
his Authority, or Faculties for that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
                     <p>Now, my Lord Biſhops Letter was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be publique, as being written
to Catholiques, ſo that they could not
but know of it, hauing alſo for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
particuler relation to them; the ſubiect
of the Letter an authority of an outward
Court or Tribunall, not neceſſary at this
time, nor conuenient for the defence or
propagation of the Catholique faith, but
offenſiue to the State, dangerous to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques,
as being contrary to the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
and moderne lawes; grieuous in
regard of many inconueniences, which
it bringeth with it; and the very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
much more admittance wherof,
bringeth daunger. What then doth this
<hi>Deuine</hi> talke of diſauowing Authority &amp;
facultyes ſuch as <hi>Fa. Campian</hi> had, as if
any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> denied them to my Lord Biſhop?
No, no man denieth, or diſauoweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
or any thing elſe of my Lord Biſhops, but
only they deſire not to be preſſed to the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17863:84"/>
admittance of that Authority of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which without any furtherance, or
any the leaſt neceſſity of their ſpirituall
good may bring many temporall dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers
vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; put them into more ſtraites,
then they haue beene this time of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
Which truly, is but a very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and reaſonable requeſt. There is
no affinity therefore betweene my Lord
Biſhops claime of Authority, and <hi>F. Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi>
challenge of Diſputation.</p>
                     <p>The eight reaſon. It is more noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
that there are many hundred of
Prieſts then one Biſhop, and more ſeuere
lawes againſt any priuity or participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with them, then for the Biſhop; and yet
theſe men, ſayth he, make no publique
diſauow of Prieſts Authority, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnſafe for hauing beene
ſo long ſilent. I anſwere, that the reaſon
is idle. Suppoſe there were as many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of Prieſts, as there are hundreds,
nay if there were as many Biſhop as there
are Prieſts, if they had not the power of
Ordinary what were that to our purpoſe,
the queſtion being of an Ordinary with
power in <hi>foro externo?</hi> Now for the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17863:84"/>
of a Prieſt or Biſhop whether greater,
is impertinent as long as the one is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
the other not. Beſides that, ſuch Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoply
Authority with the daungers, and
inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences proper to it ſelfe, bringeth
with it the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers of Prieſtly Authority.
The <hi>Deuine</hi> could not, but know thus
much of himſelfe, and yet he muſt put
downe this reaſon to make number.</p>
                     <p>The ninth reaſon; None but theſe 3.
and ſome few of their adherents appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
this daunger of being ſilent, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Biſhops Authority, &amp; yet many
haue more to looſe then they; &amp; a Noble
man tould them by publique Letter, that
<hi>Timebant, vbi non erat timor.</hi> I anſwere, for
the number, and worth of the Perſons
that apprehend this daunger, there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
ſayd before: &amp; the thing is ſo well
knowne, that ſurely this <hi>Deuine</hi> would
not haue ventured his credit by ſpeaking
ſo apparent an vntruth, but that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
his name. For the Noble mans ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I anſwere it with the wiſemans ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>ſapiens timet, &amp; declinat à malo: stultus
transilit, &amp; confidit.</hi> The wiſeman feareth
and auoydeth euill; the foole leapeth ouer
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17863:85"/>
and conſideth.</p>
                     <p>The 10. reaſon; The Monkes made
clayme of a farre greater Authority, and
farre more daungerous to the Laity, and
in a more publique ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner by many prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
copyes, and yet theſe men do not go
about to diſauowe the ſame publiquely. I
anſwere, that till my Lord Biſhops Letter
no man heard of any ſuch matter from
the Benedictines, or any elſe. Therefore
if there were any daunger in their clayme
we may plainly thanke my Lord Biſhops
Letter, as the cauſe thereof. Secondly,
the ſame Letter wherby the Catholiques
deſired to be excuſed from my Lord of
<hi>Chalcedons</hi> Ordinaryſhip, is ſufficient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that, or any other booke, that ſhal
clayme ſuch Authority, as things ſtand
heere in England, and therefore there
needeth no other diſclayming. Now for
their claime, I do not ſee that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
they exact any ſuch matter of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
from Catholiques, but only ſay,
they keepe a kind of poſſeſſion of their
ancient right, againſt the tyme ſhal ſerue
for it; and that if they would ſtand vpon
it, they might better do it then my Lord
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17863:85"/>
of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Now what offence or daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is this to Catholiques? And for the
publiqueneſſe, the book is printed indeed,
but no way directed to Catholiques, but
to their owne Religious. But this <hi>Deuine,</hi>
that in this place thinketh much, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
do not diſauow this Booke, I preſume,
was priuy to another Paper deliuered vp
at Rome, wherein it was ſayd, that the
Layty were much offended at ſuch a vaſt
claime: how do theſe hang together? But
that was for the purpoſe in that place, &amp;
this, it ſeemeth, in this; and he perhaps
thought the ſame man ſhould neuer come
to ſee both the papers. But as cloſe as that
and ſuch like papers are carried by this
<hi>Deuine,</hi> &amp; his friends, they come to light
one way or other, little to their credit,
that care ſo little for truth in what they
ſay.</p>
                     <p>The laſt reaſon, is deliuered by the
<hi>Deuine</hi> in theſe words: Laſtly what nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they to haue ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed the ſtate againſt
the Biſhop? therefore theſe pretences are
ad <hi>excuſandas excuſationes in peccati<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>:</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas
the true cauſe was to help ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars
to baniſh Epiſcopall power out of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17863:86"/>
England. This is the <hi>Deuines</hi> Concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Whereto I anſwere; that for a concluſion
I did expect a concluding reaſon, but it is
ſo farre from concluding, that I ſee no
ſhew of reaſon. For how doth the asking
of this queſtion, what they needed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
the State againſt the Biſhop, proue
that the cauſe of writing their letter, was
pretended? The <hi>Deuine</hi> might haue made
this a motiue, which might haue moued
them not to write their Letter to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
in that manner: but to make it an
argument to proue, that their pretence
was faygned, I ſee not with what Logick
it can ſtand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But now for the matter, it
is a ſtrange thing, that a <hi>Deuine</hi> ſhould
haue no more ſcruple then to charge me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of knowne vertue, and wiſedome; with
incenſing the State againſt the Biſhop.
Were it not more time for him to ſtudy
his caſes, &amp; examine well his Conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
then to ſtand cenſuring men ſo deeply,
and ſo iniuriouſly? What do they ſay ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this way? That the erecting of a new
tribunall, will moue the State to a more
exact ſearch &amp;c? For this, I haue anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before, and ſhewed, that this is ſayd
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17863:86"/>
to the cleane contrary end; to wit, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the Search and Perſecution, which
his Lordſhips clayme would bring vpon
himſelf and others; and by their ſaying
to appeaſe that which his Lordſhips doing
would incenſe. Which if it ſeeme preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
vnto him, is wholy beſydes their
meaning and he may th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore to anſwere this <hi>Deuines</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
place of Scripture, of excuſes in
ſinnes, I may now aske him in behalfe of
theſe Gentlemen, and all others whoſe
