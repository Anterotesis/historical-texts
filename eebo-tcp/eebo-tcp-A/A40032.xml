            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DESCRIPTION
OF THE
SQUARE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE whole superficies is divided into
four lesser Squares, by the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
FG and HI.</p>
            <p>Each of the 4 Semidiameters EF,
EH, EG, EI, are divided as the
lines of Sines upon the Sector, the
Semidiameters being the whole Sine,
And through the parts of each Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter
are drawn right lines per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
thereunto, quite over the face of the whole Square
every 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, &amp;c. are to be distinguished from the rest, for
the more easie and speedy account.</p>
            <p>Upon the limb are inserted several Scales, for several uses.
The edges of these Scales bordering close upon the sides of
the inner Square, that it may be discerned which lines and
parts of the Scales doe butt one upon the other.</p>
            <p>On the sides AB, AC, are inscribed Scales of equal
parts, the whole being divided into 10, and subdivided as
quantity will give leave. The parts are numbred by 1. 2. 3. 4.
5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10, and may stand, either for 1. 2. 3, &amp;c. or for
10. 20. 30, &amp;c. or for 100. 200. 300, &amp;c. as occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
            <p>To the lines BI and CG, are annexed Scales of right sines
whose beginning is at B and C, and the end at I and G, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
by 10. 20, &amp;c. to 90.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54792:3"/>
The other parts ID, GD, have Scales of Tangents from
0 gr. to 45 gr. numbred either from G to D, and so to I. Or
from I to D, and so to G, or rather both wayes, by 10, 20,
30, &amp;c. till 90, and these divisions have respect to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
E.</p>
            <p>Lastly, a Scale of larger Tangents, lying behind these last
named, Parallel to the sides BD, CD, beginning 0 gr. from B
and C, and so proceeding to 45 gr. in D and ending in 90 gr.
at C and B, accounted both wayes. These have respect to
their Center A.</p>

               </head>
            </figure>
            <p>There is further added a threed and plummet, which is to
be used in every practice, and must be in length equal to the
lines AF, and FG. And if the threed be found inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in practice, because it will take up the use of both hands,
there may instead of it, be used a little Bowe, the threed of it
being at the least equal to AD, which will perform the office
of the other threed by the help of one hand only, or a
straight ruler may serve, if it be thought convenient for that
purpose.</p>
            <p>If the Square be applyed to the observation of Angles, it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54792:3"/>
may be fitted thereto one of these two wayes, <hi>Either by
placing</hi> two sights upon the side of the Square, one upon the
Center A, the other upon the line AB, which issueth out of
the Center A. <hi>And a running sight</hi> contrived upon the utter
edge of the Instrument to move from B to C by D forward,
and so from C to B by D, backward again; <hi>Or else</hi> if this be
thought inconvenient, or not feasible because of the sights turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over at the Angle D, then this moveable sight may goe
onely upon one of the sides BD or CD. And for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the sight at A, is to stand precisely upon the Center, and
both the sides AB, AG must have sights there fixed, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely,
upon their lines that come from A.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54792:4"/>
Pole; Or by adding the Declination to 90 gr. when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
and elevated Pole are of several denominations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In this case,</hi> we have the three sides of a Spherical Triangle
given, and an Angle sought.</p>
                     <p>The two legs are <hi>The complement of the Latitude,</hi> and <hi>The
Suns distance from the Pole.</hi> The base is, <hi>The complement of
the Suns Altitude:</hi> The Angle is the <hi>Hour</hi> required, which
must be accounted from the Coast of a contrary name, to the
elevated Pole.</p>
                     <p>According then to the former general prescript, and this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
declaration, <hi>For the hour take the sum and difference
of the complement of the Latitude, and of the Suns distance
from the Pole, and from the top of the Square, upon one side,
count the difference, the sum on the other, to these terms apply
the threed; Then from the top of the Square also, count the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of the Suns Altitude, and where it cuts the threed, the
line that crosseth it Square in the same point (being reckoned
from that side whereon the difference of the legs was counted)
gives the hour from the Meridian or noon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To make it plain by an Example.</p>
                     <p>In a North Latitude of 52 gr. 30 min. the Sun declining
20 gr. to the North, the Altitude of the Sun being by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
43 gr. I would know the Hour of the day. The legs
of this Triangle are the complements of the latitude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
that is 37 gr. 30 min. and 70 gr. 0 min. The sum
of them is 107 gr. 30 min. their difference is 32 gr. 30 min.
Then from the top of the Square at D upon the side DG,
I reckon this difference 32 gr. 30 min. downward to <hi>k.</hi> And
on the other side of the Square from the top at B, I also
count the sum of the legs 107 gr. 30 min. downward to <hi>l.</hi> To
<hi>k</hi> and <hi>l.</hi> I apply the threed. Which done from the top of the
Square, again, I count the base 47 gr. the complement of
43 gr. the altitude observed, downward also to 0, and the line
that there meets me, I follow till it cut the threed, which is
at <hi>n,</hi> and the line that there ariseth Square to it is <hi>n r.
I say now that nr,</hi> if it be counted from the side DC
whereon the difference of the legs was counted, shall give
44gr. 8 min. which turned into hours and minutes of an hour,
(allowing 15 gr. to an hour; and 15 min. of a degree to one
minute of an hour) will make two hours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nd 56½ min. from

the Meridian or South, And such is the Hour for that <hi>Latitude,
Altitude,</hi> and <hi>Declination.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>So also,</hi> If in the same Latitude and distance of the Sun
from the Pole, but in the altitude of 10 gr. I would know
<hi>The boure of the day.</hi> Here because the legs, that is, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of the latitude and the distance from the Pole, are
the same, therefore the same position of the threed remaines
still, I therefore onely reckon the base (as before) which here
is 80 gr. from D to <hi>p,</hi> then I follow the line <hi>p,</hi> till it cuts the
threed at <hi>m,</hi> and the line there arising is <hi>m s,</hi> which counted
from DC, whereon the difference of the legs was reckoned,
shall give 99 gr. 50 min. that is 6 hours 39⅔ min. of an hour
from the Meridian or South.</p>
                     <div type="sub-subsection">
                        <head>Another Example.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In the same latitude</hi> of 52 gr. 30 min. let the declination of
the Sun be 20 gr. to the South, where his distance from the
elevated Pole is 110 gr. and let the altitude of the Sun be by
observation 10 gr. I require the <hi>Hour.</hi> The legs are 37 gr.
30 min. the complement of the latitude, And 110 gr. the
Suns distance from the Pole. The sum of them is 147 gr.
30 min. The difference 72 gr. 30 min. which I count upon the
sides of the Square down to <hi>u</hi> and <hi>t;</hi> and the base which is
80 gr. the complement of 10 gr. I count also from D to <hi>p,</hi>
then I follow the line <hi>p,</hi> till it cut the threed at <hi>x,</hi> and the
line there arising is <hi>x y,</hi> which counted from DC, whereon
the difference of the legs was reckoned, shall give 38 grad.
56 min. that is, two hours and almost 36 min. of an houre
from the Meridian or South.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Note,</hi> That the threed in this situation, shewes on the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter

the <hi>Semidiurnal</hi> and <hi>Seminocturnai</hi> Arks, for where the
threed crosseth the middle line, the line there arising, (counted
from that side of the Square, whereon the difference was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred)
shewes the <hi>Semidiurnal</hi> ark, and counted from the other
side, shewes the <hi>Seminocturnal</hi> ark.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Observe also,</hi> If you would known the <hi>Crepusculum</hi> or <hi>Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi>
the threed is to be placed as before, according to the
sum and difference of the legs, and if you allow 18 gr. for the

                           <hi>Crepusculin</hi> line (as they usually doe) the base will alway be
108 gr. which in the two first Examples will not touch the
threed at all, and therefore in that latitude and parallel of the
Sun, the twilight continues all night. But in the last Example
you shall find the <hi>Crepusculin</hi> line to cut the threed, 6 hours
and 15 min. from the Meridian, which shewes that the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
begins at 5¾ a clock in the morning, and ends at 6¼ in

and Hour; And so the threed (which now represents the Suns
parallel:) lying still, you may count the altitudes for all the rest
of the hours for that parallel.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>For Example.</head>
                  <p>In a North latitude of 52 gr. 30 min. let the Sun decline
20 gr. to the North, so that his distance from the elevated
North-pole will be 70 gr. which is one of the legs given, and
the complement of the latitude, 37 gr. 30 min. is the other,
The sum of them is 107 gr. 30 min. The difference is 32 gr.
30 min. This difference is the complement of the Suns Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
altitude; and I count it from D the top of the Square, to
<hi>k:</hi> (in the first figure) thereto applying one end of the threed
And on the other side from B, I count the sum, 107 gr. 30 min.
down to <hi>l,</hi> thereto applying the other end of the threed. The
threed thus laid, resembles the Suns parallel, for that decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
Now from the side D <hi>k,</hi> whereon the difference was
numbred, I count the Vertical Angle, As first 15 gr. for the
first hour from the Meridian, either 11 in the morning, or one
in the afternoon, and where it cuts the threed, I observe the
other line there crossing also, which counted from the top,
gives for the base, 34 gr. 32 min. the complement of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or rather.</hi> Count it from the middle line, which in this case
represents the Horizon, and then you shall have 55 gr. 28 m.
the altitude it self, for that hour and parallel, So the second
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54792:7"/>
hour from the Meridian (10 or 2) gives for the altitude 50 gr.
4 min. The third hour (9 or 3) gives 42 gr. 31 m. The fourth
hour from the Meridian (8 or 4) gives 33 gr. 53 min. The
fifth (7 or 5) gives 24 gr. 48 min. The sixth (6 in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and evening) gives 15 gr. 45 m. The seventh (5 in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or 7 in the evening) gives 7 gr. 6 m. And so farrethe Sun is
above the Horizon in that parallel, and then begins to go down.</p>
                  <p>And observe further, That the threed thus placed taken in
that part below the Horizon, gives the altitudes for the hours
in the declination which is equal to this, but to a contrary
coast; so that the threed in this situation, gives the altitudes
for the declination of 20 grad. towards the South, for that
part of the threed that is under the Horizon or middle
line, is the Semi-nocturnal ark for the parallel lying 20 gr.
from the Equinoctial Northward, and is therefore equal
to the Semi-diurnal ark that belongs to the parallel which
lies 20 gr. from the Equinoctial Southward, and is of like si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
below the Horizon that the other is above, wherefore
the depressions belonging to the hours in this, are the same
with the altitudes of the same hours in the other. To go on then
where we left, The next hour counted from the Meridian of
the Winter parallel is the fourth, that is, either 8 in the morning,
or 4 in the afternoon, and his depression is 0 gr. 50 min. The
next hour the third from the Meridian (either 9 or 3) is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
7 gr. 39 m. The second hour, (10 or 2) is 12 gr. 57 m.
The first hour (11 or 1,) is depressed in this North parallel
16 gr. 20 min. that is, it is elevated so much in the like South
parallel. Thus of each two opposite parallels of declination
may the altitudes be had at one and the same situation of the
threed. But if the other way seeme plainer, do as before.
Let the Sun in the same latitude decline 20 gr. to the South,
his distance from the North elevated Pole, is then 110 gr. the
sum of the complement of the latitude 37 gr. 30 min. and
this distance is 147 gr. 30 min. The difference is 72 gr. 30 m.
This difference I count from D to <hi>t,</hi> (in the first figure,) The
sum I also account as before, from B to <hi>u,</hi> And to <hi>t u,</hi> I placed
the threed, Now from the side D <hi>t,</hi> I count the hours as I did
before, and find the altitude of 11 and 1, 16 gr. 20 min. of 10
and 2, 12 gr. 57 min. of 9 and 3, 7 gr. 39 min. of 8 and 4,
0 gr. 50 min. All the same that the former depressions were;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54792:7"/>
And if now you take the depressions of the hours upon the
threed in this situation, you shall find them all the same that
the altitudes in the former parallel of 20 gr. North declination
were; So that ever, one side of the threed will afford the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
for the hours in any two opposite parallels.</p>
                  <p>The Meridian altitude is the complement of the difference
of the legs, And in the opposite parallel it is the excesse of
the sum of the legs above 90 gr. And as you have done for
the Altitudes of the whole hours, so may you doe for their
halves and quarters. Thus much for this also.</p>

and the same sine serves both to it and to 65 gr. his residue.
<figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>¶And here also is to be noted, That when any Proportion in
right sines alone is offered, and the radius is the first leader
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54792:8"/>
in the Proportion, that then I say, it may be resolved by the
former kind of work, by the sum and difference, counting the
complement of the arks of the two Sines given, for the legs of

                  </p>
                  <p>The two middle arks were 30 gr. and 23 gr. 30 min. their
complements are 60 gr. and 66 g. 30 min. The sum of these is
126 gr. 30 min. there difference 6 gr. 30 min. to this sum and
difference, I apply the threed, as in the former Examples, and
then count the Vertical Angle 90 gr. which fals in the middle
line and where the threed cuts it, there is the quantity of
the Declination, 11 gr. 30 min. as before: And these degrees
are counted from the Center of the Square at E.</p>
                  <p>And thus may all others of this nature, having the radius in

alone, but with sines intermingled with Tangents also,
If it so fall out that these Tangents be lesse then the
radius, And if instead of their proper arks be taken the

               <p>Vpon one of the sides of the lesser square EIGD. Count the

               <p>Here because the proportions are divers, we shall need
more explication then in all the rest. Yet the variety herein, may
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54792:9"/>
be reduced to three wayes according as one of these three, either
the Radius; Sine, or Tangent, doth lead in the Proportion, the
three wayes are these:
<list>
                     <item>1 As the radius, is to a tangent, So is a sine to a Tangent.</item>
                     <item>2 As a sine, is to a tangent, So the Radius is to another
tangent.</item>
                     <item>3 As a tangent, is to the radius, So another tangent, is to a
sine.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>But this variety is not all, for each of these three wayes is
subject to variation, and that upon this occasion.—Vpon
the square we have no tangent greater then the radius, or tangent
of 45 degrees. Wherefore the proportion must be so contrived,
as that no tangent greater then of 45 gr. be ingredient into it.
To that purpose serves this general direction, namely,—If
the tangent which is co-partner, in the proportion with the sine, be
greater then of 45 gr. (alway provided that the two tangents
doe never stand immediately together, which if they doe, may be
brought into frame by transposition or alteration of the middle
term.) Then, In the two first wayes the radius and sine must
change places; and for the two tangents must be taken the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
of their complements; In the third way, the co-tangents of
the third and first terms must remove into the first and third
places.</p>

                  <p>1 As the radius is to the tangent of 40 gr. So the sine of

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vpon the Square</hi> EIDG, I count EG for the radius, and
upon the end of it in the Scales of tangents I reckon G <hi>a,</hi> 40 gr.

which because it is a tangent, must be numbred in the
Scale of tangents, and therefore by help of the line <hi>c e,</hi> I
transferre it thither, and find that the line lies even against
32 gr. 44 min. in the Scale of Tangents, and this is the ark
of the fourth proportional term required.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>As the radius</hi> is to the Tangent of 60 gr. So the sine of
50 gr. to the Tangents of what?</p>
                  <p>
                     <figure/>
Upon the Square I count (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
from G up to D and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to <hi>n,</hi> 60 gr. among the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
and thereto apply the threed.
Then I count the third term. E <hi>b</hi> the
sine of 50 gr. and I follow the line
there arising to the top of the Square,
and yet it meets notwith the threed,
but beyond the Square I see that it
would concurre with it at <hi>r,</hi> which
shewes that the fourth Tangent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
is greater then the Tangent of 45 gr. and therefore
standing as it doth, cannot be expressed upon the Scale of
Tangents, wherefore I alter the Proportion, by transposing
the first and third terms into one anothers places, and for
the Tangents themselves I take their complement thus.</p>
                  <p>As the sine of 50, is to the Co-tangent of 60, So is the
Radius, to a fourth Tangent, which will be the complement
of that which should be produced by the former Proportion.
By this alteration it comes to passe that the sine leads in the
Proportion, and so this Example now fals under the Examples
of the second General way, and therefore shall be resolved
there.</p>

of it I reckon up to D, which is 45 gr. and so forward on the

the sine of 50 gr. and follow the line there arising till it cut
the threed at <hi>i,</hi> so that <hi>b i</hi> is the fourth term, and because it
is a Tangent, therefore by help of the line passing through
<hi>i,</hi> that is, by the line <hi>i m,</hi> I transferre it to the Scale of Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
and find that lies even against 42 gr. 24 min. which is

                     <hi>For the second of the three general wayes,</hi> there are two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
Cases; For the Tangent that is Copartner with the sine in the
Proportion, may be either lesser or greater then of 45 gr.
for the lesser, take the Example which before was preferred
hither, namely,</p>
                  <p>1 As the sine of 50 gr. is to the Tangent of 30 gr. So the
radius is to the Tangent of what?</p>
                  <p>First, upon the side EG, I count the sine of 50 gr. and to
the line there arising, I transferre Gt the Tangent of 30 gr.
by help of the line <hi>t s,</hi> and to <hi>s,</hi> I apply the threed, which
threed cuts the limb in <hi>u,</hi> so that G <hi>u</hi> I find to be the Tangent
of 37 gr. and this is the fourth term required in this Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
But in the second Example going before, whereof
this is also the solution, this 37 gr. is the complement
of the fourth ark there required, so that the fourth ark there,
should be 53 gr. which because it is greater then 45 gr. is
therefore absolved this way, and not the other.</p>
                  <p>2 As the sine of 50 gr. is to the tangent of 50 gr. So the
radius is to the Tangent of what?</p>
                  <p>Here because the Tangent of 50 (being Co-partner in the
Proportion with the sine) is greater then the Tangent of
45 gr. and so cannot be expressed upon the square, therefore
the Proportion must be altered by changing the places of the
first and third terms, and by taking the complement of the
second and fourth, after this manner.</p>

                  <p>Here because the Tangent of 53 gr. being Co-partner in
Proportion with the sine, is greater then of 45 gr. therefore
the first and third terms must change places, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
are also to be taken, thus, As the co-tangent of
53 gr. or Tangent of 37 gr. is to the Radius, So is the co-tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of 60 gr. or Tangent of 30 gr. to the fourth sine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                  <p>Upon GD the side of the Square, I count G <hi>u</hi> the Tangent

follow the line at <hi>t,</hi> till it cut the threed at <hi>s,</hi> and the line <hi>s b,</hi>

               <p>The best way for the solution of Proportions in this kind is
first (as was before admonished in the joynt use of Sines and
Tangents) to seek out a Tangent whereon the Radius is in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
as the sum of the legs is to the difference of them, which
Tangent is ever lesse then the Tangent of 45 gr. or radius,
because the difference of the legs is alway lesse then the sum of
them. And when the radius is brought in, the Proportion may
be absolved upon the lesser Square, which is fitted for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
of Sines and Tangents, in the same manner as was
shewed in the like Examples before. And the Proportion will
then stand thus.</p>
               <p>As the radius, is to this new found Tangent, So is the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of half the sum of the angles, to the Tangent of half
their difference.</p>
               <p>To make it plain by the former instance, As 60 parts, are

gr, 26 min. which is the Tangent sought. And now that
the radius is brought in, the next Proportion will be thus,</p>
               <p>As the radius, is to the Tangent of 18 gr. 26 min.</p>
               <p>So is the Tangent of 30 gr. half the sum of the angles, to

Upon the lesser Square, I take EG for the radius, and

and follow the line thence passing to the threed at σ, where
the line σ φ shewes, in the limb the Tangent G φ, which is the
Tangent of 10 gr. 54 min. the half difference of the angles
required, which added to 30 gr. the half sum, makes the

must be counted upon one side of the Instrument, the second and
fourth upon the lines arising out of the terms of the former, so
the threed applyed to the second, will limit out the fourth.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:54792:14"/>
The manner of the work is alwayes a like, and may suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
be declared in this one Example, I would know
that number whereto 60 bears the same Proportion, that
40 doth to 50: The Proportion stand thus
As 40, is to 50: So 60, to what?</p>
            <p>Upon AC the Scale of equal parts, I count AD 40, and
upon the line arising out of <hi>d,</hi> (by help of the Scale of equal
parts upon the other side AB) I count 50 up to <hi>l,</hi> and thereto
apply the threed, Then upon AC, I count the third term,
60 to K, and follow the line there arising, till it meet with
the threed at <hi>p,</hi> and there the line <hi>p m,</hi> meeting also, shewes
in the Scale <hi>AB</hi> at <hi>m,</hi> 75 parts, which is the fourth propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
number required. And thus in all others.</p>

            <head>Of the use of the Square in the observation of angles.</head>
            <p>WHen the observation is made and the sight placed, then
the threed from A, applyed to the running sight,
will expresse the angle in the larger Tangent, And for
observing any altitude or depth, the threed alone, without the
help of the running sight, will expresse the Angle, if the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
be made as usually it is by other Instruments.—The
Square at the greatest cannot observe an Angle that is greater
then 90. If therefore such an Angle come to be observed, you
must observe the residue of it, which is his complement to
180 degrees.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have had a general view of the use of the Square
in all Triangles and ordinary Proportions in Numbers. Now
remains the bringing of it down to particulars in every kind;
which would be an infinite labour, and un-necessary to those that
are any thing experienced, in the use of Instruments, especially
seeing we have here a tast of every of them, and the particular
Proportions are every where extant. Hereafter I may adde
something more on the other side, for the present I here make
stay, and content my selfe with that which hath already been
delivered.</p>
