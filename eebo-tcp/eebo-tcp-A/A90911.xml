            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>YOur laſt I received, Dated April the 25. 1648. I ſhall indeavour to communicate unto you, the moſt remarkable paſſages, that are more extant. As for the ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Iſland, wherein we are now reſident, we find them to be (for the Major part) verie reall
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:161666:3"/>
and well-affected, and willing to obey the power and Authority of Parliament, and extraordinary obedient to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands of thoſe intruſted by them, as may appear by their late unanimous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, both to our Governour and his Officers; who having received intelligence of the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Col. <hi>Poyer</hi> and his confederates, and their declaring for the <hi>King,</hi> and (moſt Judas-like and traterouſly) betraying the truſt repoſed in them by the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> reſolved with one unanimous conſent to adhere, &amp; ſtand firme to the ſupreame Power and Repreſentatives of <hi>England,</hi> and to hazard lives, fortunes, and eſtates, for the defence &amp; preſervation thereof, (notwithſtanding many invitations lately ſent for their engagements to the contrary.) And they further declared to our Governour, Col. <hi>Hammond,</hi> their unanimous and reall reſolutions, to adhere unto him (according to the power and authority of the ſupreame Councel and Repreſentatives of <hi>England</hi>) and to ſtand or fall, live or dye, and to uſe their utmoſt endeavours to aid and aſſiſt him againſt all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition whatſoever, that ſhall endeavour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or diſturbe the Peace of the ſaid Iſland, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any pretence whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Thus much I can aſſure you of the preſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Inhabitants of <hi>Weight;</hi> yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, they have received many falſe and various reports from ſeverall parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wade them to the contrary. And for the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:161666:3"/>
of <hi>Poyer, Powel,</hi> and their Adherents, they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deteſt and declare againſt them, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, (as indeed it may well and apparently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare) that their preſent D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And for the <hi>Scots,</hi> they declare (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ancient rule and proverbe) that they dare not, nor will not, put confidence in a blew Bonnet; for ſay they, Truſt a <hi>Scot</hi> &amp; hang him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they pretend faire towards Religion, Crown, and Kingdom, and for the re-inſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Kings Majeſty,</hi> in his Throne at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But indeed, here is ſome few perſons, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects great matters from <hi>Poyer,</hi> and the <hi>Scots,</hi> who at the firſt ariſing of the Cloud in <hi>Wales,</hi> gave out very high ſpeeches, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sir, as for the ſtate and condition of the <hi>Kings Majeſty,</hi> I can aſſure you thus much, that He is in health and merry; but at the arrivall of the newes that the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> was eſcaped and gone, His <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſeemed to be very ſolentary. His <hi>Majeſty</hi> takes much delight in the company of Sir <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> and makes choice of him to be his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, for the playing of the Game, (I meane at Bowles) againſt Colonell <hi>Hammond,</hi> or any other two.</p>
