            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>By the <hi>world,</hi> underſtand whatſoever is in the

world, that hinders us in that Race which Chriſt
hath ſet before us, and holds us ſhort of our
Crown. Thoſe three things which the Apoſtle
tells us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 16. are in the world, <hi>the luſts of
the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life.</hi> And
alſo the objects of theſe luſts, as they are ſuch; the
pleaſures, the profits, and the pomps of the
world; together with all worldly tribulations
and afflictions.</p>
            <p>By Faith underſtand, <hi>a living ſaving Faith,</hi> which
unites to Chriſt, and thereby engages him in our
Combat with us.</p>
            <p>This is the Victory, even our Faith. <hi>Faith is ſaid
to be our Victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Formally.</hi> The world hinders and holds us
back from Chriſt, Faith is our <hi>coming to Chriſt;</hi>
our coming to Chriſt, is our Victory over all that
which held us back.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Inſtrumentally.</hi> This is the Victory, that is,
this is our arm, or our hand, this is the weapon of
our warfare, that hath gotten for us the Victory.</p>
            <p>Divers obſervations lye in the words;</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>The world is a Chriſtians Enemy.</hi> A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
ſuppoſes a Combat, and a Combat ſuppoſes
an Enemy.</p>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>A Believer hath his Enemies under his
feet, even whileſt he is in the fight.</hi> He is a Souldier
as ſoon as he is a Believer, and he is a Conquerour
as ſoon as ever he is a Souldier. His very taking
up Arms is his Victory.</p>
            <p>Doct. 3. <hi>A Chriſtian overcomes the world by his
Faith.</hi> In the proſecution of this third Doctrine,
whereon I intend to bottom the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,

                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:153788:5"/>

                  <item>3. Wherein the ſtrength of faith lies, whereby

                  <item>4. The conflict of faith with this warring

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Wherein the enmity of the world againſt ſouls
ſtands, or diſcovers it ſelf.</hi> The world is an Enemy
(as before.) It pretends to be a friend, but its
friendſhip is enmity; <hi>enmity againſt God, Jam.</hi> 4.
4. and therefore againſt ſouls; its kindneſſes are
darts, its kiſſes are ſwords and arrows, its very
peace is war againſt the ſoul.</p>
            <p>But what is this Enmity, or wherein is it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered?</p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding of this, I ſhall
premiſe theſe four things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Every creature of God is good.</hi> The whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
in their Original, were mans friends or
ſervants; there was nothing hurtful that was
made.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The enmity that is, came in by ſin.</hi> Sin was the
only Make-bate; as betwixt God and Man, ſo
betwixt Man and the reſt of the Creatures; all
the Enemies which man hath, in Heaven or Earth,
he may thank his ſin for.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>There is no malignity in the creature properly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
man in his lapſed ſtate.</hi> They are yet all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being good and ſerviceable to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:153788:6"/>
1 <hi>Tim. 4. 4, 5. Every creature of God is good,—it is
ſanctified by the Word of God, and Prayer.</hi> Riches
are good, yea, and honors and pleaſures may be
good and uſeful to man.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>It is by accident, and not from the nature of the
things, that the creatures are become enemies to us.</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
man is a diſtempered diſeaſed creature, <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered
in his mind;</hi> and hereupon he miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
and miſtakes the world; and looking for
that good that is not in it, he looſes that which is;
making it his happineſs, it becomes his undoing.
He is diſtempered and diſeaſed <hi>in his heart, yea and
his whole man;</hi> And hereupon, as in bodily diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the beſt of creatures, which would be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
to the healthy, are to the ſick the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
of their diſeaſes; and as ſuch are apt to
luſt after thoſe things which are moſt noxious, ſo
is it with diſeaſed ſouls; our appetites are vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and whileſt we luſt after, either that which we
ſhould not, or more then we ſhould have, thoſe
very things which are good in themſelves, become
miſchievous and hurtful to us, the maintaining
and encreaſing our diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, I ſhall now ſhew
wherein the enmity of the world againſt our ſouls
ſtands; and that is in theſe two things eſpecially.</p>
            <p>1. In withdrawing our ſouls from God. <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In withdrawing our affections from God
as our Portion.</item>
               <item>2. In withdrawing us from our Allegiance
to God as our Soveraign.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>In withdrawing our affections from God as our
Porti<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n.</hi> The world by the advantage of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:153788:6"/>
minds and appetites, ſets up it ſelf as
our God; as our happineſs or chiefeſt good; it
propoſes its ſelf for a portion to us, and that
both as a richer portion, and more ſuitable then
God would be; it perſwades us to take our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in hand, and to take up with what's before
us, as our happineſs, and not to be ſo unwiſe as
to make an adventure for an unknown happineſs,
with the hazard of that preſent felicity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
which we taſt and ſee to be ſo good.</p>
            <p>God calls, <hi>Come unto me, and I will give thee reſt,</hi>
I will be thy portion and reward; come up to the
other world, there's an Inheritance for thee. No,
no, ſaith the world, <hi>ſtay with me,</hi> dwell here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
thou ſeeſt what thine entertainment is
here, there thou knoweſt not what thou ſhalt
find; here thou haſt ſubſtance, here thou haſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine,
here thou haſt hearts eaſe, here thou art full
and aboundedſt; thou haſt thy houſe full, and thy
hands full, and thy belly full, and thy heart full;
thou knoweſt what thou haſt, thou canſt taſt, thou
canſt ſee how good this world is; the Treaſures
of the other world, though they be called <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Light,</hi> yet to thee they are but <hi>Treaſures
of Darkneſs,</hi> thou knoweſt not what they are; be
content, dwell here below, where thou art well.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In withdrawing us from our Allegiance to God as
our Soveraign.</hi> When it hath once drawn away the
heart, it will with eaſe pull away the ſhoulder; if
Gods Crown be deſpiſed, his Yoke will quickly
be ſhaken off; we break our faith with God when
once we are fallen in love with the world; if it
become our treaſure, we yield our ſelves to it for
ſervants; the ſtrength of its temptations lies in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153788:7"/>
the eſteem we have of it, and the affection we
bear it. What will the Authority of the Lord do
with us, when he hath loſt our hearts, and we
have choſen us another God! What cannot the
world command us to, if we have once ſet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, as our Goal and Prize? if it be our end,
it will appoint us our means and way; no unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
but will be right in our eyes, that will
ſerve our worldly deſigns; farewell faith, truth,
mercy, honeſty, and all conſcience of ſin, further
then we can make a gain of godlineſs: And by
withdrawing us from our love and obedience to
God, to this I might add 3ly, It expoſes us to his
wrath and diſpleaſure; when we will none of
him, he will none of us; when he is forſaken by
us, he ſets himſelf againſt us; by deſpiſing the
riches of his goodneſs, we fall under his fury and
fiery indignation. This is the ſtate into which
the world is leading us.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In withholding us from Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt comes to
bring us back unto the Father, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
us to our duty, and reſtore us to our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
The world that withdraws us from God,
withholds us from Chriſt. Particularly
<list>
                  <item>It holds us back from coming to Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>It holds us in from following of Chriſt.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>It holds us back from coming to Chriſt.</hi> And this
it doth by theſe four means: By
<list>
                  <item>Darkning our ſight.</item>
                  <item>Deadning our ſenſe.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Hanging upon our hearts, and about our
necks.</p>
            <p>Furniſhing us with excuſes.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>By darkning the ſight,</hi> that we cannot ſee, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:153788:7"/>
the excellency, or the neceſſity of Chriſt;
Chriſt draws on Souls to him <hi>by love and fear.</hi> Firſt
he frights us in, by preſenting the danger and
miſery that is falling upon us, and we cannot eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
if we ſtand out. <hi>Look to thy ſelf Sinner,</hi> this world
will betray thee to thy ruine: thy pleaſures are
thy traitors, thy carnal friends are thy traitors,
thy eſtate is thy traitor; they are feaſting thee and
feeding thee, but tis for the day of ſlaughter: the
butcher the butcher of ſouls is near thee, into
whoſe hands they are betraying thee: they ſeek
thy life, thou art but a dead man; death is already
feeding upon thee, the curſe of God doth already
cleave to thee, and is ready to fall upon thee in
its full weight; thou wilt be devoured, thou wilt
be ſwallowed up ere thou art aware: come away,
come to me and thou ſhalt be ſafe: this houſe is
falling on thine head, eſcape for thy life; the
avenger of blood is at thy heels, flee to the City
of refuge; I am thy City of refuge, come unto
me. Thus he provokes <hi>by fear.</hi> And this is ſuch
an argument to drive Souls into Chriſt, as a clap
of thunder, or a ſtorm of hail is to the Traviler, to
haſten him to ſhelter.</p>
            <p>Then Chriſt draws <hi>by love;</hi> preſents himſelf
and his ſalvation to the Soul, diſplayes all his
beautie and excellencies before it; opens the
Goſpel, wherein his grace and his glory appear
and ſhine forth: the Goſpel is ſent down <hi>full of
Chriſt;</hi> there are all the treaſures and unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
riches of Chriſt, and all held forth <hi>in open ſight,</hi>
to invite ſinners unto him.</p>
            <p>Now the world daſhes all this, that it workes
nothing on the Soul; by blinding the eye that it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153788:8"/>
cannot ſee what Chriſt ſets before it: what is either
beauty or blackneſs, to the blind ſoul? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4.
<hi>The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them
which beleive not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of
Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi>
We are naturally born blind, and if our eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
a little to be opened, this earth is thrown as
duſt in our eyes, that we may not ſee whats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us. The things of this world as the Moon
interpoſed, cauſeth an eclipſe in our ſouls, that we
cannot ſee the Sun, we cannot diſcern either <hi>light
or darkneſs,</hi> either the light of the glorious Goſpel,
or the darkneſs of the Pitt; either our hopes or
our dangers; this earth keeps both Heaven and
Hell out of ſight.</p>
            <p>The things of the world ſhould be <hi>a glaſs</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we may behold the glory of the Lord; we may
ſee God in every creature. <hi>The Heavens declare the
glory of God,</hi> Pſal. 19. 1. And ſo doth the earth alſo,
and all that is therein; but that which God made
<hi>a glaſs</hi> in which we might ſee his glory, the Divel
makes <hi>a cloud</hi> to take God out of ſight; what
God made <hi>a window</hi> to let in the light, the Divel
makes <hi>a ſhut,</hi> to keep it out. Worldly men fix and
terminate their eyes in worldly things; they can
neither look beſides them nor through them. It
is not with them according to the courſe of nature
[The Sun dazles mens eyes that they cannot ſee
the Earth] but the quite contrary [The Earth
dazles their eyes that they cannot ſee the Sun]
Men uſually carry their eyes in their hearts, they
will not look but where they love; or if they
ſhould look heavenward, yet they could not ſee,
the earth hath dazled their eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:153788:8"/>
Sinners, take heed of theſe riches, take heed of
theſe pleaſures; theſe <hi>ſubſtances</hi> and theſe <hi>ſhadowes,</hi>
which your hearts are ſet upon; they will not only
be as <hi>clogs</hi> to keep you down from <hi>aſcending</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venward,
but as <hi>clouds</hi> to hinder you from <hi>looking</hi>
thither. It may be they appear as bright clouds,
but a bright cloud will hide the Sun out of ſight, as
well as a black.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>By deadning the ſenſe;</hi> they can neither ſee
nor feel: they ſee not the excellency, nor can feel
their need of Chriſt, who are drunken with theſe
worldly vanities: they who altogether live by
ſenſe, are without ſenſe of any but the preſent
things: they can make a ſhift to [live] without
Chriſt; the leſs of Chriſt the better for their turns.
Chriſt and the things of Chriſt are the only things
that ſtand in their way; are their way to poverty
not to wealth, to reproach and ſhame not to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
they can well enough want Chriſt while they
live, but what need they may have of him after this
life, that enters not into their hearts; they are ſo
buſy with what they find here, that they look not
ſo far as the grave, much leſs beyond it.</p>
            <p>'Tis hard dealing with ſuch hearts, but when
you find them alone; retired and withdrawn from
the world; and how long may we wait ere we
meet with ſuch a ſeaſon? find them in a croud,
among their carnal friends and companions, find
them among their Sheep or Oxen, or at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and the noiſe of theſe will ſo drown all that
can be ſaid, that its like to make as deep impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
as a ſhowre upon a ſtone: cry out in their
eares, <hi>fire, fire,</hi> throw Death and Hell in their
faces, it moves them not ſo much, as to draw forth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:153788:9"/>
ſuch a queſtion, <hi>What may I do to eſcape?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We never will come to Chriſt till we ſee we
need him; and we never ſee our need of Chriſt,
till being withdrawn from the hurries of this
World, we have leiſure to ſit down and conſider.</p>
            <p>How ſeldom do carnal hearts ask, <hi>What uſe is
there of Chriſt?</hi> wherefore is he come? what want
would there be of him if there were no Chriſt? If
God that ſpared not his Son, but gave him a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
for the world, had ſpared all this coſt, it
had been all one to them; they could have liv'd
as merrily, and as plentifully here however, and
thats all they mind or regard.</p>
            <p>Or if they have any ſenſe of their need of Chriſt
at all, it is ſo little, that it will do nothing to the
perſwading them after him: the wound is not ſo
deep, but the <hi>name</hi> of a Saviour will skin it over.
Seldome does it riſe ſo high as to wring out ſuch
a ſerious queſtion, <hi>What may I do that Chriſt may
be mine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many Houſes, and Markets, and Shops,
and Companies may we come into, ere we hear
any ſuch queſtion?</p>
            <p>Go into the <hi>Field,</hi> where Men are buſy a plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſowing or reaping, and there you may hear
them enquiring, <hi>how may I keep off the Birds,</hi> or how
may I keep out the Beaſts from hurting my field!
when will it be rain? or when will it be like to
be fair weather! Come into the <hi>Market,</hi> where
men are buying and ſelling and trading, and there
you may hear them asking, <hi>how goes the price of Corn,</hi>
or of Cattel! where are the beſt Commodities!
where is the beſt choice! Come into the <hi>houſes</hi>
where they are eating and drinking or working,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:153788:9"/>
and there you may hear them enquiring, <hi>what muſt
we have for the next meal,</hi> what for to morrow, &amp;c.
But oh how ſeldom do we hear amongſt them all,
any ſuch queſtions, <hi>How is my Soul provided for! how,
how doth my ſoul proſper!</hi> No, no, when the world
is gotten into the heart, there's no ſenſe of Souls
or the concernment of them: where the world is
in the heart Death and Hell may be there too, and
never regarded.</p>
            <p>Could we once make men deeply ſenſible, how
great their need of Chriſt is, what they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Chriſt; in what ſlippery places they ſtand, in
what jeopardy they go daily, what a dreadful gulf
of woe and miſery, the wind and tide of their
worldly proſperity, are carrying them down into,
and how ſuddenly they may be ſwallowed up in
perdition and deſtruction, and what miſerable
comforts their paſt pleaſures, and plenty will
then be to them; were they ſenſible, that nothing
but Chriſt, and a part in him would ſtand them in
any ſtead, to ſave them from that gulf; that the
caſting anchor on that rock of ages, would alone
ſecure them from ſplitting on thoſe fatal rocks,
from periſhing by thoſe tumbling waves and bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that are hurrying them down to the lake
beneath; were they ſenſible, that tis Chriſt only
that can ſecure them from theſe dangers, <hi>their need</hi>
would be argument enough to drive them to him.
But being drunken with the pleaſures of ſin, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
this wine is in, the wits are out, they will not
conſider, they do not perceive the danger they are
in. When the Prodigal, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. had ſpent all
that he had in his riotous living, when his whole
ſtock was waſted, and not an husk left, then he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:153788:10"/>
had time to conſider, and bethink himſelf what a
caſe he was in; and the pinching ſence of his
neceſſitous ſtate, to which his folly had reduced
him, this brings him to his wits again; <hi>he comes
to himſelf,</hi> and then away he will to his father. If
you had met him a little before; in his cups, and
amongſt his whores, if you had found him at his
riotous table, and in the heat of his luſt, and ſhould
there have preach'd to this Prodigal, <hi>Friend this
life will not laſt alwaies,</hi> twill be thy wiſeſt courſe to
conſider in time what thou doſt. Be ſober be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
run from theſe Harlots, and return to thy
Father; how would he have laughed and ſcoffed
at ſuch a ſermon; at leaſt the next cup would have
waſh'd it off his heart: but when his hunger and
thirſt preach thus to him, <hi>Get thee home to thy Father,</hi>
then away he goes.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>It hangs upon our hearts, and about our necks:</hi>
The world hath gotten hold of our hearts, and
there it will keep its hold while it can. Its gotten
ſo much within us, and hath ſo twiſted and twined
it ſelf about our affections, that it will be very
hard getting it off.</p>
            <p>We cannot cloſe with Chriſt, but we muſt break
with the world; we muſt be divorc'd from this,
ere we can be married to our ſecond husband:
worldlings ſee what work Chriſt makes, in thoſe
hearts where he gets poſſeſſion; he whips out the
buyers and ſellers and their merchandiſe out of
his Temple: he changes the cuſtomes, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and buſineſs of the heart, Its dealings and
its delights: Its love and its labour muſt be no
longer beſtow'd, and conſum'd upon meat, and

for it, and other work to keep it do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Theſe things muſt be minded in their place, and
in their ſeaſon, but they muſt keep their place:
<hi>Stand off Farms and Oxen,</hi> ſtand off Lands and
money, keep your diſtance, get you down and
take the lower room, give this man place who is
more honourable then you all. Chriſt and the
world contend for <hi>the place,</hi> which ſhall ſit upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
and go foremoſt in the ſoul: Chriſt will not
come in to be an Underling, he will have the chief
room, the chief reſpect and eſteem; he will have
the command of all that is in the houſe: herein
ſtands Chriſtianity, or our converſion to Chriſt,
in ſurrendring up <hi>the Throne</hi> to Chriſt; 'tis not
the queſtion, whether thou canſt find <hi>a corner</hi> in
thine heart to entertain Chriſt in, but who ſits in
<hi>the Throne,</hi> who hath the government of thy ſoul,
who hath the right hand within thee; Canſt thou
ſay to the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Sit thou on the right hand,
let all thy foes be made thy foot-ſtool?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All <hi>ſinful</hi> pleaſures, all <hi>ſinful</hi> gains, muſt depart,
and <hi>come no more</hi> where Chriſt dwells; and thoſe
which are <hi>lawful</hi> muſt <hi>come under,</hi> and be brought
into ſubjection to him; no more ſenſuality or
carnal mirth, no more covetouſneſs or oppreſſion,
no more pride or ſelf-exalting, away with theſe,
caſt them out, and never take them in for ever,
if thou meaneſt that Chriſt ſhall take up his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in thee: And no more <hi>zeal</hi> for the lawful
concernments of this life; no more pleading <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs</hi>
againſt <hi>Religion,</hi> no more pleading <hi>ſafety</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>duty,</hi> no more pleading <hi>credit</hi> againſt <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
no more pleading <hi>gain</hi> againſt <hi>godlineſs,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:153788:11"/>
and improve thy eſtate, maintain thy cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
provide for thy ſafety, follow thy buſineſs,
thou mayeſt, and thou muſt; but bring all under,
make all to ſtand aſide, and give place to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
and Conſcience: Chriſt will be no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
he reſolves for the Throne, where ever he
dwells.</p>
            <p>And the world that hath already gotten the
Throne, is loath to become the foot-ſtool; 'tis
who ſhall be <hi>King,</hi> 'tis who ſhal be <hi>God,</hi> that the
great Conteſt is about; and the world that hath
King'd it ſo long, knows not how to be content
to be a ſubject; it ſees it muſt come down if
Chriſt come in, there cannot be two Kings in
one Kingdome, it muſt come down, this pride
muſt come down, this credit, theſe pleaſures, this
carnal mirth, this covetouſneſs muſt be laid in the
duſt, if Chriſt ſet footing here. And therefore it
does all it can to reſiſt Chriſt; ſtops the ears, blinds
the eye, turns away the heart from hearkening to
him.</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſtands at the door and knocks; Chriſt
cryes and calls, <hi>Come unto me, open to me.</hi> Chriſt
promiſes and offers, <hi>Come and I will receive you,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
and I will come in unto you, and dwell with
you.</p>
            <p>If the ſoul begins to liſten to the call of Chriſt,
the world ſteps in, and objects, <hi>What doſt thou mean
ſimple ſoul?</hi> What art thou doing? whither art
thou going? hearken to Chriſt, hearken to this
Word, hearken to this Conſcience, and what
then ſhall become of me? What ſhall become of
thy eſtate? what ſhall become of thy eſteem?
what ſhall become of thy liberty? what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:153788:11"/>
of all thy love, and friendſhip, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thou haſt in the world? art willing to be poor?
art willing to be in bondage? art willing to be in
reproach and diſgrace? open that door once, let
Chriſt in, have any thing to do with Conſcience,
and thou art undone; all that ever thou haſt, all
that ever thou loveſt in all the world, muſt thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
become ſtrangers to thee. Haſt thou not given
[me] thy heart? have not I lyen in thy boſome?
haſt thou not cheriſhed me, and cared for me as
thine own ſoul? and have not I deſerv'd thy care,
and reſpect? have not I been thy food, and thy
rayment, and thy joy, and all the comfort of thy
life? What wilt thou be when I have left thee,
when thy eſtate hath left thee, thy pleaſures have
left thee, thy friends have left thee?</p>
            <p>I know thou loveſt me; thou loveſt to be rich,
and to be great, and to be at thy eaſe, and thy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
as thou loveſt thy life: I know I have thy
heart, and thou art loath to leave me. I, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conſider, and take heed; if thou hearken to
Chriſt once, if thou meddle too far with Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and wilt be dealing for another world once,
then farewell this.</p>
            <p>But canſt thou find in thine heart to leave me?
<hi>have I been a Wilderneſs to thee, or a Land of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi>
hath it not been well with thee? haſt thou
wanted any thing? haſt thou not been full and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded?
haſt thou not flouriſhed and proſper'd?
haſt thou not had thy belly full of meat, and thy
belly full of mirth, and thy bones full of reſt, and
thy heart full of eaſe and content? what haſt thou
wanted whileſt thou imbracedſt my love? and
canſt thou now find in thine heart to part? look
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:153788:12"/>
to thy ſelf; what day thou ſtrikeſt hands with
Chriſt, thou muſt ſhake hands with all the world.
Look for no more favour from me; thou doſt not
know when thou art well, when thou haſt enough;
but henceforth, if thou take this courſe, thou ſhalt
have little enough? If Chriſt carry thee, he ſhall
carry thee naked, thou ſhalt leave all thy good
things behind thee; and look for it, I have not
been ſo great a friend, but now I'le be as great an
enemy; I'le perſecute thee, and plague thee, and
vex thee; and if I may no longer ſleep in thy
boſome, I'le ſtick in thy ſides; if I may no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
be the treaſure of thine heart, I'le be a dart
in thy liver.</p>
            <p>But conſider, be adviſed fooliſh ſoul, let us not
part thus; ſtay, ſtay with me, go not after thou
knoweſt not what; forſake not an old friend for
a new; believe it, the old is better; if thou wilt
be wiſe, ſtay as thou art, and mind thy preſent
commodity; lay by the thoughts of the other
world, let hereafter take care for it ſelf, never
ſtand amuzing thy ſelf about thou knoweſt not
what, I have not been ſo good to thee, but I will
be better to thee then ever; come let's take our
fill of love, eat, drink, and be merry; gather,
keep, lay up what's before thee, and caſt away
care: And thus it wooes, and flatters, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witches
it into a neglect of Chriſt ſo long, till it
hath ſmitten the ſoul under the fift rib, and ſtab'd
it to death, and drown'd it in perdition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>It will help men to excuſes for their neglect of
Chriſt.</hi> Men are aſham'd to play the Fools, but
they would have ſomething to ſay for't, to ſtop
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:153788:12"/>
mouths withall; to ſtop the mouth of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to ſtop the mouths of Men, to ſtop the
mouth of their Judge, if it be poſſible, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.
18. Thoſe that were invited to come to Chriſt,
its ſaid, <hi>they all began to make excuſes;</hi> they were
aſham'd to ſay, <hi>they would not come,</hi> that had been
too groſs; but they excuſe themſelves, <hi>we cannot
come, Ruth</hi> 4. 6. The Kinſman of <hi>Ruth,</hi> that had
the offer of redeeming the Inheritance of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
Kinſman, anſwered no, <hi>I cannot redeem it,
leſt I mar mine own Inheritance.</hi> He would not ſay,
<hi>I will not redeem it;</hi> no, an excuſe muſt be found
out, <hi>I cannot redeem it,</hi> I ſhould mar mine own
Inheritance, if I redeem my Brothers. So theſe
here, they do not ſay <hi>I will not,</hi> but <hi>I cannot come.</hi>
Why, what's the matter you cannot come to
Chriſt? what excuſe have you? whence have you
your excuſe? Oh the world furniſhes them with
an excuſe; <hi>I have a Farm,</hi> ſayes one, <hi>I have Oxen
to look to,</hi> ſayes another; I have <hi>a Wife</hi> to mind,
ſayes a third, I pray thee have me excuſed, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, have your hearts never made this
uſe of the world, to make it your excuſe for your
neglecting Chriſt, and your ſouls? it hath <hi>hindred</hi>
you many a time from coming to Chriſt, and then
<hi>excuſed</hi> you for not coming. How many prayers
hath it loſt you? how many Sabbaths hath it loſt
you? the loſs of theſe may be the loſs of Chriſt,
the loſs of your ſouls: How much of theſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
advantages hath the world loſt you? and when
they are loſt, when you have loſt a praying time,
or hearing time, loſt a Sabbath, or a Sermon, or
a Sacrament, this muſt ſerve for an excuſe, <hi>I was
buſie, and could not come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:153788:13"/>
An excuſe is a <hi>pretence, or a ſhift that men find out,
to ſave themſelves from blame,</hi> for all their neglects
of Chriſt, and their ſouls; as if they ſhould ſay,
its a ſhame for men to neglect Chriſt that have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe to mind in his ſtead; its a ſhame for
men to neglect their ſouls, that have nothing elſe
to look to; I have no mind to Chriſt, and his
wayes, this looking after my ſoul, and my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and the matters of the other world, are
things that I like not, and liſt not to be medling
withall; but what ſhall I ſay for my ſelf if I neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
them? I am aſham'd to ſay, <hi>I care not for
Chriſt,</hi> I care not for my ſoul, I care not for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and everlaſting glory, I care not though I
periſh and die, I dare not ſay thus; and yet theſe
things that Chriſt calls to me, are ſo contrary to
me, that I have no mind to meddle with them:
But what ſhall I ſay for my ſelf, if I do not?
ſome excuſe or other I muſt have, what may be
my excuſe?</p>
            <p>Why, haſt thou never a Farm to look to, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a Wife nor Family to look after? or haſt thou
not an houſe, or an horſe, or a companion? haſt
thou no ſports, nor pleaſures, no Hawks nor dogs
to follow? haſt thou nothing to do? haſt thou no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſay? tell Chriſt, tell Conſcience, thou
haſt other buſineſs to do; thou haſt thy friends, or
thy pleaſures, that call thee another way; any
thing may ſerve, a bad excuſe is better then
none.</p>
            <p>An excuſe is a pretence to have <hi>reaſon</hi> for what
we do: no man can have reaſon to neglect Chriſt,
no man can have reaſon to continue in ſin; and
yet there are few caſes, wherein men will not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:153788:13"/>
pretend to have reaſon for it, eſpecially the
worldling, whoever wants, he will be ſure to find
reaſon enough for his worldlineſs.</p>
            <p>Though the Drunkard can hardly ſay, I have
reaſon to be drunk; though the Adulterer can
hardly ſay, I have reaſon to follow Harlots; though
the Swearer can hardly ſay, I have reaſon to ſwear,
or blaſpheme; though the Prodigal can hardly
ſay, I have reaſon to waſt, and ſpend my Eſtate;
yet the worldling will eaſily ſay, I have reaſon to
get an Eſtate, to keep what I have; reaſon to be a
good Husband, and to be provident; who ſhall
keep me when I am old? who ſhall take care of
my Family? I have reaſon to take care for my
ſelf; who will take care for me, if I do not
take care of my ſelf?</p>
            <p>And though this may be look'd on as a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Plea for the neglect of Chriſt, I am following
a Whore, and I cannot come; I muſt to the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
or the Tavern, and I cannot come; yet
this will paſs for a fair excuſe, I have a Wife, or a
Family, or a Farm, and I cannot come.</p>
            <p>I pray thee have me excuſed? For what? that
thou doſt not come to Chriſt, and hearken to, and
follow him? that is, excuſe me that I undo my
ſelf, that I ſtab, or drown, or hang my ſelf, that
I go to the Devil and damn my ſoul: If I go to
hell, and there periſh for ever, I pray do not
blame me for it, I have reaſon for what I do; I
[muſt] take care of this world whatever becomes
of me in the other world: as for thoſe that have
nothing elſe to do, but to mind Chriſt and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if they neglect it, let them anſwer for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
if they can; for my part I have reaſon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:153788:14"/>
enough to do as I do: Haſt thou reaſon to go to
hell? reaſon to be damn'd? go then and bear thy
burthen for ever, till thy ſenſe too late teach thee
better reaſon.</p>
            <p>Oh what wiſe men are the men of this world!
what very fools are the worldly wiſe! they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
their ſouls to pleaſe and provide for their
carkaſſes; they count the world their happineſs,
and this their happineſs muſt have the killing of
them: ſome mens <hi>buſineſſes</hi> muſt have the killing
of them; ſome mens <hi>money</hi> muſt do it, ſome
mens <hi>pleaſures</hi> muſt do it, ſome mens <hi>friends</hi>
muſt have the killing of their ſouls: ſome are
too rich, ſome are too buſie, ſome are too mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
ſome are too high, ſome are too civil and
courtly, to come to Chriſt and ſave their ſouls.
Behold the wiſdome of this world!</p>
            <p>Conſider this Brethren, if ſome of you do not
find it thus; how is it with your ſouls? in what
caſe are your ſouls? are you in Chriſt? are you
converted to God? have you gotten any ſaving
knowledge, or any thing of the Grace of God in
your hearts? or are you not ſtill without Chriſt,
without Grace, without God in the world? what
is it that hath hindred you, but your fleſhly and
worldly hearts, which have held you under the
power of theſe fleſhly and worldly things? it
may be you might have had grace in your hearts,
if you had not had ſo much money in your purſe,
if you had not had ſo much to do in this world,
you might have done more for the world to come:
whileſt you have been buſie here and there, as
the man in the Prophets Parable, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 40.
your ſouls are loſt, the Kingdome is loſt: if you
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:153788:14"/>
had not had ſo many ſheep, and oxen, and trades
to be look'd after, it may be your ſouls had been
better look'd to; if you had not had ſo many car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
friends about you, it may be Chriſt had been
entertained by you; theſe are they which you
have taken in exchange for Chriſt, theſe are they
for which you have ſold the Goſpel, theſe are
they for which you have ſold your ſouls to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
            <p>You wonder at thoſe poor miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>the Witches,</hi> who for a little money, or a
few years pleaſure, do by expreſs bargain and
ſale, make over their ſouls to the devil, and yet
will do the ſame things your ſelves.</p>
            <p>Where are your ſouls? in whoſe hands are they?
who hath the poſſeſſion? who hath the dominion
of them? are they with Chriſt? doth he govern?
doth he rule them? hath he taken poſſeſſion of
them? do you think he hath indeed? are the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
the idle, the ſimple, the ſenſual, the
earthly, the careleſs, the barren ſouls of the
world, are theſe the poſſeſſion of Chriſt? would
Chriſt have left you in ſuch a carnal ſenſleſs ſtate,
if you had ever come into his hands? do ye think
he would? who are they that are without Chriſt,
if you are in Chriſt? who are the ſinners, if you
are the Saints? who are the children of this
world, if you be the children of the Kingdome?
are you they whom God hath choſen out of this
world, to be a peculiar people to himſelf? are
you they that have forſaken all for Chriſt, who
have forſaken Chriſt for this world? are you the

of God, his mortified ones, his crucified
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:153788:15"/>
ones, his ſanctified ones? Will Chriſt leave his
choſen veſſels to be ſuch wooden, and iron, and
earthen veſſels, as your Souls are at this day?
What a poor and low and miſerable thing do you
make of Chriſtianity, if this be it, which you
have attain'd to? look to it, if you have any ſuch
thought, ſure you have deceived your ſelves to
this day.</p>
            <p>Are you not in Chriſt? what is it that hath hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
you? Chriſt hath invited you in; the Goſpel
of Chriſt hath been preach'd to you, the everlaſting
door hath been ſet open to you, the ſervants have
been ſent out among you, to call you and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
you to come in; but the world hath kept you
back, your friends have hung about you, your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
have lyen upon you, your eſtates have call'd
you another way, and would not ſuffer you to
enter in.</p>
            <p>And that theſe are they that have done it, it is
apparent, ſince theſe are they that muſt ſerve you
for an excuſe. I have had ſo many encumbrances
and entanglements and diverſions every day, that I
could not doe for my Soul, as others may.</p>
            <p>And oh how glad have you often been of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe!
that you have had ſomething to ſay for your
ſelf, and to ſilence Conſcience under the neglect
of Chriſt? more glad of an hindrance then of an
<hi>opportunity;</hi> there is ſuch an ungratefulneſs and
unpleaſingneſs of Chriſt and his wayes, to carnal
hearts, that when Chriſt hath been dealing with
them, and perſwading and awakening them, to
look after them, the world ſeems to do them a
kindneſs in ſtepping in, and calling their hearts
back and putting all out of mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:153788:15"/>
When Chriſt calls to a duty, to an ordinance, to
bring us near to him, that he might deal with us,
and treat with us about the matters of eternity;
whileſt ſome rejoyce to come in, to appear in his
preſence, to hear his voice, to pour out their
Souls to him in prayer or faſting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others are
glad that they have ſomething to ſay, that they
could not be there; glad of a buſineſs or of a
friend that kept them off, glad of a temptation;
that the Devil laid a block in their way, that
the world cal'd them out another way; not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
what an eternal loſſe they may have hereby
ſuſtain'd.</p>
            <p>Behold now the friend of ſinners; the Idol, the
god whom they ſerve, this preſent world: <hi>this is
your beloved, this is your friend.</hi> But what is its
friendſhip to you? what kindneſs hath this world
for you? you love it and ſeek it and ſerve it, and
work for it; it hath your time, and your ſtrength,
and your hearts, beſtow'd upon it; for this you
live, and labour, and ſweat, and toyl out all your
dayes; but when all is done, what kindneſs doth
it ſhew you? what reward have you? it feeds you,
and cloaths you; and pleaſes and pampers your
fleſh, but it kills your Souls: It blinds, it har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
it holds you in a ſottiſh, ſenſleſs, carnal ſtate
and courſe, keeps Chriſt and your hearts apart,
holds your Souls in death, and ſhuts you out from
the kingdom of God. This is your God whom you
hugge, and worſhip, and bleſs your ſelves in, and
buſy your ſelves for: this is your beloved, here is
the kindneſs of your friend: and is not this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the world enmity? What can the Devil
do more, then keep you from Chriſt, and what
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:153788:16"/>
doth the world do leſs? hitherto it hath kept you
off, and when do you think if you hearken to it,
will it give you leave to go over to him? when
will it ſay unto you, thou haſt ſerved me long
enough; thou haſt ſerv'd thy pleaſures, and thy
eſtate, and thy friends long enough, now go thy
way and ſerve thy God, now go to Chriſt and look
after thy Soul; how how long will it be ere the
world will thus give thee leave? or if it will not
give thee leave, how long will it be ere thou take
thy leave.</p>
            <p>Be not deceived, that which hath hindred doth
hinder, and will hinder thee from ever making a

            <p>Depart, depart: depart from your worldly

<hi>No man that warreth entangleth himſelf with the affairs

and the world is one ſpecial enemy we are to fight

where we are in league with the enemy; whileſt
we ſhould be <hi>charging it,</hi> we ſhall be like enough
to be <hi>treating for peace,</hi> if not quite to forſake our
colours, and run over to the enemies camp:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:153788:16"/>
Chriſt entertains none, but thoſe that are free and
diſengaged perſons; and by how much the more
free, by ſo much the more fit for his ſervice: <hi>no
man that warreth [entangleth] himſelf:</hi> a Souldier
that fights in fetters, fights thereafter: we muſt
put off our fetters, if we will put on our armour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[In the affairs of this life]</hi> the work that Chriſt
hath to put his ſervants upon, lyes in the affairs of
the other life; he that is intangled in the affairs of
this, will do little about the affairs of the other life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[That he may pleaſe him who hath choſen him to be a

not pleaſe men, he muſt not pleaſe himſelf; his
appetite, his pride, his covetouſneſs; is this thy

1. <hi>The world cutts Chriſt ſhort of that ſervice, and
thoſe fruits which he ſhould reap from us,</hi> Hoſ. 10. 1.
<hi>Iſrael is an empty vine he bringeth forth fruit to himſelf.
Iſrael</hi> is an empty vine; that is, <hi>to his Lord:</hi> tis
but a poor vintage, little or no fruit he brings
forth to God; he is <hi>his</hi> vine; he hath planted, he
hath watered, and he hath fenced him, and he looks
for grapes,, but finds none; why whats the reaſon
of it? Oh he hath brought forth all his fruits to
himſelf; he hath ſtore of fruit, but no ſuch fruit as
God looks for, he brought forth ſo much to his
fleſh, that ther's none for his God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phil. 2. 2. All ſeek their own, and not the things
of Chriſt.</hi> Here's little ſeeking of Chriſt among
you, ſaith the Apoſtle; the worſhip and ſervice
of Chriſt, the honour and intereſt of Chriſt is little
regarded; there's a general neglect of him. <hi>None,</hi>
that is, there are <hi>ſcarce any</hi> among you, <hi>none in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,</hi>
that mind the things of Chriſt: but why
is Chriſt ſo neglected? Why becauſe every man
is for himſelf; and all ſeek their own, that is, their
outward and earthly things.</p>
            <p>Their own things? Why are not the things of
Chriſt ſo much thine own, as the things of the
world? are thy carnal friends more thine, then
Chriſt is thine? are thy earthly poſſeſſions, thy
earthly pleaſures, thy meat, and thy drink, and thy
money, the things of thy body, more thine then
thy Soul, and the concernments of it? thou art
a pitiful Chriſtian, if the things of Chriſt be not
more thine, then the things of this world; if the
things of Chriſt and thine own things, be not the
very ſame; but yet thus our fleſhly hearts count,
our <hi>carnal things</hi> are our <hi>own things;</hi> and the more
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:153788:17"/>
we ſeek our own, the leſs the things of Chriſt: the
moſt careful Worldling is the moſt careleſs
Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Brethren, how little is there done for Chriſt?
how little is Chriſt ſerv'd or ſought? Judge ye
every one in your own ſelves: how little hath
been done for Chriſt, or is now a doing! look
back, and ſumme up all that you have done, and
gather together all, concerning which you can
ſay, <hi>this hath been done for Chriſt:</hi> this day, or this
houre was ſpent in ſeeking of Chriſt; and ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
what a narrow room all will be brought: look
into your hearts, and ſee how many ſhops and
feilds you may find there, to one ſanctuary; how
how many Markets and Fairs have been kept
there, to on Sabbath; how many ſervants hath
Chriſt at work for him within you? all that is
within you have the name of the ſervants of Chriſt;
<hi>every faculty</hi> is his ſervant; your thoughts, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
underſtandings conſciences; <hi>every member;</hi>
your hands, eyes tongues, have all the name of the
ſervants of Chriſt: but are theſe at work for
Chriſt? are your underſtandings veiwing Chriſt?
are your thoughts ſearching after Chriſt? are your
affections working up towards Chriſt? are your
conſciences pleading for Chriſt? are your tongues
ſpeaking for Chriſt? are your hands laying up, or
laying out for Chriſt? the Devil hath his ſervants
buſy a working for him; our carnal thoughts, our
fleſhly luſts, our earthly affections, all our earthly
members are hard at work for the Devil; to
harden us againſt Chriſt, to entice us from Chriſt,
to defile and deſtroy our Souls; but how little is
done for Chriſt twould make our hearts to tremble
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:153788:18"/>
if we did conſider how little; may be there may
be divers of our ſouls, in which there hath not been
<hi>one ſtroke of work</hi> done for Chriſt, ſince they had a
being, and in whom there's any thing done, oh
how little is it?</p>
            <p>What footing hath Chriſt gotten in your hearts?
what faith, or love, or fear, or honor hath he in
you? how goes his ſanctifying work, his morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
work on in you? how fares it with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in you, <hi>your luſts, and paſſions, and carnal affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?</hi>
are not theſe ſtill Lording it in his room?
Oh how little is it that is yet done for Chriſt
within us? how little power and authority hath he
in us? how low is it with us both in point of grace
and peace? how little is he minded, or lov'd, or
prais'd, in us? how little pleaſure or delight do
we take in him? how little care take we for him?
any little good thing that he hath committed to
us, how hath it been cheriſh'd, and nouriſh'd, and
improv'd? doth it not languiſh, and pine away?
whileſt our faces ſhine, our fleſh flouriſhes, our
outward man thrives, in what a withering periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
caſe is our inner man?</p>
            <p>Think with your ſelves, are matters with you
<hi>within</hi> as you could wiſh they were? is it with
your ſouls as Chriſt would have it? do you think
he will ſay to you, in the caſe you are in, <hi>well done,</hi>
thou haſt been a faithful ſervant, a good Steward
of my manifold graces? how is it <hi>without</hi> you?
what are your duties? what are your wayes? what
praying, or hearing, or walking? oh what ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
over duties, what halting in your goings?
what do you more then others? are you not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and vain as others? are you not proud and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:153788:18"/>
froward as others? are you not unſavoury and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
as others? of what uſe are you to thoſe
you walk amongſt? what examples are you to
them? wherein are they the better for you? does
your light ſhine? do ye provoke them to love
and good works? what do you for your Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for your friends, for your families, or any of
the members of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>What mourning is there under the diſhonor of
Chriſt? what ſenſe of the ſufferings of Chriſt?
doth not Chriſt ſuffer much in the world, in his
Miniſters, in his Members, in his Worſhip, in
his Sabbaths and Ordinances? how fares it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
with Chriſt? how fares it with his Goſpel,
with his Saints? is all well? is it peace? doth
the Church proſper? doth Religion flouriſh? or
doth it not ſuffer, and mourn, and bleed, and is
even ready to vaniſh away? and yet who is there
almoſt that cares for any of theſe things? how
few are there that lay them to heart? where are
the hearts that tremble for the Ark of God? that
ask, how fares it with the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God? Oh Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
its lamentable to ſee how little upon any
account whatſoever, the things of Chriſt are any
where minded But what's the reaſon? why look
abroad every where in the world, and you may ſee
reaſon enough; what is there a doing every where?
go into one Town, go into another; go into one
houſe, and another, and another, and what are
they doing? how buſie are we in buying, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and building, and planting, ploughing, and
ſowing, marrying, and giving in marriage? this
is it; we are ſo buſie for this world, that Chriſt
and the things of Chriſt are little regarded by us.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:153788:19"/>
2. <hi>It holds us ſhort of that grace, and true peace,
which we might receive from him.</hi> The cares of this
world choak the Word, that it cannot proſper in
ſuch ſouls, that it can neither quicken us, nor
comfort us: Grace is a flower that will grow beſt
in thoſe Gardens where it hath leaſt of earth: A
worldly-minded Chriſtian, a worldly-minded
Profeſſor, will never be but a Dwarf, will be but
an Infant in Religion, at forty years old. How
many may we ſee among us, that have liv'd many
years under the profeſſion of Religion, and have
had ſome hope towards God, and ſome confidence
that Chriſt is in them of a truth; who if they
ſhould take an account of themſelves, <hi>what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
have I made in the grace of God all this while?</hi>
What hath been added to me; to my faith, or
love, or zeal of God? to my knowledge of God,
to my acquaintance with mine own heart? how
much humility, ſpirituality, mortification? what
power over my corruptions, my pride, my paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
my peeviſhneſs, my fleſhlineſs have I obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
what evidences have I gotten for heaven?
what clearneſs, and grounded confidence and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
am I grown up to now more then I was, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or ten, or twenty years agone? what have I
gotten? how much, and wherein have I improv'd
in all this time?</p>
            <p>Oh how may moſt of us ſadly anſwer, What
have I gotten? how have I grown? oh the Lord
he merciful to me, have I not loſt? have I not
ſunk and decayed? is it not worſe with me now,
then many years ago; my faith grown, my love
grown, my holineſs and my hope grown, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and my confidence grown? the Lord help
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:153788:19"/>
me, rather my fears, and my doubts, my darkneſs
and my deadneſs, and my ſins are grown upon me;
I have leſs life, and leſs love, and leſs joy, and
leſs peace, then when I firſt look'd after Chriſt.
Let worldly-minded Profeſſors, prove and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
themſelves narrowly, if this, ſuch a lean,
ſtarveling, lifeleſs ſtate of ſoul, be not all the
kindneſs they are beholding to their worldlineſs
for; it hath built you houſes, and bought you
Lands, and fill'd your purſes, and fed your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes,
and provided for your Families; but it
hath ſtarv'd your ſouls. <hi>O my leannes, my leannes,</hi> my
dry and withered ſoul, my weak heart, my waſted
Conſcience; Oh how little truth or tenderneſs,
how little love, or liſe, or warmth, do I feel
within me? Oh how much pride, and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
oh how much luſt and liberty to ſin, hath
there grown upon me? I can fret, and vex, and
chafe; I can be falſe, I can lye, and diſſemble;
all the Religion I have gotten into my ſoul, after
ſo long a time of profeſſion, is not enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
theſe vile abominations: Oh my ſoul, how
ſad is it with thee? how low is it with thee to
this day? how comes this to paſs? why, <hi>this is thy
good husbandry, this is thy worldlineſs;</hi> thy labouring
ſo much, thy hungring ſo much after the meat that
periſhes, or thy being given to thy pleaſure, or
thy eaſe; this is it that hath held thee in ſuch a
poor caſe, ſuch an unfruitful and barren ſtate,
ſuch a dark and uncomfortable ſtate, as thou art
in at this day: for all this unhappineſs thou art
beholding to the world, and thy worldlineſs.</p>
            <p>Thus you have ſeen the enmity of the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſouls, it holds back from Chriſt, darkens
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:153788:20"/>
the ſight, that we cannot ſee the excellency or the
need of Chriſt; deadens the ſenſe, and hinders
from following Chriſt, keeps Chriſt ſhort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this, by the way, be an argument to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
from worldlineſs; are you Chriſtians, or
would you be ſo? would you ever come to any
thing in Religion? would you proſper in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
would you have the comfort of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
then take heed and beware of a worldly
heart, which will either hinder you from ever
coming to Chriſt, or elſe be a Canker and a
Moth, to devour and eat out the ſpirits of all that
Chriſtianity you have.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Wherein the ſtrength of the world lies, whereby
it prevails upon ſo many ſouls.</hi> It is a wonder it
ſhould ever prevail ſo as it does, that ever men of
underſtanding, endued with immortal ſouls,
ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be led up and down
down as they are, by ſuch a pernicious and mortal
Enemy; that when they have ſeen ſo many loſt
and undone by it, they ſhould never take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
that it ſhould ever be truſted as it is, that it
ſhould ever be lov'd as it is, that it ſhould ever
be hearkened to as it is, eſpecially conſidering
how unreaſonable its demands are, and how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
its rewards.</p>
            <p>What does the world <hi>demand?</hi> what would it
have? This is it, if it would ſpeak out; <hi>Come
ſell me thy God,</hi> come ſell me thy hopes that thou
haſt for the other world, come ſell me thy ſoul,
come give me thy heart, love me, and ſerve me.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall be <hi>mine hire?</hi> what wilt thou give
me then? if it would ſpeak out, this is the reward
it gives, <hi>Vanity and vexation, death and deſtruction;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:153788:20"/>
Hell ſhall be thine hire.</hi> But ſuppoſe it ſhould give
what it ſayes it will; <hi>all the good things</hi> on this ſide
the grave; riches, honors, pleaſures, eaſe, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of all theſe, and all manner of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the enjoyment of them; yet what's all
this thou ſhouldſt gain, <hi>on this ſide the grave,</hi> to
what thou ſhalt looſe, and to what thou ſhalt ſuffer
<hi>on the other ſide of the grave?</hi> what's Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
what's Time to Eternity?</p>
            <p>Suppoſe it ſhould ſay plainly, come take thy
good things here, and thy evil things hereafter;
take thy riches in this, and thy poverty in the
other world; take thy pleaſures here, and thy
plagues beneath; be full or be merry, proſper,
flouriſh, rejoyce for a few houres, or for a few
dayes, and be miſerable, cry howl be in torments
to Eternity.</p>
            <p>If the World ſhould ſpeak out thus to Men
(this it deſigns) if it ſhould ſpeak out thus, into
what madneſs muſt thoſe Souls be bewich'd, that
would hearken to it? and yet behold, though this
be the deſign its driving on, and men might know
it if they would but conſider; yet behold how the
whole world almoſt, are wondering after this
beaſt, and buſy in making bargains with it to be
its captives and ſervants: yea not only ſuffering
themſelves to be perſwaded, and beguiled in o
this bondage, but alſo willingly offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for ſervants. <hi>I pray thee take me into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of thy ſervants:</hi> Take [my] Soul, world ſaies
one, take [my] God, ſaies another, take my
hopes, ſaies another. Let me be but a rich man,
let me be a great man, let me have ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
or ſo much lands, or ſo much pleaſure, or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:153788:21"/>
eaſe or honour; let but this <hi>Moon ſhine upon me,</hi> and
take <hi>the Sunſhine,</hi> whoever will; let me be this
worlds <hi>favourite,</hi> and I am content to be its <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;</hi>
and ſo along they go after it, till they be
loſt for ever.</p>
            <p>What a wonder is this? and yet how many ſuch
<hi>prodigies</hi> are to be ſeen every day, and in every
place? this is the caſe of every worldling; thou
that wilt be rich, thou whoſe heart goes after thy
covetouſneſs, thou who art given to thy pride,
or thy pleaſures, or thy eaſe, thou art <hi>boring thine
eare to the threſhold of thy mortal enemy;</hi> thou art do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away thy patrimony for husks, thou art doing
away thy Soul, and its eternal inheritance to buy
in thy life into an houſe, or parcel of Land; or for
a bundle of crackling thorns, to make thee blaze,
before which thou mayeſt dance and be merry for
an hour or two, and then go down to everlaſting
darkneſs.</p>
            <p>This being ſuch a marvelous thing; that ſuch an
enemy, that is ſo known and confeſt to be, by
the very men that ſuffer themſelves to be led
Captive by it, (for what worldling is there that
will not confeſs that this world is an Enemy) that
ſuch a known Enemy, ſhould ſtill ſo eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
in the world: (as the Apoſtle in another caſe,
<hi>Gal. 3. 1. 3. O fooliſh Galatians who hath bewitched
you? are ye ſo fooliſh that having begun in the Spirit ye
will be made perfect in the fleſh?</hi> O fooliſh world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
who hath bewitched you! are ye ſo fooliſh
that being born to things Spiritual and Eternal,
you will be thus led captive by things Temporal
and Fleſhly?) this being ſuch a marvelous thing,
it will be worth our time to enquire, wherein
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:153788:21"/>
the ſtrength of the world lyes, whereby it ſo
ſtrangely prevails.</p>
            <p>And indeed it is a piece of the beſt policy, and
that which gives great advantage againſt an enemy,
to ſtudy and find out where his ſtrength lyeth,
<hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 6. &amp;c. When <hi>Dalilah</hi> attemped the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
of <hi>Sampſon</hi> bound into the hands of the
<hi>Philiſtimes,</hi> ſhe lyes at him day by day, <hi>tell me where
thy great ſtrength lyeth,</hi> tell me where thy great
ſtrength lyeth: in vain did they aſſault him, in
vain did ſhe bind him; her Cords, and her Withs,
and her webs could never hold him, till at length
ſhe found out where his ſtrength lay; which when
ſhe had once found out, ſhe quickly ſpoil'd him
of it, and delivered him a captive to his enemies:
find out the <hi>ſtrength of the World,</hi> what it is, and
wherein it lyes, and then you will underſtand your
way to the conquering of it.</p>
            <p>But where lyes this ſtrength of the World?
I anſwer.</p>
            <p>In

            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>In the ſpirit of the world within:</hi> the world
hath a ſtrong party within man, which ſides with
it, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 12. We have received not the ſpirit of the
world but the ſpirit which is of God</hi> [we] have not;
we who have that ſpirit of God in us have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the ſpirit of this world: but all others
have no other ſpirit. In the whole generation of
worldly men, there is the ſame ſpirit; as in the
whole generation of the Saints there is the ſame
divine ſpirit, the ſame ſpirit of grace, the ſame
ſpirit of faith, the ſame ſpirit of love, the ſame
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:153788:22"/>
holy ſpirit. So in all the men of this world there
is the ſame worldly ſpirit.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of this world is an <hi>earthly</hi> Spirit,
1 <hi>Cor. 15. 47. the firſt man is of the earth, earthy:</hi> in
his creation he had an earthy <hi>body,</hi> and by ſin he is
come to have an earthy <hi>Soul.</hi> Sin was his fall from
Heaven to Earth, as in his <hi>choice</hi> he made for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
he choſe an earthly inheritance; ſo in <hi>his
temper,</hi> and diſpoſition, and tendency; his very
nature now inclines, and bends towards earthly
things; his Soul as well as his Body, luſts after,
and feeds upon duſt.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of the World is <hi>a ſhort ſighted ſpirit:</hi>
it cannot <hi>ſee afarr off, 2 Pet.</hi> 19. Heavenly things are
too far diſtant to be diſcerned by it, it loves and
gapes for, and graſps things preſent, things to
come are far out of its ſight.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of the world is <hi>a low and narrow
ſpirit,</hi> theſe poor and beggerly things that this
earth affords, are the higheſt of its ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Seekeſt thou great things for thy ſelf? Yes I do:
what, worldly greatneſs? are theſe the great things
thou ſeekeſt? a great name, a great eſtate? great
poſſeſſions? thou miſtakeſt thy ſelf man, theſe great
things are but ſmall things, below the ſpirit of
a man, below a divine and immortal Soul: meat,
and drink, and mirth, and money? are theſe the
beſt things thou findeſt for thy heart to be ſet upon?
for thy ſoul to take pleaſure in? ſure thou haſt
changed Souls with the bruits, that canſt take up
with ſuch things as theſe.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of the World is <hi>an homebred ſpirit:</hi> it
hath never been abroad, but hath been born and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:153788:22"/>
bred in this worldly region: it hath never ſet foot,
nor been acquainted in a better land: the ſpirit
which is of God, carries up to the upper regions;
the regions of light, and life, and glory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality;
where it hath made diſcoveries of
other manner of treaſures, and joyes, and glories,
then are here to be found; but the ſpirit of the
world hath ever dwelt at home; the ſouls of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
dwell in their houſes of clay, and never tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
farther; then they can, with the ſnail, carry
their houſes upon their heads: their Souls travail
no farther then their carkaſes.</p>
            <p>This Spirit of the World, by what hath been
hinted, of the make and temper of it, you ſee, hath a
<hi>ſuitableneſs</hi> to worldly things; and this is the great
advantage the World hath upon us, <hi>it tempts us
to that we love and like:</hi> all that the World per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
us to, is to ſeek what we have a mind to,
to do what we have a mind to, to follow our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and diſpoſitions, to find out what will beſt
pleaſe us, and there to take our fill.</p>
            <p>The difficulty of Chriſts victory over Souls,
lyes in this, that he calls and commands them to
things and to wayes contrary to their natures;
not to pleaſe, but to deny themſelves; to kill
their Fleſh, to croſs their appetites, to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
their own mind; to purſue an happineſs,
which is ſo ſublime and ſpiritual, and ſo unſuitable
to their carnal natures, that it is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory
to them; and hereupon he hath hard work
to prevail, and tis but here and there one amongſt
many, that will be prevailed upon, to hearken
to him: to how many houſes may we come, to
how many ſouls may we bring the everlaſting
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:153788:23"/>
Goſpel, ere one will open and accept? how many
are call'd to Chriſt, to one that comes? O bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
you are witneſs, how hardly any of your
ſouls were perſwaded to come along with Chriſt;
and may be, ſome of you ſtand off, and hang back,
and will not be perſwaded to come fully in, to
this day: What's the reaſon of this? Oh carnal
men think that Chriſt calls them to their loſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
them to their hurt, that they have a better
being, whileſt they are wallowing in their riches,
and their pleaſures, then ever they ſhould find in
following of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But now the advantage that the world hath on
Souls, is, that it tempts them to things pleaſing
to them; their natures joyn with the world, and
draw them the ſame way: Whileſt Chriſt calls,
<hi>if any man will be my diſciple let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and take up his croſs and follow me,</hi> this is all the
world requires, <hi>if any man will be my ſervant, let
him ſeek himſelf and ſhift for himſelf, and pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſhun the croſs, and follow his own heart;</hi> and
what great difficulty is there, to perſwade men to
follow their own minds? when worldly tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
meet with worldly ſpirits, when temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to pride, meet with proud hearts, when
temptations to pleaſure, meet with fleſh-pleaſing
hearts, when temptations to vanity meet with
vain hearts, when temptations to covetouſneſs
meet with covetous hearts, how mightily muſt
they needs prevail? From this ſuitableneſs of
the ſpirit to worldly things, it doth

never knocks but the heart opens, the world ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
offers, but the hand is ready to receive; yea
though the terms upon which we muſt have it be
never ſo unreaſonable; though for every draught
of pleaſure, they muſt after drink the double in
wormwood, though with the gains of the world,
they muſt drink in a curſe, yet like men in a
dropſie, though to drink will be death, their thirſt
muſt be quenched.</p>
            <p>It may be when the world is a tempting the
Soul, <hi>conſcience</hi> ſtands by, and gives it warning,
<hi>take heed of theſe pleaſures</hi> ther's poyſon in that cup,
or ther's wormwood at the bottome; take heed
of theſe deceitful riches, ther's a ſnare lies under,
there's a curſe cleaves to them; look to thy ſelf
Soul, the world is but a playing the Devil with
thee; theſe pleaſures and theſe riches it hath ſent
to fetch away thy Soul: it holds thee ſo buſy
about thine earthly affairs, that thou mayeſt the
mean while looſe the opportunity of making
Chriſt thine, of making the other world ſure to
thee: look to it, thou wilt never have any part
in Chriſt, thou wilt never have any hope towards
God, if thou be tampering thus, and trading thus
greedily for this preſent world: it may be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
doth thus ſtand by, and give warning to the
worldly heart; but alls one for that, come what
will come the heart is ſo ſet upon it, that it will
not be warned.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Hence it is that they ſo greedily make out after
the world,</hi> Oh what haſt doe they make to be rich?
how doe their Souls hunger after worldly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
<hi>they covet greedily all the day long,</hi> Prov. 21. 26.
<hi>They enlarge their deſire as Hell and are as death and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:153788:24"/>
cannot be ſatisfied,</hi> as it was ſaid of the <hi>Caldean,
H<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>b.</hi> 2. 5. they enlarge their deſire as Hell, of
which tis ſaid, <hi>he hath made it deep and large;</hi> they
have deep deſires, the bottom of their Soul comes
up; they have large deſires, they never have
enough, <hi>Ezek. 33. 31. Their heart goeth after their
covetouſneſs:</hi> that is, either after thoſe earthly
things, which are the objects of their covetouſneſs;
or after the <hi>ductus</hi> or leading of their covetouſneſs:
their covetouſneſs leads on and their heart fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:
their heart <hi>goes,</hi> yea it <hi>runs</hi> after it: their
heart out runs their feet, their heart out works
their hands: <hi>when I awake I am ſtill with thee,</hi> ſaith
the Pſalmiſt; and when the worlding awakes,
where is his heart preſently? in the field, in the
ſhop, in the market; his heart is there, before
his body can get there: it may be that muſt ſtay
a time in the houſe after he awakes, and put on
his clothes or take his breakfaſt, or may be to
make a ſhort prayer, for a faſhion; but his heart
goes preſently abroad, as ſoon as ever he awakes,
and leaves only his tongue behind to pray.</p>
            <p>But whence is this eagerneſs this hungring and
riding poſt after the world? why tis his love to the
world that makes him gape ſo wide after it; he
loves to be rich, he loves [give ye.]</p>
            <p>Chriſt is propos'd and ſet before his eyes, <hi>the
bread of life, the water of life,</hi> the windows of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
are opened, the fountains above are broken
up; the durable riches, the everlaſting pleaſures,
life and peace, and reſt, and joy, and glory are
ſett forth in open ſight before the world: and as
<hi>Pſal. 14. 2. God looks down to ſee if any would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
and ſeek God:</hi> to ſee who amongſt all the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:153788:24"/>
world had a mind to <hi>his</hi> riches, to his treaſures;
who was for Chriſt, who was for Grace, who was
for Heaven; but behold they are all running ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way; there's none that underſtands, none
that will ſeek God; every door is ſhut, every
heart's aſleep when God paſſeth by. If he ſhould
never give, till many ask, if he ſhould ſtay till
they ſeek him, how long might he ſtay? he muſt
come and call, and knock and break open their
doors, and pour into their mouths, and tis well
if Heaven will down with any at laſt; whileſt full
tables, and full draughts of this world, will down
and never ſtick, now and then a crumb, now and
then a drop from above, is all that will be taken
in. Oh this agrees not with our ſtomack, tis the
world that is our favoury meat.</p>
            <p>Oh what abundant proof is there brethren, of
this difference of our appetites, to things ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and things carnal? Oh what thriving and
what grown Chriſtians had we been, had we been
as hungry after grace, as after greatneſs in this
world; had there been ſo much craving and catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after God, as after Mammon; had there been
ſuch good husbandry among us for things to
come, as for things preſen?</p>
            <p>What's the reaſon that our Souls are ſuch
dwarfs, and babes, and ſtarvlings? Are they not
ſo? is it not very poor and very low with us?
what treaſures have you gotten? how little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or Faith, or love, or power, or vigour of
ſpirit, have you attain'd, how is death ſtill feeding
upon us? Death in our underſtandings, Death in
our affections, Death in our Conſciences, Death
in our duties? we walk up and down more like
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:153788:25"/>
the Ghoſts of Chriſtians; then like living Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
pale and wan, and weak and cold; mere
carkaſes of Chriſtianity, when the Soul and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of religion is not. Look about, enquire among
you and ſee, how many ſuch dead carkaſes there
are, to one living lively Soul: how many empty
caskes that make a little ſound, to one full veſſel.</p>
            <p>The Lord be merciful to us, though the name
and ſhell of Religion be among us, and upon us,
yet the ſpirit and kernel of it ſeems to be almoſt
quite vaniſhed out of the earth.</p>
            <p>It was once ſaid <hi>Revel. 3. 4. Thou haſt a few
names even in</hi> Sardis, <hi>that have not defiled their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
But oh may it not be ſaid, thou haſt [but]
a few names, neither in <hi>Sardis, not Thiatira, nor Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia,</hi>
nor any where among all the Churches;
thou haſt but a few names any where, that have any
more then a name that they live.</p>
            <p>Brethren, how is it with us who are here before
the Lord? turn in every one his eye upon his heart,
goe down and ask every one of you, <hi>Soul how fares
it with thee?</hi> how art thou fed oh my Soul? how
art thou clothed? what haſt thou by thee? what
what grace, what peace, what hope to comfort
thee? who is there within thee? is Chriſt there?
is the holy ſpirit there, quickning thee, and cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thee? or is not the world there preying upon
thee and conſuming thee? Ask your Souls, art
thou in health O my Soul? doſt thou live, and
thrive, and hold up thy head, and hold on thy way,
and thy work? or art thou not ſick? head ſick,
and heart ſick, and weak, and poor and blind and
naked? look in each one of you, ſtep down, and
take an account of your ſtate. If you would do
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:153788:25"/>
ſo, I doubt there are few of us, but would find all
within, in a very pitiful and lamentable caſe.</p>
            <p>What's the reaſon of all this? the Lord God
hath offered to feed us, and nouriſh us, and nurſe
up theſe languiſhing Souls; the Lord God hath
ſtood among us, with his baskets of bread and his
bottles of wine; hath put ſuch meat to our mouths,
that would have nouriſhed us up, from babes to be
men from ſuch weaklings to be ſtrong in the Lord;
but there is ſuch an unſuitableneſs betwixt the
things of God and our carnal hearts, that we have
no appetite to them, and ſo they will not down;
whereas the things of the world do find ſuch a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the world in us, that of any thing that it
hath to offer us, nothing comes amiſs; we not
only readily take it in, but greedily hunger and
make out after it.</p>
            <p>By the way Chriſtians learn, that if ever you
would get victory over the world, you muſt firſt
get you <hi>another ſpirit:</hi> in vain do you think
to live other then a worldly life, whileſt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the world lives in you: Oh have you been
ſo long profeſſours of Chriſtianity, and have not
yet gotten the Spirit of Chriſtianity? Is this the
Spirit of Chriſt, that leads you on in an earthly
courſe? did God give you his Spirit, to teach you,
how to be ſuch drudges to the world? did God give
you his Spirit, to teach you how to plow, and
ſow, and buy, and ſell, and hoord up treaſures on
earth? what are your thoughts, your deſigns, your
courſes, your ordinary talk and diſcourſe? what
is it but earth earth? are theſe the thoughts, the
wayes, the language of the Spirit? can any one
that beholds our converſation, that in the general
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:153788:26"/>
bent and tenour of it, is all about the world, and
but now and then a cold wiſh, or a few heartleſs
words, about the things of God; can any man that
beholds us, ſay, I, theſe are the perſons that are
dead to the world; that are crucified, that are
mortified to things below? theſe are they that
have received the ſpirit of Chriſt indeed? theſe
ſpeak like Chriſtians, and look like Chriſtians,
and live like Chriſtians, like men of another world?
can it be ſaid thus of us? can we ſay thus of our
ſelves? my life is a ſpiritual life, my courſe is an
heavenly courſe, my ſteps are all bending to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
countrey? can we ſay thus? would not our
daily courſe, our daily diſcourſe, give us the lye
if we ſhould? Oh we are yet of an earthly ſenſual
Spirit; the Spirit of this world is yet bearing rule
in us; our very Soul is but a lump of earth and
fleſh; Oh for another Spirit, a new Soul, a more
divine and celleſtial frame! O ſeek, O wait for
this better Spirit, and then we ſhould quickly ſee
another life: once let the world be thruſt out of
the heart, and we ſhall quickly ſee more of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
breaking forth in the life,</p>

excellencies in theſe earthly treaſures, as will
transfigure Earth into an Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He preſents the world, as that which hath</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
ſufficiency, contentment, hearts eaſe, ſatisfaction

to his,</hi> Prov. 8. 17. &amp;c. I love them that love me,
and them that ſeek me early ſhall find me: riches and
honours are with me, yea durable riches and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
I will cauſe thoſe that love, me to find ſubſtance,
and I will fill their treaſures: <hi>thus the Lord ſpeaks
to his, and the Devil gives the world a tongue, to
ſpeak at the ſame rate.</hi> I love them that love me, I
have riches and honours, durable riches, and I will fill
them with treaſures.</p>
            <p>And as the world ſpeaks, ſo worldlings think, it

their portion: <hi>and now Lord what wait I for,</hi> ſaith
the Pſalmiſt, <hi>my hope is in thee:</hi> and now world,
what wait [I] for? what work I for? what live

            <p>And on the other ſide, as Sathan over rates
this, ſo he under rates the other world, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.
4. <hi>The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them
which believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of
Chriſt, who is the image of of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi>
The Goſpel is a window, through which the light
and glory of the other world breaks in, and ſhines
down upon this: here the pretended opener of
eyes, ſmites with blindneſs; by a vail of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
he keeps the Goſpel, and all the glory of it
out of ſight: unbelief gives the lye to all that the
Goſpel ſpeaks; calls all into queſtion, holds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
uncertainties, whether there be any ſuch thing
or no; and what's doubtful and uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be or no, will be vallewed there after.</p>
            <p>What a low price do carnal hearts put upon the
deep things of God, upon the great things of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?
Glory and honour and immortality and
eternal life, what cheap things are they accounted?
whileſt ſoul, and conſcience, and peace, and
hopes, and life are ſo ordinarily ſold, to purchaſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:153788:27"/>
an earthly inheritance, (that's the bargain that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where is driving in this earth) how few are
there that will deal for Heaven and Glory, though
it may be bought without mony, and without price?
though it may be had for the ſeeking for; though
it be bought to their hands, yet they will not take
it. Now what advantage is this to wordly temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
when the price of things to come is ſo
beaten down, when the price of things preſent is
ſo hoiſed and raiſed, as if the one could hardly be
over-bought, and the other were ſcarce worth the
dealing for?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>By ſharpening the edge of preſent evils, and blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the edge of evils to come.</hi> The afflictions of this
life are made to cut deeper than the vengeance to
come. The perſecutions of men are more feared
than the Plague of God: Satan makes his Vaſſals
to think, there is no Heaven or Hell to thoſe on
Earth; Poverty looks more diſmally than eternal
Fire, Diſgrace than Damnation, the Wrath of
man than the Cnrſe of God.</p>
            <p>Let Death and Damnation be preached to the
World, and this ſtirs them not, let the Devil
preach of Tribulation and Perſecution for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
ſake, and how are they frighted,? Let the
Word declare unto them, with never ſo much
plainneſs and power, <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be
damned; If you live after the fleſh you ſhall dye; The
Wrath of God ſhall be revealed from Heaven againſt all
unrighteouſneſs and ungodlineſs of men; Who ſhall be
puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of
the Lord, and the glory of his Power:</hi> And how little
is this regarded, who doth believe this report?
how few are convinced? how few are awakened,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:153788:28"/>
ſo much as to conſider how they may eſcape? How
weak are all thoſe Arguments, which are either
fetch'd down from above, or fetch'd up from the
deep, and how little will they work? On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, let men be told, <hi>He that departs from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
makes himſelf a prey; All thoſe that will live godly
in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer perſecution; Ye ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
reviled, and caſt out of men, made as the
filth of the world, and the off-ſcouring of all things; Ye
ſhall be as Sheep among Wolves, as Lilles among Thorns;
The Devil ſhall caſt you into Priſon; You ſhall be as
Signs and Wonders in</hi> Iſrael; <hi>Many are the troubles of
the Righceous,</hi> &amp;c. Let the Devil take ſuch Texts
as theſe, and preach to them, and how deep does
his word go? If this be the portion of Chriſtians,
if this be the wages of Righteouſneſs, and the fruit
of Holineſs, let me take heed of Chriſt and his
waies. A mocking <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> a curſing <hi>Shimei,</hi> a
rayling <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> will do more to fright them off
from holineſs, than the Worm, than the Fire, than
all the Vipers, and Scorpions, and Stings, and
Torments beneath will do, to drive them back
from Sin: They dare not be Saints for fear of the
barking of Dogs, but they dare be Sinners not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the roaring of Lyons; The Devil hath
made ſuch fools of them, that a few grains laid
on them at preſent, ſeem more heavy, than thoſe
Talents that the Almighty is caſting down upon
them.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>By an active ſtimulating and preſſing them on,
what ever becomes of them hereafter, to purſue the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
good things, and to prevent the preſent evil things.</hi>
If the Devil can but make the <hi>Premiſes</hi> take with
them, That the good things preſent are ſo good,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:153788:28"/>
that there's nothing better, That the evil things
preſent are ſo evil, that there are none greater;
then hee'l eaſily gain the <hi>Concluſion;</hi> Therefore it's
the beſt and wiſeſt courſ, <hi>per fas aut nefas,</hi> to ſecure
the one, and eſcape the other.</p>
            <p>But more particularly, the Devil manages and
quickens the temptations of the World,

            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>By propoſing of Objects.</hi> He brings the World
in ſight. Sometimes he preſents it immediately
<hi>to the fancy;</hi> he raiſes great thoughts of heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it; he calls the thoughts abroad with him,
to take a view of the glory, and the riches, and
the pleaſures of his Kingdom; ſets men a thinking
on the pomps and faſhions, or the ſports and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the world; a rolling over in their minds,
the gains and ſweetneſſes of a worldly life.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he preſents it <hi>to the Eye.</hi> There is
a quick paſſage from the eye to the heart: If the
Devil can but turn the eyes to behold vanity, by
the eye he will eaſily infect the heart. The Devil
preſents Objects to the eye, leading men up and
down, where his baits and ſnares do lye, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.
6. Sinners are ſaid to be <hi>lead about by divers [Luſts.]</hi>
The Devil leads Luſt, and Luſt hath the leading of
the Man. But whither do mens Luſts lead them?
Why every where, up and down, where the Devil
hath laid his baits to take them: Some mens Luſts
lead them to their Companions, to their ſports and
paſtimes, to the Ale-houſe, to the Tavern; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens Luſts carry them into the City, or into
the Field, over Sea and Land, to find them out
wealth and ſubſtance; Some mens Luſts lead them
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:153788:29"/>
to the Courts of Princes, to the Palaces of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
to ſee faſhions, to get favour, and to climb
up into dignities and high places. Men need con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
whither they go, and what their call is thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the Devil hath oftner an hand in the leading
us up and down, than we are aware of; and he
that goes whither the Devil leads him, 'tis ten to
one but he's in the Net before he returns: We
are never more ſecure than when we keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loof
from temptations, when the Devils baits are
out of ſight. We are never in more danger, than
when <hi>the hook</hi> is out of fight and <hi>the bait</hi> is in ſight:
that's Satan's courſe, as to hide the hook, ſo to
ſhew the bait. He turn'd <hi>Eve</hi>'s eye to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Achan</hi>'s eye to the wedge of Gold, <hi>Ahab</hi>'s
eye to <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, and then what work did
he make with them.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>By provoking the Appetite;</hi> And this he doth,
not onely by propounding of Objects at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but ſuch objects as are <hi>moſt ſuitable and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with</hi> thoſe he has to deal: Satan is a <hi>skilful Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher;</hi>
he underſtands our natures and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions,
and the ſeveral inclinations that flow
from them: Satan is a <hi>cunning Fiſher,</hi> and knows
at what baits every kind of Fiſh will bite; and
accordingly angles for them: Some men he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
are naturally of a <hi>ſenſual heart,</hi> given to
the pleaſures of the fleſh; for theſe he hath ſports
and paſtimes, Mirth and Jollity, Wine, Beauty,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Look thee here ſaith the Devil, what a life
thou maiſt live if thou wilt; Ariſe, take, and eat,
here's meat thou loveſt, take thy fill, and make
thee an happy man: if thou meddle too far with
the Scriptures, or hearken to theſe Preachers,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:153788:29"/>
what a ſad Soul wilt thou become? a ſowr unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
and moroſe ſpirit, thou wilt be even eaten
up of thy melancholick dumps: thou muſt croſs
thy ſelf, and be ever vexing thine heart, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
ſeverities, if thou wilt hearken to them:
let them alone, let them Preach to whom they
will, run not after them, hearken not to their
words; beleive thy ſenſes, taſte what I ſet before
thee, taſte if it be not good.</p>
            <p>Others he obſerves to be of <hi>earthly minds,</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
after wealth and riches; tis not mirth, and
jollity, and pleaſures, and ſuch like traſh, and
chaffe, that will take with theſe; they muſt have
ſubſtance; and for theſe he hath money, and lands,
fields, and farms and oxen: Wilt thou be a rich
man? wilt thou be a wealthy man? wilt thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
thy ſtock and thy ſtore? wilt thou enlarge
thy poſſeſſion? hearken to me, be a good husband;
waſt not thy time about impertinencies, reading
hearing, praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mind thy buſineſs, and thine

be the one thing thou mindeſt. Nouriſh not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſcruples, <hi>this is a forbidden courſe, this ought not

thou art to venture on any thing, the greater will
thy gain be: let Men or Conſcience clamour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thee, call thee Earth-worm, unjuſt, extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
oppreſſour; let them alone, thou ſhalt
increaſe in ſubſtance, and that will make thee

            <p>Others are of <hi>aerie Spirits,</hi> proud and ambitious;
and for theſe he hath the breath of popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:153788:30"/>
reſpect and eſteem in the world, honour
and reputation.</p>
            <p>Others are of <hi>a timorous and fearful heart;</hi> and
with theſe he deals in thunder and ſtorms; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
perſecutions, bonds and baniſhments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
and cruel mockings. Look before thee
fooliſh creature: what art thou a doing? what art
thou preparing for thy ſelf? ſee what rods I have
in brine for thee; knoweſt thou not that I have
power to make thee or to undoe thee! art thou
able to ſtand againſt all the world? See how all
my Armies are confiderate againſt thee, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon thee to devour thee, and ſwallow thee
up: conſider the rage of their hearts, the fury in
their faces, the violence of their hands; behold
them already on their march againſt thee; they
are many, they are terrible, they are potent, they
are near that ſeek thy ruine. Awake from thy
folly, be not acceſſary to thine own undoing:
ſave thy ſelf, go and make thy peace with them,
caſt in thy lott amongſt them, joyn with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
be as they are, let thy voice and thy way
be as theirs; let go this pride and ſingularity,
and be as others, and it ſhall be well with thee.</p>
            <p>Thus ſubtilly doth our adverſary deal with us;
with every man according to his humour, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ſeveral diſpoſitions of their hearts; and
in this ſubtilty, his ſtrength lyes, and thereon his
ſucceſs depends. What wonder, that the fearful
are frighted? that the proud are lifted up, that
the greedy gape ſo wide? that the full draughts of
the worlds ſtollen waters, do ſo eaſily down with
ſuch, whoſe Souls are panting after them?</p>
            <p>Chriſtians let's learn wiſedom of this Serpent;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:153788:30"/>
Doth he make advantage of our Tempers? doth he
obſerve our diſpoſitions, and accordingly order
his temptations? Let us learn this wiſdom, to
know our own hearts, and to obſerve our own
inclinations, and accordingly there to ſtand moſt
conſtantly on our guard, where we find the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
moſt like to aſſault us; and to have a ſpecial
eye to thoſe enemies that are moſt like to make a
breach upon us.</p>
            <p>Art thou a perſon <hi>given to pleaſure?</hi> Is a merry,
jolly, frolick, wanton, luxurious life grateful to
thee? art thou given to appetite? to indulge thy
throat, to ſtudy thy belly? are meats and drinks,
curioſities and varieties of them, the things thou
mindeſt? Art thou given to pride? is honour or
applauſe, is the higheſt place, the fineſt cloaths,
the neweſt faſhions, are theſe thine hearts delight?
Is merry company, lightneſs, vain jeſting, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
or amorous books or diſcourſes, are theſe the
delight of thine heart? When ever thou ſeeſt them
before thee, tell thine heart, <hi>how pleaſing ſoever theſe
be to thee, theſe things I muſt never allow thee:</hi> When
ever thou ſeeſt ſuch objects before thee and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
inviting thee to ſatisfie thy luſt, when thou
falleſt into company that are of the ſame ſpirit,
when ſports and paſtimes when delicates and
dainties or any other voluptuous Objects are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, then ſay, <hi>Now I muſt look to my ſelf;</hi> the
Devil ſtands in the crowd, to ſteal away my ſoul:
theſe are the flies with which he uſes to bait his
hook for me,; he hath catch'd me with them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a time, and now he is come angling for me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
O my ſoul I know thou haſt a luſt to be nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
theſe are the things thou naturally loveſt,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:153788:31"/>
here thy great danger lyes, and I muſt look the
more narrowly to thee here. An heart given to
pleaſure, ſhould hold it ſelf under a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
and allow it ſelf leſs liberty, than others
that are not thus enclined; that may be ſafe for
them, which would prove fatal to thee.</p>
            <p>Art thou <hi>an earthly minded perſon?</hi> and doſt thou
ſee ſubſtance before thee; a Field, or an Houſe
that may be gotten? does the world come crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and flowing in upon thee? Haſt thou good
trading, rich merchandiſe, gainful bargains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, and is thy ſoul in chaſe of them? Take
heed to thy ſelf, theſe are the things by which thou
art like to be loſt: thou art never in ſuch danger
of becoming poor, as by growing rich: When
are Worldlings hearts ſo ready to take their leave
of God, and Heaven, as when they are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with the flatteries of a ſmiling World?
their gains are uſually their greateſt loſſe, they
never decline or go back ſo much, as when they
have the beſt trading. How hardly ſhalt rich men
enter into the Kingdom of God? When riches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
how hard is it for ſuch, not to ſet their
harts upon them?</p>
            <p>How little are the Counſels or Promiſes of God
regarded, whilſt we have the World at will? how
little is it regarded, that God Promiſes, <hi>I will be
thine,</hi> Chriſt ſhall be thine, the Kingdom ſhall be
thine; whilſt the World ſtands by and ſaies, <hi>I
will be thine,</hi> Money ſayes, I will be thine, Sheep
and Oxen ſay, we will all be thine! The Lord
is hereupon often put to it, to take away our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
to drive away our cattel, to burn down our
houſes, to turn our fruitful Land into a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:153788:31"/>
to bring us to wants and ſtraits, ere he
can be regarded, <hi>Hoſ. 2. 14. I will bring her into
the Wilderneſs, and there will I ſpeak to her heart:</hi>
ſpeak to her any where elſe, and ſhe will give me
the hearing; in the Wilderneſs my Word will
reach her heart.</p>
            <p>Oh that men were ſenſible of this; that they are
never ſo like to ſtarve as upon their heaps, that
their proſperous times are the Devils ſeaſons to
impoveriſh their ſouls; that the abundance that is
ſet before them, are the Devils tokens, whereby
he is enticing their hearts after him.</p>
            <p>I am rich and have found me out ſubſtance, now
I ſhall be happy? No, no, fooliſh ſoul, theſe riches
are Satans Milſtones which he hangs about thy
neck, to drown thee in perdition and deſtruction;
if any thing ſink thee, 'tis this load upon thy back;
thy Golden age is like to be thine Iron age: Satan
knows thy mind, and what will pleaſe thee; he's
trucking with thee for thy life: He knows thou
haſt a greedy heart, and that there's nothing ſo
dear unto thee, but he can buy it for money, and
that's the bargain he's driving with thee; <hi>Sell
all that thou haſt, thy God, thy Hopes, thy Soul, and
come and follow me, and thou ſhalt have treaſures on
Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtians, ſtand ever upon your Watch, but
eſpecially when there's any thing before you, that
your carnal hearts like, and are apt to fall a luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after, if ever you would fear the Devil, fear
him then, when he is tickling your fleſh: he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
does us more miſchief, than by doing us good
turns: God ſeldom does us more good than by his
ſrowns, and the Devil never does us more hurt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:153788:32"/>
than by his kindneſſes. It never fares better
with Gods Children than when they are croſt, nor
ever fares it worſe with the Devils Children, than
when they are cocker'd: never ſuſpect the Devil
more, than when he pretends to do you a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;
what ever it be, by which he uſually pleaſures
you, dread that as Death and Hell: Miſtake not
Gods chaſtiſements, nor the Devils complements;
be content that God ſhould diſpleaſe you, and be
afraid when the Devil pleaſes you; be convinc'd
that Gods ſmitings are a precious Balm, and the
Devils ſtroakings are ſtabs at your heart; fear not
his Thunder and Storms ſo much as his warm
Sun.</p>
            <p>Beware of this folly, <hi>Whatever pleaſes me is good
for me.</hi> Beware of this madneſs, <hi>I [muſt] be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what ever comes of it,</hi> mine eye muſt be pleaſed,
my humour muſt be pleaſed, mine appetite muſt
be pleaſed, I muſt be pleaſed what ever it coſts me:
If you be for that, the Devil knows where to have
you: though God does not pleaſe you, though ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
does not pleaſe you, though Heaven does
not pleaſe you, the Devil that knows your palate,
will find ſomething that will: If Mony will do it,
if Mirth will do it, if Meat, and Drink, and fine
Cloathes or merry Company will do it, this he
offers you, and by this he holds you captive at his
will.</p>
            <p>III. Wherein the ſtrength of faith lies, whereby it
overcomes the world.</p>
            <p>What a mighty enemy is here? who can ſtand
before it? What is little <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Goliah?</hi> what is
a ſling and a pebble to a ſword and a ſpear? to an
helmet and greaves and a target of braſſe? The
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:153788:32"/>
mighty Philiſtim comes bluſtring, and boaſting,
and fuming, and chafing, ſo that he made an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
in the Camp of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and what could a poor
ſtripling do to undertake this mighty Champion?
what hope is there of victory over him? little <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
tells us, 1 Sam. 17. 45. <hi>Thou comeſt to me with
a Sword, and a Spear, but I come unto thee in the
Name of the Lord of Hoſts: this day will the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
thee into mine hand; and all this aſſembly ſhall
know, that the Lord ſaveth not with Sword and Spear,
the battel is the Lords, and he will give you into our
hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſtrength of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is this <hi>David;</hi> the ſtrength
of <hi>David</hi> is his Faith, the ſtrength of Faith is <hi>the
Name of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 18. 10. <hi>the Name of the
Lord is a ſtrong Tower, the righteous runneth into it
and is ſafe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to come cloſer to the matter in hand, this
general I ſhall diſpatch in theſe two Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The ſtrength of a Chriſtian is his Faith.</item>
               <item>2. The ſtrength of Faith is Chriſt.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>The ſtrength of a Chriſtian is his Faith,</hi> Mark 9.
23. <hi>to him that believeth all things are poſſible;</hi> there's
nothing impoſſible to Faith, becauſe there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
impoſſible to God: The 11th. chapter to
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is a ſhort <hi>Chroniele</hi> of the mighty Acts
and Atchievements of Faith. <hi>It ſpoiled Death of its
prey;</hi> as in the caſe of <hi>Enoch,</hi> verſe 5. his Faith
carried him to Heaven another way, he was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
and did not ſee death: <hi>It made an Ark to ſave
from a Flood;</hi> as in the caſe of <hi>Noah,</hi> verſe 7. <hi>It
caus'd a living iſſue to ſpring out of dead bodies;</hi> as in
the caſe of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> verſe 12. <hi>It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:153788:33"/>
a living Child from the dead, by offering it up to
death;</hi> as in the caſe of <hi>Abraham</hi> offering up his Son
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> v. 17. 19. <hi>It foretold things to come, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
down the Fathers bleſſing on his poſterity;</hi> as in
the caſe of <hi>Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> v. 20.</p>
            <p>But more fully to our purpoſe, <hi>It overcame the
world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>It deſpiſed and rejected the proſperity of the world,</hi>
v. 15. <hi>They were not mindful of their earthly countrey,</hi>
they had a better, an Heavenly countrey in their
eye, and were content to be Pilgrims in this, in
hope to be poſſeſſours of that better inheritance.
v. 24. <hi>Moſes</hi> by faith forſook the glory of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
the Court of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the boſome of <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
daughter, <hi>chooſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the
people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a
ſeaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>It triumph'd over the power, and wrath of the world,</hi>
v. 33. It ſubdued Kingdoms, wrought righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
quenched the violence of fire, eſcaped the
edge of the ſword; out of weakneſs it made ſtrong,
turned to flight the Armies of the Aliens; endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
cruel mockings and ſcourgings; yea more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
bonds and impriſonments; endured ſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſawing aſunder, wandrings about in ſheep-skins
and goat-skins, deſtitute, afflicted, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.
In all theſe things the ſervants of God
were more then conquerours [through Faith] in
him that loved them.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, where is your faith? how is it that
the world is ſtill on horſeback, riding on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
and to conquer! not only riding over our
backs, but riding over our Faith, crowing over
our conſciences, triumphing over religion, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:153788:33"/>
righteouſneſs; as if Chriſt had loſt the day, and
conſcience had run the field?</p>
            <p>Oh how many Captives hath it taken from the
mighty? what multitudes of priſoners hath it got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?
Some it hath <hi>in golden chains,</hi> fettered in
riches and worldly gains, in honours and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Some it holds <hi>with a Spiders web,</hi> which yet
they cannot break; the faſhions and fooleries of
the world; its pomps, pleaſures and humours:
others it hath laid faſt <hi>in iron chains,</hi> manacled
with fears, and dread of its fury and violence:
they dare not be Saints any longer; their faith,
and their love, and their zeal, are all thrown away;
they dare not appear in their Armour, leſt they
ſhould be known for Chriſts diſciples.</p>
            <p>How many renegadoes, and Apoſtates hath
the world made; that have run from their colours,
and have liſted themſelves under the Devil; under
whoſe conduct they are fighting againſt that faith,
and holineſs, which once they profeſſed? and
thoſe that are left behind, how weak and faint-hearted
are they moſt become? afraid not only
of ſufferings but of their duty. O how are we loſt
in our conflicts with temptations? whither are
our hearts run? ſome into our fields, ſome into
our ſhops, ſome into our gardens, ſome into our
beds of eaſe, where we may ſleep in a whole skin.
Some are gotten into ſanctuary, turn'd aſide to
iniquity to eſcape affliction.</p>
            <p>Oh how few hearts are there left behind with
Chriſt, and thoſe that are how cold and ſpiritleſs
are they become! tis woful to obſerve with what
a pale face Chriſtianity looks at this day.</p>
            <p>May we not ſadly invert the words of the Text,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:153788:34"/>
               <hi>This is the victory that hath overcome our Faith even this
preſent world?</hi> whileſt the Apoſtle boaſts that the
believers of old, by their faith, <hi>ſubdued Kingdomes,
wrought righteouſneſs, obteined promiſes, ſtopd the
mouths of Lions, quenched the violence of Fire,</hi> &amp;c.
May we not now hear the world triumphing, that
it hath, <hi>ſhaken the Kingdom of Chriſt, wrought wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
vacated promiſes, ſtopped the mouth of Conſcience,
quenched the heat of zeal, ſlain holineſs with the edge of
the ſword, put to flight the hopes of the Saints, left for
dead thoſe whom God hath raiſed up to life, left the
Church that living vineyard as a field of dead carkaſſes,</hi>
their peace ſlain, their comforts ſlain, the Spirit
of light and life within them vaniſhed into dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and deadneſs? and all this becauſe our Faith
hath ſo much fail'd: what are we become? to what
a low ebbe are we brought O we of little faith?
well, but yet there is hope concerning this thing.
This ſtump if there be but life in the root, will
ſpring again and recover again: you that have
but a little faith, blow up that living ſparkle, and
your ſick, and ſpoiled and half dead Souls, will
revive again; let your faith once out of weakneſs
be made ſtrong, and it will recover all you have
loſt.</p>
            <p>Beleive more, nouriſh and cheriſh and exerciſe
Faith more; lean on the rock of ages, look unto
Jeſus, lay hold on the Covenant, live in the word
of promiſe, hang upon the ſhoulders, feed upon
the fulneſs of the Lord, and there let your Faith
gather ſtrength again, and this will be the ſtrength
of your hearts; will renew your life, recover
your love, enflame your zeal, ſet your holineſs,
and your hopes again upon the wing, and bring
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:153788:34"/>
the world and its temptations again under your
feet: the ſtrenth of a Chriſtian is his Faith.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The ſtrength of Faith is Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt is the
mighty one: <hi>the mighty God,</hi> If. 9. 6. <hi>The rock of
ages, in whom is everlaſting ſtrength,</hi> If. 26. through
Faith this mighty God is our God, this rock of
ages is our rock, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 4. Ye are of God little
children and have overcome them, becauſe greater is he
that is in you then he that is in the world:</hi> who is he
that is in you? tis Chriſt that is in you: who is
he that is in the world? the Devil is in the world.
Chriſt is greater then the enemy, and therefore
you have overcome. He that is in the world is
great, but he that is in you is greater, he that is in
the world is ſtrong, and ſubtil, but he that is in
you is ſtronger and wiſer then he [little] Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ye have overcome: what are a company of
poor children to a mighty giant? But behold the
childrens Champion, and you will quickly ſee on
which ſide the victory will go.</p>
            <p>There are 2. things in Chriſt which are the
ſtrength of faith.</p>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>He hath power to prevent temptations,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.
13. <hi>he will not ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are
able:</hi> You may conclude from the promiſe of
Chriſt, to his power; he will not promiſe more
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:153788:35"/>
then he can doe; when he ſaies he will not ſuffer
us to be tempted, you may be ſure he hath power
to reſtrain the tempter. Chriſt hath all our temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and temptations in his power; the Devil in
his power, the World in his power, they muſt
have leave ere they can ſtrike a ſtroke. If he ſay
the word, the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſhall not come againſt <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
nor dig a trench about them, nor ſhoot an
arrow againſt them, he hath his hook in the noſe,
and his bridle in the Jaws of all his enemies. As
the Devil could not tempt Chriſt, ſo neither any
of his ſervants unleſs the Spirit lead them into the
wilderneſs to be tempted: therefore he directs
us to pray, <hi>Lead us not into temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>He hath power to deaden temptations;</hi> to take off
the edge of them, that ſo though they come, yet
they ſhall not enter: though Sathan ſtrikes, yet
his arrows ſhall not ſtick, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. By him
<hi>the world is crucified to me and I am crucified to the
world.</hi> Chriſt by his Croſs hath ſlain the world;
its now become to the Saints <hi>as a dead thing.</hi> Its
<hi>beauty and glory</hi> is dead, dried up and withered.
Chriſt by his croſs hath diſcovered the glory of
the other world; life and mortality are hung forth
in open ſight on the Croſs of Chriſt; and that
ſunſhine hath withered all the flowers here below;
who will play at ſuch ſmall games, that ſees the
inviſible Crown, which the Croſs of Chriſt hath
ſet before his eyes. And as the beauty and glory,
ſo the <hi>power and wrath</hi> of the world is ſlain. Chriſt
by his death kill'd all the powers of darkneſs: a
Chriſtian ſees, that the world can now doe him
neither good nor hurt, it can neither befriend
nor miſchief him: who would be enticed by a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:153788:35"/>
dead Carrion, or affrighted by a dead Lyon?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[And I am crucified unto it]</hi> Chriſt hath ſlain the
World without us, and our worldly Luſts within
us: <hi>Our old man is crucified with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 6. 6.
<hi>ye are dead,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3. dead to
this World: <hi>Set your affections on things above,</hi> for
ye are dead to things below: <hi>I am crucified to the
World;</hi> that is, worldly temptations are no more
to me, than if I were a dead man: What are
meat, and drink, and cloaths, and pleaſures, and
honours to a dead man? If the Devil ſhould go
and preach among the tombs, and call out to the
dead, hearken to me, and I will feed you with
delicates, cloath you in ſcarlet, enrich you with
ſilver and gold, exalt you to honour; what skull
or bone would be moved? the ſame ſucceſs will
he have in his tempting crucified Saints: were
they totally thus mortified, the higheſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
would move them nothing at all, no more
than a Carkaſs in the grave; and according to the
degree of that mortification, they have attained
to, ſo far forth is the edge of temptation blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>He hath power to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted.</hi>
Though the Tempter be let looſe, and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
come thick, and ſtrike deep, as by reaſon of
our imperfect mortification they may; our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences
ſadly reſtifie, how much the World is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
too hard for us, how often we are intangled
and led away by it; what breaches it makes on
our peace, what wounds in our hearts, and what
fears and miſgivings hereupon ariſe in our ſouls,
how we ſhall ſtand for the future; thus are we wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and diſtreſſed and hard beſtead; but though
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:153788:36"/>
it be thus with us, in the midſt of all theſe there's
this to ſupport us, Heb. 2. 18. <hi>In that he ſuffered being
tempted, he is able alſo to ſuccour thoſe that are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>His Victory over the world.</hi> Chriſt hath <hi>power</hi>
over the World to reſtrain it from tempting, to
deaden its temptations, to ſuccour thoſe that
are tempted; yea more than that, he hath already
overcome the World, and thereby ſecur'd our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>final
victory, John 16. 33. <hi>In the world ye ſhall
have tribulation, but be ye of good comfort, I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the World.</hi> Why what comfort's that, that he
hath overcome? Why, 1. 'Tis ſome encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that our enemy is not <hi>invincible;</hi> he that hath
been beaten, may be beaten. 2. There's this
farther comfort to us, that in his victory we have
overcome: Who is it that hath overcome? Our
Captain, our Champion hath overcome; he hath
overcome, and overcome for us; he hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and we in him; <hi>We are more than Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
through him that loved us,</hi> Rom. 8. Faith u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
to Chriſt; and thereupon,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>All the Power of Chriſt is engaged to our help and
aſſiſtance;</hi> We are hereby intereſs'd in his <hi>Victory;</hi>
Chriſts Victory is our Victory; and alſo in his
<hi>Power;</hi> he is now concern'd to protect and help
us: we are his own, the attempts that are made
againſt us, are made againſt him; the ſpoil that
is made upon us, is made upon him, as <hi>in all our
afflictions he is afflicted,</hi> ſo in all our temptations
he alſo is tempted; our enemies are his enemies,
our ſufferings are his ſufferings, our temptations
are his temptations: Is not Chriſt concern'd to
look to his own? <hi>Iſa. 63. 15. 19. Look down from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:153788:36"/>
Heaven and behold from the habitation of thine holineſs,
and thy glory; where is thy Zeal and thy Strength?</hi>
Why, what have you to do with me, or with my
ſtrength? O <hi>we are thine,</hi> ſay they, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. So
are not our enemies, <hi>thou never bareſt rule over them,
nor are they called by thy Name,</hi> Pſal. 119. 94. <hi>I
am thine, ſave me:</hi> I am thy Child, ſaith the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
thy Servant, a Lamb of thy Flock; thou
art my Shepherd, I have committed my ſelf to
thee, and thou haſt undertaken for me: If Satan
prevails upon me, he prevails upon thee; if the
World ſteal away my heart, it robs thee of thy
due: I am thine ſave me.</p>
            <p>2. By vertue of this Union, there is a diffuſion and
ſhedding forth of the ſtrength of Chriſt into the ſoul:
ſtrengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man,
<hi>Epheſ, 3. 16. Believers as they have the mighty
hand of Chriſt over them, ſo they have the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Spirit of Chriſt in them, whereby they wax</hi>
ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, be ware of excuſing your falls, by
pleading want of ſtrength, as ſometimes ſome do;
<hi>I could not help it,</hi> I am not able to ſtand in the
day of temptation; the cares of this life are too
hard for me, either to bear, or to deliver my
ſelf from: there's no man knows what a load they
are to me, how they run upon me like a flood,
which I am no way able to withſtand. I [cannot]
keep my heart free, I cannot mind my God and
my Soul, as I would and deſire to do; one buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or other, one care, one trouble or other is
ſtill upon me, dividing, diſtracting me ſo, that
I cannot do as I would; 'tis no comfort to me
to live at the rate I do, but I can do no more
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:153788:37"/>
then I can, I cannot help it.</p>
            <p>Others, it may be, will make the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
concerning the pleaſures of this life; I
know a ſevere and ſelf denying life would be much
more comfortable to me, if I could bring my
heart to it; I am troubled at my ſelf, and angry
with my ſelf, that I am ſo often led aſide to fleſhly
liberty; I find miſchief enough and ſorrow enough
afterwards, that my vain mirth and my vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
bring upon me; I have many a ſad night
after my merry dayes; but yet there is ſuch an
unhappy proneſs of my nature and diſpoſition, to
ſuch a life, that when ever I have temptations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, I have no power to forbear. It hath coſt
me ſomething, I have pray'd and hop'd for more
ſeriouſneſs and circumſpection, but ſtill I am over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and how to help it I cannot tell.</p>
            <p>But art thou a Chriſtian? where is thy Faith
man? haſt thou Faith, and no Chriſt? haſt thou
Chriſt and no ſtrength? Is the world too hard
for Chriſt? Is the fleſh to ſtrong for the ſpirit? haſt
thou the ſpirit of the living God in thee, and yet
canſt thou ſay, I can't help it to be thus earthly
and thus fleſhly? Miſtake not thy ſelf; thou haſt
reaſon to fear leſt thy [cannot help it] be a [will
not help it] or a [care not to help it] thou art too
willing of this carking caring life; thou art too
willing of this vain and looſer life; and it may be
art glad thou haſt ſo much to ſay as [I cannot help
it] thou art inexcuſable O man, who pleadeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability,
when all the power of Chriſt is before
thee, and he hath ſaid to thee <hi>[if thou believeſt thou
ma<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IIII. <hi>The conflict of Faith with the tempting world:</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:153788:37"/>
or the wayes and means by which faith over comes
the world. Theſe are,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It gives a right Judgment of the world:</hi> It diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
its true valew, what the world is worth.
<hi>By faith we underſtand, Heb.</hi> 11. 3. as <hi>whence</hi> the
world was, we underſtand its <hi>original;</hi> ſo <hi>what</hi>
the world is, we underſtand its <hi>worth and its power;</hi>
what it can do for us or againſt us; what help there
is in it, and what hurt it can do us: and we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
its <hi>end</hi> too, of what durance it is, as well as
its <hi>beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faith takes its eſtimate of the world from the
<hi>word,</hi> and gives its judgment of it according to
the Scriptures. The word ſpeaks of every thing
as it is; of God as he is, of Sin as it is, of the
preſent World as it is, and of the world to come,
as it is: what the word ſpeaks, God ſpeaks, and
whatever Faith ſpeaks, it hath it from the word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What a poor and contemptible thing doth the
Word make the World?</hi> a figure, a ſhadow, an
image, a dream, vanity, a lye, things that are not, of no
conſiſtency, or endurance.</p>
            <p>When the word ſpeaks of the world to come,
how highly doth it ſpeak? what a wonderful and
glorious report doth it make, of the promiſed
land, and the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that ſtate of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
prepared for the Saints? <hi>a Kingdom, a Crown,
an eternal weight of glory, an inheritance incorruptible
underfiled that fades not away. Riches reſt joy pleaſures,
ſuch as neither tongus can expreſs, nor hearts conceive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And how dreadfully doth it ſpeak concerning
the miſeries of the other world!</hi> A priſon a place of
darkneſs, a bottomleſs pitt, a lake of fire where is weeping
and howling and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:153788:38"/>
Faith ſeals to the Judgment of the Scriptures,
<hi>Joh, 3. 33. He that believeth hath ſet to his ſeal that
God is true:</hi> when the word ſpeaks moſt highly of
things to come, Faith ſaith it is even as it hath
been told me of the Lord; and it cannot ſpeak ſo
contemptibly of things preſent, but Faith will
believe its report.</p>
            <p>Unbelievers will not be perſwaded that the
world is ſo poor a thing as it is, <hi>Hoſ. 12. 7. He is
a merchant, the ballances of deceit are in his hand:</hi> the
unbeliever will not weigh things in the ballance
of the ſanctuary, but in his own deceitful ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Ballances may be ſaid to be ballances of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
in a double ſenſe. There are ballances where
by men <hi>deceive others,</hi> as thoſe falſe ballances,
which unrighteous men uſe for their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
to buy or ſell by; which may be thoſe there
meant; and there are falſe ballances, whereby
men <hi>deceive themſelves.</hi> Ungodly men as they
weigh their commodities they ſell, in falſe bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances,
thereby to deceive others; ſo they weigh
their gains that they get to themſelves, in falſe
ballances, and thereby deceive themſelves: their
bargains that they make, they could never count
them ſuch good bargains, unleſs they weighed them
on their deceitful ballances. If ſenſe may be
Judge, the world is a good bargain when deareſt
bought; though if faith may be Judge, when the
world may be had cheapeſt, it is not over ſafe
dealing for it.</p>
            <p>Now when the worth of the world is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
the Divels market is ſpoiled. No man
will care to deal with ſuch a pedlar, whileſt
the Merchant ſtands by: who will ſell his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:153788:38"/>
for counters, or his patrimony for dirt and
dung? who will ſpend his money for that which
he knows is not bread, or his labour for that which
profiteth not? the ſtrength of the temptation is
broken, when once we underſtand of how little
valew the things are, we are tempted by.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, ſtudy the world more; ſearch the
Scriptures, and what theſe teſtifie of it, believe
the Scriptures, which have written upon all under
the Sun, <hi>Vanity and vexation of ſpirit;</hi> underſtand
what an inſignificant cypher this figure of the
world is. Believe your own words; you can ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſpeak contemptibly of the world your ſelves.
Who of you will not ſay, <hi>this world is but a ſhadow,
and the faſhion of it paſſeth away?</hi> do ye think as you
ſpeak? do not diſſemble; either ſpeak your minds
plainly, that this earth is your ſubſtance, your
treaſure, your portion, and that its worth the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
your Souls for it; or if you go on to ſay,
this is not your reſt, you have here no continuing
City, ther's no building on this ſand, here's no
contentment nor continuance here, if ye go on to
ſpeak thus, believe your own words, and then Judg
how wiſely you deal for your ſelves, in venturing
your eternity for ſuch empty periſhing things.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>By Faith the ſoul pitches upon an eternal inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</hi>
Its <hi>our chooſing the good part,</hi> Luke 10. 42.
<hi>our laying hold on eternal life. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 12. thoſe
believers <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 14. are ſaid to <hi>ſeek a countrey;</hi>
they were not mindful of this, they confeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and were content to be <hi>ſtrangers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims</hi>
here, their countrey was on the other ſide
<hi>Jordan,</hi> and thither they ſent their hearts.</p>
            <p>Faith <hi>deſcries</hi> a better countrey; it ſees into the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:153788:39"/>
inviſible world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11, 27. its the <hi>good ſpy</hi> that's
ſent out to ſearch the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to be a good land, there the Soul pitches.
It ſaies unto the Lord, <hi>thou art my God,</hi> thou art my
portion for ever: this is my reſt, here will I
dwell. If I can bear through this weary land, and
at laſt enter into that reſt; however matters go
with me here, I am not careful about that, if I
can but attain to the reſurrection of the dead, if I
can but get to Heaven, thats all my deſire and
deſign.</p>
            <p>Meet a believer where you will, and ask him,
whether art thou bound? Oh for the Holy Land:
whom ſeekeſt thou thou? Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth:</hi> what
runneſt thou for? what waiteſt thou for? The
incorruptible Crown.</p>
            <p>Ask him again, will nothing leſs content thee?
Look about through all the earth, canſt thou find
nothing worthy thy love? what is ſilver and gold,
and houſes, and lands, and honours, and pleaſures,
are theſe nothing with thee? may not theſe ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
thee? No no, theſe are not God, this is not
Heaven; there's no reſt here for the ſole of my
foot; my houſe, and my home is above, my hope,
and my treaſure is above, and my Soul is above,
and cannot be content to dwell in the duſt.</p>
            <p>Ask him yet again, But how wilt thou get into
that good Land? there are difficulties and dangers
in the way; thou haſt a wilderneſs to go through,
a red Sea, and a <hi>Jordan</hi> to paſs over; there are Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in thy way, there are Giants in thy way; thou
mayeſt be a prey to thine enemies, torn in pieces
of wild Beaſts, or ſwallowed up in the waters, or
at leaſt thou mayſt wander in the wilderneſs, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:153788:39"/>
looſe thy way, and never come into thy reſt at
laſt.</p>
            <p>Well, but however, I [muſt] venture, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
for heaven, how difficult or dangerous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the way may prove: I'le venture all here;
<hi>Heaven or nothing, Chriſt or nothing.</hi> Henceforth
let no man trouble me with other buſineſs, for I
bear in my heart the prints of the Lord Jeſus, he
is gotten within me, he is engraven upon my
breaſt, and on my ſoul, and this heart can never
be at reſt till I be with him where he is: <hi>Lord be
thou my God, and bring me into thine holy habitation;
lift up the light of thy countenance upon me, and ſhew me
thy ſalvation; this one thing I deſire, let this be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, and then my heart ſhall be glad, and my glory
ſhall rejoyce, my fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in hope. I have
enough; thou wilt ſhew me the path of life; In thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
is fulneſs of joy, and at thy right hand are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now world, where art thou, with all thy
glory? this earth is trodden to dirt, when the
heart is once in earneſt for heaven.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, come pitch your Tents here; where
will you that your lot ſhall fall? you have two
worlds before you, which will you chuſe? hang
not betwixt both. Will you get up to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
or will you dwell in this Plain? Come to a
reſolution; you will never get clear of this world,
till you climb up to the other.</p>
            <p>'Tis only the milk and honey of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that
will wean your ſouls from the Onions and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The flowers of the field will be
beautiful, till you ſee the Roſes of the Garden.
The fatneſs of the earth will be your delight, till
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:153788:40"/>
you underſtand the ſweetneſs of heaven: you'l
never be content to looſe from this ſhore, till
you ſee the banks of a better Land: you will not
part with your preſent purchaſes, till you ſee
where you may have a better bargain.</p>
            <p>Its to no purpoſe to think to get off your hearts
by common arguments; <hi>This world is vain, this
world is troubleſome, uncertain, fading, a barren Land;</hi>
if that be all you can ſay, 'twill never do; your
hearts will anſwer, A barren Land is better than
none, an houſe of Clay is better then no habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
If my ſoul may not dwell here, where ſhall
I be better?</p>
            <p>Where mayſt thou be better? Come and ſee;
lift up your eyes to the hills; look you towards
<hi>Sion,</hi> the City of the great King; mark all her
Bulwarks, tell all her Towers, behold her Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations;
Is it not a ſtrong City? walk through
the midſt of her, behold the Tree of Life, bearing
all manner of fruits, of which whoſoever eats
ſhall live forever. Behold the River, thoſe ſtreams
of everlaſting pleaſures, that run through the City
of God; of which whoſoever drinks, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
die. Behold the Palms, and the Robes, and
the Crowns, the reſt, the joy, and the glory of the
Inhabitants of this City; God is in the midſt of
her; the all-bleſſed, all-glorious, all-ſufficient
God, he is their light and their life; there ſhall
be no Clouds, nor ſtorms, no night nor darkneſs,
no wants nor fears, no ſorrow nor complaining
in her ſtreet; everlaſting joy ſhall be upon their
heads, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away.
Look towards this holy City; live in the view and
contemplation of the glory to come; and then
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:153788:40"/>
look down, and ſee what a dark Miſt will becloud
the worlds moſt glorious Sun-ſhine.</p>
            <p>And then demand; Now ſoul, which wilt thou
chuſe? where wilt thou pitch? both Lands are
before thee, which ſhall be thine Inheritance? art
thou for God or the world? for heaven or earth?</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay? I wot not what I ſhall chuſe?
why is the choice ſo hard? Is it ſuch a difficulty to
determine whether light or darkneſs, joy or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
life or death, be the better choice?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Well,</hi> jacta eſt alea; <hi>the lot is caſt; God ſhall
be my portion, and the lot of mine inheritance.</hi>
O my God, wilt thou be mine? ſhall my dwelling be
with thee? The matter is ended; the lines are fallen
to me in a pleaſant place, and I have a goodly Heritage.
Remember me, O Lord, with the favour thou beareſt to
thy children, and viſit me with thy ſalvation; let me ſee
the good of thy choſen, let me rejoyce in the gladneſs of
thy Nation, let me glory with thine Inheritance, and I
have no more to ask.</p>
            <p>Brethren, when once you have by Faith made
this choice, there's an end of the Devils hopes.
Look up therefore, look up to that bleſſed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
cry unto God, Lord open mine eyes, and let
me ſee, Lord reach down thine hand and help me
up, take up this heart to thee, and there let it fix.
Oh what clods of earth, what dead lumps of fleſh
are theſe hearts, that do not yet begin to riſe;
Lord let this fleſh become Spirit, let our aſhes
flame and aſcend to thee; once for all, let us
come to thee, and never return to this duſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>By Faith we underſtand that the good things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
cannot further, and the evil things preſent cannot
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:153788:41"/>
hinder our eternal happineſs:</hi> We are apt either to
be pleas'd or diſtaſted, with the various objects
and occurrences we meet withall, according as
they ſerve or croſs <hi>our end.</hi> He that hath made
God his end, and Eternal Glory his end, doth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
all things according to their tendency thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
as any thing hinders or helps heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
ſo is it regarded: 'Tis a ſign thou haſt made
thy fleſh thy end, when fleſh-pleaſing objects and
courſes are the taking things with thee, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing is a croſs that touches upon thy fleſhly
intereſt: what is a furtherance to thy ſoul, thou
canſt want it; what is an hindrance to thy ſoul,
thou canſt bear it, and find no trouble; but what
ſerves or diſſerves thy fleſh, theſe are the things
that move thee: Let ſuch ſouls never talk of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
God their end. If God be your end indeed,
if you be for heaven in earneſt, 'tis what will
pleaſe God, and what leads heavenwards that are
the only conſiderable things.</p>
            <p>Now by Faith we underſtand that the things of
the world, <hi>in themſelves,</hi> make neither one way nor
other as to our future happineſs: <hi>The good things
of the world cannot further our happineſs;</hi> there's no
man the nearer heaven for being rich or honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
the Palaces of Princes are not the porch to
glory: Believe it Chriſtians, to be rich in this
world, and to be rich towards God, are two
things; the favour of Princes is no <hi>mark</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
honour, nor <hi>medium</hi> to it; the pleaſures of
the fleſh are not of kin to the pleaſures above, nor
ſubſervient to them. Theſe things may undo us,
our gold may ſink us, we may break our necks
from our high mountains; our temporal proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:153788:41"/>
and advantages may ſhut us out from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
Kingdom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. may be the death
and damnation of ſouls, (and do they not often
prove ſo) but never their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>And ſo on the other ſide, <hi>The troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this world cannot hinder or happineſs.</hi> Faith
ſees as open and near a way to heaven, from the
dunghill, as from the Pinacle of the Temple;
from the Priſon, as from the Palace; from the
Croſs, as from the Crown: The gate of heaven
ſhall never be ſhut againſt any, becauſe he is poor
or perſecuted; 'tis not a Purple Robe, or a Gold
Ring, that ſhall procure entrance, nor are they
rags, or ſores, or reproaches that ſhall ſhut the
door. We read <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 2, 3. that there was ſuch a
practiſe among men; <hi>If any one come into</hi> [your] <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
with a gold ring, or goodly apparel,</hi> or in a
poor habit and vile rayment, they were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
thereafter; they had their different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
according to the pomp of the one, or the
poverty of the other; But 'will not be ſo in the
great Aſſembly above.</p>
            <p>'Twill never be demanded, when you knock
for entrance into glory, what Eſtate have you got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the world? in what honor and grandieur
did you live? where are your Bags and your
Barns, your Manſions and Mannors, that you
have gotten? Will the Lord, think you, ever ſay
to him that comes and knocks, and calls, Lord,
Lord, open to me; will he ever ſay, No friend,
you are a poor man; here's no place for you? you
were ſo greedy after grace and holineſs, that you
never minded the getting an eſtate in the world;
you have waſted your time in reading, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:153788:42"/>
and faſting; you have waſted your Eſtate, in
giving and lending, in feeding and cloathing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
you are a poor man, away from me, here's
no place for thee; will the Lord ever ſay thus at
laſt?</p>
            <p>Men covet, and labour, and hoard up theſe
earthly things, as if this were the condition of
everlaſting bleſſedneſs, as if their ſouls and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
life lay on them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men ſhift and ſhun af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
as if theſe were the way to the Pit: But
Faith ſees, that theſe things will not be ſo: No
man ſhall be diſowned becauſe he <hi>bears in his body
the marks of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Well may the Croſs be
a Ladder by which we may aſcend into glory, but
it ſhall never be a clog to detain us from aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being by Faith underſtood, the
world looſes a believers heart; the good below
he can ſpare, and the evil below he will not fear.</p>
            <p>There's the ſame ground why believers ſit ſo
looſe from the world, and the things thereof, as
there is, why unbelievers ſit ſo looſe from God,
and the things of God.</p>
            <p>Carnal men can want the preſence and favour
of God; can ſpare Religion, and the duties and
comforts thereof, and never find any miſs of
them; why ſo? why, becauſe theſe things do not
at all ſerve their deſign; they can be as rich, and
as great, and as merry, without minding God, or
holineſs, or any ſuch thing. And upon a like
ground, a Believer can want his eaſe, or his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
or any of his outward comforts; why ſo?
why, becauſe theſe if he had them, would as little
ſerve his deſign, as Religion will the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:153788:42"/>
Hearken to me, ſaith Satan, and whatever the
world doth afford ſhall be thine: Why, will this
world ſtand me inſtead in reference to the world
to come? Can my ſoul feed upon this earth and
aſhes? Shall I be ever the better man for being a
rich man? Will theſe earthly things commend
me to God? Is he a reſpecter of the rich above
the poor, of the honorable above the deſpiſed?
Is this following after riches or pleaſures thou
perſwadeſt me to, Is this my way to life? Avoid
Satan, thou comeſt but to mock me, and beguile
me.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>By Faith we underſtand, that the deſign of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
is to deprive us of our Inheritance.</hi> A Believer
knows, that the Devil owes him no good will,
how fair ſoever he treats him; he ſees that all his
promiſes are cheats, that all his gifts are bribes,
to corrupt us firſt, and then to deſtroy us: he
marks him for his mortal Enemy, whoſe drift is
to keep him out of the Paradiſe of God: he hath
learn'd from the Scriptures, who 'twas that at firſt
thruſt him out thence. This Serpent was he, <hi>Gen.</hi>
3. and now he has him out, that his work is to
keep him from ever recovering in. And he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
how his particular temptations do ſerve
his general deſign, to deſtroy ſouls: whatever the
voice is, this is the meaning of every temptation,
Thou ſhalt never ſee God, thou ſhalt never get to
heaven, if I can help it.</p>
            <p>Faith underſtands what uſe the Devil [hath]
made of the world; whither did the rich mans
Purple, and fine linnen, and delicious fare lead
him? <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 19. 23. If you had ſeen him in the
ſtate he was in, <hi>v.</hi> 19. in his gorgeous apparrel,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:153788:43"/>
at his voluptuous Table, what carnal heart but
would have bleſs'd him? O this is an happy man!
but where do you find him <hi>v.</hi> 23. Oh how ſadly
is the Scene changed; Behold this brave Gallant
in hell torments. A Believer would have ſeen him
in hell in his firſt view; whilſt in the midſt of all
his Gallantry and Gluttony.</p>
            <p>Pſa. 73. 17. <hi>When I went into the Sanctuary, I ſaw
the end of theſe men.</hi> How was it with them when he
ſaw their end? where were they? why in the midſt
of all their proſperity, in the heighth of their
pride, in the heat of their luſt, in the heaps of their
wealth; fat and flouriſhing, as full of mirth and
jollity as their hearts could wiſh, and out of all
fear of a fall; even then he ſees their end, in their
very noon-tide he eſpied their night: <hi>Where ſhall
we have you a few hours hence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what end was it he ſaw theſe men would
come to? v. 18. <hi>Thou h<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt ſet them in ſlippery places,
thou caſteſt them down to deſtruction; how are they
brought to deſolation in a moment?</hi> that's the end he
ſaw was haſtening upon them, Deſolation and
Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But how came he ſo ſoon to ſee their end? <hi>I
went into the Sanctuary,</hi> there I underſtood their
end. When I conſulted with God about it, when
I left conſulting with Senſe, and conſulted with
Faith about it, then I underſtood, how matters
were like to go with them.</p>
            <p>Believers, while they conſult with fleſh and
bloud, are to apt to be envious at the fooliſh, to
fret themſelves at the ungodly, whoſe way doth
proſper, and to call the proud happy: yea and to
murmure and think hardly of the Lord, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:153788:43"/>
his enemies to eat up the fat and drink the
ſweet, and feeds his people with hunger and thirſt.
<hi>I was envious at the fooliſh, when I ſaw the proſperity of
the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when they come to underſtand themſelves,
what the meaning of all this plenty and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the ungodly is, and where it layes them at
laſt, no more envy then; much good may doe
them with all their glory and greatneſs; by that the
fruit of all their doings comes up, they'le pay for
all their pleaſure dearly enough.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, do ye ſee the proud inſulting op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
ruffling world? do you ſee the vile of the
earth ſcrambling for wealth, climbing up to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
dividing the ſpoils and ſharing among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the preferments and pleaſures of the world?
beware you envy them not. Look a little farther,
and you will ſee no matter of envy but of pity and
praiſe. Pity over them, who are but fatting for
the ſlaughter; and praiſe on the behalf of your
ſelves, that you Souls are not gathered with
them. But this by the way.</p>
            <p>Faith underſtands from thoſe many inſtances it
finds in Scripture what uſe the Divel hath made of
the world; what miſchiefs and ruines he hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
brought on Souls; and when this is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
then ſure its bewitching face notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all its paint, will not look ſo beautiful and
amiable.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Faith makes experimental and fuller diſcoveries of
the glory of that inheritance the Soul hath pitchd upon.</hi>
As I ſaid before, there's no way poſſible to divide
the heart from this world, till you can ſhew it a
better: thats the voice of every heart, which is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:153788:44"/>
ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. to be the voice of the worldlings
heart, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> and whatſoever
it finds and apprehends to be good, that it graſpes,
and will hold till an higher good come in ſight.</p>
            <p>This world is apprehended to be the worldlings
good; and tis the beſt he knows; and he muſt be
bought out of it, ere he will let it go; he muſt be
bought out of his houſe, bought out of his livings
and pleaſures, by ſomething that is, or is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
to be a valuable price at leaſt, ere he will
quit what he has. Its vain to perſwade the rich to
voluntary poverty, unleſs you can preſent him
with a reward that will compenſate his loſs. All
the arguments in the world, from the unſufficiency,
inſtability, vanity, vexation in theſe earthly things,
will be eaſily anſwered. But where ſhall I have
better? better half a loaf then no bread, a ſhort
meal is better then ſtarving the heart will not let
go this world but upon the diſcovery of a better.</p>
            <p>And according to the degree of the manifeſtation
of thoſe better things above, ſo will there be more
or leſs an abatement of our affection to things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
A little light from Heaven will make the
world look dimme; and as the Sun riſes higher,
all our ſtars creep into darkneſs: at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of God upon the Soul, the world <hi>looſes the
place,</hi> as was ſaid before; and its thruſt lower and
and lower ſtill as God riſes higher, till at length it
be brought quite underfoot.</p>
            <p>Its impoſſible that God and the world ſhould be
intenſely lov'd together: that both ſhould be our
God, our end, and chiefeſt good, is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
Its irrational for any to conclude that they
have any great reſpect for God, who are ſtrongly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:153788:44"/>
affected to the world. Many profeſſours of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
may be convinc'd, that their religion is vain,
by this, that to what ever height it ſeems to be
rais'd its ſtill overtop'd by their earthly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
1 <hi>Joh. 2. 15. If any man love the world</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſely,
chiefly) <hi>the love of the Father is not in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never talk of Chriſtianity till you ceaſe to be
worldings, and never look to be leſſe worldlings,
till you underſtand better what Heaven is.</p>
            <p>Faith in its firſt entrance into the Soul brings
this tidings, that <hi>God is better then the world;</hi> and
according as it grows higher ſo is its teſtimony to
this truth, more clear and full. As the Apoſtle
ſaith concerning the <hi>righteouſneſs of God, Rom.</hi> 1. 17.
ſo is it true of his <hi>Goodneſs, kindneſs, mercy, alſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency;</hi>
the goodneſs and kindneſs of God is <hi>revealed
from faith to faith:</hi> that is, according as faith grows,
ſo is God and all the excellencies of his glorious
name more known. Every cubit added to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of our faith, is a new beam of light ſprung
forth from the face of God: and God known is
Heaven known; our bleſſedneſs, our inheritance
known; God is our inheritance.</p>
            <p>Faith, as was ſaid before is the <hi>good Spie</hi> Num.
13. ſent forth to view the land of promiſe. The
two Generals, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Sathan,</hi> have each of them
their <hi>Spie,</hi> which they ſend forth. Chriſts Spie is
<hi>Faith,</hi> the Devils Spie is <hi>Senſe.</hi> The Devil will be
ſending forth his Spie; Senſe muſt go and view
the inheritance of the Saints. But this being ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted,
and not able to travail far, muſt take up
all its tidings upon <hi>heareſay;</hi> and finding no good
report amongſt all its acquaintance, (ſenſual men
will never ſpeak well of the things of God) it
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:153788:45"/>
hereupon returns with an evil report; Its a dark
land, and a dry and barren land; there's nothing
of all that thou loveſt to be found in it, and it is
uncertain whether there be any ſuch land or no:
everlaſting joy and reſt are repreſented as fancies
and conceits, to carnal hearts. Its better here,
here are houſes and lands and pleaſures, we know
there are, we ſee there are, but what there is in
the other world, is altogether dark and uncertain
to us.</p>
            <p>Beloved, hath your ſenſe never dealt thus by
you? what apprehenſions have you of the glory to
come? have not your blind ſenſes diſparag'd and
diſgrac'd the things of the Kingdome of God to
you. You take every thing to be as ſenſe Judgeth
it; and what is the Judgment of ſenſe, of theſe
glorious things? It ſpeaks highly of things tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral;
this world is good, a land flowing with
milk and honey; But what ſaies it concerning
things eternal? Are none of you the men and
women, whoſe carnal hearts have told you, and
you have believed them, that tis uncertain whether
there be an Heaven or no; or if there be, yet the
happineſs of it is ſo much unknown, that if you
might, it would be more to your content, to live
your eternity among theſe ſheep and oxen, in theſe
gardens and orchards, in the poſſeſſion of your
earthly delights and pleaſures, then ever to be
carried hence to that unknown world?</p>
            <p>Your opinions of theſe higher things, we may
gueſs at, by the care you take about them.</p>
            <p>What care is there taken about the things of
God? what is there a doing, in your houſes, in
your cloſets or any where about theſe matters?
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:153788:45"/>
Have you taken up any deſign for Heaven? are you
taking any effectual courſe for eternal bleſſedneſs?
Are you as hearty and ſerious in ſeeking God as
in ſeeking this world? whileſt your hearts are ſo
hot and ſo zealous and buſy, in purſuing things
temporal, is it not, upon the matter, indifferent
to you whether you do any thing or no, or how you
do it, in ſeeking the Kingdome of God? do you
pray and labour and watch for your Souls, with as
good a will as ever you did work for your living?
do you hunger and thirſt after the knowledge and
grace of God, after a part in Chriſt, after the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of your ſins, as ever you do after your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
food?</p>
            <p>What enquiries do you make? <hi>How is it with
me? what evidences have I for Heaven? have I any
right to the tree of life? Is there no fear I may fall ſhort
of the reſt, and be ſhut out of the Kingdom of God? how
may I know whether Chriſt be mine or no?</hi> Conſider
are there any ſuch enquiries? no no, your ſenſe hath
ſo much diſparag'd things to come, that they are
to you, even as if they were hardly worth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
after.</p>
            <p>But now Faith is the <hi>good Spie,</hi> that makes a good
report of that Holy Land: it makes more diligent
ſearch after the riches of it, and finds out its hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
treaſures, and then ſpeaks as it finds: faith
hath a glaſs, wherein it can behold, and whereby
it doth reveal to the Soul, the glory of God. <hi>The
goſpel</hi> is its glaſs, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18. the promiſes</hi> are its
glaſs, thoſe <hi>great and precious promiſes, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. The
promiſes are the <hi>deeds and conveyances</hi> by which this
inheritance is made over. Now as among men,
in <hi>their Deeds.</hi> there is a recital of all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:153788:46"/>
made over by them: The houſes, the lands,
the gardens, the orchards, the rivers, the royalties
and all the immunities belonging thereto; ſo is
it here, the promiſes are <hi>a Map or Survey of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
and Faith is often looking into theſe deeds,
reading over the writings, and thence underſtands
what a glorious purchaſe it hath.</p>
            <p>Nay more, Faith brings down ſome of the fruits
of this good land; this good Spie comes in loaden
with <hi>ſome cluſters from Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A believer that walks with God, God lets fall to
him now and then ſome handfuls of that harveſt,
ſome drops of that vintage, which is ripening for
him above: what are thoſe beams of divine light,
that ſenſe of divine love, thoſe intimations of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
acceptance, thoſe communications of the
divine image, in the increaſes of holineſs and
righteouſneſs, that joy of faith, and peace in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
what are theſe, but a <hi>Specimen of Heaven,</hi>
the firſt fruits of glory?</p>
            <p>By Faith the Kingdom of Heaven is within us:
there's God within us, and Chriſt within us, and
glory within us. Thoſe believers that live in the
power of Faith and holineſs, need not travail far in
ſearch for Heaven, tis but looking inward &amp; there
they may find it; <hi>ſay not who ſhall aſcend,</hi> in ſearch
for Heaven, <hi>tis in thine heart.</hi> Sinners need not
go down to the deep, to ſearch for Hell, there's an
Hell within them? <hi>The filth and ſtench of Hell,</hi> in their
vile affections; <hi>the ſmoke and flames of Hell,</hi> in their
reeking and burning luſts; <hi>the darkneſs of Hell,</hi> in
their darkned and blinded minds; and ſometimes
<hi>the torments of Hell,</hi> in the anguiſh of their guilty
and ſelf revenging conſciences. And as ſinners
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:153788:46"/>
may find an hell, ſo believers an heaven in the
heart; an heaven of light, an heaven of love,
and joy, and praiſe: Thus it is with ſome, and
thus it might be with all, were we ſtronger in
Faith.</p>
            <p>Oh what do we loſe by living thus by Senſe,
when we migh<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> live by Faith! how have our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
hearts, by conſuming and ſpinning out our
daies in ſloth and idleneſs, ſticking at the labour
of duty, whining under difficulties, ſhrinking
from ſufferings, indulging to our eaſe, and our
pleaſure, and liberties; how have our carnal
hearts robb'd us of the life of God, the pleaſures
of Angels, the joys of the Upper Region, and
left us little more of Chriſtianity, then its wounds
and bruiſes, its mournings and complainings, its
ſighs and ſorrows! Oh fooliſh hearts, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
ſo unwiſely for our ſelves; that chooſe rather
to live in Brakes, among theſe bryars and thorns,
then among the Beds of Spices; that will rather
laze it in a Wilderneſs, then get us up to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of the Lord:</p>
            <p>The life of Faith is an heavenly life. <hi>The life of
God, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18. though Faith ſhall never come
into heaven, it ſelf, yet thither it tranſlates our
hearts. It came down from heaven; <hi>it is the gift of
God;</hi> and though it muſt not return thither ('tis
love not Faith that ſhall dwell before the Throne
of God) yet thither it raiſes thoſe hearts in which
it lives.</p>
            <p>Though it may not dwell there hereafter (Faith
ſhall then be loſt in ſight) yet now its travelling
thither, going and returning every day and hour.</p>
            <p>Phil. 3. 20. <hi>Our converſation is in heaven;</hi> there's
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:153788:47"/>
all our <hi>buſineſs:</hi> where ſhould a Chriſtian be?
where does he live, but where his buſineſs lies?
A Believer that had heretofore ſo many things to
do, dividing his heart and time, hath now caſt all
his buſineſs into one, hath brought all his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
near his home; he hath nothing to do abroad
in the Tents of wickedneſs, in the Camps of the
Uncircumciſed; he hath done with ſerving fleſh
and luſts, and times, and tables, and carkaſſes;
here his whole work did lye, but no more of
theſe now, they muſt be all laid aſide, or at leaſt
made to come and ſerve with him in his higher
buſineſs: God and glory, the loving, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and ſerving, and ſecuring God to his ſoul, is
all he hath to do, Phil. 3. 13. <hi>This one thing I do,
forgetting that which is behind, and reaching forth to
that which is before: I preſs to the mark, for the prize
of the high calling of God, in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
Theſe lower things, his outward priviledges,
hopes and advantages, were once the things <hi>before
him;</hi> but he's now gotten beyond, and hath left
them all behind him; not only his Jewiſh privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
whereof he had boaſted, but much more
all earthly things; he hath caſt off theſe weights,
and is now flying upon the wing of Faith, aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in flames of love, winding up his ſoul by
conſtant labour, above this dung and darkneſs, to
the Regions of light and glory: This is his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>And hence is his bleſſedneſs; heaven is his
work and his meat, his labour and his hire; he
will know nothing for a bleſſing, or a comfort, but
what his Faith brings him down from above.</p>
            <p>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul? why art thou ſo
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:153788:47"/>
diſquieted within me? <hi>Bid him,</hi> Hope in God; <hi>tell
him,</hi> thou ſhalt yet praiſe him, who is the light of thy
countenance, and thy God; <hi>and this will comfort
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Say to him while you will, <hi>Man be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
the fig-tree bloſſoms, the labour of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
will not fail; there is fruit in the Vines, there
are Flocks in the Folds, there are Herds in the
Stalls, comfort thine heart, what wouldſt thou
have more? And how little will this eaſe him?</p>
            <p>Oh where is my God? how is it with my ſoul?
<hi>what tidings from above?</hi> have I a treaſure there?
doth God ſmile? <hi>what tidings from within?</hi> Is it
peace there? doth my ſoul proſper? Is there
grace there? is truth in my inward parts? this is
good news; Come in thou bleſſed of the Lord,
thou comeſt with good tidings; this ſhall comfort
me.</p>
            <p>This is the life of Faith; a converſation in
heaven: Thus we ſhould, and thus we might live
more then we do; but I doubt I have been here in
telling you a Myſtery, whereof the moſt of us
have but little experimental underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, what acquaintance have you with
this life of God? Is this your buſineſs, heavenly
work? are theſe your comforts, heavenly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports?
we are yet carnal, and walk as men: Oh
this earth, earth, how doth it hang on our ſpirits;
we live as if there were a middle Region be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
heaven and earth; a middle ſtate betwixt
Faith and unbelief: Some little we have attain'd
of this heavenly life, and bleſſed be the Lord for
any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but oh how little is it?</p>
            <p>Friends, wonder not that you ſee no more of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:153788:48"/>
the Divine Glory, conclude not that there is no
more to be ſeen; put it to the proof, live more
with God, more purely, more cloſely, more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
with him; live in the daily exerciſe of
Faith, and you will get the ſight of other manner
of glorious things then can be told you.</p>
            <p>What's the reaſon that unbelievers are ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the dark, and can ſee nothing of God, no
more then they can deſpiſe and laugh to ſcorn?
O 'tis becauſe they come not near where God is;
they are alienated from the life of God; their
whole buſineſs is in the heart of the earth; here
they dwell, and here is their whole converſe.</p>
            <p>Speak ye unbelievers, where dwell ye? what is
your Occupation? where is your Converſation?
far enough from heaven ſure, where ever it be.</p>
            <p>Speak ye <hi>proud and haughty ones,</hi> where is your
Converſation? our Converſation is in the <hi>air,</hi> we
feed on wind, live upon breath; honor and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
is all we work for, and live upon.</p>
            <p>Speak ye <hi>Covetous,</hi> where is your Converſation?
our Converſation is in <hi>the earth;</hi> we feed upon
duſt and aſhes, and in theſe our buſineſs lies.</p>
            <p>Speak ye <hi>contentious</hi> quarrelſome ones, where is
your Converſation? our Converſation is in the
<hi>fire;</hi> in ſtorms and tempeſts.</p>
            <p>Speak ye <hi>voluptuous Senſualiſts,</hi> where is your
Converſation? our Converſation is in the <hi>mud
and mire,</hi> in laſciviouſneſs, wantonneſs, and all
manner of filthy luſts.</p>
            <p>Speak ye <hi>Ranters, Ruffians,</hi> Swearers, Curſers,
Blaſphemers, where is your Converſation? our
Converſation is <hi>in Hell,</hi> in the Alehouſe, the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
the Brothel-houſe; we live where Satans
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:153788:48"/>
Throne is, in the very Suburbs of Hell.</p>
            <p>Oh what a difference hath Faith put betwixt
Believers and all others in the world! whilſt they
only live the life of God, all others live the life
of Bruits or Devils.</p>
            <p>Oh bleſs God for Faith; even ye of little
Faith: at its firſt entrance it gives your ſoul a lift
from heaven to earth. There it liſts your names,
no longer <hi>men of this world,</hi> but henceforth, <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God;</hi> there
it hath laid you up an Inheritance, and thence it
brings you your maintenance: thither it turns
your eyes and all your ſtreams; it ſhews you
what you have there, and by thoſe beams it draws
you up thither. Thoſe to whom it ſhews the leaſt
of that glory, it ſhews enough to diſgrace the
glory of the world; and as this Sun-light grows,
ſo doth all the beauty of the world fade, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
out of ſight.</p>
            <p>By Faith our converſation is in heaven. Now by
how much the more our converſation is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
by ſo much the more our hearts are there; by
how much the more our hearts are in heaven, by ſo
much the leſs on earth; and when once the world
hath loſt our love, it hath loſt its power over us.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>By how much the more our converſation is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
by ſo much the more our hearts and affections are
there;</hi> we ordinarily love to be where we uſe to
be. No ſuch damp grows upon affection, as by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and eſtrangement: when we looſe our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
we looſe our delight in God. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
thy ſelf with him, and be at peace, Joh</hi> 22. 21.
Acquaint thy ſelf with him, and be in love; there
wants nothing to fix our affections on heaven,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:153788:49"/>
but being better acquainted there. Intimacy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
dearneſs.</p>
            <p>Do you not love God? tis a ſign you have had
little to do with him. Is not your delight in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
tis a ſign you are ſeldome there. Is prayer
and holy meditation and exerciſing your ſelves in
the Scriptures and attendance on ordinances, a
wearineſs and altogether unpleaſant to you? ſure
you have little known what the ſpirit of Prayer
and Communion with God in his word and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
mean: thoſe whoſe Souls dwell by the
wells of ſalvation, and often let down the bucket,
do taſte that the waters thereof are ſweet; <hi>they
ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thine
houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drink of the rivers of thy
pleaſures, for with thee is the fountain of life,</hi> Pſal. 36.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that walking cloſely with God, do dwell
in the ſecret of his preſence, under the ſweet
dewes and influences of his grace; the buſineſs of
whoſe life, is to behold, and love, and ſerve the
Lord, their hearts have found ſuch reſt there, that
they can find no reſt elſwhere.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>By how much the more our hearts are in Heaven,
by ſo much the leſs are they on earth:</hi> worldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours
have all their religion in their mouths,
there's little within, whatever they talk. If any
man love the world the love of the father is not in
aim; If any man love the Father, the love of the
world ceaſes. Heaven and Hell may meet as well
as Heaven and Earth, in the ſame heart: <hi>Set your
affections on things above and not on the earth;</hi> on both
you cannot: your bodies as eaſily as your Souls,
may dwell in Heaven and Earth together. You
uſe to ſay, <hi>I cannot be here and there too;</hi> no, ſure
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:153788:49"/>
enough you cannot; whileſt your Souls are the
inhabitants of this, they are exiles from the other
world; and when they have their dwelling in
Heaven, they are but ſtrangers and Pilgrims on
the Earth: this world hath loſt your hearts when
God hath gain'd them.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>When once the world hath loſt our hearts, it hath
loſt its power over us:</hi> who will be entic'd by what
he hates or ſlights? God and the world rule, both,
<hi>by love.</hi> If God hath our love, he hath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of all that ever we have: if we love the
world, what can it not do with us? whither can
it not lead us? If the world hath loſt our love, it
were even as good lay down its weapons, and let
us alone: let them follow God, let them be holy,
let them to Heaven, their hearts are gone and
there's no holding them back. It may ſtill hang
in their heels, and retard their motion Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
but their hearts being gone, thither their
main courſe will bend it ſelf.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Faith gives aſſurance of this better inheritance.</hi>
Heb. 11. 1. <hi>Faith is the ſubſiſtence of things hoped for
and the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> It is an evidence,
not only that there is another world, and a better
world then this; and that this better ſtate may be
obbtaind; that there is an entrance into the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Kingdom <hi>poſſible;</hi> that theſe mortals may]
be clothed with immortality; that theſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibles
may put on incorruption; and theſe poor
worms, that creep on the duſt, may get them
wings, and fly away hence into everlaſting bliſs;
but it is alſo an evidence, that all this [ſhall] be;
that there ſhall be a performance of all thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
things which God hath ſpoken concerning
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:153788:50"/>
his Saints. <hi>Bleſſed is he that hath believed for there
ſhall be a performance of all that hath been told him.</hi>
Luk. 1. 45.</p>
            <p>Faith hath <hi>taken bond</hi> for performance. The
Almighty God hath bound himſelf to us; and leſt
through unbelief, we ſhould ſtick at taking his
<hi>ſingle bond,</hi> he hath given <hi>ſecurity,</hi> hath brought in
his Son and heir, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to ſtand
bound with him. Faith hath taken this bond; and
having it ſelf ſealed to the Articles or conditions
on our parts, upon the performance whereof the
inheritance ſtands ſure to us, upon the greateſt
ſecurity that Heaven and Earth can give; it keeps
it by it, and hath it ready to produce upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
to ſtop the clamours of unbelief. <hi>The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of God,</hi> that's our ſecurity, The Almighties
bond and articles wherein he hath made over all
that ever he hath, by an immutable and irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
deed to his Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Nay more, Faith will ſhew a believer <hi>his own
name</hi> in this deed.</p>
            <p>If it can but ſhew <hi>it ſelf</hi> to us, can make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that it is what it is, <hi>the Faith of Gods elect;</hi> if
it does but once appear that we do ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
it therein ſhews us our names in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of God. To ſay to any one that knows he
believes, to ſay to him, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be
ſaved,</hi> is fully as much, as if it had been ſaid to
him by name, <hi>Thou O man, even thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi>
thy name is written in the book of life.</p>
            <p>Unbelief will be ſtaggering at the promiſe, and
will call in queſtion all that the Lord God hath
ſaid. And when this world comes upon us and
tempts us; opens its pack and ſhews us its wares,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:153788:50"/>
and offers us our choice of whatſoever will pleaſe
us; <hi>Take it</hi> ſaies unbelief, make ſure of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
let not go ſuch penniworths, they may be
the beſt thou art ever like to have. Mayſt thou be
rich? mayſt thou live in pleaſure and in honour
here? Be not ſuch a fool as to neglect thy ſelf for
a conceit of ſome ſtrange things (thou knoweſt
not what) thou mayſt find hereafter. Who can
tell what there is in another world? whether there
be any other ſtate of bleſſedneſs then what our
eyes do ſee? But grant there be ſuch an happy
ſtate, what may this be to thee? God knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever thou mayſt be the better for't: when
thou haſt done all thou canſt, and loſt all thou haſt,
and left thy ſelf a poor and miſerable and forlorn
wretch, an abject an exile from all thy comforts
and contentments; after all this, thou mayſt
never come to Heaven at laſt: fooliſh man <hi>looſe not
a certainty for an uncertainty,</hi> know when thou art
well, and keep what thou haſt; what thou haſt thou
art ſure of; thine houſe is thine own, thy eſtate is
thine own; thy friends and thy pleaſures and thy
liberties, do not thine eyes ſee them, doſt thou
not taſt that they are good? here thou haſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but what thou mayſt have heareafter who
can tell?</p>
            <p>And what can a poor Soul anſwer to ſuch temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
that's held under unbelief? I confeſs
there's no great wiſdom in loſing certainties for
uncertainties; I ſee I have ſomething here, and if
I were ſure it ſhould be ſo well with me hereafter,
I could be content to venture all I have; to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Chriſt naked, to follow holineſs even to bonds
impriſonment and death. But what if there ſhould
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:153788:51"/>
be no ſuch thing as Heaven, or I ſhould never
come there?</p>
            <p>But now Faith will reply, what are thy good
things, thou counteſt ſo ſure to thee? what, but
vanity and vexation? but were they better then
they are, and worth what thou counteſt them, what
is the aſſurance thou haſt of them? for how long
are they thine? for how many years? for how
many dayes? what thine eye ſees to day, where may
it all be by to morrow? or ſuppoſe the moſt thou
canſt, thou canſt have but a leaſe of life in them;
when thou dieſt, thy eſtate dies, thy pleaſures
die, thy friends dye to thee; and heres the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
thou boaſteſt of; at preſent thou haſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that pleaſes thee, and may be, they may laſt
for an hour or two longer, or for a few dayes
more; but to be ſure after a few years at utmoſt,
they will be gone and thou muſt know them no
more. This is thy aſſurance.</p>
            <p>But is Heaven no more ſure then this? Is that
enduring ſubſtance, like theſe tranſient ſhadows?
can ſtability be removed, or eternity expire? or
if the doubt be, whether ever thou ſhalt obtain this
bleſſed ſtate, what hath God ſaid? <hi>He that beleiveth
ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it uncertain whether God be true? Hath
God help'd me to beleive, and therein told me I
ſhall be ſaved, and ſhall I yet queſtion whether
I ſhall or no?</p>
            <p>At leaſt this is ſure beyond all contradiction;
Heaven [may] be had; thou ſhalt certainly be
ſaved, if it be not thine own fault; if thou wilt
thou mayſt; The Goſpel is a mockery, if this be
not true; it apparently offers life to all that will,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:153788:51"/>
and therefore to thee amongſt the reſt. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17.
<hi>The Spirit and the bride ſay come—and [whoſoever
will] let him take of the water of life freely:</hi> there is
this only uncertainty now remaining, Its a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
whether thou wilt or not; If thou wilt thou
mayſt.</p>
            <p>Now when a Soul is brought to this, much more
when a beleiver, <hi>underſtanding that he beleives,</hi> can
read his own name in the book of life, then let the
world try its skill: what an hard task will it have
before it? Come change thy God and thy glory
for that which profiteth not; forſake the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of living waters for theſe broken Ciſterns,
purchaſe the pleaſures of time with the loſs of
Eternity. Come let the other world go: what
wilt thou give me then? why what ever thine
heart deſires, of all that thine eyes do ſee. No, no,
deceitful world, I have better things then theſe,
and I will now uſe thine own words, <hi>I will not
looſe a certainty for uncertainties.</hi> God is mine, but
after a few dayes whoſe ſhall theſe things be, that
thou offereſt me? I mean not to be ſo put off, as
to take mine Heaven on Earth. Let this earth be
my priſon, my purgatory, my Hell rather then
my Heaven; my life is bought into that eternal
inheritance reſerved in Heaven for me and I
will not ſell mine inheritance.</p>

why what comfort is that to us? If an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer

it muſt have been anſwer'd, none at all, whileſt

            <p>But if it be ask'd, what comfort is it to a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

power:</hi> he hath overcome <hi>in cauſa:</hi> he hath that
within him which will be the death of his enemies,
he is not only intereſs'd in Chriſt, and what he hath
done; but Chriſt is in him, the ſpirit of Chriſt,
which is the power of the living God, is in him.
<hi>He that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt is none of his.
Rom.</hi> 8. 9. The ſame power by which Chriſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came,
is already communicated to the Soul of a
believer: and thence may he be ſaid, to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
conquered, becauſe he hath received that
ſpirit of power, which will certainly work for him
the victory.</p>
            <p>What can a living child, new born do? He is as
weak as water; he cannot ſpeak, he cannot ſtand,
he cannot conquer a flea: but what may not this
child do, when he is grown up? there is <hi>the ſpirit
of a man</hi> in him, there's a Soul in him, which in
time will do wonderous things: a dead child,
neither can do any thing, neither is there hope
that ever he ſhould; but a living child hath a ſoul,
hath that within him that in time will do much.</p>
            <p>How ſmall are the appearances of the Saints in
the Infancy of their New-birth? how low are
their hopes, that they ſhould ever come to any
thing? 'tis a weak Enemy indeed, and a weak aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault,
that is not too ſtrong for them: a little wind
may blow away a ſmall twig; but deſpiſe not this
day of ſmall things, conſider their Root, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Chriſt that is in them, and thence you may
expect great things.</p>
            <p>Are there any of you that are grown Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<hi>ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might?</hi>
that are able for ſervice, and mighty for ſufferings;
that can ſtand againſt the temptations of Satan,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:153788:53"/>
and endure the contradictions of ſinners, and not
be weary and faint in your minds? yet look back,
and conſider what you were in your original; time
was when it was as low water with you as with
others, when you were as weary and weak as the
weakeſt: But behold what that mighty Spirit that
was in you is at length grown up to, the ſame
ſpirit is in every new-born Saint.</p>
            <p>What contemptible things were <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi>
and <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> when they were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?

did they obtain? the Sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the uncircumciſed, the great <hi>Goliah,</hi> were

            <p>You that are yet <hi>little children;</hi> but of little

begotten by the Goſpel, and brought forth into a
tempeſtuous world; let not the greatneſs of your
work, nor the potence of your enemies, nor
thoſe aſtoniſhing tempeſts that meet you at the

herbs.</hi> This greateſt of herbs, is virtually in this
ſmalleſt of ſeeds: Who knows what a little grace
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:153788:53"/>
may grow to? what is there in that bitter root of
ſin? all thoſe monſtrous wickedneſſes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
villanies which infeſt this earth, and fill
up hell; all the drunkenneſſes, adulteries, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
rapines, and moſt barbarous inhumanities,
which are the plague of this earth, and the fuel of
that Furnace; they all lye in that little bitter root,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 15. And ſo on the other ſide, all the beauty
and glory of holineſs, all the powers, victories and
triumphs over ſin, the world, and the devil, are
ſeminally contained in the firſt grace begotten in
the heart: The whole Harveſt of Glory is in the
leaſt ſeed of grace: The leaſt drop from the
Fountain of Life, is a Well of water ſpringing
up to life eternal, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
            <p>Beloved, are you in Chriſt? hath the day-ſpring
from on high viſited you? is the Spirit of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God within you? then whatever your
doubts, difficulties, hazards, temptations, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
are, the victory hath already paſſed on
your ſide. <hi>Death where is thy ſting?</hi> ſin, devil,
world, where is thy victory? Here are thy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
here is thy power, here are thy policies,
thy fury, thy fawnings, on every hand; before
us, behind us, on the right hand, and on the left;
here are thy Armies, but where is thy victory?
<hi>Thanks be to God that hath given [us] the victory
through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Thanks be to God
<hi>who maketh us alwayes to triumph in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>He hath broken the Head deſign of the world:</hi>
this is, to keep Chriſt and the ſoul apart, to keep
the ſoul from ever coming to Chriſt. Herein, as
hath been ſaid already, ſtands the deadly enmity
of the world againſt ſouls, in holding them under
its dominion, and thereby under the damnation
of hell. When we are once come over to Chriſt,
this great deſign is broken; when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
we are Conquerours. A ſoul ſubdued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord, is the world conquered to the ſoul:
every Convert to Chriſt is a Captive ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
a ſoul broken out of priſon: that's the word
that Chriſt hath to preach, Iſa. 49. 9. <hi>To ſay to the
priſoners go forth, and to them that are in darkneſs,
ſhew your ſelves.</hi> And that's the work that Chriſt
hath to do, <hi>To bring forth the priſoners out of priſon,
Iſa.</hi> 42. 7. Every Convert to Chriſt is a priſoner
broken looſe.</p>
            <p>It is a ſufficient Conviction that thou art a
worldling ſtill, that thou art no Convert to
Chriſt, and it is a ſufficient Conviction that thou
art no Convert, if thou be ſtill a worldling: he
that is come to Chriſt is come off from the world,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 19. and he that is ſtill under the world,
is not come to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>That's the great conteſt betwixt Chriſt and
the World, who ſhall carry the heart: Come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with me, ſayes Chriſt, give me thy heart, be
my ſervant, be my Diſciple: No, no, ſaith the
World, ſtay with me, be my ſervant; or at
leaſt, if thou wilt not any longer be wholly mine,
then it ſayes as the Harlot, be neither his nor
mine, but ſuffer thy ſelf to be divided; let him
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:153788:54"/>
take one half, and let the other half be for me;
halt betwixt Chriſt and the world; keep both
worlds; what hinders, but thou mayſt have thy
gains and thy pleaſures here, and yet have Chriſt
too?</p>
            <p>When the heart is convinc'd; that there is no
compounding betwixt Chriſt and the world, that
Chriſt is the better Maſter, and that it cannot ſerve
two Maſters, but muſt neceſſarily take to the one,
and let the other go, and hereupon yields it ſelf
to Chriſt: Lord I am thy ſervant, and will follow
thee whatſoever become of the world; whether
I ſink or ſwim, want or abound, proſper or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;
whatever my condition be here, thine I
am, and thee will I love and ſerve; when the
ſoul is come to this, there's converſion; there's
the Head deſign of the world broken.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>He is effectually marching on in the purſuit of his
victory;</hi> he is overcoming: So the word in the
Text, <hi>he overcometh the world;</hi> he hath already got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the better, and he is preſſing on after a total
victory; he hath his foot on the neck, and his
hand ſtill in the fight.</p>
            <p>He keeps his enemy in his eye, and ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his guard daily; he diſpatches meſſengers,
<hi>his prayers, his ſighs, his tears,</hi> to fetch down freſh
ſupplies from above: his prayers ſpeak, his
ſighs cry, his tears have a tongue, and all go up
with the ſame meſſage, as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> ſent to
<hi>Joſhua,</hi> Joſh. 10. 6. <hi>Slack not thine hand from thy
ſervant, come down to me quickly, ſave and help
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſets all his graces, his faith, his love, his
hope, his patience, in battel array againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:153788:55"/>
He is ſtill making ſure the party that the world
hath within him; keeps luſt under, keeps pride,
and covetouſneſs, and ſenſuality low; that is,
more or leſs, according as he acts as a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>He ſecures <hi>the ſtrong hold;</hi> keeps his heart,
keeps his Farms, and his oxen, and his pleaſures,
at the greateſt diſtance he can from his heart: he
ſends his heart far enough away out of their reach,
he conveys it into the other world, where it
dwells, and builds, and plants, and ſows, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and lays up a better treaſure; where it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces
and recreates it ſelf; where it hath better
work, and better company, and better pleaſures
to wean it from theſe below; he lives in the view
and contemplation of God, in the Society and
Communion of Saints and Angels, and is ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with the Fountain of Living Waters, that
he be neither thirſty after the waters, nor choak'd
with the mud of theſe broken ciſterns.</p>
            <p>He ſtudies the world more, and comes to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
underſtanding of it; of its vanity, of its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
of its treachery, power and policy: and the
more he knows it, the more he fears it: the more
he knows of God, the more he loves and thirſts
and longs after him; the more he knows of the
world, the leſs he loves, and the more he fears it.
He fears not ſo much its anger as its kindneſs:
he fears his worldly pleaſures, his carnal friends,
his earthly buſineſſes and his proſpering in them:
he carries a ſence of the danger he is in by them,
and a fear of the ſnare they may be to him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he goes: whileſt he is neceſſarily detained
and buſied here, he carries this fear as his guard
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:153788:55"/>
to ſecure his Soul, whither ever he walks: to his
table, to his bed, to his ſhop, in his journeys;
he feeds with fear and works with fear, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
with fear, and trades with fear, leſt whileſt he
is thus neceſſarily converſant in the world, he be
again intangled with its temptations.</p>
            <p>And in this warfare he grows, and gathers
ſtrength daily; is more able to contemn the
world, it becomes every day leſs and leſs to be
a temptation to him. Time was when, whenever
the world came enticing him after it, <hi>hearken to me,
mind thy earthly concernments, and thou ſhalt be rich
and proſper and abound; follow Chriſt and this holineſs
and twill be thine undoing;</hi> time was, when theſe
were arguments of great weight with him; that
could command his heart, controul conſcience,
conjure his affections, and perſwade him to any
thing; but now they come too late, they are ſcarce
temptations to him: his heart is ſo ſet upon the
ſecuring his eternal intereſt, and ſo tranſported
with the ſenſe of the importance of that great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment;
thoſe higher things are ſo great in his
eye, and ſo much upon his heart, that it ſeems but
a very ſmall thing to be poſſeſſour of all things
here, and to make but a ſmall difference upon his
condition, whether he hath or wants.</p>
            <p>2. Wherein this victory ſtands: <hi>which I ſhall
anſwer,</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>Negatively.</item>
                  <item>Poſitively.</item>

            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> and this in 4. particulars.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>A believer hath not ſo overcome the world, as to
be above all need of the world:</hi> though <hi>man lives not by
bread onely,</hi> as <hi>Math.</hi> 4. Yet he muſt have bread,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:153788:56"/>
yea and muſt work for his bread, and therefore
muſt diligently follow his calling, wherein he
may <hi>provide things honeſt;</hi> provide him an honeſt
livelihood.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Not ſo but that he is ſtill free to uſe the world
in his need: every creature of God is good,</hi> good for
uſe, <hi>being ſanctified by the word of God and Prayer.</hi>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 4. Both neceſſaries and the abundance
of the things of this life, are a bleſſing from God;
and the free uſe of them, ſo far as to fit us for
ſervice, is not onely lawful but a duty; that ſelf
denyal, that over-ſparing uſe of the creatures,
which impaires our ſtrength, or dulls our Spirits,
is not a virtue, but uſually, is either the fruit of a
melancholique diſtemper, or a temptation.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Not ſo, as to be for ever freed from all noxious temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the world:</hi> This world is an enemy ſtill,
and this enemy will be ſtill fighting againſt the
Soul. A Chriſtian will never be ſuch a conquerour
here, but he muſt ſtill keep on his armour, and
ſtand upon his guard; hereafter, when the victory
ſhall be compleat, he ſhall ſit down. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21.
<hi>To him that overcometh will I give to [ſit] with me
in my throne:</hi> at preſent we muſt: <hi>ſtand, Epheſ.</hi> 6.
13. <hi>And having done all to ſtand</hi> ſtand upon our
watch, ſtand to our arms; but hereafter we ſhall
<hi>ſit down:</hi> we are yet in our march with our Lord,
<hi>in his Chariot of war;</hi> for our place <hi>in his triumphal
Chariot,</hi> for ſitting down with him in the throne,
we muſt wait till hereafter.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Not ſo, as to be for ever free from all ſurpriſals,
and falls by theſe temptations.</hi> The world will aſſault
us, and in theſe aſſaults too often gets the better
of us: though it cannot command us quite back
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:153788:56"/>
from Chriſt, yet it may turn us aſide, and much
hinder us in our following of him; though it
cannot now deſtroy us, yet it may diſtract and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
us; though it cannot recover its abſolute
dominion over us, yet it may lay our feet again in
the Stocks. We may love it too much, and fear it
too much, and mind it too much, and follow it
too hard, and our ſouls may become great looſers
by it: God may be forgotten, Souls may be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
Conſcience may be defiled, Duties omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or ſhuffled over, and all ſenſe of Eternity for
a time, buried in an heap of worldly cares or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.
We have experience enough to give in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
to this, and much more.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Poſitively;</hi> and thus our victory over the

                  <item>1. A power to poſſeſſe the things of the world,

                  <item>5. A willingneſs to be gone from this, and to

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Victory over the world ſtands in our having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to a power to poſſeſs the things of the world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
placing our happineſs in them.</hi> The <hi>Supremacy</hi> of
the world is founded, in its apprehended <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,</hi>
to bleſs us and make us happy: Whileſt we
hold it our treaſure, we reſign our ſelves to it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:153788:57"/>
as our Governour, <hi>Mat. 6. 21. Where the treaſure
is, there the heart will be alſo.</hi> The heart will never
dwell in, or ſerve this world, when it hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
another treaſure; the world can never hold
the dominion of a Lord, longer then it can hold
the reputation of our God. The ſoul will not be
governed or commanded by it, unleſs it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to take it as its reward; when the heart hath
ſaid to the Lord, <hi>Thou art my portion,</hi> it can ſay to
the world, <hi>Stand thou as my footſtool:</hi> when we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
promiſe our ſelves contentment in our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations,
nor feel our ſelves at reſt in our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
of the world; when the heart is fixed on
an higher good, and ſo ſtrongly working upward,
that it will not be detained from the purſuit of it,
by any thing it either hath or hopes for here, then
the world is vanquiſhed.</p>
            <p>Now in this is included,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Our making God our happineſs.</hi> Its vain for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man to ſay or think, the world is not, who
cannot truly ſay, The Lord is my happineſs and
Heritage. Its natural to man to deſire happineſs,
and to pitch ſome where or other, where he hopes
'tis to be had: what he apprehends to be the beſt
of all he knows, moſt ſuitable and moſt ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
to his deſire and appetite, there he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens.</p>
            <p>Worldly men, that know no better, promiſe
to themſelves a worldly happineſs, and here
they fix; and it is impoſſible for them to looſen
hence, till they diſcover and cloſe with ſome
higher good; till God comes in, the World will
not out. The Pſalmiſt could never but have envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Idolized the portion, and proſperity of the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:153788:57"/>
ungodly, had not God been his portion. Firſt,
he muſt ſay, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee?</hi> and
then he can add, <hi>There's none in earth that I deſire
beſides thee,</hi> Pſal. 73.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The due limiting our deſires after, and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our delights in the things of this world; and a
ſubordination of them all to our great end.</hi> If the
world be not our happineſs, we ſhall love it and
ſeek it thereafter. The world, if it be any thing
to us, it muſt be either <hi>our end, or our means;</hi> if
God be our portion, he is our end; if God be
our end, the world ceaſes to be ſuch; two laſt
ends no man can have, till he have two ſouls; if
the world be not our end, it muſt be either our
means, or nothing to us.</p>
            <p>Our deſires and delights are proportionable to
our conceits of, and our expectations from the
objects of them: that which is apprehended, and
accepted <hi>as our end,</hi> is deſired accordingly, hath
the ſtream and ſtrength of the ſoul running out
after it; there it deſires and loves without limit:
that which is apprehended only <hi>as a means,</hi> is ſo
far only amiable and deſired, as it ſubſerves our
end. When ever the world ceaſes to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our happineſs, it will neceſſarily be judg'd
only as a means to it; and thence will follow this
limiting our worldly deſires, and moderating
of our worldly delights; we ſhall deſire them no
farther, nor delight in them otherwiſe, then as
they are conducible to God.</p>
            <p>2. Victory over the world, ſtands in a power to
mannage our worldly affairs and buſineſſes, without the
prejudice of our ſouls. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 5. He will guide his
affairs with diſcretion: <hi>and his diſcretion herein
appears:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:153788:58"/>
1. <hi>That in the multitudes of the thoughts he hath in
his heart, and the buſineſſes he hath in his hand, he hath
ſtill an eye to the main.</hi> He's a diſcreet man that
rightly underſtands, and duly minds his great
concernment: the world muſt be minded, the
Plough muſt be followed, the ſeed muſt be ſown,
the Flocks muſt be kept, the Oxen and the Aſſes
muſt be cared for; But what is the world to my
ſoul? what is my food to my life? this muſt be
chiefly look'd to, that I periſh not, that I run
not upon an eternal undoing, that my ſoul may
live, and it may be well with me hereafter; I
muſt firſt ſeek the Kingdome of God, and then let
other things be minded as they may. He that ſaid,
<hi>Be diligent to know the ſtate of thy flocks, and to look
well to thy herds, Prov.</hi> 27. 23. ſaid alſo with an
<hi>Emphaſis,</hi> Deut. 4. 9. <hi>Only take heed to thy ſelf, and
keep thy ſoul diligently; above all keeping keep thy
heart, Prov.</hi> 4. 23. And therefore to this he hath
a moſt <hi>ſpecial eye;</hi> his eye looks moſt inwards; its
well with me without, or whether it be or no,
how is it within? how goes the work of Faith and
Repentance on? how goes the work of Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and Sanctification on? here he beſtows his
<hi>ſpecial labour,</hi> in working out his ſalvation, in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up treaſure in heaven. I ſhall never count my
ſelf to proſper, whileſt my ſoul proſpers not; I
ſhall never count my ſelf a good husband, whileſt
mine own Vineyard hath not been kept; and I
ſhall never count my ſelf poor, while I am grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rich unto God; I ſhall never count my ſelf
an ill husband, whileſt I have been wiſe and buſie
for Eternity.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That to this end, he overcharges not;</hi> pulls no
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:153788:58"/>
more of buſineſs upon him, then he can go through
with, without neglecting his ſoul; though he muſt
imploy himſelf, yet he will not intangle himſelf
in the affairs of this life, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
            <p>His Lord hath given him fair warning, <hi>Luke</hi>
21. 34. <hi>Take heed leſt at any time your hearts be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
with the cares of this life;</hi> and he's willing
to take the warning: He's wary how he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
more buſineſs then God calls him to; if God
put him upon a more buſie life, and lays on a
greater load of work or care upon him, he chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſets his ſhoulders to it, knowing that where
God ſets him on work, he will be with him in the
work, and help him out; but he would have no
more to do, then God ſets him about.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, beſides the Call of God, there are
too often other Maſters call us to work: 'tis not
ſeldome, that <hi>mens luſts</hi> ſet them on work; as their
luſts call them off from work, call them to play,
or to ſleep, or to be idle; ſo ſometimes alſo
mens luſts call them <hi>to work.</hi> Some mens <hi>pride</hi> ſets
them on work; many an hard daies work they
have, to get ſomething to maintain it: Some
mens <hi>prodigality</hi> ſets them on work, that they may
have to ſpend on their throats, their bellies or
companions; but moſt of all, mens <hi>covetouſneſs</hi>
ſets them on work; this is an hard and cruel
Maſter; oh what a labourious weary life do ſuch
men live? their life is a meer drudgery, riſing
early, going to bed late, eating the bread of care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.
How many irons hath the covetous man
in the fire? how many cares? how many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
is he ever loaden withall? he never reſts,
his hands are ever full, his thoughts are ever bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:153788:59"/>
whatever he hath done or gotten already,
yet there's ſtill more work coming in, more
load laying on; tother houſe, or tother field is in
his eye; tother groat, or tother peny more to be
gotten: the Ephah is not yet full, his large heart,
that daughter of the Horſe-leech, is ſtill a crying
upon him; <hi>Get, get; Gather, gather.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whileſt thou haſt been ſo buſie here and
there, what's done for thy ſoul? how does that
work proſper? what trade has been driven for
Eternity? O the Lord forgive me, I never
thought of that; I had ſo many other things to
do, that I had no time to mind it.</p>
            <p>But who ſet thee on work about theſe other
things? who hath hired thee? oh my neceſſities
have hired me; my back, and my belly, and the
neceſſities of my family; God hath ſet me on
work. I but conſider, art thou not miſtaken? it
may be 'tis the Devil that hath ſet thee on work,
thy pride, or thy covetouſneſs, that hath put thee
upon this buſie life all the while.</p>
            <p>But now a Chriſtian reſolves, <hi>I will hearken what
the Lord God will ſpeak;</hi> when he ſayes go, I will
go; when he ſayes do this, I will do it; I will
have nothing to do, but what I may anſwer for it;
this is that which the Lord would have done: God
ſayes, <hi>Look diligently to thy ſoul,</hi> Deut. 4. 9. God
ſayes, <hi>What will it profit a man to win the whole world,
and to looſe his own ſoul?</hi> Matth. 16. 26. God ſayes,
<hi>Lay up in ſtore for thy ſelf a good foundation againſt the
time to come. Provide thee bags that wax not old, a
treaſure in heaven that faileth not.</hi> God ſayes, <hi>Mat.</hi>
6. 33. <hi>Firſt ſeek the Kingdome of God, and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and all theſe things ſhall be added unto thee.</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:153788:59"/>
God never ſaid, firſt ſeek food and rayment, and
the Kingdome of heaven ſhall be added to thee;
Chriſt ſhall be added, righteouſneſs ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
ſalvation ſhall be added to thee; but firſt
make ſure the principal, and the appurtenances
ſhall be caſt in.</p>
            <p>And hereupon, a Chriſtian will do according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
will look to the main, whatever become of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing elſe; and will not engage further in any
other affairs, then will conſiſt with the ſecuring
his great concernment: whatever <hi>buſineſs</hi> he hath,
he muſt have room <hi>for duty;</hi> he muſt have his
praying times, and reading times, and hearing
times; he muſt have his daily ſeaſons for ſpecial
converſe with God, for communing with his own
heart; he muſt duly ſet his watch, and walk the
rounds, through his thoughts, affections, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and all the powers of his ſoul; and finding
ſo much work, and of ſo great conſequence of
this kind, whatever wants, this muſt have his dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attendance.</p>
            <p>I muſt have bread, I muſt have cloaths, I muſt
not ſtarve? I, and I muſt have Christ, I muſt have
grace: whether I have bread or no, cloaths or
no, whether I ſtarve or no, I muſt not be damn'd;
a praying time is more neceſſary then an eating,
or drinking, or ſleeping time, and therefore
much more then a working time.</p>
            <p>'Tis not the leaſt part of a Chriſtians Victory
over the world, to have the command of himſelf
in his <hi>lawful affairs and buſineſſes. In licitis perimus
omnes.</hi> When he hath ſuch power over himſelf, that
he can aſſign to every thing their proper places,
meaſures and ſeaſons, then he is Conquerour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:153788:60"/>
Chriſtians, how ſadly doth this ſpeak concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many of you? what ſay you, Conquerours or
Captives? Let your care of duty ſpeak. Do not
your oppreſſed and curtail'd duties cry out, <hi>We
are beaten, we are beaten!</hi> we are beaten out of the
field: we are not regarded when the world hath
any work to be done: Is this your care of the
main? Believe it Brethren, when buſineſs gets
the upperhand of duty, the world hath gotten the
upperhand of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Conſider therefore, how is it with you? Do
you allow duties their proper time and place? Do
you firſt ſeek the Kingdome of God? Is the
world made to give place to prayer, or is prayer
ordinarily made to give place to the world?</p>
            <p>Do you <hi>ſet your times for daily duty? and do you
allow ſufficient time?</hi> do you not put the Lord off
with ſhort and haſty duties, and then tell him,
Lord, this is all the time I can ſpare thee; Soul,
this is all the time I can allow thee. Haſty duties
are next to none. Do you allow your ſouls room
to make the beſt of their ſuits? room for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
and importunity, or are they not moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forc'd to ſhuffle over and ſhut up, almoſt as ſoon
as they have begun.</p>
            <p>Is there not too great a fault among Profeſſors,
on this account? do not their buſineſſes borrow
of their duties; borrow, but never pay? <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
I pray thee lend me this praying hour? Soul, I pray
thee ſpare me this reading time:</hi> I want time to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch
my buſineſs, hereafter I'le pay it again?
How little of your time muſt ordinarily ſerve the
turn for your attendance on God; a ſhort prayer,
ſhort meditations are all you will allow, and your
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:153788:60"/>
ſouls ordinarily fare thereafter; you are too
much in haſt to ſpeed well, God will be waited
on, and wreſtled with ere he will hear. We
read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. 26. when <hi>Jacob</hi> was wreſtling with
God, he held at it ſo long, that God ſaid, <hi>Let
me go;</hi> enough <hi>Jacob, let me go, for the day break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi>
but he reſolv'd, <hi>I will not let thee go, unleſs thou
bleſs me.</hi> But is it not with us the quite contrary?
By that we have been at it a little while, <hi>Let me go
Lord,</hi> I muſt be gone: Whether thou hear me or
not, whether thou bleſs me or not, let me go, I
am in haſt, and muſt be gone, give me leave qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
to depart, and that ſhall ſerve for this time
inſtead of a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Oh Brethren, if we would trace our ſelves
into our Cloſets, and obſerve our ſhort ſtay there,
the ſlight and haſty work we make before the
Lord, and our quick returns we make to the
world; ſure methinks it ſhould make us ſay, I
am afraid this world is ſtill too hard for me, I
am afraid it hath me ſtill under its dominion; it
will not truſt me to be long alone with my God,
its preſently calling me off; and when it calls
once, I muſt preſently take my leave, away I
muſt. Conſider this Brethren, do you allow your
ſelves ſufficient time for duty?</p>
            <p>If you have appointed your ſet times, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
time, do you <hi>keep your times?</hi> does not the
world ordinarily ſteal away your hours of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
when the time draws nigh for the worſhip of
God, does not the world uſe to ſtep in, <hi>But I muſt
be firſt ſerv'd,</hi> my Cattle muſt be firſt ſerv'd, my
Cuſtomers muſt be firſt ſerv'd, I have a friend that
muſt be firſt waited on? and when one buſineſs is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:153788:61"/>
diſpatch'd, another falls in, and another, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
till it be too late and time to go to bed,
and ſo God and the Soul muſt wait their time till
to morrow; and when to morrow comes, that is
as this day, and much more buſie.</p>
            <p>Judge Brethren, whether it be not too ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
thus with us, and then tell me, which do ye
think hath the greater intereſt, God or the world?</p>
            <p>Prayer is one of our <hi>weapons,</hi> wherewith we are
to maintain the fight againſt the world, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.
18. <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 11. When <hi>Moſes</hi> hands are lift up,
this <hi>Amalek</hi> falls: And can you think the world
hath you not ſure enough, when it can at pleaſure
command your weapons out of your hands: or if
it leave them with you, can ſo blunt their edge,
that they are good for nothing?</p>
            <p>No man that is a Souldier will lay aſide his
weapons, but one of theſe, either <hi>a Conquerour,
or a Captive, or a Fool. A Conquerour</hi> (whoſe victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is compleat) needs his Arms no longer; the
work is done, the Enemy is fallen, and ſhall no
more be able to riſe. <hi>A Captive</hi> (who is totally
and irrecoverably loſt) hath no further uſe of his
Arms; they will now ſtand him in no ſtead; 'tis
too late to fight, the field is loſt. He that is yet
in the fight, and will lay down his Arms, is <hi>a fool:</hi>
in laying by his weapons, he gives his enemies
the day: he is a fool, that thinks to ſtand in the
fight, and will not ſtand to his Armes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In heaven,</hi> when our warfare is accompliſhed,
no more <hi>need</hi> of praying then; no more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
no more fighting, no more exerciſes of faith
and patience then; the Enemy is under our feet;
<hi>the triumph</hi> is all that then remains; the Robes,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:153788:61"/>
and the Palms, and the Crowns, ſinging, and
ſhouting, and rejoycing; no more need of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and watching.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Hell,</hi> when the captivity is irrecoverable,
there's no more <hi>uſe</hi> of weapons; tis too late then,
they'le ſtand them in no ſtead: tis too late to pray,
and watch, and wreſtle; the day is loſt. The
ſhame the contempt, the priſon, the mill, the
dungeon, the torments of their captivity is all
that there remains. Prayer, that men now make
to give place to luſt and vanity, to laughing or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring;
God will then make it to give place to
curſings, and ravings, and roarings; to tearing
of hairs, and gnawing of tongues, and gnaſhing of
teeth: you that now count it a trouble and a
cumbrance to attend on praying, and faſting, and
ſuch like duties; if you ever fall into that priſon,
you ſhall have your liberty from theſe burthens;
you ſhall live an eternity of dayes and nights, and
never be put to the trouble of one Prayer more,
of one Sermon more, of one exerciſe of religion
more: there's an everlaſting end of Prayer in
Heaven and Hell.</p>
            <p>But now, though the perfect conquerour may,
though the perfect captive muſt, lay by his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
have done with prayer for ever; yet he
that is yet in the fight, is a fool, if he ſtand not to
his arms: either he triumphs before the victory,
or elſe cares not on which ſide the victory goes.
Thou art a fool with a witneſs, that either ſlighteſt
ſuch a potent enemy, or holdeſt thy ſelf little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the victory.</p>
            <p>May all his coſt and labour be ſpared? canſt
thou ſtand in thine own ſtrength? needeſt thou not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:153788:62"/>
be beholding to the Lord for his help? or is the
help of the Lord ſo cheap, as to he had without
ſeeking for: or will any ſlight ſeeking now and
then ſerve? <hi>ſerve thy governour ſo.</hi> Will the world
give thee leave to take ſufficient time for ſeeking
God, if thou wilt not take whether it will or no?</p>
            <p>Brethren, learn hence forth, not to put God off
with <hi>the worlds leavings,</hi> but let the world be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to take <hi>Gods leavings:</hi> if time fall ſhort for
any thing, ſee that it be not for your Souls: let
God have his daily due, and your Souls have theirs,
whatever goe without. Let not the world any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ſay, <hi>give place Bible, ſtand aſide Prayer,</hi> I have
no leiſure for you; but let your Souls daily ſay,
<hi>ſtand aſide world, buſineſs, trade,</hi> I muſt ſerve the
Lord.</p>
            <p>Never look to be other then worldlings, whileſt
any thing below hath ſo much power with you, as
to keep God and your Souls aſunder; to hold you
either under a total neglect, or ordinary remiſneſs
in your religious duties: whileſt it can keep you
either ſo buſy, or ſo ſlothful, that you reſtrain
prayer, it hath you ſure enough: if the Divel can
but keep you out of your cloſets, he will not fear
to meet you in the field; he will not doubt your
ſtanding on your feet, if he can but keep you from
falling on your knees.</p>
            <p>Becauſe there is ſo much depending on this,
both as to the iſſue of our conflict, and the evidence
of our victory over the world, give me leave to
preſs you the cloſer to it, by giving you a ſhort
view, of the ſumme of what I have here ſuggeſted,
in theſe following propoſitions and advice.</p>
            <p>1. The death of the world will never be either
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:153788:62"/>
compaſſed or witneſſed, but by the life of religion.</p>
            <p>2. The life of religion cannot be maintained,
but by keeping up the life of duties: no prayer
no holineſs, little prayer and but little holineſs.
The vigour of grace is maintained from above;
and nothing will come down unleſs we often
look up.</p>
            <p>3. The life of duty will not be kept up, unleſs
there be <hi>ſet and ſufficient time</hi> allotted to it: occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional
duties will be but ſhort and ſeldom.</p>
            <p>4. Seldom receſſes from the world, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
returns to it, ſhort and haſty prayers the
Devil will allow us, and the world will be no
looſer by them.</p>
            <p>5. If buſineſs, or ſlothfulneſs ordinarily get the
upper hand of duty, whatever time be allotted for
it, little enough will be beſtowed on it. If we
never pray but when we have liſt or leiſure, there
will be but little done; the world will either fill
us with work or weary us into ſloth. Therefore,</p>
            <p>6. Reſolve whatever the countermands of the
world or Devil, of your buſy or weary Spirits
are, to ſet and keep up your daily duties: if
time fall ſhort, yet let not your Souls fail of their
due; be conſtant, be inſtant in prayer. If this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
be not accepted, I look not that any other of
the counſels of God ſhould proſper with you. Are
you worldlings? are you in bondage to your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and earthly hearts? there I look to find you
to your dying day, if conſtant and inſtant prayer
do not fetch you off.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>That in the multitude of his buſineſſes he neglect
not the Souls of his Relations:</hi> He that neglecteth his
families Souls, ſinneth againſt his own Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:153788:63"/>
Worldlings hold all they have in the ſame bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
with themſelves; the ſons of theſe bondmen
are ſeldom ſuffered to be freemen: like the
Scribes and Phariſes, <hi>Math. 23. 13. They neither
enter into the kingdom of God themſelves, nor ſuffer
thoſe that would to enter in.</hi> Like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters,
<hi>Exod. 5. 17. Ye are idle, ye are idle,</hi> is their
word, when any of theirs will worſhip God: an
hour ſpent in prayer or reading, by ſuch as belong
to them, is as great a crime, as ſo much time
waſted in play or idleneſs: to your work to your
work; any work that's done for God is counted
loſt to them.</p>
            <p>He that fears God would have God ſerved by
all his, and never counts himſelf ſerved, when
God is neglected.</p>
            <p>He ſees that the education of thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him in the knowledg and worſhip of God is
neceſſary work and excellent work: a godly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
is a nurſery for Heaven: he counts it his
beſt husbandry to be husbanding up ſuch choice
plants, as will afterwards be for trees to be here
and there tranſplanted in the vineyard of the Lord:
he would train up a new generation that may riſe
up in his room to bear the name of God in their
generations; whereby the Lord may have a ſeed
preſerved to ſhew forth his praiſes from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to generation, <hi>Gen. 18. 17. I know Abraham
that he will command his children and his houſhold after
him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord.</hi> It may
be written over the ſayings of the ſeed of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
as <hi>Prov. 31. 1. The words of King</hi> Lemuel, <hi>the
prophecy which his mother taught him:</hi> over others it
may be written, not <hi>the propheſies</hi> but <hi>the prophaneſs,</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:153788:63"/>
the oathes the lyes the ſcoffes that his mother
taught him; the covetouſneſs and the oppreſſion
that he hath learned of his Father.</p>
            <p>Whats the reaſon of that rudeneſs, and thoſe
debaucheries, that Ignorance, Atheiſm and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that abounds in wordly families: tis all
they have been bred up to; they have learn'd to
be wicked, of Children: the iniquity of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
covetouſneſs would not allow them time,
to teach them better things.</p>
            <p>He whoſe own foot is eſcaped out of the ſnare,
would not leave any of his in priſon behind him.
Tis a vain argument for the Devil to uſe with ſuch:
thou wilt never thrive, if thou ſpendeſt ſo many
thoughts and words and hours about ſuch matters:
thou wilt if thou takeſt this courſe bring thy ſelf to
a morſell of bread; and wilt teach all thine the
way to the ſame poverty, and make them all as
bad husbands as thy ſelf: this would do ſomething
with earthly minds; but he that fears God, if it
muſt be, had rather be undone then to preſerve or
increaſe his eſtate by the murther of Souls. This
may be my way to increaſe my ſtore; for what
is labour without a bleſſing, and what bleſſing
where God is not known? this may be my beſt
husbandry for [this] world, but whether it be or
no, God muſt be ſerved.</p>
            <p>Oh what dark and diſmal holes are the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of worldlings: their habitations are full of
violence; cruelty and bloud lodges in them: they
live by murther and rapine, <hi>the bloud of Souls,</hi> is
their meat and drink: the lives of their Children
muſt be ſacrifices to their luſt; they buy them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
and raiſe them portions out of their own
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:153788:64"/>
ruine; all the purchaſes they make for them, they
may call <hi>the Potters field,</hi> for they are <hi>the price of
bloud:</hi> they will ſuffer them to run down to Hell,
for fear they ſhould leave them beggers on earth:
they'le make them too good husbands to be ever
good Chriſtians: they are bondmen themſelves,
and they ſell all theirs for ſervants to the ſame
maſter.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, you that hope you are gotten free,
prove that you are ſo by being zealous of getting
that freedom entail'd upon your poſterity; leave
them no longer at the brick kiln, but bring them
away with you to ſerve the Lord.</p>
            <p>1. Bring them with you <hi>before the Lord:</hi> lay
them often at his feet: pray over them; Here be
my blind (Lord) and my lame, my creeples and
my captives. Lord open their eyes and bring
forth theſe priſoners out of priſon: behold the
Souls which thou haſt given me, here they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, Oh that they might live in thy ſight, let
all mine be thine. Haſt thou delivered thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant?
O let all theſe be as the Soul of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant:
haſt thou brought me out of bondage,
O let me not leave a Child behind.</p>
            <p>2. Bring <hi>the Lord to them,</hi> let theſe poor priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
hear of a redeemer; make Chriſt known to
them; and that they may accept of his redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
make them firſt known to themſelves?
Inſtruct them often, make them to know their ſin
and their miſery; the dreadful bondage that they
are under at preſent, and the dreadful pit they are
haſtning to; and then tell them of that redeemer
that is come out of <hi>Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Bring them <hi>over to the Lord:</hi> be an Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:153788:64"/>
for Chriſt to them; ceaſe not to warn them
to command, perſwade beſeech them in Chriſts
ſtead, till they conſent and be reconciled to God.</p>
            <p>Be induſtrious, be at pains with them: lye at
them from day to day; bethink not your time and
labour. And if the world ſtep in and reprove you;
this is not the way to thrive, theſe houres ſpent in
thy trade or calling would turn thee and them to
more profit, then prove thy ſelf to have broken its
yoke from off thy neck, by turning away thine
ear from its ſuggeſtions.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>That in all his dealings in the world, he have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to truth, righteouſneſs, and mercy.</hi> He would
not live by lying, he would not <hi>get</hi> by unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
nor <hi>ſave</hi> by unmercifulneſs.</p>
            <p>The worlds vaſſals muſt ſtick at nothing that
will ſerve their turns; muſt lye, defraud, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe,
extort, grind the faces, ſtarve the bowels
break the bones of their poor brethren, this is for
their intereſt.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Tim. 6. 10. The love of money is the root of all
evil:</hi> whence is it that there is ſo little faith, or
truth, or righteouſneſs, or mercy among men?
ſo little truth in their words, ſo little faith in
their promiſes, ſo little righteouſneſs in their
dealings, no more bowels of compaſſion? we may
be aſhamed to think how little, we may fear and
tremble to think how little; ſo much praying,
and hearing, and profeſſing, and yet ſo much falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
and wrong? ſo much knowledg of God and
yet ſo little conſcience towards men? ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
to faith, and yet ſo little exerciſe of charity?
this is dreadful; but whence is all this? the love
of money is the root of all evil: this is the lyar,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:153788:65"/>
this is the oppreſſour this is the barbarian, <hi>the love
of money:</hi> there had been more faith, and more
truth, and more mercy, had there been leſs of this
love: where this root is dried up, where the
world is no longer lov'd, it will be no longer
ſerv'd or obey'd; nothing of it will be regarded
but what comes in, in a way of truth and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <p>He that loves truth above the beſt trading, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
above the greateſt riches, that counts
mercy the beſt good husbandry; he that had rather
ſtand to a bad bargain, then break promiſe; make
a bad market, then advance his gain by a lye;
ſuffer bad wares to lye on his hands, then ſay they
are good; he that had rather have no bleſſing in
his hand, then no bowels to lay it out for God; He
that however he hath this world about him, has an
eſtate, houſes, lands, money in greateſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;
he that however he labours in all fair and
innocent wayes, to preſerve and improve what he
has; yet chooſes rather to be poor then not to be
honeſt, to have nothing then not to be a good
ſteward of what he has; he that will not be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be falſe, unrighteous, or unmerciful, for
the getting or ſaving an eſtate, the world hath not
much in the heart of that man.</p>
            <p>Oh brethren, if this be to overcome the world,
then how many more captives hath it ſtill then the
moſt are aware of? what trade is there driven al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
any where in the world, wherein the trade
of lying hath not a great ſtock going? Are there
not even among men pretending to religion, too
many found, who inſtead of uſing the Pſalmiſts
prayer, <hi>Keep me from the way of lying,</hi> will rather
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:153788:65"/>
content themſelves with the <hi>Syrians</hi> prayer, <hi>The
Lord pardon me in this thing;</hi> the Lord forgive me,
I know not how to help it. It's true that men of
great dealings have great temptations to it, and
is it not as true, that they are <hi>taking temptations?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how can you then take your ſelves to be any
of Chriſts diſciples? or how can you ſtand here
praying with the ſame mouth, that it may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a day or two, will be found in the market lying?
<hi>Can the ſame fountain ſend forth ſweet water and bitter,
Jam.</hi> 3. 11. Deceive not your ſelves, you do but
lye unto God in your duties, that make it your
practiſe to lye unto men in your dealings. <hi>If any
man ſeem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue</hi>
(from lying as well as other ill language) <hi>that mans
religion is in vain,</hi> Jam. 1. 26.</p>
            <p>And as little truth as there is in mens words, is
there not as little righteouſneſs in their wayes?
the lying tongue and the oppreſſing hand are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
from the ſame heart. How very few are
there that weigh their actions on that unerring
beam, <hi>Do unto others as you would they ſhould do unto
you?</hi> Wouldſt thou be oppreſſed? thou wouldſt
not: why then doeſt thou oppreſs? wouldſt thou
not be defrauded? why then doſt thou defraud?
wouldſt thou not over-buy nor underſel? why doſt
thou then in the ſame kinds, go about to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach
thy brother?</p>
            <p>Brethren you do not know your own genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you live in, if you do not underſtand, how
commonly and how greedily men are every where
heaping up to themſelves the gains of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and for mercy there's little hope of finding
that, where righteouſneſs is departed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:153788:66"/>
And now Soul, where is thy victory over the
world? thou pretendeſt to Chriſt, takeſt thy ſelf
to be a beleiver, and hopeſt thou haſt choſen God
for thy portion, and renounced this preſent world;
what and yet lye for a little worldly advantage?
be unrighteous that thou mayſt be rich: ſell thy
conſcience for a penny, and bleſs thy ſelf in thy
good bargain? Hath the world ſuch power of thee,
that for its ſake thou wilt be thus falſe and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and cruel, and yet haſt thou overcome it?</p>
            <p>Is this thy Faith? is this your Chriſtianity, <hi>to be
diſciples of Chriſt ſo far as it may be for your profit?</hi> was
there any ſuch reſerve in your engagement to be
the Lords, <hi>Ile be thine ſo thou wilt abate me lying?</hi> I
will ſerve thee in any thing, ſo thou wilt allow
me, <hi>the gain of unrighteouſneſs?</hi> Ile profeſs thy name,
and ile pray and ile hear, and ile be godly in all
things wherein my <hi>gain is not concerned?</hi> In theſe
things the Lord pardon thy ſervant, in theſe things
let me have the liberty to be as other men, and in
any thing elſe command me what thou wilt?</p>
            <p>Brethren, be plain hearted throughout: be able
to ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 13. 18. We truſt that
we have a good conſcience, willing to live honeſtly in all
things:</hi> convince the world that you are none of
theirs, but are come out from among them, and
are of Chriſt indeed, by being in all things as he
was in the world, <hi>who did no ſin, neither was any guil
found in his mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Victory over the world ſtands, in a power to uſe
our worldly goods to their proper ends.</hi> What is there
on this ſide Hell, (ſin onely excepted) but being
well us'd, will prove our bleſſing? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28.
<hi>All things ſhall work together for good to them that love
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:153788:66"/>
God.</hi> What is there on this ſide Heaven, (grace
only excepted) but being ill uſed may degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
into a curſe? <hi>Pſal. 69. 22. Let their table be
made a ſnare and that which was given to them for their
wealth be an occaſion of falling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All things in the world, as they have their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
particular uſes, and intermediate ends, ſo
they have but one common end, in which they all
concenter. God who made man, hath made all
things elſe alſo for himſelf: and man only of all
theſe lower creatures, is made capable, both of
underſtanding the end to which all things are, and
of directing them to it, and accordingly is oblig'd
ſo to do.</p>
            <p>Then only may we be truly ſaid to enjoy what
we have, and are ſecur'd from the miſchiefs of it,
when we have ſo much power over it, as to <hi>uſe it
aright:</hi> he that hath not an heart to uſe what he
hath, and to uſe it well, is rather poſſeſs'd by it,
then the poſſeſſour of it: upon this account are
worldly men the worlds ſervants; ſervants of
their eſtates rather then the maſters of them: will
you call him a maſter that is under the command
of his ſervant? that cannot govern nor order nor
diſpoſe of himſelf, and what he has, but is alwaies
governed by it? when the world ſaies go he muſt
go, when this ſaies come he muſt come, when it
ſaies work he muſt work, and till it ſaies ſit ſtill,
he muſt not reſt; who muſt neither eat, nor drink,
nor give, nor lend, but where the world gives
him leave? who is a ſlave if this be a freeman?</p>
            <p>He that underſtanding his dominion of all that
is in his hand, and his way to uſe it aright, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
exerciſes his dominion, this man is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:153788:67"/>
Lord and the world his ſervant.</p>
            <p>Now (as I hinted but now) the proper end to
which all we have ſhould be laſtly directed, is God.
God made all things for himſelf; and he hath put
us in poſſeſſion that we may uſe them for him, for
whom they are made. All we have are our talents
intruſted in our hands by our Lord, with this
charge, <hi>Occupie till I come, Luk.</hi> 19. 13. Occupie
till I come, as thoſe that muſt give an account to
me when I come; <hi>that I may receive mine own with
advantage,</hi> v. 23. twill be but a lame account we
ſhall give of what we have received, if we bring
not in, every talent employed for God.</p>
            <p>We muſt work for God, and get for God, and
lay up for God, and lay out for God: he that works
for bread or for clothes, or for money; he that
works for wife or for children, and doth not
therein work for God; he that beſtows any thing
of what he has, on himſelf for food or raiment;
he that beſtowes any thing on his wife or his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
for their preſent proviſion, or their future
portions, and doth not beſtow it there for God, is
an evil ſteward and unfaithful to his truſt.</p>
            <p>And as we muſt <hi>work</hi> for God, and <hi>beſtow</hi> for
God, ſo we muſt <hi>keep</hi> for God and <hi>ſave</hi> for God:
A good ſteward muſt ſee there be no waſtes made
on his Lords eſtate. He muſt not ſave any thing
<hi>from God;</hi> when God calls for a peny, or a pound,
or all that he hath, he muſt let it go and keep no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
back.</p>
            <p>He muſt conſider, that God hath more mouthes
to feed, and more backs to clothe, then his own or
his families. There's a poor neighbour by thee,
that wants bread, go and feed him; there's a poor
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:153788:67"/>
orphane by thee, go and take care of him, and
what thou layeſt out, put it on account to me:
he muſt conſider, that God hath other wayes to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe
of his eſtate, then on backs and bellies;
There are a company of poor children by thee,
that are like to be bred up for Hell; to be bred
up in ignorance and profaneſs; go and be at
charges with them, put them to School, or help to
the diſpoſing of them, ſo that they may be bred
up as Chriſtians, in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord: and other like wayes has God for
the beſtowing what he has.</p>
            <p>He that muſt ſave for God, and ſee that there be
no waſt made, that nothing be ſpent upon ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
upon his pride upon his gluttonous appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
upon his vain companions; he that muſt not
be thus prodigal of his eſtate, to ſatisfie his own
or others luſts and humours, muſt neither be a
niggard, and think to ſave any thing from God:
<hi>He that ſpends and not for God, and he that ſaves from
God, will both prove but evil ſtewards.</hi> This ſaving
will in the end prove the greateſt waſting: as
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Math. 16. 25. He that ſaveth his life
ſhall loſe it;</hi> ſo upon the ſame account, he that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
his eſtate; he that ſaveth his bread or his
money, ſhall loſe it: there is not a ſhorter cut
to beggery, then ſinful parſimony: tis ill ſaving
from Gods poor: that bread thou ſaveſt from the
mouth of the poor, whom God would have thee
feed, that bread will become an eater; that peny
which ſhould have gone for an alms, may ruſt out
all thy pounds.</p>
            <p>Thou thinkeſt thou art more provident then
others, who are ſo free and liberal; and bleſſeſt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:153788:68"/>
thy ſelf in thy better husbandry; when God calls
for an alms thou ſhifteſt him off with an anſwer,
<hi>I have nothing for thee;</hi> when God calls for a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
almes, <hi>ſome of thy pounds,</hi> thou putteſt him off
with a <hi>peny or a groat;</hi> and then pleaſeſt thy ſelf to
think how well thou cameſt off, and what a good
husband thou haſt been; but boaſt not to ſoon.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, thou that art a prodigal of
thy eſtate, that ſwilleſt it down thy throat, that
ſpreadeſt thy table with it, or trimmeſt thy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs
or debaucheſt thy companions with it; thy
coſtly fare, thy gorgeous apparel, thy riotous
company, thy ſumptuous buildings, muſt devour
all thou haſt; what anſwer wilt thou give to thy
Lord, when he ſhall require thee, <hi>Give an account
of thy talents?</hi> how will thy account be taken
whereof this is the total ſumme, <hi>All ſpent in ſin
and vanity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things I have ſpoken, to give you a ſhort
account how we are to uſe our worldly comforts,
namely all for God: and he that hath power thus
to uſe the world; yea he that doth charge this on
himſelf, and is heartily reſolved on this courſe,
making it his ordinary care thus to diſpoſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and what he has; though in many things he
fall ſhort, and too often tranſgreſs his rule, may
without arrogance write himſelf, <hi>By the grace of
God, crucified with Chriſt and conquerour over the
world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtians, if theſe things were conſidered and
well weighed, how much would our bill of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
on our ſelves, and our fleſh be ſhortned;
and how greatly might it abound to our account?</p>
            <p>O how many ſuperfluities would be par'd off,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:153788:68"/>
even from ſuch of us, who have been the beſt ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
for God? How much is there daily waſted of
our Lords talents? how much of what we have,
doth our fleſh totally conſume, whereof the Lord
hath no ſhare at all? how much is there ſpent
daily, concerning which we cannot have the face
to ſay, <hi>this hath been ſpent for God?</hi> how much hath
been loſt to God by our full bellies and pamper'd
fleſh? Do we never eat to unweldineſs, drink,
though not to drunkenneſs, yet to drowſineſs?
how many times have we been chearing our ſelves
into ſottiſhneſs, recreating our ſelves into uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs,
whileſt we have pretended to be fitting
our ſelves for ſervice? how many a prayer and
praiſe hath the Lord loſt by a feaſt? we have been
feeding our wantonneſs, clothing our pride, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
up our ſelves into meer frothineſs and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
whileſt we have profeſſed to be refreſhing
and comforting our hearts for God.</p>
            <p>Hath not the Lord had the leſs for his bounty to
us? ſhould we not have been like to have ſerv'd
the Lord better in hunger and thirſt, then we
have ſometimes done, in the abundance of all
things?</p>
            <p>Have we indeed us'd all for God? our eſtates
for God? our liberties for God? our intereſt and
eſteem in the world for God? might not God
have been often better ſerv'd in a priſon, then we
have ſerv'd him in our liberty? might not God have
been better ſerv'd in our ſickneſs and weakneſs,
then we have ſerved him in our health and ſtrength?
hath not the Lord been often as it were forced to
reſolve concerning us, well I muſt even ſmite
them with ſickneſs, that they may ſerve me bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:153788:69"/>
I muſt take away their talents that they may
be better ſtewards!</p>
            <p>What uſe hath been made of that eſteem and
reſpect we have had from men? hath our care been,
what the reſolution of a worthy ſervant of Chriſt,
now with God, once was? <hi>I would</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
God to every inch of Ground I get upon the opinions
of men;</hi> I would make my advantage to be dealing
for God with them, to be pleading for God with
them, I would improve all my intereſt with them
ſo, that if it be poſſible, God may become of the
acquaintance of all my friends.</p>
            <p>Oh how very few of us are there, whoſe aim
and care is, to live at the rate and in the way that
God would have us live? who reſolve, <hi>Religion</hi>
ſhall have the whole ordering of me; this ſhall
chooſe my company and govern my whole beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
with them: this ſhall appoint me my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation;
this ſhall furniſh my houſe and my table;
ſhall appoint me the quality and limit the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
my daily food: this ſhall order me for my
habit, both the coſt and the faſhion of my raiment:
this ſhall direct me in the viſiting and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my friends: this ſhall ſet me my buſineſs, and
allow me my recreations; this ſhall meaſure my
daies and my nights, and ſet me my times for my
ſleep, my watch, and my work: this ſhall diſpoſe
of my eſtate while I live, and make my will when
I die. This ſhall give, my ſelf mine allowance,
my wife her dower, my children their portions,
and Gods children, his poor orphans theirs. I
would ſo feed, and ſo clothe and ſo recreate my
ſelf, ſo work and ſo reſt as God would have me. I
would never ſpend nor ſave but for the Lord. I
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:153788:69"/>
would viſit whom God would have me viſit, I
would entertain as God would have me entertain;
I would never viſit a friend, but to whom God
ſends me, nor entertain but as God bids me; I
would put it into the hands of the Lord to divide
mine eſtate; no more to my children, and no leſs
to his, then my conſcience tells me he would
have.</p>
            <p>O how few are there who are thus reſolved?
And why is it not thus with us? Oh theſe worldly
hearts hinder us; theſe put in for a ſhare; they
would carry all, but if that may not be, they will
divide with God: ſomething for thy ſelf, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for thy fleſh, ſomething for thy friends, and
let God take the reſt: and as the heart would
have it, ſo ordinarily it goes; inſomuch that it
often comes to paſs, that by that every one elſe
is ſerved, he to whom all is due, hath little or
nothing left; God ſhall be laſt ſerved, and by that
his turn comes the ſtore is ſpent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Oh theſe falſe and treacherous hearts! Is the
Lord our God or not? to whom do we owe any
thing but to him? is not all his? is not he Lord of
all? is there any thing in our hands, concerning
which we can ſay, this is mine own, this is none of
his. Do we not eat his bread and dwell in his hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and wear his clothes, <hi>his wooll and his flax?</hi> Is
not the earth the Lords and the fulneſs thereof?
and may he not require of his own what he will?</p>
            <p>And what doth the Lord require? doth he not
require all? doth God reſerve only <hi>a chief rent</hi> to
himſelf, and let the reſt go which way it will? hath
he allowed any part to be beſtowed on his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
would God, that the Divel and luſt go
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:153788:70"/>
ſharers with him? Do we not know and theſe
tongues confeſs, that all is his due and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
what then is this fleſh, what are theſe luſts,
that we ſhould hearken to them, when they put in
for a part?</p>
            <p>O rebuke and repell theſe imperious beggars:
you ſhall have a whip and a ſcourge, but no alms at
my door; you are none of the beggars that God
would have me feed &amp; clothe. Did God ever allow
me to clothe my pride or feed my covetouſneſs or
nouriſh this unruly and greedy appetite? away
away, nothing is allowed you, but a cup of cold
water to quench your flames. The Lord he is God,
the Lord he is God, my ſoveraign and ſupreme
proprietour? of him and through him and to him
are all things: his I am and to him I owe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
whatever I am or have; my ſtreams ſhall fall
into no other channells but what will convey
them into the Ocean: he is my Ocean who is my
fountain, O my God my ſprings do all riſe and
reſt in thee.</p>
            <p>O what a ſtrange change would this doctrine
and the practiſe of it make upon us: then we
ſhould live like Chriſtians indeed, and be able to
ſay with the Apoſtle <hi>Philip. 1. 21. To me to live is
Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O what exemplarie Chriſtians ſhould we be,
had we nothing to do but to bring forth fruit unto
God; how rich ſhould we grow were all our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to lay up treaſure in Heaven; how roundly
would the work of our ſalvation go on, were all
our works made to fall into this? what a tribute
of praiſe and honour would be raiſed to the name
of the Lord, if our united ſtreams ran all upward,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:153788:70"/>
how glorious ſhould the Lord be, if God ſhould
thus become <hi>all in all?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Victory over the world ſtands, in a power to want
the worlds good things, and to ſuffer the worlds evil
things, and to keep our hearts and our way, whether we
proſper or ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Philip. 4. 12. <hi>I know both how to be abaſed and how
to abound; every where and in all things I am inſtructed,
both to be full and to be hungry, to abound and to ſuffer
need.</hi> Tis one thing to know [what] tis to abound,
and what to want; and another thing to know
[how] to do both: it may be, though the Apoſtle
knew ſufficiently [what] tis to want and to be
hungry, yet he knew but little what tis to be full
and to abound; but he had learn'd [how] to want
and how to abound,</p>
            <p>To know how to want and how to abound, is
to know how to carry it as a Chriſtian in both
eſtates. Poverty and riches have each of them
their temptations. <hi>Prov. 30. 8. Leſt I be full and
deny thee, or leſt I be poor and ſteal and take the name of
my God in vain:</hi> both eſtates have their temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and he knew how to deal with either of them,
ſo that neither the one nor the other ſhould put
him beſides his duty, or draw him to any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>He is a Chriſtian, that neither, beholding to the
world for his religion (he hath other arguments
to perſwade him to be godly, then that godlineſs
is gain) and that will not be forc'd out of it, by
all that the world can give or take away: he that is
not beholding to the world for his religion, will
be the more like to be religious in ſpite of the
world: if the loaves were not they that drew him
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:153788:71"/>
to Chriſt, neither will the want of bread drive
him away; thoſe that come to Chriſt in hopes of
a temporal Kingdom, will when they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
diſappointed, go back from him again:
thoſe that found nothing but Chriſt to draw them
after him, will find nothing whileſt Chriſt is Chriſt
to draw them off.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtian counts Chriſt ſufficient: a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>reward</hi> and a ſufficient <hi>ſafeguard,</hi> enough to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
him and to ſecure him; and thereupon can
be content in all his wants and patient in all he
ſuffers: we ſeldom depart from God, but it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from diſcontent or impatience; either we
think it intolerable abiding with him, or at leaſt,
that we may have a better being elſewhere; our
turning aſide from God to the world, is in hopes
ſome way or other to mend our condition; either
to be better provided for or better pleas'd: when
God is accepted as a ſufficient portion, ſo that we
need not the world to make us happy, when God
is accounted our ſure refuge, ſo that we fear not
that the world can make us miſerable, then twill
be all one as to our godlineſs, whether the world
be with us or againſt us.</p>
            <p>He that can ſay <hi>God is my portion whether I want or
abound;</hi> I have never ſo much but I have need of a
God, I have never ſo little but a God will ſuffice;
He that can ſay <hi>God is my refuge whether I be in ſafety
or in danger;</hi> I am never in ſuch hazards but in
God I am ſecure, I am never ſo out of hazard but
I need his ſecurity; how little is it that the world
with all its glory on the one hand, or all its fury
on the other, can do upon that Soul? thou mayſt
then go on thy way rejoycing, thou mayſt ſerve the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:153788:71"/>
Lord without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs all
the dayes of thy life.</p>
            <p>He that knows and feels what God is, can want
or ſuffer what ever is in the world; in him he
finds a ſupply of every vacuity, and a ſalve for
every ſore; He that knows what pinching want
and piercing ſufferings are, will underſtand that
nothing but God can hold him up or bear him
through. You are miſtaken if you think, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
hardineſs and ſelf confidence will do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
divine ſupports in preſſing caſes. He that hath
this power, hath gotten it from above; he that
hath this power, may be whatever the Lord will
have him.</p>
            <p>Then are we more eminently endued with this
power when we have attained to,
<list>
                  <item>1. Self-denial under the greateſt opportunities
of ſelf-ſeeking or ſelf-ſatisfaction.</item>
                  <item>2. Contentment under the greateſt ſtraits.</item>
                  <item>3. Patience under the greateſt preſſures of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</item>
                  <item>4. Humility in the height of honour.</item>
                  <item>5. Magnanimity in the depth of danger or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.</item>
                  <item>6. Equanimity in the greateſt turns and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of our outward condition.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Self-denial under the greateſt opportunities of felf-ſeeking
and ſelf-ſatisfaction.</hi> Self-denial properly,
is the neglecting the intereſt, and the croſſing the
inclinations of our fleſh, in order to ſervice or
the preventing of ſin. Then onely ſelf-denial is a
vertue, or a duty, when our allowance of our fleſh
in its liberty, would be either <hi>a ſin, or an occaſion of
ſin, or an hindrance of duty;</hi> when it would be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:153788:72"/>
the advantages of the fleſh above the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and honour of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now by how much the greater our opportunity
to pleaſe our fleſh, by ſo much the greater ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
it is to deny it. He that <hi>might</hi> be full and yet
for Chriſts ſake is content to be empty; he that
might be rich and yet is content to be poor; he
that might live at eaſe or in honour, and yet for
Chriſts ſake is content to be vile or in trouble?
He that chooſes rather to be ſerviceable then
to be ſafe, to be holy then honourable, he that
upon the account of Chriſt, flyes from fleſhly
advantages when theſe fly after him, this is the
man.</p>
            <p>Tis a vertue to be quiet when <hi>Providence</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
us; to be content to be poor and in affliction,
when it comes unavoidably upon us: tis ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be able to ſay, <hi>I cannot help it and therefore
will be quiet.</hi> But when we can let <hi>Conſcience</hi> deny
us, let love to Chriſt, let zeal for God ſtraiten us,
when Providence allows us our liberty and our
fill, this is ſomething to purpoſe.</p>
            <p>To neglect the world when the world neglects
us or flyes from us; not to ſeek great things for
our ſelves, when we have no hope of obtaining;
not to mind the pleaſing our pride or our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
when we have not wherewith to maintain
them; to ſpare from our fleſh when we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſpend upon it; to faſt when we have no
bread, to put on ſackcloth when we have no better
raiment, not to contend for our wills when we ſee
we cannot have our wills, there is not ſo very
much in all this, though it be more then every one
hath attained to; But voluntarily to lay down all
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:153788:72"/>
at the foot of Chriſt, to part with all for the ſake of
Chriſt, when we might have even what we would
in a way of ſin; to keep our fleſh ſhort when it
is in our power to make it a larger allowance; this
is a great teſtimony how high the intereſt of Chriſt
is exalted, and how low the world is brought
in us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One great inſtance of this ſelf-denial, you may
read in</hi> Moſes, Heb. 11. 24. 25. By faith <hi>Moſes</hi>
when he came to years, refuſed to be called the ſon of
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter chuſing rathor to ſuffer affliction with
the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for
a ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Obſerve it, fairer opportunities of fleſh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
of living in the ſplendour of worldly glory,
and the Grandieur of a prime favourite in the
court, few of the ſons of men ever enjoy'd; he
was adopted the Son of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, nurs'd
up upon her knee and in her heart, and upon this
account, what his hopes and advantages might be,
tis eaſy to imagine.</p>
            <p>But at once he forſook all; he had a ſervice to
do for his God, and ſuch an affection to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, that away he goes, puts himſelf out
of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> favour, and caſts in his lot among his
ſuffering brethren.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conſider divers circumſtances, which
all heighten this noble inſtance.</p>
            <p>1. The circumſtance of time,</p>
            <p>[When he came to years] twas not a childiſh
folly, done when he was ſo young, that he knew
not what he did; but when he came to age, when
he came to underſtand himſelf; whileſt he was a
child, he ſuffered himſelf to be dandled on the lap
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:153788:73"/>
of theſe carnal pleaſures, but when he came to age,
and underſtood what theſe things were, and had
gotten thoſe higher things of the other world in
his eye; when he came to age he put away theſe
childiſh things: this world is a paradiſe only to
children and fools; pictures, and babies, and rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
will pleaſe children, men muſt have manly
delights; thou that art ſo taken with the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and dalliances of this world, thou that makeſt
thy ſelf ſport with images and rattles, when thou
comeſt to have the underſtanding of a man, thou
wilt wonder at thy childiſh folly.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>When he was (upon the matter) newly come to
age;</hi> a young man, in the prime and vigour of his
time; when he had but begun to taſt the ſweet of
his youthful pleaſures; the pleaſures of this l<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe
are moſt taking at the firſt taſting, the firſt draught
is the ſweeteſt; when they grow more common,
and ordinary, they ſour and become leſs ſavory.</p>
            <p>Oh how rare a thing is it, to ſee young men, in
their prime to diſguſt and deſpiſe the world: Old
men, whoſe ſtrength is gone, whoſe ſpirits are
dead, who have been glutted and tired out with
pleaſure, have loſt their appetite, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 35.
<hi>I am this day fourſcore years old, and can I diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
good and evil? can thy ſervant taſt what I eat or
drink; can I hear any more the voice of ſinging men, or
ſinging women?</hi> are theſe any longer a pleaſure to
me? the world ceaſes to be ſuch a temptation to
old men, it is a dead and a dry tree to them, in
the winter of their age, which look'd ſo green and
ſo beautiful in the ſpring of their youth.</p>
            <p>But behold <hi>Moſes</hi> whileſt he was a young man,
whileſt all look'd freſh and green, yet even then
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:153788:73"/>
he rejects it. Young men, you whoſe wanton and
ſprightful hearts cry in your ears, in the words of
the Preacher, <hi>Eccl. 11. 9. Rejoyce O young man in thy
youth, and let thine heart chear thee in the daies of thy
youth, walk in the way of thine own heart, and in the
ſight of thine own eyes;</hi> eat, drink, be merry, take
thy pleaſure, take thy liberty: Behold here's an
inſtance that preaches another Doctrine to you;
and what does it preach? the next Text you find
after the former, Chap. 12. 1. <hi>Remember thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
in the daies of thy youth.</hi> Remember my Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor?
ſo I will in time, I intend it hereafter; 'tis
for old men to be ſerious, the Grave will teach
gravity; I cannot be old while I am young, time
enough to think of the other world, when I am
leaving this; I am but newly come into the
world, I cannot receive my <hi>welcome,</hi> and my <hi>fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
together; I mean to think on God hereafter,
but you muſt give me leave to mind my ſelf, and
pleaſe my ſelf a while. No, no, 'tis another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Doctrine then this, <hi>Moſes</hi> though dead,
yet ſpeaketh; <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the daies
of thy youth;</hi> make thy preſent choice, and let this
be it, <hi>Chuſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people
of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi>
Oh that young men would ſet this Copy before
their eyes; ſee what this young <hi>Moſes</hi> did, and
do likewiſe.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to take the hint, and in a ſhort
digreſſion, to ſpeak a few words to young men, to
perſwade them to make <hi>Moſes</hi> his choice betimes,
to renounce the world, and to remember their
Creator in the daies of their youth, and to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
their firſt time to God. This I ſhall preſs to
by the following arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:153788:74"/>
1. <hi>Otherwiſe this is like to be the worſt time of their
lives.</hi> Such is the heat and ſtrength of their luſts,
that nothing but a God will be a bridle to them,
<hi>Jam. 3. 3. Behold we put bits in the horſes mouths.</hi>
What ruling an horſe without a bridle? what
bridle will hold theſe wild horſes, but <hi>the memory
of a God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some young men are ſo head-ſtrong, that
they catch the bit in their teeth, and run on their
courſe with full career; though God be ſet before
their eyes, and all the terrors of the Lord be put
as a bridle in their jaws, yet all will not do to
ſtop them, but on they run, as the horſe ruſheth
into the battel.</p>
            <p>Young men living without God, are as <hi>Eſau,
wild men;</hi> wild-headed and wild-hearted, they
run a wild Race.</p>
            <p>Young men will do more work for the Devil
in a day, then afterwards is done in many daies;
and therefore Satan uſes to hire his labourers <hi>in
the firſt hour of the day;</hi> when they are but newly
ſtarted out of the ſhell, he ſtands ready to preſs
them for hell. And O what haſte do they make on
their way? like ſwift Dromedaries, like the wild
Aſs, which none can tame, or turn her back.</p>
            <p>Youth is <hi>the Devils ſeed time.</hi> All the tares that
grow ripe in thine age, theſe were the ſeed of thy
youth; all the Frogs and Toads of the Summer,
were from the Spawn of the Spring.</p>
            <p>O friends, this world hath been afore-hand with
Chriſt, and is gotten firſt in, and there its buſie
in complementing your hearts, ſhewing you its
treaſures, entertaining you with its carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
inſinuating into your affections, captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:153788:74"/>
and intangling your ſouls, building Forts and
ſtrong holds againſt Chriſt, that he be not ſuffer'd
to enter, and filling you with all wickedneſs,
that you may become a loathing and abhomination
to him.</p>
            <p>O hearken, and open to the Lord, make room
for the King of glory, who ſtands at the door and
knocks: Will you ſay to him, <hi>Go away to day, and
come again to morrow,</hi> let Chriſt ſtand a while lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?
let his Enemy be firſt ſerved? let me be
wanton, and fooliſh, and fleſhly a while longer? I
am not vile enough yet, not wretched enough yet?
a little more of this madneſs, let me be a fool
and a beaſt a little longer, let this Luſt and this
Devil alone yet a while? let me be laid faſter in
the Stocks, let my priſon be double locked, let
my ſoul, and my life, and the everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
be brought to more deſperate hazards? a
few daies more of bondage and miſery, no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
yet, no Reconciliation yet, no pardon,
nor grace, nor hope; no God nor Chriſt come
here a while? will you ſpeak thus to the Lord?</p>
            <p>O open to Chriſt, this day open; while ſin is
yet but a youngling, while the world is yet but a
new Comer, before you be rivetted into ſuch
acquaintance and friendſhip with it, as may never
be broken off.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Youth is the fitteſt time.</hi> Young men have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
advantages which old men have loſt, and will
never recover; they have this threefold advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Youth is more docile and tractable.</hi> Old men
are more dull and hard to learn, more refractory
and hard to be perſwaded; therefore you know its
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:153788:75"/>
the practiſe of men to put theirs to Schools, and
to Trades, in their younger time. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 6.
<hi>Train up [a child] in the way that he ſhall go, and
when he is old he will not depart from it.</hi> What's the
reaſon that old men are ſo tenacious of their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
and wayes? O they were train'd up in
them of children.</p>
            <p>That which is learned in youth, is eaſier gotten,
and longer retained: Old mens capacities are
dull, and their memories ſlippery; they are hard
of hearing, and as hard to remember what they
hear. Old mens hearts are preoccupated, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
(as before) hath been before-hand with them;
they are ſo over-grown with tares, that the good
ſeed comes too late, to be like to take any root in
them.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Lord charges Parents, <hi>Eph.</hi>
6. 4. <hi>To [bring them up] in the nurture and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lord.</hi> In the morning ſow thy ſeed;
our evening is uſually the harveſt of our morning
ſeed; the luſts of youth are ripe in age, and the
graces of the Aged, are ordinarily the fruits that
are grown up out of the ſeed of their youth.</p>
            <p>Hence is it, that 'tis ſuch a bleſſing to be the
children of godly Parents: they have not only the
<hi>bleſſing of the Covenant,</hi> the promiſe entail'd upon
them: <hi>To</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeed was the promiſe
made;</hi> and therefore it was a bleſſing to be a child
of <hi>Abraham;</hi> but they have alſo <hi>the bleſſing of holy
Education; I know</hi> Abraham, <hi>that he will command
his children and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall
keep the way of the Lord, Gen. 18. 19. Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<hi>Timothy,</hi> or rather his Mother in him, that
he had <hi>of a child known the Scriptures, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 15.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:153788:75"/>
               <hi>David</hi> begun with <hi>Solomon,</hi> whileſt he was a young
man, 1 <hi>Chron. 28. 9. And thou Solomon my Son, know
thou the God of thy Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Lord charges parents to give holy
education, ſo is it the duty and the happineſs of
children to receive and ſubmit to it: a towardly
and tractable childhood promiſes a gracious and
fruitfull age. <hi>When he is old he will not depart from
it,</hi> that is, there's hopes he will not: tis true it
does not alwaies prove ſo; ſometimes there's too
much truth in that proverb, <hi>A young Saint and an
old Devil.</hi> Some there are, whoſe youth is the
winter that withers all the buds of their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
or at leaſt their age is the grave, that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
all the flowers of their youth: who however
it was with them, whileſt they were under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of inſtruction, and the reſtraint of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
no ſooner do they get their neck from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the yoke, and feel the reins of government
looſened, but preſently they grow wild and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;
and fall to pulling down what hath been
built, to rooting up what hath been planted, and
razing out thoſe holy principles they have ſuck'd
in, and ſo letting themſelves looſe to all manner
of rudeneſs and debaucherie: theſe are monſters;
a degenerate brood; and of all perſons in the
world, moſt likely, after this firſt ſtep from Saints
to brutes, to take their next from brutes to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.
O let all ſuch tremble, whoſe youthful luſts
have gotten the head of their religious education;
the Divel hath broken into Gods nurſery, and
ſnap'd off thoſe twigs, to engraff them in his own
Orchard, among thoſe trees that are only for
the fire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:153788:76"/>
I ſay, thus it may happen; (and look to it, that
this be the caſe of none of you) that thoſe who
have been trained up whileſt children, in the good
way of the Lord, depart from it when they are
come to age; yet there is ſuch a flexibleneſs in
young ones, and ſuch an aptneſs to receive and
retain the impreſſions of their holy education, that
there's great hope it may abide by them all their
daies. If it ſhould wear out, its uſually worſe
with ſuch, then with thoſe that have been born and
bred up in the dark; but there's hope it will
abide.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Youth is more vigorous and ſprightly;</hi> of warm
affection, and full of action; <hi>quicquid agit valde
agit,</hi> there's life in its action: it is not clog'd with
the infirmities, nor depreſs'd with the weakneſs
and unweldineſs that creeps on with age. In this
morning the Soul is free and freſh, the ſpirits
are quick and lively, the edge is ſharp and keen,
which in time grows more blunt and dull. We
may now both <hi>act</hi> more for God, and <hi>taſte</hi> more of
God; there would be more ſervice, and we
ſhould find more ſweetneſs in it, did we begin
betime, before our native warmth is cooled, and
our edge turned.</p>
            <p>What work do <hi>rude young men</hi> make in the
world? how much ſervice do they to the Devil in
a little time? laughing and mocking, drinking
and gaming, rioting and revelling, giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to laſciviouſneſs, to work all uncleanneſs
with greedineſs? what haſte do they make to undoe
themſelves? how hot are they in their luſts, how
heady in their wayes, how ſwiftly and violently
does the torrent run down towards the burning
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:153788:76"/>
lake? in how little time are the plants and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
rooted out, which had been ſetting and nurſing
up all their time, and how ſuddenly are their
weeds ſprung up, and how rank are they grown?
what might not this heat and activity have brought
forth to God, had it been but ſet right? how
greatly might God have been honoured, how much
might Souls have been advanced, what a treaſure
might have been layd up in Heaven, had the ſtream
in this ſpring-tide been running towards God,
as it hath been towards Hell?</p>
            <p>You that have thus fooliſhly loſt your ſeaſon,
and run out the flower of your dayes, oh be
aſhamed and bewail your loſs; you that have yet
your day before you, be warned, let others folly
make you wiſe: know in your ſeaſon what a price
you have in your hand.</p>
            <p>O 'tis pity ſuch a treaſure ſhould be loſt and
waſted: what is God, that he muſt have only the
laſt and worſt? Sin and the world muſt have the
firſt and beſt, and only the lees and dregs left for
him, to whom all is due; the Devil muſt have our
marrow, and if God will accept our dry and weary
bones, that's all we ordinarily deſign for him.</p>
            <p>Brethren, how many of our morning hours are
already run out, and what hath the Lord had of
them? how few <hi>early Chriſtians</hi> are there of us?
who of us are there that came along into the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
at the firſt hour of the day? we think the laſt
hour the beſt, and enough for our work; ſoon
enough to come into the vineyard, when we are
going out of the world; we will not bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
and heat of the day, but chooſe rather to
come in the cool of the evening. Unworthy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:153788:77"/>
weele firſt make our ſelves good for nothing,
and then weele be the ſervants of God.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Young men have day before them:</hi> he that hath
a long journey to go, had need ſet out early; he
that hath much work to do had need be at it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times:
he that goes an Apprentice to a trade when
he is old, is not like to do any great matter at it;
either to get any great skill, or to make any great
gain: they are never like to come to much, who
are ſo long ere they come to any thing: the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of a Chriſtian is long, <hi>vita brevis iter longum;</hi>
the work of a Chriſtian is great. Young men, if
you would come to Chriſt this day, the youngeſt of
you would find work enough, to hold him the
longeſt day he has to live: theſe ſtrong holds which
have been ſo long a fortifying againſt Chriſt, will
not be batter'd down in a day; your evil cuſtoms
and evil habits which have been ſo long growing
and rooting in you, will require time to be well
changed and rooted out; grace and peace and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
are ordinarily the fruits of many years
labour and travail: when you have wrought your
ſelves out of work, then wiſh you had ſtaid lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
out of the vineyard.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The firſt time is the acceptable time.</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 2.
<hi>Behold now is the accepted time, behold now is the day of
ſalvation.</hi> The preſent ſeaſon is the bleſſed ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
[the accepted time] that is the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you may be accepted, and which God will take
well at your hands, if you will accept. Now you
may be accepted, for behold he calleth you; tis
a queſtion whether hereafter you may or no: if
you will not accept to day, it may be God will
not accept to morrow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:153788:77"/>
Its very acceptable to the Lord, he likes it, and
takes it well at our hands that we give him a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
anſwer: delaies are as unpleaſing to him, as
they are dangerous to us: Wilt thou ſay, when he
calls thee, <hi>ſuffer me firſt to go and bid them farewell
that are at my houſe?</hi> yea wilt thou ſay, when he
ſaies come and be my ſervant, ſuffer me firſt to go
and ſerve my belly and my appetite, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I will be thine? ſuffer me firſt to get me
an eſtate, to get more money or lands and then I
will be for getting grace? how do ye think God
will take ſuch an anſwer?</p>
            <p>The Lord loves to ſee a willing people; of a
ready and forward mind; that will offer up their
firſt fruits unto God. Tis recorded to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
honour of that good King <hi>Joſiah 2 Chron.</hi> 34. 3.
That <hi>in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet
young, he began to ſeek after the God of David his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
He was but 16. years old, when he began to
look heavenward; and you may perceive how
well the Lord took it, by his recording the very
year.</p>
            <p>O it is a pleaſant thing to ſee the buds of grace
putting forth in the morning of nature; to ſee men
growing up in grace, as they grow up in ſtature;
this is by ſo much the more beautiful, by how
much the more rare and ſeldom found. A godly
young man is a Jewel, that ſparkles forth a luſtre,
among all the gravel and pebbles of the earth:
what a vaſt difference is there, betwixt an humble
meek ſober gracious young man or woman, and
the rude proud wanton riotous brutiſh of that age?
Old age is a crown, and this crown will be much
more glorious, if it be deck'd with the flowers of
the ſpring.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:153788:78"/>
4. <hi>If the Devil hath the firſt time, he'l endanger
to have the laſt too.</hi> 'Tis ſeldome ſeen, that thoſe
that paſs over their youth and their ſtrength, in
the ſervice of ſin, do ever become the ſervants of
God at laſt: thoſe that ſtand out againſt Chriſt, to
their laſt day, do moſtly ſtand it out in their laſt
day. How ſeldome do we hear of an old over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
ſinner, ever prove a ſincere Convert at
laſt?</p>
            <p>The experiences of the Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
do teſtifie, that the ſucceſs of their Miniſtery
is ordinarily moſt upon the younger ſort; a twig
is more eaſily bow'd, or pluck'd up, then an old
tree: if thy heart be too hard for the Word, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
it is young and tender, how difficult will the
caſe be, when its brawn'd and cruſted by age?</p>
            <p>Zophar <hi>in</hi> Job, <hi>ſpeaking of an old ſinner ſayes,
Job</hi> 20. 11. His bones are full of the ſin of his youth,
which ſhall lie down with him in the duſt. <hi>Obſerve
here theſe two things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That age doth often pay the ſcores of youth;
the pains of age are often the reward of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of youth; the wantonneſs of youth is often
revenged by the weakneſs and diſeaſes of age;
mens aged bones do remember them of their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
marrow. Sinners, though you think you can
never fill your bellies with your luſts, while you
are young, yet God will fill your bones with them
when you are old; and 'twill be but a ſad meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when <hi>young ſins and old bones meet together.</hi> O
what a ſtrange difference will there be betwixt
feeling our aged aking bones, <hi>full of the duties of
our youth,</hi> our prayings, watchings, faſtings, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and ſufferings, and having them <hi>fill'd with our
youthful luſts</hi> and lewdneſs?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:153788:78"/>
2. Where ſin breaks its faſt and dines, it often
ſups and lodges, it lies down with him in the duſt.
If timely repentance do not lay thy ſin in the duſt,
when thou art young, vengeance is like to lay it
down with thee in the duſt when thou art old. <hi>[It
ſhall lie down with him in the duſt.]</hi> A dreadful
word; the meaning is, it ſhall never be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or done away, he ſhall carry his ſins out of the
world with him, as he liv'd, ſo he dies.</p>
            <p>'Tis ill having ſin <hi>thy bed-fellow;</hi> 'tis ill ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one night in unrepented ſin; but O what will
it be to have all thy wickedneſſes, <hi>thy companions
in the grave?</hi> 'tis a wretched thing to live in ſin,
but beware of dying in ſin: whileſt the Worms
eat up thy fleſh, theſe Vultures ſhall gnaw upon
thy ſoul.</p>
            <p>Young ſinner, take heed of going on in the
hardneſs of thine heart: If the Word of Life do
not part thee and thy ſins, death ſhall not part
you, the grave ſhall not part you: Death ſhall
part betwixt thy body and thy ſoul, betwixt thy
ſins and their pleaſures, betwixt thy ſins and their
gains; but it ſhall never part betwixt thy ſins and
thy ſoul, they die with thee, and are buried with
thee, and they ſhall riſe with thee, and become
the fuel of that fire that ſhall burn to the bottom
of Eternity.</p>
            <p>Well now at length what ſay you young men?
when for God and the other world? when for
wiſdome, ſobriety, chaſtity? when for Religion
in earneſt? now, or not till hereafter? will you
yet be ſo unworthy as to give your marrow to the
Devil, and reſerve nothing but dry bones for the
Lord? will you offer up your firſt fruits to <hi>Bacchus</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:153788:79"/>
and <hi>Venus?</hi> will you burn out your Candle to
light you on in your noyſome lewdneſs, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be ſweet till you be conſumed into a ſtinking
ſnuff?</p>
            <p>How few are there that will hearken? what
wild creatures, wild Aſſes Colts are the moſt of
the youth of the earth? what a wanton waſtful
luxurious looſe Age is this firſt Age? It cannot
be ſaid, as to <hi>Iſrael, Jer. 2. 2. I remember the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of thy youth, and the love of thine Eſpouſals;</hi> but
I remember the luſts of thy youth, the lewdneſs,
and the madneſs, and the wantonneſs of thy youth;
art thou willing it ſhould be hereafter thus ſaid
to thee?</p>
            <p>Remember now thy Creator, and ſee if that
will not hold thee to another courſe. Doſt thou
not want a bridle in this unruly age? what bridle
but the memory of a God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remember that there is a God.</hi> Thou runneſt on

thou art wilful and obſtinate in thy way, and wilt
not be turned back; thou ſayeſt in thine heart,
my tongue is mine own, my time is mine own,
my eſtate is mine own, <hi>who is Lord over me?</hi> But
remember there is a God.</p>
            <p>Thou committeſt thy wickedneſs it may be <hi>in

there is a God.</p>
            <p>Thou deſpiſeſt wiſdome as folly, thou hateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
ſeriouſneſs is thy ſcorn, ſobriety thy

good ſpeak to the wind, or the ſtones of the earth;
tell thee of Death, or of Judgment, as good tell

or a Chriſtian friend warn thee, and how
are they either ſlighted or laugh'd out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
But remember that there is a God.</p>
            <p>Thou wilt know no other heaven but below;
thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf in the earth, in thy pleaſures,
in thy companions, and canſt fancy no other hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs

            <p>
               <hi>Remember and return to thy God;</hi> remember and
repent; remember God, and then run on if thou
dar'ſt, be a drunkard if thou dar'ſt, be a wanton
if thou dar'ſt, be a worldling if thou dar'ſt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thy God and repent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remember thy Creator [now in this day of thy youth.]</hi>
If ever, why not now? Is not this the fitteſt
time? Is not this the accepted time? May not

poliſhed ſtones for his Temple; who hath cur'd
you of your madneſs, and made you the children

from the vile, fetch'd you out from the rude Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and thoſe Potſheards of the earth, wherein
there is no pleaſure, and mark'd you up for his
Veſſels of Honor: What day the Lord goes forth
among the wild Herd, and takes out here and
there one of the company, he ſaith, <hi>Theſe ſhall be
for me;</hi> this young man, or this young woman
ſhall be mine; <hi>they ſhall be mine in the day wherein

and the pit ſwallow them up.</p>
            <p>Yet ſay, young man, of which number wilt
thou be? <hi>of the taken, or the left?</hi> wilt thou along

<hi>Take me, or leave me? let me be thine, or leave me to

forſake all; 'tis but a ſhort ſtep from a little to
nothing: he can take no great harm in a fall, who
alwayes ſits on the ground; want will never much
pinch thoſe who never underſtood plenty; 'tis no
ſuch hard change, to be caſt from the Cottage to
the dunghill: we poor little ones, if we had
hearts, might ſay we have not opportunities, to
leave much for God; 'tis thoſe who dwell on
high, whoſe Mountains are exalted among the
tops of the Mountains of the earth, and that have
had their Neſt among the Stars, 'tis theſe are like

            <p>3. <hi>The circumſtance of his Obligations. Pharaoh's</hi>
Daughter had ſtrangely oblig'd him, had ſav'd his
life, took him up an abject Infant, and adopted
him for her Child, given him Princely breeding,
and ſet her heart upon him as her own: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the ingenuity of his Nature could not but
plead with him thus: Unworthy unthankful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
what art thou meditating? whither art thou
going? a running away from her, whoſe pity gave
thee thy life? who pittied thee, and loved thee?
who loved thee, and took thee in? who took thee
in, and bred thee up? what art thou? what haſt
thou, that ſhe may not juſtly call her own? and
wilt thou thus requite that pity, love, bounty,
which thou canſt never recompence? what a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
wilt thou become, mark'd out for infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:153788:81"/>
an unworthy, unthankful, diſingenuous, ill
natur'd man? whither wilt thou cauſe thy ſhame
to go? oh how would ſuch ſuggeſtions gall and
gravel an ingenuous ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Well, but <hi>Moſes</hi> breaks through all; let my
fame be infamy, let me be accounted any thing,
unworthy, unkind, fooliſh, or any thing that's
worſe; God is worthy, for whoſe ſake I ſhould
bear all this; and away he goes.</p>
            <p>'Tis not the leaſt of temptations which lies on
ſome mens ſpirits, and which unhappily keeps
them from Chriſt, that they ſhall diſcontent their
friends, diſoblige their dear Relations, ſeem to
put a ſlight upon the love, and kindneſs, and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
reſpects of thoſe, whom they have lov'd as
their own ſouls; if I take this courſe, if I fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this uncouth diſcountenanced reproach'd way,
what will they call me? how will they look on
me? how ſhall I look my Father in the face, or
my Husband, or my Wife in the face? what will
become of the eſteem, and affection, and dearneſs
which now I have with all my intimates, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance?
what ſhall I be accounted? with
whom ſhall I be reckon'd? how ſhall I bear up
under thoſe evil reflections, and thoſe unworthy
imputations, that I cannot but expect?</p>
            <p>But now a reſolved Chriſtian will weigh the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide too: But how ſhall I look God in the
face? how ſhall I look Chriſt in the face, if upon
ſuch grounds I refuſe to hearken to him? who
hath been ſuch a friend as God hath been to me?
who hath loved me as Chriſt hath loved me? who
hath done for me as he hath done for me? who
hath laid down his life for me? who muſt ſave
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:153788:81"/>
my ſoul from death? how ſhall I look God in the
face, if this be all I have to ſay, I would have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
thee Lord, I would have hearkened to
thee, but my Father and Mother would have been
angry then, my Husband or Wife would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it unkindly, I ſhould have diſpleaſed my
friends, they would have counted me a fool, or a
mad man, or unkind, or unthankful, if I had hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
to thee? Oh I remember what he hath ſaid,
Mat. 10. 37. <hi>He that loves Father or Mother more
then me, he that loves Son or Daughter more then me,
is not worthy of me.</hi> He that forſakes not Father
and Mother cannot be my Diſciple; therefore I
have no more to ſay, my Friends are dear, my
Husband is dear, my Wife is dear to me, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in their love, and I would not their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
I would not worthily be counted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
or unkind, or diſreſpectful, or undutiful
to any of them; but God is more then all.</p>
            <p>My friends, if you will go along with me, if
you will to Chriſt with me, if you will be for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
with me, (and oh that you would) come
along, let's along to Chriſt together, let me have
your company to heaven; oh that I could pray
you thither, oh that I could perſwade you thither,
I love you ſo well, that I am loath we ſhould part
companies; if you will go along with me, if I
may be the Lords, and yet be yours, I am much
more yours then ever; but if this be the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of your love, you will love me ſo I love not
Chriſt, you will be my friends, ſo the Lord be
not my friend; you will reſpect me, and eſteem
me, ſo I will deſpiſe and diſreſpect holineſs;
you will be for my company, ſo I be not for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:153788:82"/>
or ſo I will not go ſo far, or ſo faſt that way;
if this be the condition of your love, <hi>ſtay with us,</hi>
do as we do, live as we live, be merry, be vain,
take thy pleaſure, take thy liberty as we do, and
we will love thee; if you will not love me on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
terms, then farewell to you all, and to all
your love: I have learn'd what this meaneth, he
that loveth Father or Mother more then Chriſt, is
not worthy of him; he that loveth favour or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
more then Chriſt, is not worthy of him;
and till you can make it out, that you have oblig'd
me, more then Chriſt hath oblig'd me; that your
love will be better to me, then the love of Chriſt;
that reſpect from men will be better to me, then
acceptance with God, you muſt give me leave to
run the hazard of loſing ſuch friends, whom I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
keep without loſing God, and my ſoul.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Circumſtance.</hi> But when he went from <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>
Court, <hi>whither</hi> went he? when he left the
boſome of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter, to whom did he
joyn himſelf? why to a company of poor bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that were labouring at the brick Kilns; and
not to be a Taskmaſter, or Ruler among them;
but to take his lot of ſuffering with them, <hi>chuſing
rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now lay all theſe circumſtances together; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
that had been bred up, and liv'd in the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
of a Prince, and might have ſo continued;
<hi>when he came to age,</hi> and underſtood what the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of worldly greatneſs were; when he had
his ſenſes quick about him, and could make the
higheſt experiment what the ſweetneſs of worldly
pleaſures was, in the higheſt Spring-tide of
worldly luſts and temptations; when 'twas high
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:153788:82"/>
water without, and his youthful blood was moſt
aflote within; when he had time before him, to
make the moſt of the worlds favours; who had
never known what an harder and lower condition
meant; who had been ſo ſtrangly obliged, by ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
favours, and could not but be ſtrongly promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
from principles of ingenuity, not to ſlight
ſuch favoures: in the midſt of all theſe temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for the ſervice of his God, and from his
affection to his brethren, he voluntarily, not upon
force but of choice, diſrob'd himſelf of all his
glory, and eſpouſed the ſufferings of his brethren;
<hi>eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches then the
treaſures in</hi> Egypt. <hi>v.</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>O brethren how may we be filled with wonder?
and which of the two wonders are the greateſt,
<hi>Moſes</hi> his ſelf-denial, or our denial of Chriſt? <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
his comming off in ſo great a floud of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or our being ſo ordinarily overcome in
thoſe little temptations which daily occurre?
how little is it that we do or can deny our ſelves in
for Chriſt? what have we forſaken, or what are we
willing to forſake for Chriſt? upon what incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
termes have Chriſt and our Souls ſo often
parted? what cheap duties will we not do? what
cheap ſins will we not abate? what ſmall tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are hearkned to, when Chriſt cannot be
heard?</p>
            <p>How often have we neglected to reprove a ſin,
for fear of looſing a friend? how often have we
neglected to ſpeak of God, for fear of diſpleaſing
our company? how often have we denyed conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that we might not deny our luſts? what ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
pleaſures, that our hearts have been luſting
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:153788:83"/>
after; what ſinful gains, that our eyes have been
ſet upon; what pleaſant morſels, that our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
have been craving, have we been able to deny
them? how do we let conſcience lye at the mercy
of every luſt? if luſt will but crave, it muſt be
granted whatever become of conſcience.</p>
            <p>If the name of Chriſt ſhould prevail no more in
Heaven, then it ordinarily doth on earth; if God
ſhould ſo ordinarily deny thoſe prayers, we offer
up in Chriſts name, as we deny thoſe precepts,
which in the ſame name are ſent down to us, we
ſhould have as little hopes towards Heaven, as the
Lord hath honour on earth.</p>
            <p>We grudge, we murmur, we quarrel with God,
if he deny us in any thing, croſs us in any thing,
and yet how many denyals muſt he bear from us,
and be patient? 2 <hi>King. 5. 13. If the Prophet had
bid thee do ſome great thing, wouldeſt thou not have
done it? how much more when he ſaith, waſh and be
clean?</hi> If it had been ſome great thing the Lord
had required of us; (that it is not) all we have is
but a little: if it had been ſome great thing,
twere a ſhame to deny it to God; but when ſuch
little things can't be granted, not a word ſpoken
ſometimes, in a whole day together; not an alms
given, not a vain pleaſure abated, not a wanton
faſhion laid aſide; not a proud look, or a froward
tongue, or a wanton eye, or a greedy appetite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
at his word; when we fail in ſuch little
things, what ſhould we have done had we ſtood in
<hi>Moſes</hi> his ſtead?</p>
            <p>Brethren, when we are led aſide from a ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying,
to a fleſh pleaſing life, we are ready to ſay
to thoſe that reprove us for it, Oh you do not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:153788:83"/>
know my temptations; if you were in my circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
you might have done the like. But you do
know <hi>Moſes</hi> his temptations; and if you had had
more of <hi>Moſes</hi> heart, you would not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
ſo much of great temptations.</p>
            <p>Beloved, you that dwell in your ſieled houſes,
lodg in your warm, and eaſy beds, are clothed in
your ſoft and coſtly raiment; fed at your full ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
cheared by the countenance and courteſies
of your friends; compaſſed about with your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations
of all ſorts; when you can chooſe
rather a poor cottage, an hard lodging, rough or
ragged garments, hungry meals, hard uſage, from
friends and enemies; when you can chooſe all
this, rather then ſin againſt Chriſt; when upon a
little ſin, all your comforts might be continued to
you, there's that ſelf-denial, that will prove, that
you can live without being beholding to the world
for its good will, or without fear of its ill will.</p>
            <p>2. Contentment in greateſt ſtraits, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11, 12.
I have learned in whatſoever eſtate I am, to be content.</p>
            <p>[In whatever eſtate] whether I have little or
much, ſomething or nothing, ſtill content: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
is the heart at eaſe, our well pleaſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with our condition, without quarrelling at
our lott, without murmuring againſt God, and
without ſelf-tormenting vexations. Thoſe whoſe
God is the world, cannot long be quiet: the
world like the moon, waxes and wanes; the world
like the Sea, ebbs and flowes; and the heart of
the worldly is like their God, <hi>Iſa. 57. 20. The
wicked are as the troubled ſea, that cannot be at reſt:</hi>
when tis full ſea there's a little ſtand; but when
the tide turns, away their reſt ſwims down the
ſtream.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:153788:84"/>
The world is too little when at fulleſt, to fill
the heart; this Sea is to narrow when at broadeſt,
to extend it ſelf paralel to our expatiating deſires,
<hi>Iſa. 28. 20. The bed is ſhorter then that a man can
ſtretch himſelf on it, the covering narrower then that he
can wrap himſelf in it.</hi> The wide Ocean to the heart
of man, is but as the narrow Seas; he can drink
it up and be thirſty ſtill: when it hath ſpent its
ſtore upon him, that's the voice, <hi>what no more? Is
this all.</hi> But what is the world to content a Soul,
when tis <hi>low water?</hi> What reſt can there be, when
ever and anon the banks will be empty?</p>
            <p>God is the ſame; enough and he changeth not:
the <hi>manifeſtations</hi> of God are unequal; ſometimes
bright and ſometimes dimmer; ſometimes he is
ſeen, and ſometimes out of ſight: and hereupon
there is ſometimes leſs quiet in the hearts of the
<hi>Saints,</hi> then at other times; but whileſt the heart
feels that God is there, there's no want. Diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
there may be, but tis not whither the world
ebbs or flows, but whether God be preſent or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
that makes the change upon the Spirit: let
God be with me, and then let the world be with
whom it will: let me have an houſeful or but an
handful, tis all one as to my Soul contentment.
A Chriſtian is as little beholding to the world for
his <hi>contentment,</hi> as he is for his <hi>godlineſs;</hi> and that
ſure is little enough: as he will be godly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
asking leave of the world, ſo he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
whether the world will or no: godlineſs
and contentment grow both together; as much as
you find of the one, ſo much of the other: if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
be but ſmall, godlineſs is not great;
they grow both together, and the ſame root bears
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:153788:84"/>
them both. Godlineſs comes down from Heaven,
and never did contentment ſpring up out of the
earth; they have the ſame fountain, both come
<hi>from the Father of lights,</hi> Jam. 1. 17.</p>
            <p>You that are ordinarily male contents, look to
it that you be not ſtrangers from God; if there be
any thing, yet ſure there's but little of God in you,
that need ſo much of the world to keep you quiet:
if this be it that can [only] ſtill you, look to it,
this is ſtill your God. Oh what reſtleſs Spirits for
the moſt part have you? never well, never at reſt:
what's the matter? what is there wanting? what
would quiet you? A better houſe? a greater eſtate?
better trading? kinder neighbours? And can you
not be content as you are? content without all
theſe? muſt you be rich? muſt you have all to your
mind, or you will ſtill be thus angry? go ſerve the
world then, and take it for your God, ſay no more
the Lord is my portion, if he be not enough to
content you.</p>
            <p>Contentment in God will be one of the beſt
evidences of your conqueſt over the world: he
is a Chriſtian of proof, <hi>that cannot be content with
the world, and yet can be content without it:</hi> that
cannot be contented with the world, when he
hath moſt of it; and yet can be content when he
hath the leaſt of it, yea can be content without it,
if God be his.</p>
            <p>If the world can content you, to be ſure it can
command you; if you make it your pay-maſter it
will be your task-maſter: whither will not men
go, what will they not do for contentment?</p>
            <p>Why run we ſo often from God, but for our
contentment? what ſeek we in our fields, in our
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:153788:85"/>
beds or among our companions, but our content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
company to pleaſe us, pleaſure to content
our minds? We miſtake the ground; content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
does not grow in any of theſe fields, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
there we are digging for it; and we never
bethink our labour for any thing that will promiſe
us, <hi>Ile content thee for thy pains:</hi> this the world pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
<hi>I'le content thee, I'le content thee;</hi> and as
long as we dare take its word, it has us ſure enough
for ſervants: once find your miſtakes; hear
riches ſay, <hi>'tis not in me,</hi> hear pleaſures ſaying,
<hi>'tis not in me,</hi> hear friends ſaying, <hi>God help thee to
a contented mind, we cannot,</hi> hear the whole world
ſaying, <hi>theres no ſuch plant in all my gardens;</hi> thou
mayſt go from plant to plant, from flower to
flower, till thou haſt tryed all my ſtore, and never
find contentment amongſt them all; tis in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
field, in the other world, the paradiſe of God;
ſend thy heart thither for it, purchaſe that field,
and there dwell and ſatisfy thy Soul. Once hear
every creature, every condition telling thee thus,
tis not in me to content thee, tis from within,
tis from above that thy contentment muſt come;
and then, when thou ſeeſt that all the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
content thee, what wants of any thing the
world hath will diſcontent thee? whatever it be
the fruition whereof cannot content, its want
need not diſcontent us.</p>
            <p>O what a conſtant calm and ſerenity ſhould we
feel in our ſpirits? what ſteadineſs would appear
in our lives? what triumph over the World, and
all its changes, did we feel this truth in our hearts?
<hi>In God alone my contentment lies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh how much below the excellency and the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:153788:85"/>
ſweetneſs of ſuch a life do we live? how hard to
be pleas'd? how ſoon out of patience? what a
ſmall matter will put our hearts upon the Rack?
Some there are that are <hi>ever male-contents,</hi> there's
no condition that can keep them quiet, if they
be the greateſt Candidates of Providence, they
are ſtill murmuring; they not only know not how
to want, or to be croſs'd, or to be in ſtraits, but
neither how to abound; they are never well f<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

nor faſting, but will be ſtill picking quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
even with their moſt plentiful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous
ſtate; they will be vexing and fretting
themſelves for they know not what, though they
can ſcarce tell what they would have more, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then they have, yet they are angry that
'tis thus; what pleaſes them to day, they nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
to morrow; theſe are their own peſts, the
moſt miſerable of men.</p>
            <p>But vvhen vve are in ſtraits indeed, vvhen Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
does frovvn upon us, and keeps us lovv
and ſhort of vvhat our minds deſire, then hovv
fevv of us can ſay, <hi>It is well?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Brethren, look not on diſcontent as a little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
that vve ſhould count it but a ſmall thing for
God to ſave our ſouls, unleſs he vvill pleaſe our
ſenſes; that vve ſhould count it but a ſmall thing,
that God ſhould give us our lives, unleſs he alſo
give us our vvills; as if nothing vvould pleaſe us,
unleſs the Lord vvill ſet us on the Throne, and
let us carve for our ſelves, and be Governours of
the vvorld.</p>
            <p>A diſcontented perſon ſayes, 'Tis but little
that God hath done for me, 'tis but little that God
hath given to me; he hath but given Chriſt to me,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:153788:86"/>
he hath but pardoned my ſins, he hath given me
nothing but Heaven and everlaſting glory; what
Blaſphemy is here? Ah Wretch! doſt make a
<hi>But</hi> of Chriſt, a <hi>But</hi> of Pardon and Salvation?
thou haſt reaſon enough to fear, that Chriſt and
Life is none of thine, who makeſt ſo little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
thereof.</p>
            <p>Think not that <hi>miſchief</hi> little which diſcontent
will bring forth; how great things will this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
thing do? Whence are all our wandrings from
God after ſin, after vanity, but from a preſent
diſcontent with our condition? whence is envy?
whence is covetouſneſs? whence are frauds, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
robberies, but from hence, that we are
not content with our own? Whence is that luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and running out after fleſhly liberty, after
unlawful pleaſures, after an eaſier and looſer life,
but from this, that we think to mend our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to make our ſelves happier then Religion
allows us to be.</p>
            <p>Is that little, which makes God little, and
Chriſt little, and the everlaſting Kingdome little,
and ſends us to the Devil to inlarge our quarters
which God allovvs us?</p>
            <p>To cloſe up this, I ſhall give you a ſhort and
more diſtinct vievv.</p>
            <list>

            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>The evils and miſchiefs of diſcontentment</hi> (as
hath been already in part hinted) are theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovving.</p>
            <p>1. It denies Gods ſufficiencie; <hi>it ſayes,</hi> In the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of [his] ſufficiency I am in ſtraits. <hi>Diſcontent
argues want, or elſe</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:153788:86"/>
2. <hi>It impeaches Gods goodneſs and bounty.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is with him in the houſe, yet there's no good
houſe-keeping: If in my Fathers houſe there be
bread enough, yet he keeps me ſhort enough, I
have but little, the Lords hand hath been ſhortned
to me.</p>
            <p>As we go along, conſider Brethren, whether
you would not be aſhamed thus to ſpeak; and yet
is not this the voice of your diſcontented hearts?
If God ſhould challenge us, as he did <hi>Iſrael, Jer.</hi>
2. 5. <hi>What iniquity have ye found in me?</hi> Or as <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi>
3. 6. <hi>O my people what have I done to thee,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
have I wearied thee? how have I uſed thee?
Come forth, teſtifie againſt me. Or as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
ask'd <hi>Hadad, 1 King. 11. 22. What haſt thou lacked
with me,</hi> that thou wilt be gone? If the Lord
ſhould ask us thus, Diſcontent would anſwer, Yes
I have lacked, thou haſt been an hard Maſter to
me, thou wilt not let me have my will; this I
have lacked, and that I have lacked, I have been
ſtraitned in the Lord, he hath been a <hi>Wilderneſs, and
a Land of darkneſs</hi> to me. Though Conſcience
muſt ſay with <hi>David, The Lord is my Shepherd, I
want nothing,</hi> yet this male-contented heart will
ſtill be complaining.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Hereupon it rebels,</hi> and will not ſtand to Gods
allowance: When God will not ſatisfie, we fall
to ſharking and ſhifting for our ſelves: Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with our lot (as I ſaid before) lies at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of all our unlawful carving for our ſelves;
hence is covetouſneſs, hence is fraud, oppreſſion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe we are not content with Gods allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>It diſgraces godlineſs.</hi> Whatſoever is boaſted
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:153788:87"/>
of it, that its <hi>wayes are the wayes of pleaſantneſs, and
all its paths are peace; that the merchandiſe thereof is
better then ſilver, and its gain then gold; that its a tree
of life; that length of daies, riches and honours, attend
upon it;</hi> as <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. Whatever the Scriptures
ſpeak, and mens mouths ſpeak, of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
the ſweetneſs, and ſatisfaction that a godly
life brings in, a diſcontented heart denies all, and
tells the World there's little in it: Peace, and
joy, and gain, and ſatisfaction, where is it? there
is not enough to keep the heart in any tolerable
quiet; there is not enough to ſtill the ſoul from
murmuring and complaining: What do our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
ſpeak leſs in the ears of the World?</p>
            <p>5. <hi>It is its own plague and puniſhmont;</hi> it eats out
and devoures the good and the comfort of all we
have: the want of <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s Cap and Knee, made
all the honour that <hi>Haman</hi> had in the Kings
Court, to be as nothing to him. <hi>Ahabs</hi> whole
Kingdome could not keep him in health while he
wanted <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard. Diſcontent is ſuch a
ſickneſs of the heart, as makes it diſreliſh what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
elſe it hath to delight and pleaſe it.</p>
            <p>Diſcontented perſons are apt to think, that all
their troubles are from without, one thing is
wanting, and another thing is amiſs; as he that
hath a tender foot complains of his ſhoe, 'tis too
ſtrait, or too hard; or as a ſick man of his meat,
or his drink, or his bed, his bed is hard, or not
well made, his meat is not good, or not well
dreſs'd; but the fault all the while is in his foot,
or his ſtomach, in his weakneſs and wearineſs;
his tender foot makes his ſhoe wring, his ſick ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
makes his meat unſavoury, his weary bones
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:153788:87"/>
make his bed uneaſie; 'tis this evil ſickneſs of
thine heart that makes thee angry with thy ſtate,
and makes the very comforts of thy life uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
to thee; this thou wanteſt, or that thou
likeſt not, and that vexes thee; why if this want
were ſupplied, and that vexation were removed,
thy ſickly heart would ever find ſomething or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to torment thee; thou wilt never want a
plague whileſt thou carrieſt this evil heart about
thee.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>It Idolizeth the world,</hi> and argues captivity
to it: What, could the World do, if thou hadſt
it, that which God cannot do without it? Could
the World content thee? or canſt thou not find
contentment when any thing of that is wanting?
who then is thy God?</p>
            <p>2. The excellencies and ſweetneſs of contentment.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>There is a chearful ſubmiſſion in it;</hi> a reſting
in Gods allowance, and a well-pleaſedneſs with
our condition; let the Lord deal out to me, and
keep back from me whatſoever he will; its the
Lord, let him do whatſoever ſeems him good;
God is pleas'd it ſhould be thus, and therefore I
am pleas'd. O what a ſweet life were this? all
the perturbations of our lives ariſe from the claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Gods Will, and our wills; when ours is
<hi>ſwallowed</hi> up in his Will, then there's reſt: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
comes amiſs to us, there's nothing to grieve
or offend, when we like what ever God wills.</p>
            <p>Brethren, this we pray for, <hi>Thy will be done:</hi>
this we profeſs, <hi>Not my will, but thine;</hi> and when
our hearts conſent that our prayers ſhould be
heard, and will come in and ſubſcribe our Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
how ſweetly will all run on: When we can
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:153788:88"/>
heartily ſay, <hi>Not my will, but his be done,</hi> we ſhall
be alſo able to ſay, <hi>Becauſe his will, mine is done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>There is ſatisfaction in it;</hi> ſatisfaction with
God, <hi>Prov. 14. 14. A good man is ſatisfied;</hi> ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from himſelf, from within him: God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him, and thence his ſatisfaction; there's no
true contentment, but what's bottom'd on God:
Thou haſt many wants, and many wiſhes, and
many hopes; if theſe were once anſwered, then
thou thinkeſt all would be well: No, no, it would
not do; if thou hadſt thy wiſh, and thy hopes,
there would ſtill be ſomething wanting till thou
comeſt to take up with thy God: When thy ſoul
can dwell at eaſe in the midſt of ſtraits and wants,
that's a ſign thou haſt taken God as thy ſufficient
portion.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Independence from the world;</hi> I mean wholly,
as to matters of Religion and Conſcience: thou
canſt now be happy with, or without the World,
and he that can be happy with, or without it, can
be holy which way ſoever the world goes; as long
as thou canſt be content, thou wilt dare to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious.
For</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Its an Antidote againſt temptations:</hi> 'tis the
hungry Hound that follows his game, when he's
full he will not hunt: When thou findeſt this ſelf-ſufficiency,
thy ſoul will not bite at the Worlds
baits.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Its its own reward:</hi> Its both our duty, and
our comfort. <hi>Let us be content,</hi> this is one of thoſe
Commandments, <hi>[In] keeping whereof there is great
reward:</hi> this is the ſweet of thy life, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
this is the ſauce of thy meat, the ſugar of
thy cup, the crop, the cream of all thy enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:153788:88"/>
Oh Chriſtians, Would you be happy? be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and you are happy: Would you not be in
want? be content, and you have enough? Would
you not be poor? be content, and you are rich:
Would you have your houſes, and your buſineſſes,
and all your concernments, according to your
mind? be content, and it is done: Would you
be free from trouble, and paſſions, and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of mind? be content, and they all vaniſh:
Would you live at hearts eaſe, and carry all
things ſweetly and ſmoothly on? be content, and
then <hi>ſoul take thine eaſe:</hi> Would you be content?
I, there's the difficulty; this would heal all my
ſores: But how ſhall I be content? ſeek not for
it here, in any thing below thee, or without thee,
ſeek for it within, ſeek it from above, take up
with God, and in him thou ſhalt find reſt.</p>
            <p>Only that you may find contentment in God;</p>
            <p>1. Make God your own: Look not for content
in the World, and look not for content in God,
without a propriety in him: Look not for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and dare not to be content without God: It
is a ſhame not to be content with God, but it is a
madneſs to be content without God, and an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in him. May be ſome of you will ſay, I thank
God I am none of theſe male-contents, I am of a
ſedate and quiet ſpirit, I am well pleas'd with my
ſtate; what, and yet a ſtranger from God? Is
God none of thine, and yet content? Its well
with thee to day, but where mayſt thou be to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row?
Is it no matter where? Will theſe bubbles
and ſhadows, will Death and Hell content thee?
art thou content to go down into the Pit, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
everlaſtingly? God would not have thee to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:153788:89"/>
be <hi>patient</hi> of his wrath, much leſs to be <hi>contented.</hi>
Oh Brethren, let your ſpirits boil up, while you
will, into the higheſt extremities of impatience,
under ſin and wrath; how can you be quiet,
whileſt God is angry? beware of having one good
thought of your ſtate, ſuffer not your hearts to
have one hours reſt, till God be yours: make
God ſure, and then be content with any thing, but
dread that contentment that is where God is not,
Pſal. 16. <hi>The Lord is my portion,—the Lord is at my
right hand, therefore mine heart is glad,</hi> ſaith the
Pſalmiſt: But wilt thou ſay, The World is my
portion, the Lord is not my portion, yet my
heart is glad?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Advance in godlineſs.</hi> What is God to the
contenting of a ſoul without godlineſs? you can
neither underſtand, nor taſt of God, without god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs:
Contentation ariſes from communion;
and by how much the higher our communion with
God, by ſo much the more full our contentment.
Godlineſs is the proof of God, of his riches and
ſatisfying excellencies, <hi>Rom. 12. 2. Be ye not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to this world, but be ye transformed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
of your mind, [that ye may prove] what is that
good and acceptable and perfect will of God.</hi> You that
are but young beginners in Chriſtianity, you yet
but little know what a treaſure the Lord is; <hi>no
man knows but he that hath it,</hi> and no man hath
much of this treaſure, but he that's rooted and
grounded in the love of God, and raiſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
in the experimental exerciſes of godlineſs.
1 Tim. 6. 6. <hi>Godlineſs with contentment is great gain.</hi>
When godlineſs riſes ſo high, as to bring in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
(a little will not do it) then you ſhall
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:153788:89"/>
find it great gain. Never look to find the gain of
godlineſs, but according to the proportion you
find of contentment, and never look for great
contentment, nor count that content you have any
great vertue, where there is but little godlineſs.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Patience in the greateſt diſtreſſes:</hi> Patience (as
I have elſewhere noted) is the fleſh mortified,
and the fleſh mortified is the world vanquiſhed:
the fleſh, while it is alive, will quickly feel; and
when it ſmarts, twill kick and fling, and put the
whole Soul into a combuſtion: when the world
with all its fury, either cannot make the fleſh to
ſmart, or not ſo, but that the Soul can bear it and
ſtill keep quiet, there's patience. When the world
hath not only made ſome lighter onſets, by its
vollies of reproaches and mockings; but perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
us to Bonds and Impriſonments, prepared
for us its inſtruments of death, and forced us to
reſiſt unto bloud; when ſcourging, and ſtocking,
and ſtoning, and ſtarving, and ſawing a ſunder, as
twas the caſe of thoſe believers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. are all
put to it and not pleas'd and cannot force a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
or repining thought againſt God, nor an
unworthy reflection on thoſe holy wayes which
have coſt us ſo dear: but the Soul ſtill keeps ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
and with our Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. we lye as
<hi>lambs dumb before the ſhearer,</hi> yea before the butcher,
when we are in ſuch great patience in ſo great
ſufferings; when the world hath done its worſt
by us, and yet cannot have its will of us, there's
the victory, ſhall I ſay? nay there's the triumph
of faith over the world.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Humility in the height of honour:</hi> When the
world can neither depreſs nor ſinfully exalt us,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:153788:90"/>
neither ſink nor ſwell us; when it can neither
beat us on the lower ground, nor on the pinnacle
of the Temple.</p>
            <p>Some Chriſtians have been highly exalted in the
world; have been raiſed from the duſt to ſit with
the Princes among the people: have been num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
among the great and the honourable; and
made to ride on the high places of the earth.
<hi>Joſeph</hi> from the Priſon, is lifted up to be <hi>the ſecond
in the Kingdom; Mordecai,</hi> from the threſhold of
the Kings houſe, to be <hi>the man whom the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
to honour; David</hi> from the ſheepfold to the
Throne.</p>
            <p>Others have had the nobler advantages of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
worth and accompliſhment. <hi>Moſes</hi> was
<hi>learned in all the wiſdom of the Egyptians. Paul</hi> brought
up at the feet, and furniſhed with the learning of
<hi>Gamaliel;</hi> too great a diſputant for the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
of his age. Apollos <hi>an eloquent man and mighty
in the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others have been had in great renown for their
noble acts and mighty works which they have
done. How was it with <hi>David</hi> upon his ſlaughter
of the Philiſtine, with <hi>Daniel</hi> upon his interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Kings dream, with the Apoſtles ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
upon the miracles that they wrought?</p>
            <p>Such a ſtate as this, a ſtate of honour and renown,
is a keen weapon in the hand of the world where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it often ſtabs the Soul of all vertue and grace:
thoſe that are blown up to the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
are often blown away by the winds of pride
and popular applauſe</p>
            <p>Thoſe who can keep humble in ſuch heights,
whoſe hearts ſtill keep their dwelling on the lower
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:153788:90"/>
ground, who are little ones in all their greatneſs;
little in their own eyes, and willing to be little
in the eyes of others; who can take their crowns,
and their garlands that are ſet on their own heads,
and tranſlate them on the head of their Lord; who
account it their honour to decreaſe to his increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;
here are the perſons whoſe humility ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
ſomething.</p>
            <p>What is it to be humble, when we have nothing
whereof to be proud? to be low when we cannot
climbe high? when the conſcience of our poverty
and penury, that we have no worth in our ſelves
and are of no value with others, checks every
aſpiring thought? what is it not to boaſt, when
we have nothing nor have done any thing whereof
to boaſt? Some are ſo fooliſh, as to be proud of
meer conceits; to dream themſelves ſomething,
and then to be proud of their dreams; but thoſe
that are not thus madly proud, what great matter
is it if they be not?</p>
            <p>When there is ſtore of fewel for this luſt to feed
upon, and the bellows of popular breath blowing
it up, and yet it burns not, this is ſomething.
<hi>Doſt thou not know thy ſelf what thou art, and what thou
haſt, and how thou art eſteemed? every one loves thee,
and admires thee, and applauds and ſpeaks well of thee,
and thou haſt merit enough in thee to deſerve it all; why
ſhouldſt thou not accept of all this reſpect, and be of the
ſame mind with all that know thee? why ſhouldſt thou
not think as well of thy ſelf, and prize thine own worth,
and know thine own place, as well as they?</hi> Then to
have all check'd and repell'd with ſuch thoughts as
theſe; But who am I that I ſhould lift up my ſelf?
what have I that I have not received? I have wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:153788:91"/>
I have ſtrength I have riches, but whoſe are
all theſe? are they mine own? of mine own get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?
Have I done any thing more then others,
through whoſe ſtrength was it? in whoſe name
was it? this is humility indeed.</p>
            <p>Act. 3. 12. <hi>Why look ye on us ſo earneſtly?</hi> The
Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> had done a great cure
upon the lame man, and the people were greatly
taken with it; they ran together to ſee theſe men,
and wondred at them, and the cure which they had
done; Theſe are ſtrange men, Gods rather then
men, by whom ſuch a mighty cure was wrought.
But behold, they are not at all tranſported with the
peoples wonderment, nor will accept of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe;
<hi>Ye men of Iſrael why look ye ſo upon us, as
though we by our own power had made this man to walk.</hi>
You are miſtaken in us, we are not the men you
take us to be; we could no more have cur'd this
man by our own power, then any of you could
have done; wonder not at us, give glory to God,
give glory to God; God hath magnified his Son
Jeſus; 'tis his name, and through faith in his name,
by which this man is made whole.</p>

            <p>O Brethren, where is the victorious ſpirit?

that ſet their necks to the work of the Lord?
What deſigns have you for advancing in holineſs,
for magnifying the grace of God in you, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting
his name in an heavenly life? Where are
the Trophies of your proweſs? bring forth the
Captives you have taken: Can you ſhew your
luſts in Chains, your pride in Chains, your covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs

taken, Behold houſes, and honors, and dignities,
and pleaſures, behold my feet upon the necks of

not I, but the grace of God that was with me:</hi> This
little have I done for God, the weights are laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
and now will I run with patience the Race
which is ſet before me: Now for a fruitful life,
for labouring and abounding in the work of the
Lord; for growing rich unto God, rich in good
works; I cannot ſit down by that little I have
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:153788:92"/>
done; he is worthy, he is worthy, for whom
I ſhould do other manner of things then theſe, for
whom I ſhould live another manner of life then
this: O were I all ſoul, all wing, all life, all
action, how little would this my [all] be, to what
I would it were: Riſe up O my ſoul, ſhake off
thy aſhes, open thy ſluces, let run all thy ſtreams,
what wilt thou do for thy good? I have done for
my fleſh, I have done for my family, I have done
for my friends, what ſhall I do for my God?
Read O my ſoul, in the Book of Records, as
that King did, <hi>Eſter</hi> 6. 2. and ſearch what the Lord
hath done for thee, how he hath pardoned thee,
and ſanctified thee, and ſubdued thine enemies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thee; how he hath brought thee out of thine
houſe of bondage, and redeemed thee from the
houſe of ſervants: And then ask, What honour
hath been done the Lord for all this?</p>
            <p>O Brethren, how are we ſtraitned? we walk as
if we were ſtill in our fetters; if we were ſtill
Vaſſals to this earth, we could hardly be leſs active
for heaven: Whileſt we tell one another what the
Lord hath done for our ſouls, how little have we
to tell, what our ſouls have done for the Lord?
<hi>Empty vines we are, that bring forth our fruit to our

ſelves, and threſh for our ſelves, and live to our
ſelves, and how little to him?</p>
            <p>And that little we do for God, how hardly are
we brought to it? Am I bound to do this? am I
bound to do that? bound to give ſo much to the
poor? bound to ſpend ſo much time in prayer?
bound to ſuch conſtant care and labour? May not
leſs ſuffice? will not leſs be accepted? may I not
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:153788:93"/>
be a Chriſtian at a cheaper rate? And if our fleſh
can but make us believe, that leſs may ſerve, how
glad are we to ſit down and ſave our labour?</p>
            <p>Brethren, is it not thus with the moſt of us?
muſt we not be drag'd and driven on to duty? what
do we more then bare neceſſity forces us to? if
fear would let us alone, if Conſcience would let
us be quiet, how little is it that love to Chriſt
would put us upon? Oh where are the large hearts

before the Lord, <hi>Heb. 10. 19. 22. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
therefore boldneſs by the blood of Jeſus,—let us
draw near with a true heart,—with an heart ſprinkled
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:153788:93"/>
from an evil conſcience.</hi> There's no coming before
God with a guilty or guileful heart; 'tis Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
that gives boldneſs; the conſcience of guilt
or guile, makes us afraid and aſhamed to appear
before God. We are afraid of our Bibles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd
to look towards our Cloſets, when God
hath a quarrel with us. We go into our Cloſets,
as the Thief to the Houſe of Correction: We
ſneak in aſhamed and afraid, and ſhuffle over in
haſte, and are glad when we get out again: We
cannot pray, we ſcarce dare to lift up our eyes
to heaven, we bluſh before the Lord, and cannot
be free and open-hearted with him: Guilt ſtops
our mouths, or at leaſt the <hi>heart</hi> keeps ſilence
where this cryes in its ears.</p>
            <p>How can I go before the Lord? What am I
like to hear if I ſpeak to him? What will he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
me if I call upon him? <hi>Why eryeſt thou to me?
Go to the Gods whom thou haſt ſerved,</hi> go to thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
go to thy companions, go to thy Mammon
which thou haſt ſerved; thou art privy to thy trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries,
to the Whoredomes thou haſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with thine other Gods; why cryeſt thou to
me in thy diſtreſs? go to the Gods after which
thou haſt loved to wander: how will that heart
hang down the head, and give it ſelf the repulſe
that's conſcious to ſuch treachery?</p>
            <p>When the ſoul can reply, I have no other God
to go to; this Fleſh is not my God, this World
is not my God, my heart is with thee, my deſire
is to thee, and I have kept me by thee; thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Lord, it hath been my care to keep me from
the way, and from the luſts of this world, and to
walk before thee in mine integrity, then will it
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:153788:94"/>
lift up its face with confidence in his preſence.</p>
            <p>Now he that can thus be bold with God, that
can with openneſs of heart <hi>make his appeal to God,</hi>
as the witneſs of his integrity, and that can here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>make his requeſt to God,</hi> make known his want,
and his ſtraits and diſtreſſes, and be bold to leave
it upon him to relieve and ſupport him; he that
can be thus bold with the Lord, will be bold with
all the world.</p>
            <p>Brethren, you that think you ſhall be <hi>bold for
the Lord,</hi> when ever you are put to the tryal, that
have now a forward mind to own the worſhip and
wayes of God, and have hope that <hi>in nothing you
ſhall be aſhamed,</hi> but that at all times, and in all
things, Chriſt ſhall be magnified in you, whether
by life, or by death; let me ask you, Have you
boldneſs <hi>with God?</hi> Is he your friend? Is it peace
betwixt him and your ſouls? How came this peace
in? time was when there was no peace; you
were Runawayes and Rebels againſt God; your
natural ſtate was a ſtate of enmity; are you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
by the Bloud of Chriſt? are you return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and become Converts to God? hath the Lord
been at work with your ſouls? hath he convinced
you, humbled you, broken you, ſlain the enmity,
and brought you into a Covenant of peace with
himſelf? Its dangerous to talk of being bold with
God, till you are brought home unto God; 'tis
for the ſtubble to be bold with the flames; 'tis to
daſh on the Rock, to ſleep on the Waves, to take
Sanctuary in wrath and fury, and to truſt to indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
as little ſuccour and relief will the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
find with the Lord: Are you reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?
are you the friends of God?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:153788:94"/>
Are you of the acquaintance of God? friends
may grow ſtrangers, and ſtrangers cannot be
bold: Do you uſe to converſe and walk with
God? how often do you viſit him? is there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
entercourſe and correſpondence maintained
betwixt the Lord and your ſouls?</p>
            <p>Are you tender how you break your peace, and
loſe your acquaintance? is it your care to walk
before him in uprightneſs? do you not ordinarily
grieve, or offend, or careleſly neglect the Lord?
Is there no allowed treachery or falſhood in your
hearts to him? do you not ſuffer new quarrels to
ariſe betwixt the Lord and you? or if there be,
have you therein a quarrel againſt your ſelves?
When you offend him, do you offend your own
hearts? Is every ſin againſt God a wound to your
own ſouls? are you ever angry with your ſelves
but when God is at peace? Is it your conſtant care
to keep all clear and fair betwixt the Lord and
you? and hereupon, can you come boldly before
the Throne of Grace, and make known your
wants, and your grievances, and eaſe your hearts,
by opening them, and emptying them into the
boſom of your friend? fear not, this your bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with the Lord, will give you boldneſs on the
behalf of God, how frightful ſoever the caſe may
be.</p>
            <p>Oh take heed that your confidence that you
ſhall ſtand your ground in the day of tryal, be not
preſumption. And certainly whatever your
thoughts are at preſent, if you be not the real
and inward friends of God now, if you have but
the name and the face of his Diſciples, if you
follow him for faſhion, or for company, or for
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:153788:95"/>
novelty; if notwithſtanding all the regards and
reſpects you profeſs to have for God and his
wayes, there be ſtill a Conſcience of guile and
deceit within; if notwithſtanding all your heat
and forwardneſs in his publick worſhip, you are
ſtrangers to the love and life of God, and are ſtill
in league with his Enemies, ſerving your fleſh
and this world: And hereupon whatever you do
in publick, yet you have no freedome in ſecret
with God, no ſecret familiarity, no ſecret enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of love and friendſhip, you cannot be
bold and open-hearted when you have him alone;
if you cannot be thus bold <hi>with the Lord,</hi> your
promiſing your ſelves that you ſhall be bold for
him is your preſumption, and will deceive you.</p>
            <p>Only let me tell you (for fear of diſcouraging
ſuch who ſhould not be diſcouraged) he that hath
the ground of this holy boldneſs, that through
the bloud of Jeſus hath peace with God, whoſe
conſtant care is to pleaſe the Lord, and to walk
before him in his uprightneſs; though by reaſon
of the darkneſs and miſgivings of his troubled
trembling heart, he ſcarce dares to call God Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and can hardly at any time look him in the
face without fear and ſhame, and hereupon ſhakes
at the fore-thoughts of the day of tryal, this poor
trembling ſoul may expect, when he is put to it,
to be enabled to ſtand as Mount <hi>Zion</hi> that ſhall
never be removed.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Boldneſs in God:</hi> We were <hi>bold in our God,</hi>
1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 2. This boldneſs ſtands in a firm depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon God, <hi>Job 13. 15. Though he kill me, yet
will I truſt in him.</hi> A reſolved Chriſtian will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon God, <hi>for his counſel and conduct, Pſal.</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:153788:95"/>
73. 24. <hi>Thou wilt guide me with thy counſell:</hi> he will
not lean to his own underſtanding; he is fearful
enough to walk in his own counſels; he knows
that 'tis not in man that walketh to order his own
ſteps, but withall he knows he hath a better guide:
he depends on God <hi>for his aid and aſſiſtance:</hi> His
faith ſaies the ſame which Chriſt ſaies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 7.
<hi>The Lord God will help me, therefore I ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded;
therefore have I ſet my face as a flint, and I
know that I ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> He will keep his
way and <hi>adventure events and iſſues upon God: God
will provide,</hi> is his encouragement in his moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
caſes: and hence he bears up under the moſt
frightful aſpect of his preſent caſe what ever it be,
1 <hi>Sam. 30. 6. But David encouraged himſelf in the
Lord his God.</hi> He was in a great diſtreſs and in
great danger, but yet he bears up. All is gone,
and worſe is coming: mine enemies have carried
away all, and my friends are become mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
my friends are againſt me, and I have none
to ſtand with me; I am in great diſtreſs, what
ſhall I do?</p>
            <p>But where is the Lord? who is the Lord but my
God? O there's enough. <hi>Why art thou caſt down O
my Soul, and why art thou diſcouraged within me? Hope
in God,</hi> be ſtrong and of good courage.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Boldneſs for God:</hi> There is a boldneſs to
which God is nominally entitled, which is not
boldneſs for God, but for our ſelves. The bold
aſſerting our own conceits and opinions for divine
truths; the bold impoſing our own inventions as
the will of God; the zealous purſuing matters of
religion for our own advantage, and crying out
over it <hi>zeal for God:</hi> the intemperate inſiſting on
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:153788:96"/>
the controverted and queſtionable matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
this our boldneſs we may call our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and wilfulneſs; our pride and ſelfiſhneſs.
God will never thank you for ſuch boldneſs; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not your follies or phrenſies upon the moſt
high; God will reward ſuch boldneſs either with
frowns or with fury.</p>
            <p>Boldneſs for God ſtands, in a <hi>conſtant maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our fidelity and allegiance to God;</hi> in <hi>a reſolved
promoting the real intereſt and honour of his name and
worſhip:</hi> a boldneſs <hi>to pray,</hi> as in the caſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,
Chap.</hi> 6. 10. When the King forbad him:
a boldneſs <hi>to preach,</hi> as in the caſe of the Apoſtles,
<hi>Acts</hi> 5. When the Prieſts and Rulers forbad them:
a boldneſs <hi>to be holy</hi> and upright and not to ſin
againſt God as in the caſe of <hi>Job. chap.</hi> 1. When the
Devil afflicted him for it: a boldneſs <hi>to confeſs
Chriſt before men;</hi> both in our ordinary converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in ſpecial when called before rulers:
bearing witneſs both by word and works againſt
all the ſins, the prophaneſs, the Atheiſm, the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries
and Apoſtacies of the world; a boldneſs
<hi>to ſuffer</hi> rather then ſin againſt God.</p>
            <p>This is Chriſtian fortitude, and is then the
clearer proof of our victory over the world,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>When we follow God and keep his way, with the
contempt of the [greateſt] advantages on the one hand,
and the [ſharpeſt] ſufferings on the other;</hi> when the
higheſt price that the World can give, cannot
entice us, and the greateſt miſchief that the World
can do, cannot force us to unfaithfulneſs: when
its <hi>beſt and worſt</hi> are contemned, in compariſon of
a good conſcience towards God.</p>
            <p>Wilt thou mind and ſerve and follow me ſaith
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:153788:96"/>
the World? why what reward wilt thou give me?
Thou ſhalt have wealth: what nothing elſe? yes
thou ſhalt have pleaſure: what no more? yes thou
ſhalt have honours and preferments, thou ſhalt be
a great man, and exalted in the earth, and what
more canſt thou deſire?</p>
            <p>And if thou wilt not hearken, if thou wilt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
me; why what then? look for all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
I can do thee: look for reproach and ſcorn;
if that will not do, look for hunger and thirſt; if
yet it be not enough look for ſtripes, and bonds,
and priſons, and torments and death: Well is
this all that thou canſt give? is this the worſt thou
canſt do? Away from me, I neither love nor
fear thee, I will keep the Commandments of
my God: there's a bold Soul, one of Chriſts
worthies.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>When we chooſe the greateſt of ſufferings, rather
then little ſins.</hi> May be thou wouldſt be afraid to
run upon horrid ſins; If theſe were the terms
that were given thee, <hi>Curſe God and live, Renounce
thy part in Chriſt, forſwear thy Lord, blaſpheme
and live;</hi> Theſe horrid wickedneſſes have too
ghaſtly a face, theſe look too much like Hell; thou
dareſt not buy thy liberty, or thy life, at ſo dear
a rate. But mayſt thou eſcape by <hi>Zoar,</hi> will ſome
little ſin ſecure thee? ſome little ſinful ſhift, a
little complyance, or that which hath but <hi>the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of evil,</hi> what ſayeſt thou now? If thou
canſt not drink down a full draught of the cup of
fornication, canſt thou not ſip of the cup, or ſo
much as put to it thy mouth, canſt thou not kiſs
the cup? no no, every drop is poyſon, and a drop
of poyſon is deadly, every little ſin is the price of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:153788:97"/>
bloud; the very appearance of evil will be a blot
on my holy profeſſion. 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 13. I had rather
dye then that any ſhould make my glorying void:</hi> Not
only whats unjuſt, or impure, or diſhoneſt, but
whats diſhonourable, what ever hath an evil face,
or an evil ſound, my life ſhall go, rather then I
will redeem it by any ſuch unworthy way.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>When we refuſe the greateſt advantages rather then
neglect the leaſt of duties:</hi> When we can reſolve <hi>from
love,</hi> what <hi>Balaam</hi> did <hi>for fear,</hi> Numb. 22. 18. <hi>If
Balak would give me an houſe full of ſilver and gold, I
cannot go beyond the word of the Lord; to do leſs or more.</hi>
I will not willingly fail of a tittle of all that the
Lord requires me. I will not be bought out of
my duty: <hi>weigh me my price;</hi> whatever can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
houſes, or mountains of gold and ſilver, they
will be contemned in compariſon of faithfulneſs
to God. I will not be hired, not only to a total
neglect of God, but not to do leſs then he requires.
I can make no abatements, I will not keep back
part, there is unfaithfulneſs in the leaſt, the whole
World ſhall not hire me to be unfaithful. If God
ſaies, <hi>Keep thy ſelf pure, keep thy ſelf unſpotted of the
World;</hi> If God ſaies, <hi>Be faithful, be circumſpect, be
zealous;</hi> If God ſaies, <hi>Hold faſt that which thou haſt,
Hold forth the word of life, be not aſham'd to confeſs me
before men, be harmleſs, be blameleſs, in the midſt, and
in the ſight of a crooked generation; endure hardneſs,
deny thy ſelf, take up thy croſs and follow me, without
turning aſide, either to the right hand or to the left.</hi> As
the Lord liveth, as I will not go beyond, ſo neither
will I take up ſhort of the word of the Lord, to
do leſs or more.</p>
            <p>It may be if the profane World ſay, let [all]
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:153788:97"/>
alone, give up [all] thy religion; have done
with this praying and hearing, yea and this profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of religion; ſcrape out all prints, and raze
out all principles of righteouſneſs and holineſs,
and proſtitute thy ſelf with us to all manner of
licentiouſneſs; poſſibly thou wilt not dare to do
thus.</p>
            <p>But if thy carnal friends ſay, at leaſt be wiſe,
be not righteous over much, be not fondly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe;
remit of thy heat, abate of thy zeal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
thy ſelf; Haſt thou faith? have it to thy ſelf.
Haſt thou conſcience? have it to thy ſelf. If thou
wilt follow Chriſt ſtill, yet walk no more openly
with him? thou mayſt be a Diſciple and no body
the wiſer if thou wilt be a little more moderate
and wary. What ſayſt thou to this? no if all the
friends I have in the World ſhould thus plead with
me, even in this I cannot hearken.</p>
            <p>What Chriſt ſaith is over much, ſhall be abated;
when Chriſt ſaith be leſs preciſe, be not ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
keep thy religion to thy ſelf, keep thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to thy ſelf, I will hearken. What Chriſt
calls diſcretion and moderation, I will embrace;
what Chriſt calls pride, and fondneſs, and nicety,
I will avoid: where Chriſt ſaies, be ſober, be
wary, hide thy ſelf, I will obey; but beyond the
word of the Lord I will not go, to do leſs or
more; I will not be raſh or heady, I will not be
wilful or obſtinate; I will not be turbulent or
contentious; I will not contend for any thing as
religion, which Chriſt hath not call'd ſo, nor for
that which is, farther or otherwiſe, then he hath
required me: <hi>Chriſtian</hi> wiſdom, and moderation,
and meekneſs, and gentleneſs, and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:153788:98"/>
and peaceableneſs, I will embrace, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after with all men, for this is the will of my
Lord.</p>
            <p>But ſay no more to me, be leſs holy, be leſs
zealous for righteouſneſs and holineſs; I cannot
be righteous overmuch and I will not be wicked
in a little.</p>
            <p>If you ask further, what are the properties of
this godly boldneſs, I anſwer, it is,</p>
            <p>1. An humble boldneſs, that does not make a
noiſe, that does not boaſt and bluſter, nor ſhew it
ſelf in uncomely heats and animoſities; that hath
firmneſs and undauntedneſs, but joyn'd with low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
and meekneſs.</p>
            <p>2. A prudent boldneſs, that doth not eſpouſe
needleſs controverſies, that is wary of miſtaking
matters or meaſures; that doth not raſhly and
headily run upon dangers which it might without
ſin avoid; that doth not unwarily create it ſelf
nor needleſly provoke enemies, but fears not to
meet them in his way, nor will either turn aſide
or ſtand ſtill to eſcape them.</p>
            <p>Now put all theſe together; he that is <hi>bold with
the Lord,</hi> who being reconciled by the bloud of
Chriſt, and walking before him in his integrity;
can with an holy boldneſs approach, and make
known his requeſts to the Lord, for grace and
mercy and help in the time of need; He that is
<hi>bold in the Lord,</hi> whoſe heart is fixed truſting in God;
He that is in his name, <hi>bold for the Lord,</hi> bold to
be faithful to God, bold to be holy and righteous;
that will follow God and keep his way with the
neglect of the higheſt worldly advantages on the
one hand, and the ſharpeſt ſufferings on the other;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:153788:98"/>
that will chooſe the greateſt of ſufferings, rather
then little ſins; that will refuſe the greateſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
rather then neglect the leaſt of duties; that is
meek, and yet mighty through God; that trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
at the word, and yet ſtands againſt all the
world; that is tender as a bruiſed reed, and yet
ſtands againſt all the world; that is tender as a
bruiſed reed, and yet not terrified at an army with
banners; whom a child may lead and yet a giant
cannot drive; an innocent dove with a ſerpents
wiſedom; a patient lamb, with a Lions heart;
who will not ſtrive nor cry nor make a noiſe in
the ſtreets, and yet in the ſtrength of the Lord
brings forth judgment into victory; Here is the
valiant Chriſtian, that triumphs over thrones and
Dominions; that in the name of Chriſt, hath
ſpoiled principalities and powers, and hath led
captivity captive. Here is a <hi>man</hi> clothed with the
Sun, who hath the moon under his feet.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, where is this mighty ſpirit of the
Goſpel? <hi>Behold,</hi> ſome who ſeem ſufficiently high
flown, are yet as weak as water: whoſe hopes
and whoſe comforts lye at the mercy of every
temptation; whoſe religion muſt ſtrike ſail, at
the fight of every enemy, or tack about at every
turn of the wind; who are no body but in the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
and the calm: whoſe courſe muſt be ſteer'd
by their commodity and ſafety: who are for duty,
yet dare not pray to their loſs; who proteſt againſt
iniquity, yet will ſin rather then ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Is not this thy caſe? wouldſt thou not have been
better if thou hadſt dar'd? thy conſcience is for
more praying, and hearing, and cloſs walking
with God, but thine heart will not ſerve thee, the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:153788:99"/>
times will not bear it, thy eſtate will be in hazard,
thy liberty, yea and thy life too in danger: thou
dareſt not turn Apoſtate from Chriſt, thou wouldſt
be one of the company ſtill, though thou be but
a midnight Diſciple, and this muſt comfort thee
under all thy diſguiſed unfaithfulneſs: thou halteſt
betwixt Chriſt and the World, thou dar'ſt neither
utterly to forſake him, nor reſolvedly to own him;
thou canſt not tell what to be, nor where to find
thy ſelf: were it not for love of this World, what
a Chriſtian wouldſt thou be? were it not for fear,
who ſhould out-ſtrip thee? but as Matters are,
what to do thou knoweſt not, and whoſe thou art,
who can tell? to day thou art with the Diſciples,
but who can tell where to find thee to morrow?
weak Soul, haſt thou good will for Chriſt, why
wilt thou not venture after him? haſt thou the
name, where is the Spirit of a Chriſtian? ariſe
ſhake off thy fear and be bold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be bold for God:</hi> Some are bold enough, but 'tis
for themſelves; God hath the name but ſelf is the
mark thats aim'd at; beware that this be not it
thou counteſt thy godly boldneſs. Some are bold
<hi>upon God;</hi> upon the patience and forbearance of
God; bold to ſlight and affront the Lord, bold to
ſin againſt him, to ſtand it out againſt him, againſt
all his commands, threatnings and judgments; bold
to continue unbelievers, impenitent, blaſphemers,
unclean livers, though God hath ſaid that all ſuch
ſhall be damned: to be thus bold is to be deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
they dare the Almighty to his face, to bring
his Counſel to paſs, and to perform all his words
that he hath ſpoken againſt them. Be bold but ſee
that it be for God not againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:153788:99"/>
Be bold for <hi>God,</hi> but let it be alſo <hi>in the Lord.</hi>
Be bold <hi>in the Lord,</hi> but that you be not more bold
then welcome; look to it, that you be the <hi>friends
of God;</hi> the boldneſs of ſtrangers, is <hi>ſaucineſs</hi> or
preſumption: The Lord upbraids his rebellious
people with their confidence in him, <hi>Mic. 3. yet
they will lean upon the Lord;</hi> they love me not, yet
they will lean upon me. Its hard to ſay which is
more dangerous, the <hi>truſt</hi> of the ungodly, or their
<hi>diſtruſt:</hi> God will be no Rock to thoſe, who will
not that he be their Lord: He will not accept of a
teſtimony from a devil; it diſparages a good
Cauſe to be pleaded by an evil mouth; and as he
will not regard thy confeſſion, ſo neither will he
bear thee out in what it coſts thee: If thou wilt
not ſubmit to God, confeſs him at thine own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril;
depend on [me] for my help? expect coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
or encouragement from me? lay hold
on [my] power? lay claim to [my] all-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
or faithfulneſs? how dar'ſt thou be ſo bold?
what art thou to me? a ſtranger, and yet ſo bold?
an enemy, and yet ſo bold? away Confident, look
to thy ſelf, ſtand on thine own bottom, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for thee: Art not thou he that wilt not be
rul'd by me, that wilt not accept of my love and
peace, that diſſembleſt with me, that ſpeakeſt me
fair, but thine heart is not with me? art not thou
he that dar'ſt continue in thy ſin, and to walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fleſh, and in friendſhip with this world,
whoſe heart goes after thy covetouſneſs, and thy
companions, and thy pride, and thy pleaſures?
and wilt [thou] lean on me, and ſtrengthen thy
ſelf in me? I have offered to be reconciled to
thee, and thou wilt not; I have offered to change
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:153788:100"/>
thee, to change thy mind, and change thy way; to
make thee a new ſoul, and a new life, and ſtill
thou refuſeſt, and art the ſame man that ever thou
waſt: may be thou haſt gotten thee a new face,
and a new tongue, and I have thy company ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
thou draw'ſt nigh to me, and comeſt in
among my Saints; but behold the ſame heart ſtill
that ever thou hadſt; thou wilt not be a Convert,
thou wilt not be brought into a Covenant of peace
with me, but are ſtill in league with thy fleſh, and
this world; and how canſt thou ſay I truſt in God?
I will be no ſanctuary for ſin?</p>
            <p>Brethren, beware there be not any among you,
who make your <hi>truſting</hi> in God, to ſerve you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of <hi>turning</hi> to God; your outward forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the cauſe of God, to ſerve inſtead of your
hearty accepting the grace of God; the Lord
needs not, nor will regard your good words,
whileſt your hearts are not with him; go and be
reconciled to your adverſary, (for ſuch the Lord
is yet to you) go and be reconciled to God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of his grace, reſign to his Dominion, ſet
him up as Lord and Ruler within you, let his Law
and his love be in your hearts, and then you may
be bold, both upon his acceptance of whatever
ſervice you do for his Name, and upon your ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in it: Be the Lords in truth, and then fear not
to make the Lord your truſt.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Aequanimity in all the changes of his outward
condition:</hi> An equal, ſteady, fixed frame, in all
turns and changes. If proſperity alone, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
alone, will not corrupt or diſcompoſe
us, they are often made to <hi>take their turns,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
one, ſometimes another, if that may do it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:153788:100"/>
Though <hi>all wet</hi> or <hi>all dry</hi> will not, yet ſometimes
wet, and ſometimes dry, will rot the ſturdy Oak.
He is a ſtrong man indeed, upon whom great and
ſudden changes of weather, air, diet, and his
whole courſe and way of life, doth make no
change. Thoſe ſouls are often toſs'd with turns
of fair weather and foul, which can ride at anchor
in conſtant tempeſts; we can hardly be long the
ſame, whileſt matters go not with us after the
ſame way.</p>
            <p>As the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſa. 55. 19. Becauſe they have
[no] changes;</hi> ſo ſometimes may it not be ſaid,
Becauſe they have [many] changes, therefore they
fear not God; we may be ſo long emptied from
veſſel to veſſel, till we have loſt our ſavour.</p>
            <p>He is a Chriſtian indeed, whoſe ſoul is not
toſt out of its peace, whoſe feet are not turn'd out
of courſe, by all the toſſings and turnings of his
outward ſtate, whoſe heart is not moved within,
when every day proves, that all he has without
are moveables.</p>
            <p>Inward changes there are, and ought to be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the viciſſitudes and varieties of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
occurrences; every providence ſhould
make impreſſion upon our ſpirits, proportionable
to it: a due and different ſenſe there ought to be,
of our <hi>outward</hi> mercies and croſſes; a ſad ſenſe of
paternal diſpleaſure, is as neceſſary under cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
as a chearful ſenſe of bounty and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
when all things proſper with us: We may
not be as ſtocks or ſtones, upon whom the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
or Winter makes no difference; God looks
that worldly changes be ſeen and felt in hearts;
we may and muſt have our light and dark, our
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:153788:101"/>
joys and ſorrows, our hopes and fears, there's
need, and uſe of all.</p>
            <p>But now in all theſe outward, and their corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding
inward changes, a Chriſtian as to the
main changes not; <hi>his heart is fixed truſting in
God;</hi> he is not <hi>out of frame,</hi> though he be <hi>in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
frame</hi> to day, then yeſterday he was; both in
his proſperity and in his patience, he poſſeſſeth
his ſoul; he is the ſame to Godward, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſin; ſtill in motion heavenward, and in
defiance with iniquity.</p>
            <p>As 'tis on the other ſide with the wicked, though
they are as a troubled Sea, yet they are ſtill at reſt
in their iniquity; whatever changes paſs over
them, their hearts, as to the main, are not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
ever beſides themſelves, and yet ever them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
wicked ſtill; <hi>emptied from veſſel to veſſel,
and yet their ſent goes not forth out of them.</hi> Ungodly
ſtill, hardned ſtill, for ſin and the devil ſtill; let
their condition be what it will, let them be in
health, let them be ſick, let them be full, let them
be empty, let their ſteps be waſh'd with Butter,
or ſprung with Vinegar; let their way be ſtraw'd
with Roſebuds, or hedg'd with Thorns; let them
be merry, let them be ſad, all's one, they are the
ſame men, and holding the ſame courſe; wicked
under mercies, wicked under judgements, wicked
in their joys, wicked in their ſorrows:</p>
            <p>O how do we ſee the providences of God thrown
away, &amp; loſt upon the ungodly world: Let the Lord
do what he will with them, ſhine upon them, or
thunder upon them, deal gently, or deal roughly
with them; cloath them, or ſtrip them, feed them,
or famiſh them, it comes all to one, their hearts
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:153788:101"/>
will not be broken, nor turned to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Oh what ſtrange changes hath the Lord of late
made upon this wicked age? what turns and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
have we ſeen, ſmitings and healings, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings
and gatherings, wars and peace, ſickneſs
and health; and yet behold the world ſtill where
they were, <hi>lying in wickedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So for the Saints, let the <hi>world</hi> do what they can
upon them, let [them] ſhine or thunder upon
them, deal gently, or deal roughly, feed or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
them, they are ſtill where they were, their
heart is fixed, truſting in God.</p>
            <p>And he that by all this feels the [leaſt] diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
upon his ſpirit; he that ſails moſt ſteadily
in all winds and weathers, whoſe heart is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinged
by all his turnings, who is not inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exalted nor depreſs'd by his fair weather and
foul, nor hurried out of himſelf by paſſionate and
troubleſome tranſports, on the one hand or the
other; but holds his ſoul in ſuch an even equal
poiſe, that his moderation appears unto all men,
there's another that rides in triumph over earth
and hell.</p>
            <p>Oh Brethren, how is it with us upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?
If we have made over our ſelves to the
Lord, and have ceaſed to be numbred among the
men of this World; if we no longer ſeek our
treaſure on earth, and have laid hold on that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
treaſure above, yet are we gotten ſo clear of
things below, that they have not ſtill too great a
power upon us? Hath not this Moon a mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon our wateriſh ſpirits? do not theſe
ebb and flow, according as it waxes and wanes?
are we the ſame men, when things are not with us
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:153788:102"/>
after the ſame manner? are we the ſame in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and winter? can we keep our hearts and
hold our courſe in all weathers? Is it come to be
all one with us, as to our inward ſtate, which way
matters go with us without? can we want and
yet be quiet, can we be full and not be wanton?
can we be full and not forget God, and be hungry
and not fret our ſelves againſt him? can we love
God when he ſmites, and fear him when he ſmiles?
Is it peace longer then there is plenty, have we
ſunſhine in cloudy dayes? do we keep warm in
the winter, and not ſleep in the ſummer? how
ſmall a ſunſhine will ſteal off our garments, and
how little a wind will blow us off our legs?</p>
            <p>Conſider brethren; it may be whileſt the Lord
hath proſpered you, and matters outward have
gone according to your hearts, then you could
love and ſerve and praiſe and rejoyce in the Lord;
then you could be active, and lively and fruitful,
and chearfully go on your way; but the next croſs
providence hath been as water upon all your fire;
a little ſtorm that hath riſen, hath put out all your
light, turned you beſides all your duties and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts:
turn'd you beſides praying and rejoycing
in God, to vexing and fretting and murmuring
againſt him, and to queſtioning his love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to you; all the flowers that your ſunſhine
hath nurs'd up, how doth one froſty night wither
away.</p>
            <p>Or elſe, if your Souls have been proſpering <hi>in
the winter</hi> how hath the next <hi>ſummers day</hi> chok'd
them up with weeds. Sometimes God hath
brought thee into the houſe of mourning, girded
thee with ſackcloth, layd thee in aſhes, proved
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:153788:102"/>
thee in the furnace of affliction; and then how
humble, and ſerious, and mortified! then what
praying, and repenting, and covenanting with
God, and ſtrengthning thine heart in him! then
dead to ſin, crucified to the world, living by faith,
walking in fear; nothing but God, and holineſs,
and glory in thy heart and in thy tongue; but no
ſooner hath he turn'd thy captivity, put off the
garments of thy widowhood, brought thee out of
darkneſs into light, and redeem'd thy Soul out of
trouble, but all is preſently forgotten, and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
vanity and ſecurity returns upon thee.</p>
            <p>Oh how little is there yet done to what muſt be
done, ere we ſhall come to any ſteadineſs, whileſt
every wordly change does ſo rout and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, let us be like our God, <hi>holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable;</hi>
get you <hi>chang'd</hi> into his image, and
then be <hi>unchangable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh that my Soul were in ſuch a caſe, but how
may I obtain? Why,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Seek earneſtly after a more abundant diffuſion of the
eſtabliſhing Spirit of grace.</hi> Let the Pſalmiſts prayer
be yours, <hi>Pſal. 51. 12. Uphold</hi> or eſtabliſh <hi>me with
thy free Spirit.</hi> The Spirit of this World, is as
<hi>Reuben,</hi> Gen. 49. 4. <hi>Unſtable as water:</hi> the Spirit
of grace is an eſtabliſhing Spirit.</p>
            <p>Haſt thou received this Spirit? haſt thou a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
grace? open thy mouth yet wider, enlarge
thy deſire as Heaven. <hi>A double portion, a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thy Spirit O Lord.</hi> Conſider theſe two things,</p>
            <p>1. The greater meaſures of grace are the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thoſe that are the moſt importunate ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:153788:103"/>
2. Thoſe are the moſt eſtabliſhed Souls to
whom grace hath abounded.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The greater meaſures of grace are the portion of
thoſe that are the moſt importunate ſeekers of grace.</hi> To
his Saints, the Lord giveth his Spirit by meaſure;
to ſome a leſſer, to ſome a fuller meaſure; they
have all drank in the ſame Spirit, but not all a
like draught: our Heavenly Father will give his
Spirit to thoſe that ask it of him, and every man
hath according to his asking: 'tis not with this as
with the Manna in the wilderneſs, <hi>He that gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
much had nothing over, he that gathered little had
no lack;</hi> He that asketh much hath never the
more, he that asketh little, hath never the leſs;
'tis not thus, but God gives to every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his asking. The reaſon why we go on from
day to day, from year to year, with our veſſels ſo
empty, with ſo little grace, is becauſe our little
ſuffices us, we are content and ſit down by our lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
If the Widow had brought more or larger
veſſels, ſhe had had more oyle, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 6. The
largeſt hearts go away with the richeſt loading.
Do ye ſee Souls, that ply at the bucket, that are
often letting down into the well of ſalvation; that
dwell at the throne of grace, whoſe very breath is
prayer, that are every day and every night wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with the Angel for a bleſſing, whom one bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
will not ſuffice, but are ſtill for more and for
more, theſe are the thriving Souls: <hi>full of prayer
and full of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Thoſe are the moſt eſtabliſhed Souls, to whom grace
hath abounded:</hi> 'tis not every little meaſure of
true grace, that will bring the heart to a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
conſiſtency: poor weakling Chriſtians ſadly
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:153788:103"/>
prove, how even <hi>Diſciples</hi> may be ſo toſs'd in the
waves, that they know not where to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
We are <hi>reeds ſhaken with the wind;</hi> Oh how
are our hearts thrown up and down hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by a perplexing ſucceſſion of hopes and
fears, joys and ſorrows, comforts and croſſes,
and ſcarce ever at reſt: ſometimes lifted up, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
depreſſed; ſometimes all upon the wing,
by and by in the duſt; ſometimes in a fever, anon
in a cold ague; yea ſometimes breathing out pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and praiſes, and at the very next minute flame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out in paſſion and impatiencies: thus it is, and
there is no hope it ſhould be otherwiſe, whileſt ſo
low in grace; what wonder, if whileſt we are ſuch
children, we be carried to and fro with every wind?
thoſe that are grown up to be ſtrong in the Lord,
and in the power of his might, theſe will have
<hi>ſtrength to ſit ſtill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O be aſpiring Chriſtians; be making up to the
higheſt form, and be not content here to take a
lower room. Be filled with the Spirit, follow on,
follow hard after the Lord, and look not to be
long your ſelves, till you be fuller of him.</p>
            <p>Brethren, do not go about to excuſe your ſinful
perturbations, when there is a way before you to
cure them. You are ready to ſay, <hi>do not blame me
for it,</hi> I cannot help it. I know 'tis very ſad to be
in a perpetual ſtorm, but how can I mend it? you
know not my tryals, none knows where the ſhooe
wrings but he that wears it.</p>
            <p>Do not blame you for it? why do not you blame
your ſelf for it? are you willing of ſuch a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
life, and to be let alone in it? Is the eaſe of
an <hi>excuſe,</hi> all the cure you deſire? Is there not a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:153788:104"/>
remedy for your diſeaſe? I cannot help it? what,
would not more grace help it? would not more
faith, and more patience, and more mortification
help it? You miſtake your ſelf, you are yet car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
your proud fleſh, your fretful angry fleſh is
too hard for that little grace you have; get more
grace, and the cure is done.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Let your hearts be more ſtrongly intent upon God;</hi>
By how much the more intenſely God is minded,
by ſo much the leſs impreſſion will any thing that
occurs make upon our ſpirits; when the Scales
are but juſt turned, every little duſt falling in,
will make them hover: A Bowl that runs ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
towards the mark, 'tis not every little rub
that will turn it out of its courſe: When the ſoul
is making a main heavenward, and intends all its
powers, in the more vigorous purſuit of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
Crown; when the heart is poſſeſſed, and
much taken up with its more weighty and glorious
concernments; when the thoughts, affections,
reſolutions, are all deeply ingaged, and buſily
working towards God, the greateſt occurrences
of this life are paſt over as <hi>little things;</hi> 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we are ſo weakly moving heavenward, that
we are ſo moved with every trifle.</p>
            <p>Thou complaineſt of the frequent diſtractions
and fluct<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ations of thy mind, wave upon wave,
billow upon billow come rolling in upon thee,
and invincibly roll thy ſoul out of it ſelf; wouldſt
thou be cur'd of this palpitation of thine heart?
mind thy God more, mind thy buſineſs more, ſet
thine heart on thy home, and upon haſting on thy
journey thitherward, and ſee if this will not keep
thee in frame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:153788:104"/>
               <hi>Put on more weight,</hi> Chriſtians, and your wheels
will run more even, and more conſtant; let the
importance of your eternal ſtate be much in your
eye, and upon your heart: Look often into the
<hi>bleſſed eternity</hi> that is before you; ſteep your hearts
in Divine Contemplation, and when you are
tranſported into admirings of that glory, then
ask your hearts, what little things are the
Sun-ſhine or the ſtorms of this lower Region?
tell me not of pleaſures, of plenty and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
here; tell me not of croſſes or diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
here; how ſhall I get to heaven: Oh may
I come there once, no matter how it be here.
Look alſo into the <hi>black and dreadful eternity;</hi> put
your finger into the eternal fire; think, and think
over and over of thoſe flames, of the gripings
and gnawings of the Infernal Worm; think of
theſe things, till you feel them to ſmart, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to ſcorch and burn in your hearts; and then
ſay, What if this ſhould be my place; if this fire,
and this Worm; if theſe gnawings, and this
burning, ſhould be my portion for ever? may I
but eſcape this death only, what is there elſe
ſhould trouble me?</p>
            <p>Take a view thus of Eternity, and then ſet
down, <hi>This is the work I have upon me, this is the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of my day, to make ſure for Eternity.</hi> Let this
ſink into your hearts, hang on this poiſe, and ſee
if it do not hold your ſouls in ſuch conſtant and
vigorous motion heaven-ward, that all the noiſes
of this world, which now ſo amuſe and confound
you, will be but whiſpers that will be little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Reckon upon nothing but God:</hi> Make ſure of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:153788:105"/>
God, and reckon upon nothing elſe: Reckon on
no good thing but God, and reckon on all the
troubles and miſeries on this ſide hell: What
you look for, and count upon, will work the leſs
diſturbance when it comes; count upon all loſſes
but the loſs of God; him (if you be his) you
ſhall never looſe: Count upon all woes, but the
<hi>laſt woe,</hi> upon all ſufferings but hell; God would
never have thee count upon theſe, (if thou be his)
theſe ſhall never come upon you; bleſs God for
that, ſo long 'tis well enough; any thing elſe,
the worſt you can think of, may come, reckon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and you will the better bear it.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Put your fleſh upon the frequent tryal of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
reſtraint, and ſelf-croſſing.</hi> Reſtrain your ſelves,
and you will the better endure when God ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
you: He whoſe fleſh is ordinarily curb'd by
his <hi>Chriſtian prudence,</hi> will be leſs mov'd when
croſs'd by <hi>Divine Providence:</hi> allow not thy fleſh
what it craves, though thou haſt to ſatisfie it;
think not <hi>opportunities</hi> of ſatisfying thy fleſh to be
a <hi>divine allowance;</hi> count it not thy Warrant to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thy ſelf whatever pleaſes thee, <hi>that thou haſt
wherewithall, opportunities are often but temptations:</hi>
God ſometimes does as a wiſe Maſter, who lays
an apple, or a piece of money in the way, to try
his child or ſervant. Uſe to give thy heart no
more then God bids thee, and thou ſhalt find that
God will never give it leſs then will content thee.
Inure thy ſelf to live daily at the allowance of
Religion, and thou ſhalt never want thy allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
When thou uſeſt to have no more then <hi>thou
ſhouldſt have,</hi> thou wilt be like to be content with
what thou ſhouldſt have; and when thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:153788:105"/>
with what thou ſhouldſt have, thou wilt ever
be content to have what thou haſt: Though it be
often ſaid of ſome of the ſervants of men, yet it
ſhall never be ſaid of any of Gods ſervants, that
they have not <hi>what they ſhould have.</hi> And he, who
whatever falls, whatever his portion or condition
be, in every turn or change that comes, can find
his heart ſaying, ſtill 'tis with me as it ſhould be;
yeſterday it was ſo, this day it is ſo, to morrow
it ſhall be ſo; he whoſe heart ſayes thus of every
condition he is in, <hi>It is with me as it ſhould be,</hi> will
ſay, <hi>It is well;</hi> and ſo ſit down quietly in his lot.</p>
            <p>5. Laſtly, <hi>Victory over the world, ſtands in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
to be gone from this, and to take our flight to
the other world,</hi> in a willingneſs to die: Worldly
men, if they could help it, would never die;
they would rather live among the dead, then die
into a better life; they are <hi>dead while they are alive,</hi>
dead in ſin; and they would that this might be
their <hi>eternal death:</hi> Oh might they be allowed an
everlaſting day to ſin in, to drink, and ſwear, and
whore, and curſe, and covet in, what other heaven
would they wiſh for? Were there a <hi>meſſage</hi>
brought down to the World, that their houſes of
Clay ſhould ſtand for ever; that this buying, and
ſelling, and building, and planting, and getting
wealth, and rolling themſelves in pleaſures,
ſhould be their everlaſting imployment; that all
the noiſe and fear of graves, and tombs, and
death, and mortality, ſhould be for ever ſilenc'd,
what a Goſpel would this be to them? how would
the word then be changed, not the <hi>poor,</hi> but the <hi>rich

            <p>Death is a terror, the great dread of the world,
<hi>the King of terrors, Job</hi> 18. 14. the hopes of heaven
would willingly be parted with, ſo the fears of
death might be no more. How do the expectations
and approach of death appale the faces, weaken
the hands, ſhake the hearts, ſowre the pleaſures,
damp the jollities, cool and cow the ſpirits of
the mighty ones of the earth?</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be ſaid this day to any of the

anima,</hi> go forth O my ſoul, linger not, theſe four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
years thouhaſt ſerved the Lord, fear not now
to go and receive thy wages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:153788:106"/>
Its true, there is even in the <hi>Saints</hi> a degree of
unwillingneſs to die; but it is chiefly, becauſe
their Victory over the world is not perfect and
compleat.</p>
            <p>There are three grounds of mens unwillingneſs
to die;
<list>
                  <item>1. From a natural abhorrence of death.</item>
                  <item>2. From a lothneſs to part with their treaſure
here.</item>
                  <item>3. From an uncertainty whither they ſhall go,
when they go hence.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>From that abhorrence of death which is implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the natures of all living:</hi> And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
there may be even in the beſt of Saints an
unwillingneſs to die: Our Lord himſelf, who was
without ſin, diſcovers ſomething of it, when he
cried out, <hi>Matth. 26. 39. Father, if it be poſſible,
let this Cup paſs from me.</hi> Its true, in his caſe, there
was more in it, there was wrath in the Cup, there
was a curſe in the Cup, there were all the ſins of
the World wrung in, to mingle him a bitter
draught; but this was alſo ſomething of it, there
was death in the Cup. He that ſaid a little before,
<hi>Luke 12. 50. I have a Baptiſme to be baptized with,</hi>
(this Baptiſme of Bloud was it) <hi>and how am I
ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed?</hi> I think long ere that
day come; yet when it came, his Innocent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
you ſee how it was put to it.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, you that ſeem to have triumph'd over
the fears of death; that upon good grounds have
ſaid unto it in the words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
55. <hi>Death where is thy ſting? grave where is thy victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?</hi>
yet when it comes to it in earneſt, you know
not how this fleſh may ſhrink, and if it do, yet
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:153788:107"/>
be not diſcouraged; poſſibly, this very inſtance
of our Lord, may be left upon Record to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
end, to comfort his Saints when they ſhall be
thus troubled.</p>
            <p>It will be your wiſdome, to whatever confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
you are arrived, that your death is already
ſwallowed up in victory, that you ſhall entertain
your dying day as the moſt joyful day of your life,
though in this confidence, your hearts pant after
the approach of that day, <hi>Make haſte my beloved,
come Lord Jeſus;</hi> yet will it be your wiſdome to
buckle on all your armour, all your hopes, all
your graces, all your evidences, all your experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
and comforts, and to expect that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
of that day may be ſuch, as may need your
utmoſt preparations for it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>From a lothneſs to part with their treaſure here.</hi>
What men have, they cannot carry it with them,
and they are loth to leave it behind them. When
men die, can they carry their money with them?
can they carry their houſes or Lands with them?
they covet, they purchaſe, they build, they lay up
with ſo much care and zeal, as if they could ſhip
over all they have, into the other world; but yet
they know, that as they came naked in, ſo naked
they muſt go out of this world, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 21.</p>
            <p>But now a Chriſtian that hath Conquered the
World, the World from thenceforth ceaſes to be
his <hi>treaſure:</hi> A Worldling, what he has here, 'tis
his treaſure, for 'tis all he has: God is a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
but he's none of his; Chriſt is a treaſure,
but he's none of his; heaven is a treaſure, but
man 'tis none of thine; this earth is all thou haſt;
a Chriſtian hath another treaſure; he hath not his
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:153788:107"/>
hopes in his hand, that's to come.</p>
            <p>But yet in regard we have hitherto conquered
but in part, there may be ſome unwillingneſs,
upon this account alſo, even in the Saints, to die-Woe
to us, there are ſtill ſuch remains of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of this world in us, our hearts are ſtill carnal
to ſuch a degree, ſo ſuited to an earthly and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life, taking ſuch large allowances of our fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delights, and finding ſuch pleaſure in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of them, that this makes us linger and
hang back, when God calls away.</p>
            <p>And indeed, ſuch Chriſtians who indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the pleaſures of the fleſh, and are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
with an earthly mind, (is not this the caſe
of too many?) ſuch Chriſtians do but deceive
themſelves and others, while they ſay, they are
willing to die. Thou ſaiſt, if I were ſure that Chriſt
were mine, I would not care to live a day longer;
I want aſſurance, and that's the only reaſon I
would yet a while longer abide in this Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle:
No, no, there's ſomething more in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the world hath ſtill ſuch hold of thy heart,
thou findeſt ſuch pleaſure in an earthly life; thy
friends, and thy eſtate, and thy contentment thou
haſt herein, are ſo taking with thee, that yet thou
canſt not find in thine heart to part: Search Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
narrowly, if you find not the matter to be
thus with you; I never look to be more willing to
die, till I find mine heart more looſe from the
pleaſure of an earthly life.</p>
            <p>'Tis the mortified Chriſtian, he whoſe ſoul is
already dead to this world, who is ready to die
out of this world: Thoſe who live moſt with
God, whoſe ſouls being weaned from this milk
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:153788:108"/>
and honey, can keep their diſtance from it, whoſe
ſelf-denying courſe hath made the pleaſures of the
fleſh to looſe their gratefulneſs to them; whom
their communion with God, their converſe with
Eternity, their delightful fore-views of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
above, have already carried up their hearts;
theſe are the Chriſtians that are ready to be gone:
I will believe ſuch an one, that he is in earneſt,
when he ſayes, <hi>Make haſt my beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>From an uncertainty whither they ſhall go, when
they go hence;</hi> what world they ſhall find, when
they leave this: Upon this ground I cannot blame
worldlings to be afraid to die: art thou afraid?
thou mayſt well enough; for whither will thy
death carry thee? O the Lord knows! I know not
whither, nor where it will lay me; Doſt thou
not know whither death will carry thee? thou
mayſt be ſure into no good place, if it find thee
thus: Captives to the world are Captives to the
Devil, and whither will the Devil carry his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners?</p>
            <p>Who would be willing to leave his Country,
his habitation, and acquaintance, for an unknown
Land, eſpecially when he had a jealouſie he ſhould
be ſold for a Bondman? Is this thy caſe World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?
I wonder not that thou ſayeſt, Its better to
abide here.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtian may know whither he is going
when he goes hence, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 1. We know that if our
earthly houſe of this Tabernacle be diſſolved, we have a
building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
in the heavens.</hi> And hence ſayes the Apoſtle,
v. 2. <hi>We groan earneſtly, deſiring to be cloathed upon
with our houſe which is from heaven.</hi> Whatever our
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:153788:108"/>
dwelling be here, we know where we ſhall have
a better when this fails; we groan not under the
ruines of this, but in hopes of a better building,
earneſtly deſiring that joyful day.</p>
            <p>Its true, <hi>Chriſtians</hi> may be at ſome uncertainty,
through the weakneſs of their faith, and in doubts
what their place and portion hereafter may be;
and therefore alſo may fear to be gone.</p>
            <p>But however, upon the whole, thus far forth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Believer is willing to die; though he ſtill
feel a natural dread of death, though by reaſon of
the remainders of fleſh, he be too much taken
with the pleaſure of an earthly life, and being at
ſome uncertainty, and under ſome doubts what his
future eſtate after death may be, he may linger
and hang back; yet were theſe doubts removed,
and were he grown to an aſſurance, that whenever
his ſoul looſes from this body, it ſhould immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
be received into the Paradiſe of God; he
ſo much prefers a life with God, in perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and bleſſedneſs, above the moſt proſperous
worldly life, that though his fleſh could wiſh a
longer ſtay, yet his ſpirit would be willing, when
ever the Lord calls, to depart and be with Chriſt,
which is far better.</p>
            <p>And according as the mortification of his fleſh,
his Crucifixion to the world, and his aſſurance of
ſalvation, grow more compleat and clear, ſo is
his willingneſs heightned into more earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
and longings: <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, why doth my
Lord delay his coming? when Lord? when ſhall this
duſt return to the earth, and this ſpirit to God that
gave it? make haſte my beloved, and come away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh Brethren, what an argument is here to preſs
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:153788:109"/>
you to put hard for this Victory over the World?
when the World is Conquered, death is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
the fear of death ceaſes: Would you be
delivered from this fear? would you not count
it a mercy better then life to be bold to die? ariſe
then and buckle on your armour, treat this world
no longer as a friend, but deal with it as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
watch againſt it, fight againſt it, and what
day you prevail over it, you have both won the
field of all your doubts and fears, (Victory over
this world is a ſure evidence for heaven) and got
the Maſtery of your carnal hearts, which alone
make death formidable or unwelcome.</p>
            <p>Brethren, death comes, you know, and it may
be upon you on a ſudden; do you not perceive
its approaches? do we not, ſome of us, already
feel our Tabernacles to totter? do not the walls
moulder? the windows grow dim? do not our
pillars ſhake, and grow weak under us? you that
are youngeſt and ſtrongeſt, do you not know that
death may be at the door? do you know what a
day or a night may bring forth? are you ready to
be gone? are you bold to go forth, and meet this
laſt Enemy? or do you not ſhake and ſhrink at the
very mention of it? Be mortified once, and then
let death do its worſt: Give the Word leave to
kill this world, give the ſpirit leave to kill this
fleſh, and then you may give death leave to do its
office.</p>
            <p>Conſider, whither ever you go you carry your
life in your hand, and know not whether ever
you ſhall bring it back. O think with your ſelves,
when you are <hi>going forth into the field,</hi> think with
your ſelves, I carry my life in my hand, and God
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:153788:109"/>
knows whether ever I may return with it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever I may come home alive; when you <hi>go
into the houſe,</hi> think with thy ſelf, God knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever I may come abroad; when you <hi>ariſe in
the morning,</hi> God knows whether my next lodging
may not be in the duſt; when you <hi>lye down in the
evening,</hi> God knows where my ſoul may be before
morning; I may awaken in another world, and
what if I ſhould awaken in flames, and feel this
ſoul wrapp'd up in a winding ſheet of fire? Is
there no fear it may be ſo? Hath this world kept
me from Chriſt all my life long, and will it let
me to heaven at laſt? hath it held me in Chains
all my time here? how will it uſe me when it
carries me hence?</p>
            <p>Are you ready to die? how ſhall I die when
this earth is ſtill my treaſure? <hi>take away my Gods,
and what have I more?</hi> How ſhall I die, when my
ſoul hangs in doubt? whither muſt I when I go
hence? can I follow this griſly Meſſenger, when
I know not whither he will lead me? let mine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
die firſt, let ſin and the World die; let
mine Enemy be dead, and let him that liveth be
my friend, let me ceaſe from this earth, and let
heaven be my treaſure, and then I ſhall be willing
to be gone.</p>
            <p>Be it thus with you Friends, and then you will
be ready to be offered up: Whatever Execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
be now ſent to take away your life, if old age
be ſent, if a diſeaſe, a Fever or Conſumption;
if a diſtaſt, a fall, or a fire, or any the like caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties;
if a ſon of violence, a thief, or a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer;
whatever Executioner be ſent to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
your life, and when ever he comes, whether
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:153788:110"/>
in the firſt, ſecond, or third Watch, you will ſay
with the Apoſtle, <hi>The time of my departure is at
hand, I am ready to be offered up; I deſire to depart and
to be with Chriſt: Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
in peace, for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now at length, <hi>Behold the man.</hi> Here is the
Conquerour, and this is his Victory.</p>
            <p>He that is come unto Chriſt, to whom the
world hath ceaſed to be his treaſure, and he hath
accepted of God as his happineſs and Heritage;
the moderation of whoſe affections to things
earthly, doth evidence that they are now only his
means, not his end: He that can mannage his
worldly affairs without the prejudice of his ſoul;
that whatever his hand finds to do, hath ſtill an
eye to the main; that overcharges not with buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but makes buſineſs leave room for duty;
that ſo cares for the Oxen and the Aſſes, that he
neglect not the ſouls of his ſons or ſervants; that
in all his dealings, hath a due reſpect to truth,
righteouſneſs, and mercy; that will be true, though
to his own hindrance, that will be poor, rather
then diſhoneſt or unmerciful, whom the whole
world cannot hire to lye, or be unrighteous: He
that can uſe the world to its proper end, <hi>all for
God;</hi> he that can want the worlds good things, or
ſuffer the worlds evil things, and can keep his
heart and his way, whether he proſper or ſuffer;
that can deny his fleſh when he hath to ſatisfie it;
that can want, and be content; ſuffer, and be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient;
that is humble in the height of honour,
magnanimous in the depth of danger and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
that keeps in an even equal poiſe, ſober,
temperate, ſerious, in all the turns and changes
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:153788:110"/>
of his life. He that can thus live in the world,
and can die out of the world, that is willing to be
gone; this is the Conquerour, and here is his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. The application that I ſhall make of the

                  <item>Information and Conviction.</item>
                  <item>Direction and Exhortation.</item>

            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>By way of Information and Conviction.</hi> Learn
from what hath been ſaid,
<list>
                  <item>1. That every Captive to the World is an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</item>
                  <item>2. That where there is but little power over the
World, there is but little Faith.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Every Captive to the World is an unbeliever;</hi>
without Chriſt, and in the ſtate of damnation:
Oh think not light of your worldlineſs, 'tis a
<hi>death token</hi> upon you, and ſuch as marks you up with
thoſe that periſh; that this is certainly ſo, that
every worldling is an unbeliever and unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I ſhall make evident by theſe infallible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Can that man be a believer, who is a lover of the
world more then a lover of God?</hi> Art thou a believer
who loveſt not? canſt thou ſay thou loveſt God,
when the better part of thine heart is with the
world? will this be accepted, when thou canſt
only ſay, <hi>Lord, I bring thee half mine heart,</hi> and but
the leaſt half neither; here 'tis divided, let the
world I pray thee have the firſt choice, and take
thou all that the world leaves? give me leave firſt
to mind my earthly things, and next to theſe, God
ſhall be regarded? Speak Conſcience, will God
accept ſuch a gift? <hi>ſuch a little piece of a ſoul,</hi> when
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:153788:111"/>
the main is beſtowed on another? Will God ſay,
Surely this is my Child, ſurely this is my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<hi>next to the world he loves me beſt of all?</hi> Do
ye think he will? what ſaith the Scripture? <hi>Mat.</hi>
10. 37. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother m<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re then me,
is not worthy of me; he that loveth Son or Daughter
more then me, is unworthy of me.</hi> Find, if you can,
a more convincing argument of an unbeliever,
then that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 4. A lover of
pleaſure more then a lover of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that loveth the world more then God, is
none of his; that cannot be deny'd. And art thou
not the man? doſt thou love God as thou loveſt
the world? let thy life ſpeak; what ſeekeſt thou?
whom ſerveſt thou? where doſt thou beſtow thy
ſelf? in whom doſt thou bleſs thy ſelf? what is
the chief pleaſure and comfort of thy life? Is
God he? Is it God whom thou ſeekeſt, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt,
and bleſſeſt thy ſelf in? does not thine heart
know that thy Mammon is the God whom thou
ſerveſt? that thou loveſt to be rich, and to proſper
in the world, more then ever thou lovedſt to be
holy and righteous before God.</p>
            <p>Doſt thou love God? where are thy labours of
love? what haſt thou done for God ever ſince thou
wert born? where are thy fruits thou haſt brought
forth unto the Lord? haſt thou been ſerving God
all thy daies, and yet haſt nothing to ſhew of all
that thou haſt done? thou haſt ſon ething to ſhew
for thy ſerving the world; this houſe thou haſt
gotten, or that Farm, or theſe Sheep and Oxen,
or this ſtock of money; ſomething thou haſt to
ſhew, to prove thee a ſervant of the world; but
haſt thou been ſerving God all thy time, and haſt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:153788:111"/>
nothing to ſhew for it? Sure Brethren, worldly
men are either very fools, or very falſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
if they do not condemn themſelves here.
<hi>I confeſs I have done little for God all my time; I have
been buſie for this world, but I confeſs I have but loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and neglected the things of the other world.</hi> I
muſt never lye for the matter, mine own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
tells me 'tis thus.</p>
            <p>Fooliſh ſoul, Haſt thou ſerv'd the world more
then God, and canſt thou yet make thy ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
thou loveſt God more then the world? to
ſay thou loveſt God above all, though thou haſt but
little ſought or ſerv'd him; is to ſay, I love him
above all, but I care not much for him; if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man ſhould have ſaid ſo, would not thine own
heart have laugh'd at him for a fool, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
him for a lyar?</p>
            <p>Tremble Worldling, and hear <hi>this firſt evidence</hi>
againſt thee; thy whole life tells thee thou loveſt
the world more then thou loveſt God; and God
himſelf tells thee, that he that loveth the world
more then God, is none of his.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Is he a believer that is not come to Chriſt?</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Chriſt, and believing in Chriſt are the
ſame, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 35. Art thou come unto Chriſt?
whence art thou come? from the world? what,
and yet thine heart ſtill in the world? art thou
come to Chriſt, who art ſtill where thou wert,
when thou wert without Chriſt? canſt thou be here
and there too? deceive not thy ſelf, thou mayſt
as well be at once in heaven and hell, as thine
heart be in Chriſt, and in the world.</p>
            <p>Are Chriſt and the world friends? are God
and Mammon become but one Maſter? are the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:153788:112"/>
two kingdomes united, and may the ſame perſons
at once be ſubjects of them both?</p>
            <p>Hath Chriſt ever ſaid, be mine, and then ſtay
where thou art? liſt thy name under me for a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and then go and ſerve the world ſtill? be
proud, be covetous, be ſenſual, be in all things
as the men of this world are, only be my Diſciple?</p>
            <p>Is not the <hi>renouncing</hi> of the world, included in
our coming to Chriſt? doth not he that ſaith to
thee, <hi>Come,</hi> firſt ſay, <hi>depart?</hi> and is not thy <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to Chriſt,</hi> in the very nature of it, <hi>a departing
from the world,</hi> thy chooſing of him, a refuſing of it?
when Chriſt and the world are offered to thy
choice, canſt thou chooſe both? muſt thou not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
take to the one, and let the other go?</p>
            <p>And haſt thou renounc'd the world, who art ſtil
a worldling? what haſt thou renounc'd of it? or
how far forth haſt thou renounc'd it? Is it not thy
treaſure ſtill? is it not thy Lord ſtill? Is not this
it which thou ſtill takeſt, as thy governour and
reward.</p>
            <p>Doeſt thou love it as thy God, and ſerve it as
thy God, and hold it faſt as thy God, and yet haſt
thou renounc'd it? does every one that knows thee
point with the finger at thee, <hi>there goes an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm,</hi>
there goes a Mammoniſt, there lives a
true drudge to the world, and wilt thou yet ſay,
I have done with the world?</p>
            <p>Is thy luſt, and thine appetite after more, as
greedy, and inſatiable as ever? is thy love, and
delight, and reſt in what thou haſt, as great as
ever? is it ſo hard to get any thing out of thine
hand for God, ſo that that little which comes, muſt
be wrung as ſo many drops of bloud from thine
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:153788:112"/>
heart? art thou ſo pinching and ſparing, that ſcarce
any without thine own belly is ever the better for
thee, and haſt thou yet renounc'd the world.</p>
            <p>Art thou ſo crucified, and vexed, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
when thou art croſs'd or miſcarrieſt in
any little of thy worldly intereſt, and canſt thou
yet ſay, I am crucified to the world?</p>
            <p>Can the world make thee lye, and diſſemble,
and play the knave, when tis for thy advantage;
can it command thy conſcience, and thy religion,
and thy hopes, to do obeyſance to it; can it keep
thee out of thy cloſet, out of the Church; muſt
prayers and ſabbaths and ſermons and Sacraments
be neglected, when the world hath any buſineſs
for thee, and hath it ſtill ſo much buſineſs
for thee, that thou canſt ſcarce have one prayer
or one ſabbath clear of its encroachment? doth it
follow thee into thy cloſet, and follow thee into
the congregation, and ſo fill thine head and take
away thine heart, that thou canſt make nothing
of thy religion? or whatſoever tranſactions there
have been ſometimes betwixt the Lord and thy
Soul, doth the World ſtill meet thee at the door
and make all void and null? Hath it held thee in
ſuch ignorance, and Atheiſm, that under all the
means of knowledge and grace, thou ſtill liveſt
without God in the World, and canſt thou yet ſay
thou haſt ſhaken off its yoke.</p>
            <p>Stand worldling and hear <hi>this farther evidence;</hi>
Thy greedineſs, thy penuriouſneſs, thy lying and
defrauding, thy neglected duties, thy neglected
ſabbaths thy neglected Soul and all upon the
Worlds account, theſe will tell thee thou haſt not
renounc'd the World, and that will convict thee,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:153788:113"/>
that thou art not come unto Chriſt, nor haſt be
lieved on him.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Is he a believer who hath [abſolutely] choſen this
world, and hath onely [conditionally] choſen Chriſt?</hi>
who will <hi>firſt</hi> ſeek his own things, and in the <hi>ſecond
place,</hi> the things of Chriſt? who will model his
chriſtianity into a conſiſtency with his carnal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt?
Is he a believer who will have both if it
may be, Chriſt and this World too, but if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have both, will let Chriſt go? Is he a chriſtian
that ſayes, i'le ſerve Chriſt though it coſt me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
I'le be for him when I have nothing elſe to
do, he ſhall have all my <hi>ſpare hours,</hi> if that will
content him? is this to give Chhriſt the <hi>prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,</hi>
or is he a Chriſtian, that will take in Chriſt
to be an <hi>underling</hi> to the world?</p>
            <p>What are the terms on which Chriſt is offered?
hath he given thee leave to make thine own terms?
or muſt thou not ſtand to his? what are Chriſts
terms, but <hi>that thou take him abſolutely,</hi> that is purely
on his own terms without putting in any of thine.
Doſt thou underſtand what his conditions are? Is
it only, that he ſhall be <hi>ſecond in the kingdom?</hi> that
he ſhall be obeyed in all things provided the world
do not contradict it? Is this Chriſtianity, that the
world ſhould be ſuffered to give check to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and intereſt of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>And is not this all thy Chriſtianity? thou ſaieſt
indeed, thou haſt choſen Chriſt abſolutely; God
forbid that I ſhould prefer any thing before Chriſt,
that I ſhould mind any thing more then Chriſt; I
mind the World, tis true, and I ought ſo to do;
but Chriſt hath my heart, and I had rather looſe all
that ever I have, then at laſt be found out of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:153788:113"/>
But conſider; thou mayſt beſt judge of thine heart
by thy life; as I ſaid before, ſo I demand of thee
again, whither does the courſe of thy life mainly
bend? what art thou doing all the year round?
what proportion hath Chriſt of thy daily care and
labour? ſpeak truth; would not thine heart tell
thee thou lyeſt, if thou ſay, thou art more earneſtly
and more conſtantly caring for the things of
Chriſt, then of the world?</p>
            <p>Again, thou mayſt beſt Judge of thy choice by
obſerving thy <hi>critical hours.</hi> How is it ordinarily
with thee, when Chriſt and the World ſtand in
<hi>competition?</hi> when it comes to be a caſe, that one
of the two muſt be neglected, which of the two
then uſe to carry thee?</p>
            <p>Thou knoweſt thou haſt often neglected Chriſt
for the world; thou knoweſt that thy buſineſſes,
or thy pleaſures, or thy companions have often
loſt thee a prayer, or a ſabbath, or a ſermon; thou
wouldſt have pray'd oftner, or heard oftner, but
thou couldſt not have leiſure: thou knoweſt it
hath been too often thus: and conſider if it be not
commonly thus. How ſeldom is it that thou canſt
remember, that thou haſt carried thy ſelf as a
Chriſtian, to thy loſs; that thou haſt followed
Chriſt in any duties, when thou kneweſt it would
have been more to thy profit, to have put Chriſt
off to another time. Many a time have thy gains,
or thy friends, or thy pleaſures, loſt thee thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
but how often couldſt thou ever ſay, <hi>My
conſcience hath loſt me a friend, my conſcience hath loſt
me a good bargain?</hi> Whatever Chriſt hath at any time
call'd thee to, If thou couldſt ſay, it is not for
mine eaſe, it is not for my credit, it is nof for my
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:153788:114"/>
ſafety to hearken, hath not this been counted ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
enough to hold thee back, and excuſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to ſave thee from blame?</p>
            <p>And wilt thou yer ſay, thou haſt choſen Chriſt
abſolutely? or canſt thou think thy ſelf a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
who haſt choſen him only conditionally?
Is this the Chriſtianity on which thou wilt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thy Soul, <hi>I will be for Chriſt as far as the world,
and this fleſh, or</hi> (which is all one) <hi>as far as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
will give me leave?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have known ſome poor ignorant wretches,
whom when I have been preſſing to a ſerious mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, and their eternal concernment, they
have anſwered me, why I do, <hi>as far as God will give
me leave;</hi> No no wretch, thou miſtakeſt, tis onely
<hi>as far as the Devil will give thee leave;</hi> and this is
the common caſe of Worldlings; thou that wilt
be a Chriſtian no farther then the World will give
thee leave, wilt be ſuch, no farther then the Devil
will give thee leave; and ſure thou that wilt be
a Chriſtian no farther then the Divel will give
thee leave, when he will give thee leave, thou
ſhalt to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Wanton, when wilt thou be chaſt? when my
fleſh will give me leave. Drunkard, when wilt
thou be ſober? when my companions will give
me leave. Earthworm, when wilt thou to Chriſt?
when the World will give me leave: how much
of Chriſtianity wilt thou take up? what the world
will allow me: how much is that? as much as
pleaſe the Devil. But when wilt thou to Heaven
then? why when the fleſh and the World and the
Devil are all agreed to ſend me thither.</p>
            <p>Stand Worldling, this once more ſtand, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:153788:114"/>
hear thy whole evidence; <hi>Thou art a lover of the
world more then a lover of God; thou art not come
unto Chriſt; or if thou ſeem to be come, thou haſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of him only on condition, that though thou be his
Diſciple, yet thou mayſt ſtill continue a ſervant to this
world.</hi> Surely if the God of this world, who hath
blinded thy mind, that thou believe not, had not
ſo blinded thee, that thou canſt not ſee thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
thine own heart would condemn thee, and
thine own hand would ſubſcribe thy ſentence;
and this is thy ſentence, <hi>That thou art yet under the
dominion, and therefore under the damnation of the
world; Thy ſoul abideth in death, and the wrath of
God abideth on thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou art a man of this world, thou haſt taken
thy portion in this life, and art like to have no
better then thou haſt choſen: If thy day run out
thus, thy word at laſt will be that which was the
rich mans, <hi>Luke 16. Son, remember thou haſt received
thy good things.</hi> Oh what's the meaning of that
word? why this is the meaning of it, thou haſt
all the good that thou art like to hsve for ever; an
end, an end is come upon all thy comforts, the
Sun is ſet upon all thy good daies, not one good
day, not one merry hour more for ever and ever;
thou haſt had thy day, henceforth nothing remains
to thee, but an eternal night, the blackneſs of
darkneſs for ever; thy temporal joyes are ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up of everlaſting ſorrows, thy honors are
expired into everlaſting contempt, thy riches
have taken wings, and now thy poverty is come
upon thee as an armed man, which thou ſhalt not
eſcape. All this is included in this word, which
will be thy word, <hi>Thou haſt received thy good things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:153788:115"/>
               <hi>What eyes have ye, O ye ſons of the earth, if
you do not yet ſee? what hearts have you, if you
do not yet tremble?</hi> The Lord be merciful to me,
if theſe things be ſo, what's like to become of me? I
have ſpun a fair thread; Oh I have coveted an evil
covetouſneſs, I have been buſie in gathering dirt, and
building my Neſt, and providing for my young, but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is my ſoul taking her flight? If the reſt of my daies
be as the daies that are paſt, (and God knows whether af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo long an Apprentice I may ever go out free) if the
reſt of my daies be as the daies that are paſt, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
but a fearful expectation of wrath and fiery indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which will devoure me for ever? I have kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
a fire, and compaſs'd my ſelf about with ſparks,
and after I have walk'd a while in the light of my fire,
and of the ſparks that I have kindled, this ſhall I have
of the hand of the moſt High, I ſhall lye down in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
            <p>O ye worldlings, ſhake up out of your ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
ſecurity; will you yet receive the Word of
the Lord, and ſuffer your ſelves to be convinced?
will you yet believe your ſelves to be unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers?
What ſay you? Do you not believe that
Worldlings are unbelievers? can you have any
other thought but you are Worldlings?</p>
            <p>Open your eyes upon all your wayes, view the
whole courſe of your life, what it hath been from
your firſt time until now, and let Conſcience
ſpeak freely.</p>
            <p>If theſe two things might ſtick in your hearts,
<hi>that you are Worldlings, and that Worldlings have no
part in Chriſt,</hi> then there were hope, that you
would accept of thoſe counſels which I ſhall give
you from the Lord, in order to your eſcape, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:153788:115"/>
I have firſt urg'd the ſecond word of Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That where there is but little power over the
world, there is but little Faith.</hi> As the firſt Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
will <hi>overthrow</hi> the Faith of ſome, and prove
it a meer nullity, ſo this will <hi>call in queſtion</hi> the
confidence of others, and at leaſt take them ſome
degrees lower.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Profeſſors who have a name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>the firſt three</hi> of the Worthies of our Lord;
have the ſite and the aſpect of ſtars of the firſt
magnitude, and are ranked among the chief of
Saints; who have riſen high in the eaſier and
ſweeter, but leſs ſignificant parts of Religion;
who have gotten the language, and taſted, as they
imagine, of the milk and honey of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and
learned much of the more pleaſing manners of
that good Land; who ſeem to be of the more
intimate acquaintance of the ſublimer ſpirit, and
power of the Goſpel, and to be much elevated in
the ſpirituality of their notions and duties, above
the attainments of vulgar Chriſtians; and hence
are grown up in their own and others apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
to be as <hi>the Cedars of the Lord</hi> among the
lower ſhrubs; whom yet if we enquire into, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thoſe ſeverer points, <hi>of mortification, ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
and crucifixion to the world,</hi> poſſibly they may
be found in theſe things as low as <hi>the leaſt of
Saints:</hi> The faith of theſe, if it prove to be <hi>the
faith of Gods Elect</hi> at all, yet ſure it will be found
to be by many degrees leſs then it appears; and
theſe <hi>arietes gregis,</hi> muſt yet for the real ſpirit of
faith and holineſs, come behind <hi>the littles ones of
the flock?</hi> where there is but little power over the
world, there is but little faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:153788:116"/>
In order to the mannaging, and carrying home
this Conviction, conſider, that
<list>
                  <item>1. According to the truth or falſhood of our
faith, ſo are we either Conquerours, or Captives
to the world.</item>
                  <item>2. According to the proportion of our faith,
ſo will this victory over the world be more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
or imperfect.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>According to the truth or falſhood of our faith, ſo
are we either Conquerours, or Captives to the world.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
unbeliever is a Captive, every believer is a
Conquerour of the world; both theſe have been
already proved.</p>
            <p>Faith is our <hi>chuſing and laying hold on another porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
our reſigning our ſelves to the dominion of
another Lord: the world is gone, when it may
no longer be our Ruler or reward.</p>
            <p>Faith <hi>changes the heart, Act.</hi> 15. 9. it kills the
Spirit of this World, and that other Spirit that
riſes up in its room, is this Spirit of faith. By
faith Chriſt is form'd upon the heart, the old Soul
is made new, renewed after the image of God in
righteouſneſs and true holineſs: this new Soul is
ſuited to a new treaſure; earthly things wax old,
and old things paſs away, when the ſoul is made
new: 'tis argument enough that thou art an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
and an enemy to the Croſs of Chriſt,
that thou ſtill <hi>mindeſt earthly things,</hi> Philip. 3.
19.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>According to the proportion of our faith, ſo will
this victory over the world be more compleat or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
We may beſt take the height and degree of
our faith, by obſerving the elevation of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
above the earth: a low and earthly ſpirit,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:153788:116"/>
whatever ſhew it makes, is but of little faith:
Faith hath a general influence upon every grace
and luſt; as to the nouriſhing of the one, ſo to
the withering of the other; luſt and the world
run parallel; where one is, there you ſhall find
the other, <hi>on the Throne, or at the footſtool:</hi> Faith
lays luſt in the dirt, and the world ever falls with
it: Faith is <hi>our arm,</hi> and according as this arm
grows ſtronger, ſo is the blow it gives to our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
more mortal. The power of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in us <hi>from faith to faith;</hi> there is a more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
communication, and a more vigorous
exerting of this Divine Power where faith is
grown; where we are but of <hi>little ſtrength,</hi> its
certain we are but <hi>weak in faith;</hi> and where our
adverſary is ſo ſtrong, 'tis argument enough that
we are weak.</p>
            <p>Growth in grace is then prov'd to be moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
when 'tis moſt <hi>equal and univerſal;</hi> 'tis an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
in Nature where one member out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grows
the reſt; as grace and peace, ſo grace and
grace have their due proportions each to other:
great peace, and little grace, will make it queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable,
whether that peace be peace; ſomething
of one grace, and nothing of another, will make
it as doubtful, whether that grace be grace; high
in knowledge, and low in love; ſtrong in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and looſe in conſcience; hot in affection,
and cold in practiſe; in the ſolaces of the ſpirit,
and yet walking in the fleſh: Behold a Chriſtian,
like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image, <hi>the head of gold, the
feet of iron and clay; deſinit in piſcem mulier formofa
ſupernè.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis ſtrange to obſerve what <hi>contradictions</hi> ſome
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:153788:117"/>
Profeſſors of Chriſtianity are; they are what
they are not, they are not what they are: whileſt
they would be the great reconcilers of fleſh and
ſpirit, of earth and heaven, and make the ſerving
of God and their own bellies, the ſame ſervice,
behold how they are divided from themſelves;
they love God, and love him not; they ſerve
God, and ſerve him not; this they may do as well
as love God, and this preſent world.</p>
            <p>Oh how different are many of us <hi>from our ſelves;</hi>
our practices from our principles, our doings
from our ſayings; and yet how little differing
<hi>from others:</hi> you pray as others do not, you hear
as others do not, you ſwear not as others, you
curſe not as others; but <hi>do you not covet as others?
are you not carnal as others?</hi> Conſider your wayes,
who more intent upon their preſent commodity,
who more hot upon the chaſe of an earthly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
then ſome of thoſe who profeſs to have
laid up their treaſure in heaven? Are there none
to be ſound, who pretend to the greateſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Divine Love, to the higheſt pitch of
Spirituality and Divine Communion; who ſeem
to pant after the Lord, and breath out their ſouls
in their warm and paſſionate duties, and yet are
eaten out, and ſwallowed up of the cares of this
life?</p>
            <p>It is an amazing thing to conſider, what a
<hi>ſtrange degree</hi> of earthlineſs is to be found among
ſuch; what infatiable hunger, what indefatigable
labour after an encreaſe of their eſtates? how
little reſpect to ſoul or conſcience, where their
gain is concerned? how ordinarily diſpenſing
with lying, promiſe breaking, and almoſt any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:153788:117"/>
when 'tis for their advantage?
how many grains muſt there be allowed them,
e're charity it ſelf can judge them honeſt?</p>
            <p>And where is all beſtowed that is thus gotten
in? how little goes out for God, or any of his?
how many hypocritical bemoanings of the hard
caſe of the poor, to one liberal alms? Some
gather only that they may lay up, others that
they may have to ſpend upon their luſts, to build
them houſes, and furniſh their tables, to trim
their carkaſſes, to pleaſe their eye, or their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats;
and all this either juſtified and allowed, or
at leaſt made up with ſome ſuch hypocritical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
<hi>Woe is me this world is too hard for me, O it
eats up my time, O it ſteals away mine heart; how am
I overcharged, how is my ſoul even choaked within me,
what ſhall I do to help it?</hi> And when the complaint
is thus made, the matter is mended; now a good
Chriſtian, now eaſe, and joy, and confidence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns;
and then on again the ſame courſe.</p>
            <p>Brethren be ſerious; conſider your ſelves, feel
your own pulſes, view your own faces, and ways,
obſerve your hearts, ſee where their daily walks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
are; may you not find them ten times walking to
and fro through the earth, to once or twice caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a look towards heaven?</p>
            <p>What are their daily tasks? what is the work
you every day put them upon? Inſtead of thoſe
higher and nobler Offices of Veſſels of Honor,
<hi>waiting before the Throne of God, ſtanding in his
Courts, bearing his Name, beholding his Face, ſetting
forth his Praiſes;</hi> have not our hearts been made,
<hi>hewers of wood, and drawers of water, carriers of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
ſervers of tables, purveyors for the fleſh, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:153788:118"/>
for the appetite, ſervants to the back and the belly,
the great traders and merchants of the earth, to buy in
proviſion for luſt?</hi> Worthy employment for immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Souls; as if the <hi>utenſils</hi> of the Temple, <hi>the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

and the baſons, all of beaten gold,</hi> ſhould have been
fetchd out and ſet up in a blind Inne or a dirty ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
for the ſervice and the pleaſure of every

            <p>Have not your Souls, none of you, been thus

when any thing is to be done for God, the body
muſt do that; the body muſt to the cloſet, the

read, but the Soul muſt ſtay abroad; when any
thing is to be done for the other world, that muſt
be but <hi>bodily exerciſe,</hi> but when this fleſh muſt be
ſerved, that's the <hi>heart-work,</hi> that's work for the
Soul. If theſe Souls could be ſeen with bodily
eyes, a man that goes into the field, or into a fair,
or to a feaſt, might ſee an hundred Souls more
there then bodies; and he that went into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of the Lord, if there were never ſo great
a throng, may be, he might ſee but a few hearts in

            <p>Chriſtians conſider, is this your faith? is this
your victory over the world? is this to be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?
is this to be crucified with Chriſt? or to

think your ſelves believers, eſpecially of <hi>ſo high

            <p>What think you of thoſe Jews, of whom the

to have a mouth full of God, a mouth full of love,
and an heart full of covetouſneſs?</p>
            <p>Give me leave to interpoſe a word or two to

                  </gap>rs of religion,</hi> in order whereto let us a
little conſider that Scripture, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 18. 19.
Where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a ſort of profeſſours
much of this earthly make, and he ſpeaks with
tears in his eyes. <hi>Many walk of whom I have told you
often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the croſs of Chriſt; whoſe end is deſtruction,
whoſe God is their belly, and whoſe glory is their ſhame,
who mind erthly things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the former part of the chapter you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
how</p>
            <p>1. He gives an account of himſelf, and his own
Chriſtianity: <hi>and this in theſe particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He ſet ſuch an high rate on Chriſt, and an
intereſt in his righteouſneſs, that in compariſon
hereof, he counted all things elſe but loſs and
dung: let this gain be loſs, this earth be dung,
troden under foot as dung, caſt out as dung, ſo I
may win Chriſt and be found in him.</p>
            <p>2. He unites <hi>intereſt</hi> in Chriſt, with <hi>conformity</hi>
to Chriſt: they lye both together in the ſame
heart, and his Soul is making out after both in the
ſame breath. <hi>That I may win Chriſt and be found in
him;</hi> and that <hi>I may know him, and the power of his
reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being
made conformable to his death.</hi> He would not only
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:153788:119"/>
rejoyce in Chriſt, he would not only live in Chriſt,
but be dead with Chriſt; and then be raiſed with
Chriſt above theſe earthly things: he would have
his <hi>intereſt</hi> in the death and reſurrection of Chriſt,
witneſſed by <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with him in both, by the
power of his death and reſurrection, made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
in him: he would that both the death of Jeſus,

towards the obtaining of Chriſt: <hi>I follow after: I
preſs towards the mark:</hi> and this not in his <hi>prayers</hi>
only, but in his whole <hi>practice, this one thing I do:</hi>
this one is all: whatever I am doing, this I am
doing, I have nothing elſe to do, nothing elſe to
do, nothing elſe to ſeek, but this intereſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity

his phariſaical righteouſneſs, and his external pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
to which this eſpecially refers, but much
more, all carnal and earthly things, <hi>v. 8. Yea doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
I count all things but loſs:</hi> he leaves all behind;

            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>He propoſes himſelf as a pattern to all beleivers,

though they profeſs'd Chriſt with them, and worſhipp'd
God with them, and walk'd with them, yet they walk'd
not after them: <hi>and ſetts this brand upon them,</hi>
They are the enemies of the croſs of Chriſt; whoſe end is

thy heart, and thy way as the heart of theſe? <hi>So ſhall

even whileſt you pretend to rejoyce in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,

            <p>Oh how many ſuch <hi>mark'd and branded Diſciples,</hi>
may we find among us! whom while their <hi>luſts</hi>

the <hi>word</hi> hath branded for enemies, and veſſels of
deſtruction: whilſt the Devil hath branded, and
the World hath branded the whole generation of
the Saints, for a proud, deceitful, earthly, ſelf-ſeeking
generation, Chriſt hath ſet this brand on
thee, <hi>earthly ſenſual deviliſh.</hi>

            <p>Oh brethren, if we could ſpeak of theſe with the

of the profeſſion of the Goſpel: good had it
been for the Goſpel, if never a good word of it
had ever proceeded out of ſuch mouths; and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

known, nor ſo much as heard of the Goſpel of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Friends, if you do not yet fall a weeping for
your ſelves, for your hypocriſie, your carnality;
for your ſelf-ſeeking, and ſelf-deceiving, my ſoul
weep thou in ſecret for them: Oh that mine head
were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears,
that I might weep day and night for you, till ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this earth be thrown out of your hearts, or
the name of Chriſt out of your mouths: O for
more of the Goſpel, or for leſs; for more of the
power, or nothing of the name; for more of its
holineſs, or leſs of its hopes, and boaſtings; come
ye and be crucified to this world, or talk no more
of the Croſs of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Oh how many enemies hath the Croſs of Chriſt
made him! oh how few friends have the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Chriſt left him? are thoſe the friends of
Chriſt, who are the enemies of his Croſs? are
you the friends of Chriſt, who are the intimates
of the world? will profeſſing, and praying, and
hearing, baptize ſuch into the name of Diſciples?
If lying, and promiſe breaking, if ſerving of

            </p>

my confidence; God forbid that I ſhould think,
that I have profeſſed in vain, that I have heard,

know whom I have believed, I feel that I love
God, and I am perſwaded that nothing ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
me from the love of God, which is in Chriſt
Jeſus our Lord; whatever corruptions I have,
yet the ſpirit witneſſes with my ſpirit, that I am
the Child of God, I am ſealed by that holy ſpirit
unto the day of Redemption, and I will not caſt
away my confidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> The meaning of all theſe good words may
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:153788:121"/>
be no more but this, you will hold your <hi>Opinion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the greateſt evidence of Scripture and
Reaſon: For what is that which thou calleſt the
witneſs and the ſeal of the ſpirit, but an Opinion
of thine own; a voice within thee, or a ſtrong
perſwaſion of thine own heart, that thou art of
God? which becauſe it is atteſted by ſome gifts of
the ſpirit, and ſome affectionate workings of
thine heart, at times, heavenward; thou takeſt to
be the voice of the Divine Spirit, though it be
never ſo contradictory to the Word of God; and
ſo wilt hold thy confidence, notwithſtanding what
the Word ſpeaks to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But that thou mayſt no longer thus deceive thy
ſelf, know and conſider,</p>
            <p>That the Spirit witneſſes and ſeals in this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
way,</p>
            <p>By being the mark of the Lord upon us.</p>
            <p>By being the light of the Lord in us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we come to diſcern the mark of the Lord up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>By being the mark of the Lord upon us,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.
24. <hi>he that keepeth his commandements, dwelleth in him,
and he in him, hereby we know that he abideth in us,
by the Spirit which he hath given us.</hi> By the Spirit
we are to underſtand, the graces of the Spirit;
<hi>that holineſs and heavenlineſs of mind,</hi> which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
hath wrought upon us. The ſpirit of God forms
us into his own likeneſs, and this image of the
Spirit is Gods mark upon us.</p>
            <p>As mens, ſo Chriſts ſheep may be known whoſe
they are, by their maſters mark upon them:
whoſe mark is <hi>an earthly mind?</hi> Is it of Chriſt, or
is it not the mark of the God of this world? Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:153788:121"/>
and ſpirituality is the mark of Chriſt, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
and ſin is of the Devil. To whom does thy
Soul belong? The Spirit, thou ſayeſt, witneſſeth
that thou belongeſt to God; I but whoſe mark is
it that is upon thee? is this covetouſneſs and
greedineſs upon the world, is this lying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding,
this unrighteouſneſs and unmercifulneſs,
which the world can ordinarily command thee to,
is this the mark of God or the Devil? the Devil
is this thy maſter, for behold his mark ſtill upon
thee.</p>
            <p>It's true Chriſt buyes all his ſheep out of the
Devils flock; but whatever ſheep he buyes and
brings home, he ſcrapes out the old, and claps on
his own mark upon it: and though there be ſome
prints of the old yet remaining, (till we have
put off fleſh ſome dirt will ſtick) yet the new
mark which Chriſt hath ſet on, now carries it.</p>
            <p>Say not thou art ſeal'd with the Spirit, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thy comforts or confidences have been, unleſs
thou ſeeſt his mark upon thee; ſay not thou art
mark'd by the Spirit, whileſt the Devils mark
[an earthly mind] is the moſt viſible and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
upon thee.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>By being the light of the Lord within us,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are able to diſcern our Lords mark upon
us, 1 Cor. 2. 12.</p>
            <p>The Devil ſo amuſes and deludes Souls, that
they often know not what to make of themſelves;
but conclude themſelves to be quite another thing
then they are: and this he doth by this threefold
device; by
<list>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:153788:122"/>
                  <item>Counterfeiting Chriſts mark,</item>
                  <item>Pulliating his own mark,</item>
                  <item>Blurring and blinding the mark of Chriſt.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>By counterfeiting Chriſts mark,</hi> and ſetting it
on his own ſheep. Chriſt marks his ſheep eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>in the heart;</hi> that's the throne of the Spirit,
that's the ſeat of Grace, <hi>the heart;</hi> the Devil can
do ſomething to the counterfeiting of this; he
can make common grace look like ſaving grace,
he can paint the face of a Saint upon the heart of
a beaſt.</p>
            <p>But he can more eaſily diſſemble the <hi>outward
marks</hi> of Chriſt. Chriſt hath his outward marks;
his <hi>earmark, Joh. 10. 27. My ſheep, hear my voice.</hi>
His <hi>mark in the forehead,</hi> the owning or confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Chriſt before men, <hi>Luk. 12. 8. He that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
me before men him will I confeſs before my father
which is in Heaven.</hi> His <hi>mark in the mouth;</hi> he cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſes
their lip, and makes them a people of
a <hi>pure language, Zeph.</hi> 3. 9. All theſe the Devil can
counterfeit with more eaſe: he can bring his
ſheep to <hi>hear Chriſts preaching:</hi> he can bring them
<hi>to own and confeſs Chriſt</hi> before men: he can teach
his <hi>to pray, and to be expert in the language of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:</hi>
and when he hath done thus, then he tells
them, ſee thou art one of Chriſts; for behold thou
prayeſt, and heareſt and confeſſeſt Chriſt; and
what are theſe but Chriſts marks upon thee; when
whatever is upon the tongue or the forehead, the
image of the Devil is ſtill upon the heart,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>By palliating his own mark:</hi> Chriſts mark upon
thee? I but whoſe is that, <hi>this earthly mind,</hi> that
ſtands above it? O he hath a device for that too:
he hath a cloke for covetouſneſs: 'tis but provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:153788:122"/>
or good husbandry; nay this <hi>gain is godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi>
all this carking and caring and drudging for
the world, is but in obedience to the will of God,
to <hi>provide things honeſt in the ſight of all men.</hi> And in
this the Devil is ſo damnably ſucceſsful, that it is
one of the hardeſt tasks, to help poor worldlings
to the ſight of what's under this cloke, though all
that know thee, do ſee that thou art an earthworm,
yet thou wilt not be brought to ſee thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>And as the Devil thus deceives his own, ſo he
diſtreſſes the Saints,</p>
            <p>3. <hi>By blurring Chriſts mark that it cannot eaſily be
ſeen, or known to be his.</hi> As he can make a meer
paint look like ſincerity, ſo he can make ſincerity
look like hypocriſie: as many carnal confidents
bleſs themſelves in the opinion of their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs;
ſo many mortified, broken, upright
hearts condemn themſelves for hypocrites: though
Chriſt be in them, and hath ſet his ſeal upon their
hearts, yet the Devil raiſes up ſo many black
miſts, of melancholique thoughts and fears, that
they cannot ſee what there is of Chriſt in them;
and thereupon they judge very ſadly of their caſe.
<hi>I doubt I am an hypocrite, and none of Chriſts, for what
is there of the grace of Chriſt found in me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the Spirit of the Lord; as it works
grace in the heart, ſo it gives light to the eye: it
brings mens perſwaſions and opinions to the word,
and compares them with that; it ſearches the
ſcriptures, and ſhews the Soul <hi>what Chriſts mark
is;</hi> it irradiates the heart, and ſhews the very
ſame mark which is written in the word, ſtamp'd
upon the Soul, and thereby eſtabliſhes it in power;
if there be no ſuch mark found there, but the quite
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:153788:123"/>
contrary to it, the peace that's ſpoken is not of
the Spirit of God, but of the Devil.</p>
            <p>Worldly profeſſour, doſt thou not ſee the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>death-mark</hi> upon thee? or if thou doeſt not,
does not every one that knows thee, behold it?
Doth not this earthly mind, appear upon thy fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
upon thy tongue, upon the palms of thine
hands, and the prints of thy feet? may not thy
love of the world be read in every look, in every
word, in every line of thy life? and wilt thou yet
ſay, it's the Spirit of the Lord that ſpeaks peace
to thee? whoſe mark is this <hi>[they mind earthly
things?]</hi> of them that are ſaved, or of them that
periſh? and is not this the moſt proper character
that can be given of thee? ſee and take more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge of thy ſelf: canſt thou not ſee? haſt
thou received the Spirit, and yet not ſo much
light, as to diſcern betwixt earth and Heaven?</p>
            <p>Is the Lord divided; and become contrary to
himſelf? do not his hand and his ſeal agree? does
his word write this man <hi>no child,</hi> and is that his
Spirit that calls thee, <hi>a child of God?</hi> once again,
ſee and compare the writings; that in the word,
and that in thy heart; and if the voice within thee
be not according, call it not the witneſs of the
Spirit, but the falſe witneſs of the Devil.</p>
            <p>If thou wilt yet underſtand thy ſelf no better,
(it's much to be feared, thou wilt not; there's too
much duſt in thine eye, for thee to ſee it,) If thou
wilt not ſee it, yet there it ſtands written upon
thee in moſt legible characters, <hi>a minder of earthly
things, whoſe end is deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beloved, I am perſwaded better things of you,
to whom I am now ſpeaking; even <hi>you of little faith;</hi>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:153788:123"/>
though it may be <hi>of a great name:</hi> yet with you alſo
muſt I plead a while, and tell you from the Lord
that I have <hi>ſomewhat againſt you:</hi> and oh were it but
a <hi>little ſomewhat,</hi> that I have to ſpeak, even againſt
you: but ſure, there is very much to be ſpoken,
unleſs you will ſave me the labour, and ſpeak
againſt your ſelves. So much may be ſaid, as if it
be duly conſidered may take you down many
rounds lower then you imagine your ſelves to have
aſcended? how few of you that are riſen with
Chriſt, but are too often letting your affections
run down again to this earth? who though you
have really counted this earth but dung, yet are too
greedily gathering up this dung into your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes;
that have your hands full and your mouths
full of this dung and much more then you are aware
of it is ſtill in your hearts; that are not able to
looſe what you have accounted loſs. In whom
though Chriſt may be <hi>really formed,</hi> yet there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<hi>little conformity,</hi> to his life or death. To
whom though it hath been long ſince ſaid, <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
come forth,</hi> yet to this day you have ſcarce got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
your heads above ground: whoſe bellies creep
upon the duſt, whileſt your eyes and your hopes
are in Heaven: in whom there is ſuch a mixture
of fleſh and Spirit, that it's hard to diſcern, which
hath the predominance: whoſe hearts ſeem ſtill
ſo divided betwixt Chriſt and the world, that no
body that knows you can tell which hath the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part; whoſe time, and whoſe care, and whoſe
labour, run out ſo much on things below, that
without ſome great charity, it may be judg'd your
hearts are there alſo: And yet, by ſome clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
inſight into the myſteries of the Goſpel; by
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:153788:124"/>
ſome affectionate intercourſes with God in your
ſecret receſſes and retirements from the world,
by your ſerious heats and inlargements in your
duties with others, by ſome taſtes and reliſhes of
the pleaſure of ordinances, by ſome raptures of
joy, and the ſeeming ſerenity and uncloudineſs of
your ſpirits, by not conſidering what abatement
the carnality and earthlineſs of your courſe muſt
neceſſarily make upon you, are grown to an hope
and opinion that you are the highly favoured of
the Lord, and his greatly beloved.</p>
            <p>But do you not bluſh then at your unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
are you not aſhamed that ſuch love, and
ſuch hopes, ſhould no more wean your hearts
from theſe breaſts of vanity, from which you ſuck
nothing but filth or froth? that you ſhould defile
ſuch an heavenly treaſure, by lodging it in ſuch
earthen veſſels; that you ſhould ſo diſgrace that
divine portion which you count is yours, as that
it ſhould not be enough for you, but leave you as
hungry as if you had no God, nor hope in him?
that you ſhould ſo diſgrace your Fathers table, by
your unnatural appetite after coals and dirt? Is
your profeſſion that God is your happineſs, your
treaſure, your all, Is your <hi>none but Chriſt,</hi> come
to more then this? Hath your covenanting with
God, for renouncing the world, mortifying your
fleſh, denying your ſelf, brought forth no better
fruits then theſe? Oh the impudence and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
of our hearts, that can carry the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of ſuch treachery before the Throne of
Grace, without ſhame and conſternation; how
can you lift up your face before the Lord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hanging down the head?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:153788:124"/>
Nay, do you not fear that [your] hearts alſo
have deceived you, and that matters may not be
ſo well with you as you ſometimes conclude?
that your hopes are but deluſory, that your joys
are but dreams, and all your comforts are but the
lying divinations and propheſies of your own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
heart? Is it out of queſtion with you, that
you are riſen with Chriſt, and aſcended with
Chriſt when theſe hearts are gotten no further
up out of their graves?</p>
            <p>Believe it Chriſtians, <hi>the ſeverities</hi> of Religion,
will be a ſurer teſtimony to you, then all its <hi>ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities:</hi>
an humble, patient, contented, ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
mortified Chriſtian, under all his doubts and
fears, under all his complaints of darkneſs and
deadneſs, is fairer for heaven then you all.</p>
            <p>Thoſe are the joys of faith, which ſpring up
out of the ruines of carnal joys; thoſe are the
genuine comforts, and delights of the Saints,
that ariſe up out of the aſhes of earthly delights;
thoſe are the confidences of true believers, which
grow out of their contempt of the world; then
will the world think better of our Religion, and
then may we hope better of our ſelves, when
the joy of the Lord is our ſtrength, and the joys
of the earth are ſtrangers to us, and deſpiſed by

            <p>Oh Brethren, let us no longer diſhonour our

who is there almoſt that ſets not his heart
upon them? who is there that labours to be holy
as to be rich, to thrive in grace as in purſe? though
the Lord hath taken off our Chariot Wheels, yet
ſtill we drive on; though he hath been whipping
us upward, yet behold ſtill we are all below;
though he hath burnt up our houſes, and fir'd us
out of our Neſts, yet behold our hearts are ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:153788:125"/>
among the rubbiſh; though he hath mingled worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
with our milk, and gall with our honey,
yet we ſay 'tis ſweet, and will not be weaned;
though he hath teſtified againſt our pride, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
againſt our covetouſneſs, and made ſuch
ſtains upon our beauty, and ſuch holes in the
bottoms of our bags; though we ſee plainly and
ſay, <hi>God is angry with us,</hi> and angry for the <hi>iniquity
of our covetouſneſs,</hi> yet who are they that have given
off, and are gone back from their ſo eager purſuit
of the world? Oh what's like to become of us?
we are ſo ſet upon this Idol, that it's much to be
feared deſolation is determined upon us.</p>
            <p>Do we not ordinarily hear and make ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints?
but if we ſhould with our complaints,
<hi>let fall a teare</hi> upon the guilty, may they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
upon us, <hi>weep not for us but for your ſelves,</hi> for
your own covetouſneſs, for your own carnality:
and what ſhould we ſay for our ſelves, if they do
ſo? Oh the Lord help me I am one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
I even I alſo am guilty; this Idol hath a
tabernacle in this heart alſo, though I conſidered
it not.</p>
            <p>But muſt our complaints ſuffice us? is it enough
to make all well, to confeſs 'tis ſo bad? muſt this
be all our heavenlineſs, to bewail our earthlineſs?
will God take our <hi>acknowledgments</hi> for <hi>amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi>
is this your redemption, to bewail your
captivity? But when ſhall it be better? when
ſhall it be ſaid to theſe priſoners, <hi>Go forth?</hi> when
for the other world? when for God alone, for <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
but the everlaſting kingdom? Ariſe O cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
put off thy priſon garments, get thee up
out of this houſe of bondage; unclog unfetter thy
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:153788:126"/>
Soul; get thy foot out of the ſnare, and away for the
holy land: leave this earth to its heirs, let the
men of this world take to their portion, and
be the only ſervants to it, but go thou and ſerve
the Lord: let God and the world take their own;
whileſt worldlings will not be the ſervants of
Chriſt, let it no longer be ſaid, that Chriſtians are
the ſervants of the world.</p>
            <p>Brethren, conclude upon it, that you have no
more of chriſtianity then you have of ſpirituality:
that this ſpot of earthlineſs will unavoidably be,
a blot upon your evidences for Heaven. <hi>Have
you aſſurance that you are the Lords?</hi> how can that be
when you are ſo much the worlds?</p>
            <p>What ever arguments you have, that ſeem to
conclude well for you, yet how many objections
are there alſo? Oh how many <hi>Buts</hi> are there againſt
us. Such a one is a judicious underſtanding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
<hi>But,</hi> hee's greedy upon the world: ſuch a
one is of a ſavoury gracious behaviour, <hi>But,</hi> hee's
unmerciful to the poor: ſuch a one is much in
prayer, and will pray ſingularly well, <hi>But</hi> there's
no truſt to his word: ſuch a one is of a free and
liberal Spirit, <hi>But</hi> he is proud. Shoot down theſe
<hi>Butts</hi> if ever you would ſtand eſtabliſhed in your
confidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Have you not aſſurance?</hi> Is this yet to be gotten?
Oh how can you ſo eagerly mind any other get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?
can you have ſuch leiſure for Earth when
Heaven ſtill hangs in doubt? or do ye think that
the ſame way does lead to both? that the ſame la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
will ſerve for both? will the ſame wind, and
the ſame courſe carry you towards both the Poles?
can you at once be ſayling Northward and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:153788:126"/>
can you aſcend and deſcend by the ſame
motion? when you are progging for your fleſh,
building your houſes, enlarging your border,
laying you up treaſure on earth, and making it as
ſure as you can; Is this your laying up treaſure
in Heaven? your giving diligence to make God
ſure, your calling and election ſure? once be
bound in good earneſt for glory, and take the
ſtrait courſe thitherward, and then farewel World,
<hi>thy kingdom is finiſhed, thy dominion is at an end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Brethren receive this word of conviction and
ſubmit to it; the ſumme whereof is, <hi>that where
there is ſo much of the Spirit of this World, there is but
little faith, and where there is but little faith, 'tis more
then you can tell whether there be any at all.</hi> God is a
convincing of us; if his word does not, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
ſhall convince us, and lay us yet lower
in our own eyes: what means his <hi>undoing and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
providences,</hi> but <hi>to try us</hi> what ſpirit we are of
and <hi>to teach us</hi> with his briars and thorns, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
our ſelves better, and to recover? why is
his face ſo againſt us? why is his hand ſo heavy
upon us? what do the aſhes of our waſted trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
ſpeak to us? If it do, not ſpeak out this to
us, <hi>Thou haſt a name that thou liveſt and art dead,</hi> yet
does it ſpeak leſs then this, <hi>Thou haſt but a little
ſtrength; thou haſt but a few names, that have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
their garments, ſtrengthen the things that remain
that are ready to dye?</hi> Is not this its word, <hi>ſeekeſt
thou yet great things for thy ſelf?</hi> when I am break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down what I have built, when I am plucking
up what I have planted, is this a time to ſeek
great things for thy ſelf? yea or to think great
things of thy ſelf? ſeek them not, no nor think
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:153788:127"/>
any more ſuch great thoughts: lay thee down in the
duſt, be aſhamed and confounded for what thou
art and haſt done, and climb no more up thoſe
trees that are hewing down under thee.</p>
            <p>Brethren when do ye think the Lord will cauſe
his fury towards us to ceaſe? when will the flames
be quenched, when will his repentings be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?
what hope is there that our conflagrations
ſhould be at an end, till our Idols be burnt up? 'tis
vain to think, that our prayers and faſtings and
weeping before the Lord will put out the fire of
his jealouſie. <hi>Get thee up, wherefore lyeſt thou thus upon
thy face? Iſrael hath ſinned—they have taken of the
accurſed thing—I will not be with you any more, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ye deſtroy the accurſed from among you.</hi> Joſh. 7.
10, 11, 12. The Lord hath <hi>broken us with a great
breach,</hi> the Lord hath <hi>ſmitten us with a very grievous
blow;</hi> and now we fall to faſting and praying and
proſtrating our ſelves before him in hope that this
may make up our breach and be the healing of our
wound. But will this do? <hi>Get you up, get you up,</hi>
why lye you thus upon your faces? Is there not an
accurſed thing among you? think not that the
Lord will be with you, till that be deſtroyed from
among you: hope not for any thing from thoſe
prayers or faſtings, that do no execution upon
your accurſed things. Do your prayers leave your
pride alive, your covetouſneſs alive, your wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs
alive? your ſelves are like to dye notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all ſuch prayers.</p>
            <p>God is either upon <hi>refining</hi> or <hi>rejecting:</hi> he hath
caſt us into his furnace, kindled his fires, been
blowing with his bellows; if our droſs may yet
be conſumed. If that be not done, the next word
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:153788:127"/>
we may hear, may be that of the Prophet, <hi>Jer. 6.
29, 30. The bellows are burnt, the lead is conſumed by
the fire, the founder melteth in vain, for</hi> [this droſs]
<hi>is not taken away, reprobate ſilver ſhall men call them,
for the Lord hath rejected them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Of <hi>Direction and Exhortation:</hi> Brethren,
have I not yet ſaid enough to fetch you off from
your ſervitude? will you go free, or have I ſpent
my labour in vain? muſt I leave you at the Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiln,
or will you go over to <hi>Canaan? what are
your thoughts?</hi> Is it good to continue in your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
ſtate? is the vaſſalage of unbelief better then
the victory of faith? <hi>what are your reſolutions?</hi> have
you ſold your ſelves for ſervants, and will you
ſtand to the bargain? may you go free and will
you not? have you not underſtood enough of the
worlds enmity? have you not felt enough of the
worlds tyranny? have you not ſin'd enough, and
ſuffer'd enough already by it? what ſay you, are you
for liberty or bondage? for captivity or victory?
why what may we do to obtain the victory? why
will you hearken then? are you willing of help?
will you take Gods counſel when 'tis offered you?
well in hope that ſome of you will hearken, I ſhall
yet farther adventure theſe few directions.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place I ſhall mind you of what hath
been already ſpoken, touching the wayes by which
faith overcometh the world, and ſhall turn them
into theſe 6. counſels.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Get a right judgment of both worlds:</hi> ſtudy and
get an underſtanding of Earth and Heaven; and
give not off this ſtudy, till you be throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd,
of the unſpeakable tranſcendencies of
things to come, above things preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:153788:128"/>
2. <hi>Chooſe your lot in the beſt of the two:</hi> determine
for Heaven, that infinitely better inheritance. Be
unalterably at this point, <hi>I am for the everlaſting
bleſſedneſs,</hi> however it be with me here.</p>
            <p>3. Be convinc'd, that the good things of this World
cannot further, nor can the evil things of this world hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your eternal bleſſedneſs, <hi>and eſteem of all things
temporal, according to the reſpect they bear to
the things that are eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Be convinc'd that the Deſign of all the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this World is, to deprive you of your eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</p>
            <p>5. By living more purely a life of faith, get clear
apprehenſions and a deeper ſenſe of the bleſſedneſs to
come.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Give diligence to make your calling and election
ſure:</hi> by turning your eyes back upon what hath
been already ſaid, you may make fuller improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of theſe directions, upon which I forbear
any farther enlargement.</p>
            <p>To theſe I ſhall add this one general direction.</p>
            <p>Make your advantage of all thoſe means, by which
your faith may gather ſtrength, and in which it's ſtrength
is to be put forth and exerciſed.</p>
            <p>Particularly</p>
            <p>1. Improve all your duties this way: <hi>Let all your
ſeekings of God be a wreſtling with the World.
Put this great affair into every</hi> prayer: <hi>put it into
your dayly</hi> confeſſions, <hi>put it into your daily</hi> peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<hi>Carry the ſenſe of your ſore bondage into
the preſence of God: let the miſery and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
it hath ſubjected you to, be written upon your
hearts, and go and ſpread the writing before the
Lord. Let the throne of grace be a Judgment
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:153788:128"/>
ſeat where this traitor may be daily arraigned and
condemned.</hi> Take unto you words, <hi>confeſs unto
God.</hi> Lord I have dealt very falſely with thee, and
fooliſhly for my ſelf. I have forſaken the Fountain of
living waters for broken Ciſterns, wherein is no water.
I have taken the World into my boſom, and thrown the
Lord at my heels. I have ſet the World on the Throne
and trodden Chriſt under my feet; I have ſerved mine
enemy, and ſlighted the Rock of my Salvation. I have
ſold my ſoul for ſilver, and my hopes for handfulls of
barley. I have followed vanity, and neglected alſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.
I have been a true drudg to this muck, a good
husband for this fleſh; but what have I been to the Lord?
what an evil and ſlothful ſervant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If I ſhould ſay I were
not a worldling, or a ſenſualiſt, mine own ſoul would call
me lyar to my face; but though I ſee what a fool, and
what a beaſt, and what a ſlave I am, this ſottiſh heart
will not yet be wiſe, it hath loved theſe Idols and will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them ſtill. Confeſs thus unto God, <hi>and if one
dayes confeſſion will not ſhame you out of your
folly, to it again; the next day, and the next day,
and every day as long as you live: Bring in new
Indictments fill'd up with all the</hi> aggravations <hi>you
can gather up,</hi> I have been often told of the evil of a
worldly heart and life, of the danger of it, of the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs
of it; I have been counſelled to take heed of it,
and I have known it has been good counſel; I have been
oblig'd againſt it, by commands, by kindneſſes, by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
by intereſt, by experiences of the gall and the
Wormwood it hath ſtill prov'd in my belly, whatever it
hath been in my mouth. My judgment and Conſcience
hath been againſt it; I have been offered a better ſervice,
and a better reward; and I have underſtood it was a
good offer, and worth the accepting; I have been char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:153788:129"/>
upon pain of death, and everlaſting damnation to
take heed and beware of it, and yet ſtill I am where I
was. Counſels have been deſpiſed, commands have been
broken, kindneſſes have been ſlighted, covenants have
been violated, reaſon and conſcience have been baffled,
yea, death and hell have been deſpiſed for the ſake of this
luſt, and love of the world, ſo fooliſh am I and ignorant,
and as a beaſt before thee. <hi>Thus quicken and ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
your confeſſions with all the aggravations ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
till, if it be poſſible, thy folly may depart
from thee, not being able to bear ſuch an hot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.
Deal thus roughly and thus cloſly with
your earthly hearts when ever you have them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord, that they may not dare to meet you
ſo there again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Put it into your daily</hi> Petitions. <hi>Speak unto the
Lord, let not thy ſoul keep ſilence till he hear. Let
thine oppreſſed heart lift up its voice to the moſt
high; tell him,</hi> Oh I have ſurfeited of this fleſh, I am
ſick of this World, theſe briars and thorns, yea, and theſe
Lillies and Roſes are a grief of mind to me, I muſt have
them out ere I can be at reſt. Make theſe thorns to
ſcratch me, theſe flowers to ſtink in my noſtrils. <hi>Beg a
new heart, beg a better ſpirit, that may neither
find pleaſure, nor ſo much as eaſe in ſuch things as
theſe.</hi> Oh for mortification! oh for a more raiſed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit!
where is the life of faith? where is the power of the
Spirit? help Lord, help Lord, a renewed heart, a chaſte
ſpirit, when ſhall it once be? let not my ſoul be held any
longer an adultereſs from thee; let not theſe husks be
my meat, theſe aſhes be my bread, this earth be my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
while God ſtands by. Let not Chriſt and my ſoul
be kept ſtrangers, whileſt I am the familiar of this fleſh,
and the ſervant of vanity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:153788:129"/>
Plead <hi>with the Lord for relief. Plead with him
upon his own</hi> intereſt. Who is it O Lord thats muſt
wronged? whoſe right is it thats moſt invaded? whoſe
am I? Am I not thine Lord? Is not my love, and my
labour, and my ſtrength, and my time, and my body, and
my ſoul, is it not all thy right? ſhall thine enemy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and carry away that which is thine? recover, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
thy due. Take this heart and all that I have,
take poſſeſſion Lord, ſet thy name upon my door, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
not theſe ſtrangers to enter or encroach upon thy right.
<hi>Plead with him upon the</hi> bloud of his Covenant.
Whence is the Covenanted Redemption! is it only from
Hell? is it not from luſt alſo? can it be from one, if it
be not from both? a total redemption Lord, an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
redemption; from every Plague, from every enemy.
I cannot eſcape the pit, if I be held in the ſnare; if I
break not this outer; I ſhall fall alſo into the inner Priſon;
by the bloud of the Covenant ſend forth thy Priſoner out
of this Priſon. What doth this bloud ſpeak! Doth it
only ſay Deliver them from the pit, for thou haſt found a
ranſome? Doth it not alſo ſay, Whileſt thou keepeſt them
in the World, keep them from the evil? and will not
God hear the cry of ſuch bloud?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cry unto the Lord.</hi> Be inſtant, be importunate
with him. <hi>Try the ſtrength of Prayer.</hi> Be unceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
reſolve againſt denyals. Cry unto him day
and night, <hi>avenge me of mine adverſary.</hi> Rid my ſoul
out of thraldom; whileſt thou liveſt give not over,
if thou wilt not, thou ſhalt not be denyed.</p>
            <p>Haſ thou gotten a little ground, take the ſame way
to maintain what thou haſt gotten. Does the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
World rally upon thee, and do thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
begin to ſtoop to it? <hi>Pray them up again.</hi> Doth
thine heart begin again to wander after it, <hi>Pray it

to get head again and to prevail? <hi>Pray them

<hi>The Lord rebuke thee falſe heart; The Lord rebuke thee

            </p>
            <p>Beloved, your Victory over the World can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be gotten, nor maintained, but by <hi>power from
above.</hi> Tis God only thats able to give battel to
the fleſh. In vain do you engage, unleſs he engage
with you. Prayer will ſet faith on work, and
faith will engage the promiſe, and the promiſe
will engage Chriſt with you, and Chriſt will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the Father to your help. If Heaven be too
hard for earth, the World ſhall fall before a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſoul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren will you take this counſel? put it thus
into every Prayer you make, and if you find this
to be your</hi> Great enemy, <hi>Bend the</hi> main force <hi>of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Prayer againſt it,</hi> Fight neither againſt ſmall nor
great, in compariſon, but againſt this King of Evils.
This is the great Thief, Lord, that meets me at every
turn, and is robbing me every day; that robs the Lord
of his due, and my Soul of its peace: this is the <hi>Moth,</hi>
that eats out all my Strength; this is the Murtherer,
that kills my Soul; O let this Strong be bowed down;
this is the Heir, kill him, and the Inheritance ſhall be
mine.</p>
            <p>And when ever you have made your prayer,
judge of the acceptance of it, by the ſucceſs it hath
on this Adverſary: When at any time you have
found your ſouls moſt melted and inlarged in
prayer, and greatlieſt refreſhed by ſenſible illap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and incoms from above; at ſuch a time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
return into your heart, and demand; <hi>But
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:153788:131"/>
how goes it now with the intereſt of the World in me?</hi>
How ſtands my heart now affected to my carnal
things? am I weaned? Is my clog fallen off?
What hath my fleſh loſt, by what my ſpirit ſeems
to have gained? What hath my earthly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
my covetouſneſs loſt in this prayer? Can I
now go away and be contented, and be patient in
any condition? hath this Divine warmth left a
chill upon my fleſhly appetite? can I the better
want the <hi>Quails,</hi> now I have taſted of the <hi>Manna?</hi>
am I leſs careful, and leſs concerned, which way
the World goes with me? or can I go down pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
into my ſhop, or forth into my fields, and
be as hungry and as much ſwallowed up of my
earthly cares and delights, as if I had never taſted
any thing of God? Can I ſo? Oh this is not the
Prayer I took it to be; I may not ſit down by
this, I muſt to my knees again, to my God again,
and again; while I live I will not give over thus;
I will wreſtle, I will wait, I will enquire; to
day, to morrow, next day, after every prayer,
Is it yet better? yet more mortified? yet more
weaned? Yet more humble and contented? I can
never, I will never ſatisfie my ſelf with any pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with any anſwer, whilſt my fleſh thus holds
up its head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is the firſt Direction, the ſtreſs whereof
I lay upon theſe two things;</hi> Bend the main force
if every Prayer againſt this evil; level your Arrow

is our <hi>entring into his Reſt;</hi> our receſs from the

            <p>The end of the Sabbath is <hi>the preſervation and

memory the Redemption of Chriſt, for the more

Spirit of Chriſt, for the more ſolemn Celebration
of his Worſhip, and ſo conſequently for the
maintaining the power of Holineſs; all which the
World would deſtroy and bury with him in his

The Adverſaries of Religion have attempted
its deſtruction, by heaving at theſe <hi>Pillars</hi> npon
which it is ſupported; and the oppoſition which
hath been made againſt them, hath been carried
on (ſome part of it at leaſt) much after the ſame
way. The <hi>Authority of the Scriptures</hi> hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unded,
by pretences to other rules beſides, to be
added to them; as <hi>unwritten Traditions, or enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Revelations. Ordinances</hi> have been aſſaulted
by the addition of humane Inventions, to Divine
Inſtitutions. The deſtruction of the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> hath
been by ſome of its Adverſaries attempted, by
making all Teachers; and <hi>Sabbaths</hi> have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined
by others, by pleading for an <hi>every day
Sabbath;</hi> Firſt encloſing the ſix daies to the Lord,
and thereby at length laying the Sabbath in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to the World.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe four pillars is Religion upheld; let
theſe be removed, and what becomes of it! and
the deſtruction of this one (this fixed time) how
greatly will it endanger all the reſt. An <hi>every-day
Sabbath</hi> will ſoon bring us to <hi>no Sabbath;</hi> and from
<hi>no Sabbath,</hi> we ſhall quickly come to <hi>no Ordinances,
no Miniſtery;</hi> and from <hi>no Miniſtery,</hi> how long will
it be ere we arrive at <hi>No Scriptures, no Religion, no
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whatever the adverſaries of Religion, and
their waies to ſupplant it be, that which makes
them adverſaries, and engages them in this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
deſign, are the luſts of this World. Religion
levels at the fleſh, its affections and intereſt; and
theſe ſet themſelves to make their batteries upon
Religion, and all its ſupports and foundations.</p>

            <p>But the more immediate influence, the due ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification

            <p>1. <hi>A day of ſeparation for God.</hi> The people of
God, as ſuch, are a <hi>ſeparated people,</hi> ſeparated from
the luſts of men, <hi>to the Law of their God,</hi> Neh. 10.
28. Ezra 6. 21. In their firſt day, their day of
Grace, they ſeparate themſelves <hi>from the evils of the
World;</hi> in this day they are to ſeparate themſelves
from <hi>the affairs, yea and the thoughts of the World,</hi> Iſa.
58. 13. This day is an <hi>Hallowed day,</hi> ſanctified by
God, and to be ſanctified by his Saints. Gods ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
it, is his ſetting apart the day for an holy
uſe; our ſanctifying it is our ſetting our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
thereon for his holy ſervice. This day is <hi>a
priviledged day,</hi> nothing thats common or unclean
may encroach upon it.</p>
            <p>The day of the Lord, is as the houſe of the
Lord, <hi>a kind of meeting betwixt heaven and earth;</hi>
wherein God calls us up to the Mount, and comes
down to give us a meeting. And as when he
came down on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> he required that his
people (who yet were to come no nearer him than
the foot of the Mount) ſhould, by waſhing their
clothes, and <hi>ſeparating</hi> themſelves from their
Wives, make ready againſt his comming down,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 11, 15. So doth he here give us as ſtrict
a charge, [Remember] be ye alſo ready. Be ye
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:153788:133"/>
waſh'd, and be ye ſeparate. Waſh your hearts,
empty your hands, come in from your fields, come
out of your ſhops, lay by your work, leave this
earth below, come up to meer your God.</p>
            <p>There are two things that give to objects their
greateſt efficacy and advantage upon us. <hi>Their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to us,</hi> and the <hi>remoteneſs of their contraries.</hi> The
World on this day loſes both theſe advantages,
wherein we are called to ſtand aloof from it, and
to draw nigh to God.</p>
            <p>We are then faireſt for victory over the World,
when we are fartheſt off it: 'tis ill fighting a
Cock on his own Dung-hill: while the world is
at our elbow there's little like to be done againſt
it; whilſt it is in our eye, or our hand, 'tis not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
to keep it out of our heart: when the Lord hath
gotten our company alone, and the World hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
not an Oxe, nor an Aſs, not a buſineſs,
nor a pleaſure to ſollicit our love, or labour;
When we are gotten out of ſight, and out of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the wooings of this Harlot, and its cries
after us, then is it moſt like to loſe its hold of
us.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why we ordinarily make no more
advantage of Sabbaths this way is, becauſe how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we pretend <hi>to draw nigh unto God,</hi> yet we do
not <hi>with-draw from the World:</hi> we come into the
Sanctuary as <hi>Iſrael</hi> went out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> we carry,
not our Wives, and our little ones only, but our
Flocks and our Herds, and all our Subſtance; we
carry all we have with us, when we come before
the Lord. The lowing of the Oxen, the bleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Sheep, the ſound of the Mill-ſtones is
ſo ſtill in our ears; the Butter and the Hony,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:153788:134"/>
the wine and the oyle, the ſilver and the gold are
ſo continually in our eye, that we cannot hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
what the Lord God doth ſpeak, nor ſee his
face.</p>
            <p>Brethren, who is there with you at this houre?
here you are before the Lord, but who is there
with you? ſearch every room, look into every
corner; Is there none within, that ſhould not be
there? is there no meſſenger of Satan, hath the
World no agitatour now at work within you? O
behold, whileſt the Lord is a treating with our
cares, what <hi>a mixed multitude</hi> are there within;
cares, and thoughts, and luſts, and projects for this
world; and what a ſtirr do they all make that God
may not be regarded? The Devil will be moſt
moſt buſy in ſuch a time; he doubts how matters
might go with him if he now keep ſilence. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
many a Soul more might have been gain'd
over to Chriſt, had not Satan ſtood by and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and had thoſe ever near us, who forbad the
match: uſe to be alone with God; out of the
company, and out of the noiſe of theſe harlots,
and then theres hope the Lord may gain your
love.</p>
            <p>What wonder that that ſeed dies and becomes
unfruitful, that falls into a brake of thorns? or
amongſt ſuch birds as ſtand watching to catch it all
away? what hope that the counſel of the Lord be
accepted, of a mind prepoſſeſſed, and actually
ſt<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ff'd with the cares of this life? <hi>Intus exiſtens
prohibet alienum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How canſt thou aſcend, with thy burthen upon
thy back? unload unload; <hi>lay aſide every weight,</hi>
and then go up and proſper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:153788:134"/>
Say to all thou haſt, <hi>ſtay you here, whileſt I go and
pray before the Lord;</hi> let the <hi>night</hi> before each Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
be as the <hi>grave</hi> betwixt the two worlds; there
let thy duſt be buried, and thy Spirit fly naked to
thy God. Let that night which is the partition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
thine own dayes, and the Lords, be thy
Souls taking its leave of all thou haſt; any [ſinful]
thoughts works or pleaſures, <hi>thy luſts and thy evil
wayes,</hi> give them an eternal burial. <hi>Be gone, ſee my
face no more for ever:</hi> and for matters [lawful and
honeſt] that concern this earth, charge them not
to thruſt in before the Lord: <hi>go you alſo your way
for this time, and when I have a convenient ſeaſon I will
ſend for you:</hi> and if from Sabbath to Sabbath thy
feet ſtand thus on the mountain of the Lord, thou
mayſt find them all the week long, on the tops of
the mountains of the earth.</p>
            <p>Brethren, where is our Sabbath ſeparation? Is
there not a fault among us upon this account? let
him that heareth enquire, <hi>How it is with me?</hi> Am
not I faulty? what are my Sabbath thoughts? what
are my Sabbath diſcourſes? If I be better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the houſe of God, what do I in mine
own houſe? what are my morning and evening,
and midday thoughts? what is my table talk, my
chimney talk. If buſineſs, if bargains, or journeys
be not admitted, are not viſits or complements,
or vain ſtories or impertinent news ſuffered to
fill up the time? is it thus or not with thee? Is it
well that it is thus? O clear your Sabbaths of ſuch
worldly encroachments, or you'l never clear your
hearts: drive all the world into <hi>Pathmos,</hi> into
baniſhment, and be wholly <hi>in the ſpirit, on the
Lords day.</hi> Be abſtracted from earthly things and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:153788:135"/>
earthly thoughts bring them with you neither to
the houſe, nor to the day of the Lord; let your
own houſes, and your own tables, be as the houſe
and table of the Lord; have nothing to do from
morning to evening but to wait on God.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>It is a day for ſpecial Communion with God.</hi> Tbe
meeting of God with his people on that day, is
like unto that meeting which is promiſed to <hi>Moſes
Exod.</hi> 25. 22. before the mercy ſeat: <hi>There will
I meet thee, and commune with thee:</hi> there will I ſhew
thee all my mind, and hear all thy requeſts.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>a day of bleſſing:</hi> thither the tribes go up,
to bleſs the Lord, and there he comes down to bleſs
his people. It's ſaid <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. that
<hi>God bleſſed the Sabbath day:</hi> Gods bleſſing the day,
makes it <hi>a day of bleſſing,</hi> a good day to his Saints,
he then comes unto them, <hi>in the fulneſs of the bleſſing
of the goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe that queſtion whether the firſt day of the
week be the Chriſtian Sabbath, let them conſider
which of all the dayes of the week the Lord hath,
ſince the death of Chriſt, ſo exalted above the reſt
of the dayes, that they can with moſt confidence
ſay, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath bleſſed?</hi> on
what day were the gates of death broken, the Lord
Jeſus declared to be the ſon of God with power,
by his reſurrection from the dead? on which day
was the ſpirit of God moſt ſignally ſhed abroad
on the Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians, in <hi>thoſe
extraordinary gifts,</hi> whereby they were made more
capable of publiſhing the bleſſed Goſpel to the
ends of the earth, and in <hi>that ſpecial grace</hi> which
ſeized three thouſand Souls in one day? <hi>Act.</hi> 2.
What day is it that hath been honoured to be <hi>the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:153788:135"/>
birth day</hi> of the greateſt number of Saints ever
ſince? that hath been their <hi>feaſt day,</hi> wherein their
Souls have been moſt ſenſibly nouriſh'd, and they
have been increas'd with the increaſings of God?
what meals have they had to their <hi>Lords-day meals?</hi>
what joyes, <hi>to their Lords-day joyes</hi> Surely if this
may determine the queſtion, which day is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
of the Lord, the day that of all others, <hi>God
hath bleſſed</hi> and made a good day, the experiences
of Chriſtians in all ages would bring in their vote
for the firſt day. <hi>This is the day that God hath made
we will rejoyce and be glad in it:</hi> this by the way.</p>
            <p>This day as is ſaid before, is <hi>the reſt of God:</hi> a
little Heaven let down to us on earth: God calls
us up hither, as he called <hi>Moſes</hi> up to <hi>Piſgah,</hi> to
give us a view of the promiſed land. The Sabbath
is Heaven opened; we may give a gueſs at the
glory to come, by thoſe glimſes, and taſtes, we
have of it now.</p>
            <p>It is the day of <hi>interview,</hi> betwixt the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
and the bride; wherein he beholds our
faces, and ſhewes us his loves; wherein he comes
down into his garden to eat his pleaſant fruits, and
we behold his goings, the goings of God in his
Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs of this day is to look into the Ark
of the Covenant, to review and renew the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
tranſactions betwixt God and our Souls; to
ſearch out, contemplate and admire the mercies
and lovingkindneſs of the Lord; to receive the
overflowing of his goodneſs and to pour forth our
Souls as an offering to him, in our prayers and
praiſes: to give and receive mutual tokens and
pledges of Love and faithfulneſs; to ſeal to our
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:153788:136"/>
fidelity to him, and to receive farther aſſurances of
his grace and good will to our Souls; to obtain
help from God againſt our enemies, whereby we
may execute upon them the vengeance written;
and upon this mountain ordinarily is the victory
obteined, <hi>there breaks he the arrowes of the bow, the
ſword, the ſhield, and the battel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtians, have you ever experimented this
<hi>Sabbath Communion?</hi> hath the Lord God appear'd
thus unto you? have there been ſuch friendly and
familiar intercourſes betwixt him and your Souls?
Oh how contemptibly hath the world look'd in
that day?</p>
            <p>But oh what dark and cloudy dayes are our Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths
ordinarily to us; <hi>Sundayes, per antiphraſin,</hi>
the Sun not once appearing it may be, for many
dayes together; no wonder our Souls are ſo
earth'd all the week, when they are ſo ſeldom in
Heaven, on the day of the Lord: what dry feaſts
are our Sabbath feaſts? rather faſts then feaſts: real
Communion with God is a ſtrange thing to us, even
in the day of God: Heaven is opened but our eyes
are ſhut; God comes down to meet us, and to
bleſs us, but our hearts are not there: the breaſts
of conſolation are full, but we have no skill, or no
liſt to draw at the breaſts: we come to the well,
but we do not let down the bucket; we ſtand by
the pool, where the Angel comes down, but our
creeple Souls put not in to the waters: we ſtand
without, in the <hi>outer court</hi> of the Lords houſe; our
Sabbaths are to us but figures of Sabbaths; the
ordinances of them are to us, as wells without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
lamps withoul Oyle, meer ſhadows of good
things: we go up from week to week, to meet
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:153788:136"/>
one with another, but how ſeldom do we ſee God
in the company? and hereupon Sabbaths come and
goe, and leave us ſtill as we were: the Devil may
well enough truſt us with ſuch Sabbaths, the world
may give us leave to go thus before the Lord, and
be no looſer by it.</p>
            <p>Brethren, get you into the <hi>inner court,</hi> which on
theſe dayes eſpecially was to be ſet open, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46.
1. there is an entry through the houſe of the Lord,
that leads in to the heart of the moſt high; get
you into that <hi>ſanctum ſanctorum</hi> and there let be
your reſt: as often as the morning of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
day looks forth upon you, get your veſſels
ready, and go you forth to meet the bridegroom:
open your eyes with theſe thoughts, <hi>this is the day
which the Lord hath made I will rejoyce and be glad in
it:</hi> climb up betimes, and let every duty be a ſtair
by which you aſcend to your Lord: let divine
contemplation, let prayers and praiſes, &amp;c. be
the whole work; let the bleſſings of Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
be the whole expectation of that day:
and when you find your hearts refreſhed with his
preſence, and filled with the company of your
God, and he ſends you away laden with the tokens
of his love, and with the impreſs of his face upon
your hearts, and the reliſh of his goodneſs freſh
upon your palats; when you thus go hot out of the
preſence of the Lord, then you will learn to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
that <hi>day of ſmall things,</hi> with which the World
entertains you: <hi>Shall I forſake my ſweetneſs,</hi> ſaith
the figtree, <hi>ſhall I forſake my fatneſs</hi> ſaith the
Olive, <hi>and become King over the trees?</hi> let the bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
take that honour; farewell dignities and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
farewell pomps and pleaſures, farewell
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:153788:137"/>
houſes and lands, I have enough, I have ſeen the
face of God.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>It is a day of ſpecial proviſion for Souls;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lord brings forth out of his treaſury, his
ſpiritual proviſions, to keep the Soul in heart.
Hunger-ſtarv'd ſouldiers are but poor fighters;
they are the weak ſouls whom the World hath van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed.</p>
            <p>Sabbaths are the Souls <hi>Market dayes.</hi> Men
have their Markets whence to be ſupplied with
neceſſaries for their bodies; and on this day God
keeps a Market for Souls: He hath his Milk and
his Honey, his Wine and his Oyl, his Bread and
his Water of Life; and on this day in ſpecial, he
makes Proclamation, <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come
to the Waters, and he that hath no money; Come ye buy
and eat, yea buy Wine and Milk without money and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
price.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The bread which comes down from Heaven,
though it be to be had every day, (our Week-dayes
may in their meaſure, be all Sabbaths) yet
on this day it falls more plentifully. The Jews
had their corporal Manna on the ſix dayes, and
none on the Sabbath; but the hidden Manna falls
more thin, and more ſparely on our other dayes,
and on this day more abundantly. They were to
gather double on the ſixth day, that they might
have to ſupply them on the Sabbath; but for the
Spiritual Manna, all our other dayes are to be
ſupply'd from our Sabbath proviſion.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtian who is not fit to meet <hi>the Bridegroom,</hi>
is neither fit to meet <hi>his adverſary,</hi> without Oyl in
his Lamp. Tis the great commodity thats ſet to
ſale in this Market, <hi>Oyle for our veſſels.</hi> Come
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:153788:137"/>
bring your empty veſſels, here's Oyl to fill them.
The Ordinances which are this day adminiſtred,
are <hi>the pipes opened,</hi> thoſe golden pipes by which the
golden Oyl is emptied forth, and conveyed down
from the living Olive, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>Tis no wonder that men hunger after this
world, who know no better feeding. <hi>An Aſſes
head, or a kab of Doves dung</hi> are of great price, when
there is no bread, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 25. Tis for want of
bread that worldlings can make ſuch a feaſt of their
<hi>Locuſts and wild Honey.</hi> Thoſe that have eaten of
the hidden Manna, will not luſt after Quails; the
Worlds dainties will come out at their noſtrils,
whoſe bellies have been filled with this hid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
Thoſe whom God hath fed <hi>in his green Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,</hi>
thoſe whom God hath led by his <hi>ſtill waters,</hi>
they cannot live in theſe ſalt Mariſhes or ſtubble
fields. Thoſe whoſe ſouls God hath made <hi>well
watered Gardens,</hi> will not need the Pools of the
Wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>Its no wonder that the World beats us, when
we go for many daies together without making
one good meal. When our ſouls are famiſhed
into weakneſs, then are we our enemies prey;
they are the hunger ſtarved ſheep, that are a prey
to Crows and Kytes. If Sathan can but keep us
low, if he can either keep the Manna from falling
about our Camps, or keep us idle when we ſhould
be gathering, he may then lead us after his lure at
pleaſure. Tis not a little ſtrength that will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
us againſt his great temptations, and tis not a
little bread by which we are like to gather any
great ſtrength; we had need feed well if we will
be ſtrong, and we had need be ſtrong or we ſhall
never fight well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:153788:138"/>
A Soul that uſes to come before the Lord <hi>with an
appetite,</hi> that feeds hungrily, and is as the thirſty
earth that <hi>drinks up the ſhowers that come oft upon it;</hi>
whom the Lord ſatisfies with the fatneſs of his

            <p>Let not finer cloaths and better fare, let not idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and eaſe, no nor filling up a place in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
be the only difference betwixt Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths

ear hear what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches.</hi> Catch
at every word, obſerve every look of your Lord
upon you. And whatever you receive lay up, and
ponder in your hearts. Have you received a <hi>check

a <hi>word of counſel</hi> or inſtruction, lay up your inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
Hath he <hi>ſpoken peace to you,</hi> lay up that
word charily by you; whatever tranſactions have

and when you go forth, whither ever you

the World meets you again, and tempts you again,

            <p>Brethren, put hard on every Sabbath, for ſuch an
undiſturbed attendance on the Lord; ſingle out
the Lord for the object of your whole converſe;
knit your hearts thus to him, ſolace your ſelves
thus in him, get you thus elevated and raiſed in
your ſpirits from earthly to heavenly; and every
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:153788:139"/>
inch of ground you get of your adverſary, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it carefully from Sabbath to Sabbath. If this
were ſeriouſly deſign'd, and more generally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
by Chriſtians, we ſhould find both ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
face, and another power of Chriſtianity in the
earth; the children of the Kingdom would be
more viſibly differenced from the men of this
World, and both the guilt and reproach of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
and ſenſuality, be wip'd off from the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
and Profeſſion of the Goſpel.</p>

            <p>1. <hi>In our preparation.</hi> One confeſſed prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
duty is <hi>ſelf-examination,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 28. A
great ſecurity of this Idol is <hi>the ſecret of its taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle;</hi>
Its covert in which it lurks unſeen. World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
(many of them) if they knew what is within
them, their Conſcience would ſo prick, that they
could have no reſt or eaſe, till this thorn were puld
out; but they are not aware that the World is
within them. Yet this enemy lies not ſo cloſe
but upon a privy ſearch it may be diſcovered. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
trial ſhould be cloſe and thorow, no
corner within us ſhould be left unranſacked.
The reverence of this great Ordinance and the
dreadful conſequence of comming ſo ſolemnly
before the Lord with a Traitor in our boſoms (<hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and drinking judgment</hi>) will cry in our ears,
<hi>Make diligent ſearch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The evidence that this one thing <hi>[an earthly mind]</hi>
carries in it of our treachery towards God, is ſo
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:153788:139"/>
notorious, that he hath but little underſtanding in
the matters of God, that would not from this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
conclude himſelf an unworthy gueſt at the
Table of the Lord, were all things elſe never ſo
ſpecious and fair. Dar'ſt thou ſay, Surely the
Lord will accept me, for he hath but this one thing
againſt me, <hi>That I love the World more than I love
God.</hi> I can own his name and waies, I join with
the Aſſemblies of his people; I can pray, and
hear, and faſt; I am neither proud nor froward,
nor envious, nor malicious, there is no evil but
<hi>this covetouſneſs,</hi> but I hope I can acquit my ſelf of?
Dar'ſt thou ſay thus? I am no drunkard, I am no
Adulterer, I am no ſwearer, <hi>I am nothing but an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolater?</hi>
the Lord I hope will excuſe me in this
thing? Doſt think he will indeed? And may it
not be like enough, that upon this diligent ſearch
thou mayſt find this to be thy caſe?</p>
            <p>Friends, get the ſenſe of theſe terrible truths
upon your hearts, <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
is guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord; He
that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
damnation to himſelf; He that is an Idolater, eateth
and drinketh unworthily, He that is covetous is an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later;</hi>
Let theſe things ſink into your hearts, and
then ſee if you dare come without a narrow ſearch;
make a narrow ſearch and then you will ſee how
great your unworthineſs and danger is. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were there a due care taken of this duty, it were
not poſſible that men could go on from Sacrament
to Sacrament under the power of their earthly
hearts, this would ſurely ſtartle them. This Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
would either make them afraid of their
worldlineſs, or this worldlineſs would make them
afraid of Sacraments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:153788:140"/>
Worldly Profeſſors, what care is there ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
taken of this duty? do you examine? do
you make diligent ſearch? do you make <hi>particular</hi>
ſearch for this evil? It may be you enquire, <hi>Am I
in the faith? am I in charity? do I bear no malice?
hath no man a quarrel againſt me?</hi> nay poſſibly you
may go a little farther, and ask, <hi>Am I unjuſt? am I
an oppreſſor, an extortioner? have I done wrong to no
man?</hi> and if you can acquit your ſelf here, then an
end. But do you further ask, Do I not love the
world? Is not mine heart too much upon it? Am
I not too buſie for the world? is not my time
ſpent too much upon it? are not duties neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
is not my ſoul, or my families ſouls neglected
for its ſake? am I not ſo bent upon growing rich
in the world, that I mind not how poverty grows
upon my ſoul? do I honor the Lord with my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?
am I merciful? am I bountiful? do I
ſeek no more nor no otherwiſe then God would
have me ſeek? do I aim at God? do I entitle
God to all I have? do I know how to abound?
can I want if the Lord will have it ſo? is God
enough if I have nothing? is not all the world e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
if God be a ſtranger? how can I bear croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and diſappointments in the world?</p>
            <p>Speak friends, are any of theſe things enquired
after? I doubt whether you be faithful in this
matter; oh might I prevail with you to put upon
this cloſer and ſeverer tryal, you know not what
it might gain you: If you can but apprehend your
Enemy at ſuch a time as this, when you are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this ſolemn approach to the Lord, when it
would be ſo dreadful to you to be found in league
with it, at what an advantage would you then
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:153788:140"/>
have it? Now is a time, when if ever, we are
like to have you ſerious; looſe not the ſeaſon;
beware of <hi>ſolemn triflings;</hi> hide not now your
eyes from ſeeing your diſeaſe; beware of palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
and mincing, be zealous to know the worſt
of your caſe; put Conſcience cloſe to it, what
ſayſt thou, <hi>Guilty, or not guilty?</hi> If Conſcience
plead <hi>Guilty,</hi> then come before the Lord if thou
darſt without ſerious repentance and reſolution
to reform.</p>
            <p>Another preparatory duty, (to name no more)
<hi>is the renewing of our repentance.</hi> This is neceſſarily
included in the <hi>renewing of our Covenant,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without repenting of our covenant brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p>Repentance, if it be ſincere, will be <hi>univerſal,</hi>
of every known ſin; If <hi>this evil</hi> we are now deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt, be found upon thy ſcore, this muſt be
the matter of thy repentance: he that repents not
of every thing thats evil, truly repents of nothing.</p>
            <p>Repentance hath reſpect, not only to <hi>the time to
come,</hi> and ſo is <hi>Reformation</hi> or the amending of our
wayes, a ceaſing to do evil, and a doing well, <hi>Iſa.</hi>
1. 16, 17. but alſo <hi>to the time paſt,</hi> and ſo is <hi>a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation</hi>
or undoing what hath been done: what
hath been done cannot be undone properly, but
in a ſenſe it may; <hi>the hearty wiſhing it undone,</hi> is in
Gods acceptance, the undoing what hath been
done: and this is eſſential to true true repentance,
<hi>an hearty wiſhing all the evil undone that hath been
done.</hi> Can that man be ſaid to repent he hath been
a worldling, that would not for any thing but he
had been ſo? hath he repented, that if he were
to begin again, would take the ſame courſe?
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:153788:141"/>
Now this, if it be well conſidered, will, in the
preſent caſe, appear to be the hardeſt part of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
how difficult ſoever it be for him whoſe
heart hath hitherto gone after his covetouſneſs, to
force it at length to a retreat, yet this hath much
more difficulty in it, <hi>heartily to wiſh he had never
been guilty of any covetous practiſes.</hi> Such an undoing
of his ſin would be his undoing in point of eſtate.</p>
            <p>It may be his covetouſneſs hath brought him in
<hi>his whole living,</hi> and gotten him all the eſtate he has
in the world; if he had not been an oppreſſour or
a fraudulent dealer, or at leaſt a zealot for this
world, poſſibly he had been but a poor man at this
day, and had never gotten any thing; his houſe
and his money and his lands are all, <hi>the income of his
covetouſneſs.</hi> To wiſh he had been true, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
and moderate in the affairs of this life, may
be the ſame as to wiſh himſelf in perpetual po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It may be when thou conſidereſt not what thou
ſayeſt, thou couldſt wiſh thou hadſt been honeſt,
but when thou weigheſt what there is in that wiſh,</hi>
Now I am full and abound, I eat and drink and wear
and lodg and dwell in the fruit of my labour and care,
but O that I had been empty and hungry and, naked,
that I have been a bankerupt and beggar rather then grown
as rich as I am upon ſuch terms? <hi>Is this ſo eaſy a
wiſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May be the drunkard will more eaſily wiſh, <hi>O
that I had ever been ſober,</hi> the adulterer will eaſily
wiſh, <hi>O that I had never been unclean,</hi> the prodigal
will eaſily wiſh, <hi>O that I had never thus fooliſhly
waſted my eſtate,</hi> but will the covetous ſo eaſily
wiſh, <hi>O that I had never gotten an eſtate thus?</hi> And
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:153788:141"/>
yet this is eſſential to repentance. He that doth
not wiſh his wickedneſs undone, doth certainly
will to do it again, if he have the ſame opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and temptation.</p>
            <p>This I ſay, is in the preſent caſe an hard piece
of repentance; it is not ſo hard a trial for a rich
man that hath now enough, to be required to
covet no more, to be unjuſt no longer, never
again to neglect his God or his Soul for his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intereſt; for if he be never ſo ſtrict this way
for the future, his fleſh is not like to ſuffer ſo much
by it, he hath enough by him already to feed and
pamper it; but to wiſh his meat out of his mouth,
his clothes off his back his mony out of his purſe,
to wiſh himſelf back to that dunghil from which
his covetouſneſs raiſed him; yea ſo heartily to
wiſh this, as to be ready to be refund and to make
reſtitution of all his diſhoneſt gains, he whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is ſo awakened as to preſs this upon him,
will ſufficiently underſtand he has hard work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. And he that perceives how hard this is
and yet how neceſſary to repentance, will take
heed how he goes on: he that hath thus unravel'd
his former evil doings, is fenced againſt future;
he will beware how he goes on to heap up ſuch a
treaſure to himſelf, which he ſees will coſt him,
either ſo much diſtreſs, or his Soul.</p>
            <p>Brethren, dare you come to Sacraments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance? that is, dare you mock God to
his face? dare you ſay you have repented of all
your ſins, when you have not repented of your
covetouſneſs, when your hearts know, you would
not for any thing but you had been covetous?
can you ſay you wiſh you had not been diſhoneſt,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:153788:142"/>
when you will not make reſtitution of your diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
gains? when do we hear of any ſuch thing as
reſtitution? Is it enough that you do evil no more
whileſt you thus juſtify what you have done?</p>
            <p>Surely friends, if you underſtand what repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is, and dare not venture upon Sacraments in
your impenitence, you would find all your ſins,
and this amongſt the reſt, to fall before that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

1. The Sacrament is <hi>the New Teſtament ſignified:</hi>
or a lively repreſentation of the great bleſſings of
the covenant; it is a viſible Goſpel, <hi>Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
before our eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a <hi>commemoration</hi> of Chriſt crucified; as
ſometimes you know dying friends bequeath unto
their dear ſurvivers, ſome token of their love, a ring
or a Jewel or their picture to preſerve their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
with them, ſo did our dying Lord bequeath
this ſignet, this picture of Chriſt crucified to his
living Saints, with this charge, <hi>as often as you look
on this think on me,</hi> Luk. 22. 19. <hi>Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the <hi>ſhewing forth Chriſt crucified in open ſight,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. And in this <hi>Croſs</hi> may be ſeen the
<hi>Crown,</hi> as you may give a gueſs at the <hi>purchaſe</hi> by
the <hi>price</hi> that's layd down for it. The pardons, the
peace, the hopes, the robes, the manſions, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
incorruptible undefiled immarceſſible,
to which we are redeemed, we have a ſurvey of
them all in this price that was paid for them. The
love of Chriſt, his kindneſſes and compaſſions do
all look forth upon us; His ſweat, his ſtripes, his
grief, his groans, his bloud, do all ſpeak, <hi>Behold
how he loved us, behold what he hath laid up for thoſe
that love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Brethren, will not this price buy off your Souls
from this Earth, which hath bought them from
Hell? will neither the price nor the purchaſe do
it? will not Heaven be taken in exchange for
clay? you have been at the table of the Lord, but
ſure you do not uſe to ſee Jeſus there, if your
Souls yet dwell in the duſt.</p>
            <p>Look ye to that tree, the croſs of your Lord;
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:153788:143"/>
that inſtrument of death, behold how it is become
a tree of life; a tree of life hung with all manner
of precious fruits: there are all the curſes naild
and witherd, there are all the flowers, and fruits of
the Paradiſe of God growing up and flouriſhing;
there is joy and glory, there is life and peace,
<hi>Surſum Corda:</hi> What are theſe Souls? what, moles
and batts? what, no eyes to ſee this glory? what
ſee it and not deſire it? what, ſtill feeding with
the worms? Let theſe moles get them eyes, let
theſe worms get them wings; look till you can
ſee, and ſee till you can love, and then aſcend and
be ſatisfied: <hi>When I am lifted up I will draw all men
after me,</hi> Joh. 12. 32. Is not the Son of Man lifted
up? doſt thou not ſee him before thee? what is
thine heart that doth not yet begin to aſcend?</p>
            <p>O what is Chriſt? what not worth the thirty
pieces? wilt thou again ſell thy Lord for money?
once more look on him whom thou haſt pierced
and then ſay, O my Soul whom wilt thou? <hi>Jeſus
or Barabbas?</hi> this World is a robber? what do I
here? am I come to crucifie the Son of God afreſh?
to ſet him at nought again, to ſell him the ſecond
time? my mony periſh from me rather then it
ſhould again become <hi>the price of bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Sacrament is <hi>the New Teſtament ſealed:</hi>
the uſe of a Seal is to ſecure and confirm; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Seals are affix'd to writings, bonds or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
to give them their full force and ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>The writing to which this Seal is ſet is <hi>the Goſpel;</hi>
the <hi>great and precious promiſes,</hi> which are full of life
and immortality, and all the riches of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:153788:143"/>
               <hi>The Lord in giving us the Sacramental Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
his Bread, and his Cup, <hi>doth therein deliver
us the Covenant of Grace ſealed, to aſſure us of
the truth and certainty thereof; as if he ſhould
ſay,</hi> This ſhall be a ſign betwixt me and thee, that if thou
accept of my Goſpel treaſures upon Goſpel terms, if thou
wilt have no other God, but wi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t forſake all and follow
me, this ſhall be to aſſure thee, that I will be thy God,
and all that I have is thine.</p>
            <p>And as the Lord ſeals on his part, ſo we ſet
our ſeal to our part of the Covenant; as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is mutual, ſo is the ſealing; Gods giving
is his ſealing, and our receiving is ours; our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Elements from the hand of the Lord,
our eating and drinking, is our ſeal, to witneſs
our acceptance of God upon Gods terms, <hi>let this
be a ſign betwixt me and thee that I accept Lord, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of thee according to the tenor and terms of thy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our acceptance of theſe Elements is as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
taking <hi>Covenant money,</hi> or a Souldiers taking
<hi>Preſs money,</hi> which binds the one to his Maſter,
the other to his Captain; and our ſealing in this
manner, doth in a ſenſe ratifie Gods Seal, as to
our particular intereſt in the promiſe; as upon
a ſervants receiving his Covenant money, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is confirmed not only on his own part, but
alſo on his Maſters: His Maſter is now engaged
to own him, provide for him, protect him, and
reward him as his ſervant: Its true, Gods Seal
alone fully confirms the truth of the Covenant in
general, but upon my ſealing to the condition on
my part, (provided it be ſincere and unfeigned)
hereupon Gods Seal doth not only confirm the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:153788:144"/>
Covenant in general, (that he which believeth
and obeyeth the Goſpel ſhall certainly be ſaved)
but it now makes it ſure to me, and gives me a
certain propriety in all the promiſes of God.
There's not a man in the world that thus accepts
and ſets to his Seal, but the Seal of God ſtands
good to him; he hath it under Gods hand and
ſeal that he ſhall be pardoned, he hath it under
Gods hand and ſeal, that grace, and peace, and all
things neceſſary unto life and ſalvation are his.</p>
            <p>Only it muſt be underſtood and remembred (as
before) our acceptance is not to be only of what
God promiſes, <hi>a willingneſs to be pardoned and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
but of what God requires, <hi>a willingneſs to
ſerve him, and forſaking all others, to cleave only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him;</hi> as a Souldier takes his Preſs money, not
only in token that he accepts of his pay, or a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
his Covenant money in token that he accepts
of his wages, but it is their taking pay upon terms
to fight, and taking wages on terms to work.</p>
            <p>Now hence ariſes a double advantage in our
war againſt the world, an
<list>
                  <item>Encouragement.</item>
                  <item>Engagement.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Gods Seal encourages us on.</hi> The Covenant of
God aſſures, not only a Crown to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
but aſſiſtance to the Combatant: He will be
not only <hi>the rewarder,</hi> but <hi>the helper</hi> of all thoſe that
diligently ſeek him: He hath ſaid, <hi>Heb. 13. 5. I
will never fail thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> And hereupon
thou mayſt boldly ſay, <hi>The Lord is my helper.</hi> He
hath ſaid, <hi>Ezek. 36. 27. I will put my ſpirit within
you;</hi> and ver. 26. <hi>I will give you a new heart.</hi> This
fleſh will never prevail, but what cannot the Spirit
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:153788:144"/>
of the Lord do? this old heart and the world will
never part, they were ever friends, and ever will
be; but he will take away this, and give you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heart.</p>
            <p>Fright not thy ſelf with the difficulties thou
ſeeſt before thee, from <hi>the ſtrong party the world has
within thee,</hi> thy carnal nature with all thine earthly
members; <hi>from the Allies and Confederates it hath
without thee,</hi> Satan with all his inſtruments and
temptations; thou wilt be like to ſay, How can I
turn this ſtream of nature? how can I ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this floud of temptations? Can I create me
a new ſpirit? or can I conquer whileſt this old
ſpirit lives? can I command my love, and my
fear, and my hatred, as I pleaſe? can I love what
I will, and hate what I will, and fear what I will?
can I fly from what my heart follows after, or
fight againſt what I ſo love and deſire?</p>
            <p>How can I endure ſuch hardneſs, as not only
<hi>the fight,</hi> but <hi>the victory</hi> will bring upon me? Can
I be poor? can I be hungry, be naked, be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute?
can I be in reproach, in diſgrace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt?
will this heart ever bear the watchings,
the faſtings, the labours, together with the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and afflictions of this warfare? I ſhall ſurely
periſh one day or other by the hand of this Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>Diſcourage not thy ſelf thus; what cannot God
do? what will not God do, who hath ſaid, who
hath ſeal'd to it, <hi>I will never fail thee, nor forſake
thee?</hi> Behold his Seal; Is it not in thine hand, and
in thy mouth? Truſt in God; ſet to thy Seal that
God is true, and then ſay, <hi>Though my fleſh and my
heart fail, God is the ſtrength of mine heart, and my
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:153788:145"/>
portion for ever: I will go in the ſtrength of the Lord,
through him I ſhall do valiantly, he ſhall tread down
mine enemies, and my difficulties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Our Seal engages us on.</hi> Haſt thou ſealed to
the Lord, and not bound thy ſelf to him? Haſt
thou ſet thy ſeal to a blank? haſt thou engaged thy
ſelf to be the Lords, and not therein to be no
longer the worlds? Canſt thou ſerve theſe two
Maſters? Is not thy renouncing the world neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
included in thy Covenant Obligation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren, that the tye may the more ſenſibly lie
upon you, I adviſe, that as often as you come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord in this Ordinance, you put this</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<hi>into your engagement;</hi> Father, I am ſenſible
of the plague of this earthly heart, and of the tyranny
of theſe worldly luſts, how impetuouſly they ſet upon me,
and how imperiouſly they lead me on after them, how
falſe and unfaithful have they made me to my God, how
ordinarily am I led away by them againſt my Covenant,
and my conſcience: But I here bewail it, I deteſt it, it
is my grief and my ſhame that ever I have been ſo falſe
and unworthy: Behold now again, in thy fear, I open
my mouth to the Lord, I take hold of thy word, I hang
upon thy help, let the Lord my righteouſneſs be my
ſtrength, and in his Name I again lift up mine hand to
the moſt High, ſolemnly proteſting before the Lord, that
I ſo avouch thee to be my God, and ſo entirely and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
make over my ſelf unto thee, that through the
grace of God with me, I will henceforth, and while I
live, be the avowed enemy of a worldly heart and life;
I will uſe all thy means for the overcoming of it; I will
ſtudy, I will watch, I will pray againſt, I will rate, and
check, and reſtrain, and reſiſt all the motions, luſtings,
and temptations by which I have been ſo often led aſide
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:153788:145"/>
and overcome; I give my ſelf, my eſtate, my ſtrength,
my parts, my time, all that I have unto the Lord; Lord
take me at my word, and all that I have for thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
I am thine ſave me. Thou that knoweſt all things,
knoweſt that I would not lye unto God, but that I ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intend, in thy ſtrength, to ſtand to this word, in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
whereof I here take this holy Sacrament from
thine hands. I have opened my mouth to the Lord, help
me, and I will not go back.</p>
            <p>And now, O my ſoul, look to thy ſelf; Shall I
again break my Covenant? ſhall I wickedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and alter the word that is gone out of my
lips? ſhall I any longer walk after the courſe,
and in the luſts of this world, fulfilling the deſires
of the fleſh, and of my mind? ſhall mine heart
ſtill go after my covetouſneſs? ſhall I ſtudy and
project, and plot and prog for this fleſh at that
rate, as if the world were ſtill my God? ſhall it
climb up from the footſtool to the Throne? ſhall
it again give Laws to my heart, and ſet limits to
my Religion? ſhall intereſt Lord it over Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and carnal inclination bear down devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
ſhall I ſuffer this Robber to break in again
into the Sanctuary of the Lord? ſhall it eat up my
Sacrifices, ſteal away my Sabbaths, curtail my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and enervate Ordinances? ſhall the Lord
have no more of me then the world will ſpare
him? ſhall buſineſs be ever again pleaded againſt
duty, or gain againſt godlineſs? ſhall my ſoul
take up its dwelling in my ſhop, or in my fields,
and only give ſome ſhort viſits to heaven at its
leiſure?</p>
            <p>But oh ſhall lying and promiſe breaking, ſhall
fraud and oppreſſion, ſhall unrighteouſneſs or
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:153788:146"/>
unmercifulneſs be nothing with me, or but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable
failings? Are theſe things according to
the vows of God that are upon me? Look to thy
ſelf, O my ſoul, be not found a lyar againſt God.</p>
            <p>O Brethren, were there this ſolemn and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
tranſaction betwixt our ſouls and the Lord
at every Sacrament, and did we thus live in the
conſcience of this Obligation, and the dread of
being found falſe to God, from Sacrament to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
what might it not bring forth? what a
wound would be given to the head of this deadly
Enemy?</p>
            <p>3. The Sacrament is <hi>the New Teſtament bleſſings
exhibited:</hi> The new wine broached; this Conduit
runs with Goſpel Wine: Our partaking in the
Sacrament, is our coming into the Garden of our
Lord, <hi>to eat his pleaſant fruits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read, <hi>Cant. 2. 3. I ſate down under his ſhadow
with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte.</hi>
I ſhall ſtay a while here, and ſhall gather a bundle
of theſe fruits, and preſent them to your eye. I
ſhall in ſhort ſhew,
<list>
                  <item>1. What the ſpecial fruits of Chriſt are.</item>
                  <item>2. That theſe fruits are ſweet and pleaſant,
and then I ſhall add,</item>
                  <item>3. That theſe fruits are exhibited in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>
                  <item>4. The advantages we hence have againſt the
world.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>What the ſpecial fruits of Chriſt are;</hi> which I
ſhall reduce to theſe two heads.</p>
            <p>The fruits of
<list>
                  <item>His Bloud.</item>
                  <item>His Spirit.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>The fruits of his Bloud.</hi> Theſe are eſpecially
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:153788:146"/>
two, in which all others are comprized, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>Righſeouſneſs.</item>
               <item>Peace.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> He is therefore called <hi>the Lord
our righteouſneſs, Jer. 23. 6. Joh.</hi> 16. 8. He ſhall
convince the world of <hi>righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, of
the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; he ſhall evidence
and make manifeſt unto the world, who all <hi>lye in
wickedneſs,</hi> that in him there is righteouſneſs; not
only that he is righteous as an <hi>individual perſon,</hi> but
as a <hi>publick perſon;</hi> that he hath in the name and
on the behalf of all thoſe that believe on him, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
all righteouſneſs, and hath hereby a ſtock
and treaſure of righteouſneſs to beſtow, and
wherewith to cloath all thoſe that come unto God
by him, to whom <hi>he is made wiſdome, [righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs]
ſanctification and redemption, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 30.</p>
            <p>Beloved, are there any guilty ſouls among you,
any unrighteous ones? do you know what 'tis to
be guilty? do you know the dread and terrour of
the Lord? do you conſider what the face of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
incenſed God will be to an unrighteous
ſoul? do you underſtand how naked you lye, and
open before everlaſting vengeance? how can you
endure? or how can you eſcape the wrath to
come? righteouſneſs of your own you have
none, and that which you ſeem to have, is not
your righteouſneſs: But behold here's righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for you, come to Chriſt, put in here, dip you
in his bloud, and then you are clean; though your
iniquity be ſearched for, yet it ſhall not be
found; this righteouſneſs ſhall <hi>anſwer for you,</hi> for
all your unrighteouſneſs; this righteouſneſs ſhall
<hi>purchaſe for you</hi> the eternal inheritance, O me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:153788:147"/>
we ſhould hear you all crying out with
thoſe Jews, though with another heart, and in
another ſenſe, <hi>His bloud be upon us, and upon our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Peace.</hi> That's another fruit of Chriſts
bloud; he <hi>hath made peace by the bloud of his Croſs,
Col.</hi> 1. 20. He hath made peace, not only betwixt
Jew and Gentile, reconciling them both into one
body, but betwixt God and men, reconciling
both Jew and Gentile in one body unto God,
Rom. 5. 1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace
with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This peace hath all bleſſings in it; love, good
will, pardon, grace, life; as the wrath of God
hath all woes in it, all the plagues and miſeries,
both of this world and that to come; you need
ſay no more to mark out any perſon for an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and loſt perſon, but this, <hi>The wrath of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
on him;</hi> you have ſaid enough, you need not
ſmite him the ſecond time; as the wrath of God
hath all woes, ſo the peace of God hath all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
in it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The fruits of his ſpirit.</hi> The former fruits,
<hi>righteouſneſs and peace,</hi> which I call the fruits of
the bloud of Chriſt, are in a ſenſe, the fruits alſo
of the ſpirit; as alſo theſe latter which I call the
fruits of the ſpirit, are in a ſenſe, the fruits of his
bloud: the ſpirit convinces of righteouſneſs, and
preaches peace, <hi>Joh. 16. 14. He ſhall take of mine,
and ſhew it unto you.</hi> The ſpirit firſt indeed <hi>takes of
our own,</hi> and ſhews that unto us; that ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
ſpirit that brings life and immortality, brings
firſt death and mortality to light; he that convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſin, is the ſame ſpirit that convinces of
righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:153788:147"/>
He ſhall take of our own, and ſhew it unto us.
Look thee here ſoul, what a vile and unclean
thing thou art, what a wretched and unhappy
thing thou art, what a Leper, what a Viper, what
a devil in fleſh thou haſt made thy ſelf, what an
<hi>Egypt,</hi> what a <hi>Sodom,</hi> what an hell thou haſt within
thee, what a portion, what a treaſure thou haſt
laid up for thy ſelf; Serpents, and Scorpions, and
Dragons, Bloud, and Wrath, and Fire, theſe muſt
be the portion of thy cup. Secure ſleepy ſoul,
jolly merry ſoul, that art quiet and at eaſe, ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thy ſelf with thy pleaſures, loading thy ſelf
with riches, decking thy ſelf with ornaments,
open thine eyes ſoul, look thee here, all that's
thine <hi>I here ſet in order before thee:</hi> theſe ſins, and
this guilt, and theſe curſes, and theſe plagues,
theſe are all thou canſt call thine own, theſe ſhall
dwell with thee, theſe ſhall ſtick and cleave to
thee, as thy fleſh to thy bone, as thy body to thy
ſoul: this ſad and amazing ſight the ſpirit ſhews
us, <hi>takes of our own, and ſhews it unto us:</hi> But then
ſays Chriſt, <hi>he ſhall take of mine,</hi> of my righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and peace, <hi>and ſhew it unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay, even theſe fruits <hi>of the bloud of Chriſt</hi> may
be alſo called the fruits of the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe, there are others that the
Scripture expreſly calls <hi>the fruits of the ſpirit;</hi> what
theſe are you may read, Gal. 5. 22, 23. <hi>But the
fruit of the ſpirit is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs,
goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance;</hi> all the
graces and the comforts of the ſpirit iſſuing from
them, theſe are the fruits of the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>2. That theſe fruits of Chriſt are ſweet, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 7. <hi>To them that believe he is precious:</hi> He and all
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:153788:148"/>
his, root and branches, tree and fruit; he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<hi>to the eye,</hi> the thoughts of Chriſt are precious,
<hi>Pſa. 104. 3. My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet.</hi> It
is a pleaſant thing to behold this Sun; he is ſweet
<hi>to the ear,</hi> his words are ſweet, <hi>ſweeter then the honey
and the honey comb, Pſa.</hi> 19. 10. His houſe and his
dwelling is ſweet, <hi>Pſa. 84. 1. How amiable are thy
Tabernacles O Lord.</hi> How might I inlarge here!
But more cloſe to the matter in hand, becauſe ſenſe
will give us the fulleſt proof of ſweetneſs let
me ask.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>How ſweet have you found the fruits of the bloud of
Chriſt?</hi> Ask <hi>the guilty</hi> if righteouſneſs be not ſweet,
if pardon be not ſweet, ask <hi>the priſoner</hi> if liberty
be not ſweet, ask <hi>the debtor</hi> how he would receive
his diſcharge from all his debts. Doſt thou know
what <hi>bloud guiltineſs</hi> means, I need not commend to
thee, <hi>the bloud of attonement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>How ſweet are the fruits of his Spirit?</hi> would
it not be a pleaſure to you to be holy and humble
and meek? is not love ſweet? is not holy joy
ſweet? that is, is not ſweetneſs ſweet? nay is not
godly ſorrow ſweet? the mournings and meltings
for ſin, have more ſweetneſs in them then the
ſportings and laughings of ſinners.</p>
            <p>Is not the ſenſe of integrity, clearneſs and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs,
is not peace of conſcience, the aſſurance
of divine love, are not theſe ſweet? Ask thoſe that
labour under the gripes and pangs of a wounded
conſcience, or are ſtung with the conſcience of
guile and treachery, how they would prize peace
of conſcience: ask thoſe who have received the
ſentence of death in themſelves, and lye roaring
like bulls in a net, full of the fury of the Lord,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:153788:148"/>
how pretious aſſurance of the love of God would
be. Ask thoſe whoſe ſouls do dwell at eaſe, who
walk in the light of the Lord, and have taſted that
the Lord is gracious, what they would take in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for thoſe comforts, wherewith they feel
themſelves comforted of God.</p>
            <p>I appeal to ſome of your experiences, whether
ever you have had ſo much pleaſure in all your
lives, as when you have found your hearts aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Heaven ward, in your flames of love, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
teſtimony from the Lord, that you are
accepted with him: ſurely your ſouls have taſted
how good the Lord is.</p>
            <p>But here note that theſe fruits of the Spirit
(ſome of them eſpecially) are ſweet only
<list>
                  <item>To the Souls.
<list>
                        <item>Healthy</item>
                        <item>Hungry</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>To the healthy Soul:</hi> that is, to the holy Soul,
to the ſick every pleaſant thing is bitter: is grace
unfavoury? is holineſs harſh to thee, doeſt thou
find no reliſh in it? are thy gourds and thy husks
thy locuſts and wild hony, the pleaſures of thy fleſh
only grateful to thy palate? O thou art a ſickly
Soul, there is no health in thee.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>To the hungry Soul:</hi> The hungry he fills with
good things, and the hungry will reliſh his good
things, the full Soul loaths the honey comb: canſt
thou not taſt the ſweetneſs? O thou art a full Soul;
Satan hath filled thine heart, thou haſt <hi>an heart full</hi>
of dirt and traſh; the Divel hath made a very ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or barn, or dung pot of thine heart; meat and
drink and mony and mirth have chok'd up thy ſoul,
and that's the reaſon that Chriſt is no more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:153788:149"/>
Are there any <hi>empty ſouls</hi> among you, hungring
and thirſting after the bread and water of life?
what if Chriſt ſhould come down and meet you
here, and feed you with theſe good things? would
you not ſay, O this is ſweet feeding, O this is a
ſweet morning, O this is a pleaſant meal?</p>
            <p>If you could ſee all the bleſſed fruits of the
goſpel, ſpred upon this table; if you ſaw pardons
ſealed before you for every one of your ſouls; if
grace and peace, if love and joy, if holineſs and
power, and every thing your ſouls want or wiſh
for, if you ſhould ſee them here on the table; if
you ſhould hear a voice from Heaven calling unto
you, <hi>Eat O friends, drink, yea drink abundantly O
beloved,</hi> you that want a pardon, there 'tis for you;
you that want holineſs, humility, patience, power,
aſſurance, here 'tis for you, take it; It may be
the full ſouls among you would be nothing moved,
it would better pleaſe them to hear, <hi>there's a penny
for you, there's a ſheep or an houſe or a living for you,</hi>
But every hungry ſoul would cry out, O this is
ſweet, 'its good to be here.</p>
            <p>3. That theſe fruits of Chriſt are exhibited and given
forth in the ſacrament. <hi>The ſacrament is a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:</hi>
the Communion of the body of Chriſt, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the bloud of Chriſt, 1 Cor. 10. 16. <hi>wherein
we come not only to ſee, but to receive Chriſt
crucified, to receive</hi> of his fulneſs grace for grace.</p>
            <p>Iſa. 12. 3. <hi>we have a promiſe,</hi> with joy ſhall ye
draw water out of the wells of ſalvation, <hi>here note,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>That the Church of Chriſt hath her wells of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi>
without is death and deſtruction: ſinners
have their pits, and their pools, and their ciſterns,
but no wells. There is a fountain and <hi>a fountain
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:153788:149"/>
opened</hi> Zech. 13. 1. but 'tis <hi>to the houſe of David and
the inhabitants of Jeruſalem:</hi> to the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God
not to his enemies; to theſe <hi>the fountains opened,</hi>
is a <hi>fountain ſealed,</hi> Chriſt ſhall profit them nothing;
Chriſt is the Churches incloſure, no common for
aliens.</p>
            <p>If you ask what are thoſe wells, I anſwer the
word is a well, the ordinances are wells, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
this ordinance, this ſacrament to which we
are come this day to draw, this is a well: it hath
<hi>the depth of a well;</hi> this ordinance is a deep myſtery,
'tis not every hand, no nor every eye that can
reach the water. 2. It hath <hi>the ſpring of a well:</hi>
wells have not a ſtanding and underived fulneſs,
but they have a ſpring that feeds them: Chriſt is
the ſpring that fills this well. 3. It hath <hi>the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a well,</hi> ciſterns will hold little water, in the
well there is ſtore: all Chriſt is here, <hi>in whom all
fulneſs dwells.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This well is the Churches, <hi>it belongs only to thoſe
that belong to God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 22. 23. whether Paul
Apollos or Cephas, <hi>whether miniſters or ordinances,</hi>
all are yours becauſe you are Chriſts and Chriſt is Gods:
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. who are Iſraelites, to whom pertaineth the
adoption and the glory and the covenants; <hi>to whom
the adoption and the covenants belong, theirs are
the ſeals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The things that are without are yours ſinners;
ſin is yours, guilt is yours, temptations ſnares
woes, death is yours, becauſe ye are none of Chriſts;
this well of life is none of yours. It will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of you, as <hi>Math. 22. 12, Friend how camſt
thou in hither? what haſt thou to do to take my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
or the bloud of my covenant <hi>into thy mouth,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:153788:150"/>
ſince thou hateſt inſtruction and caſteſt my words behind
thee,</hi> Pſal. 50.</p>
            <p>Such may not come to the well, or if they come,
it may prove a well of damnation to them, not of
ſalvation: and ſo the Apoſtle tells them it will
prove 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29. This water of life may prove
as the <hi>water of jealouſie,</hi> that bitter water that will
cauſe <hi>their belly to ſwell and their thigh to rott,</hi> may be
a curſe and not a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Look to it ſinners, you may be drown'd in this
well when you come to drink; you may drink
flames and fury inſtead of the water of life.</p>
            <p>Oh how many have been drown'd in theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
who ruſhing unpreparedly upon this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ordinance, have drown'd all that little good
they ſeem'd to have: ſomething poſſibly they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
had that was hopeful, but by the juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God upon them for abuſing ſuch an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
they have loſt all: at firſt they came it may
be with ſome little tenderneſs and trembling of
heart, but not being upright in the main, they have
at length loſt all their ſenſe, and have been ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with deadneſs and hardneſs.</p>
            <p>O conſider what you are, and how 'tis with you
now you come here? are you Chriſts? are you ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
his? are you reſolvedly his? if you have
not <hi>aſſurance</hi> that you are his, what <hi>probable evidences</hi>
have you that you are? are your ſouls wiſhing for
Chriſt, waiting for Chriſt, thirſting and panting
and following after love to Chriſt, likeneſs to
Chriſt, ſubjection to Chriſt, evidences that he is
yours? are you reſolved, never while you live,
to turn back and give over your purſuit of
Chriſt nor to ſit down by any thing ſhort of an
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:153788:150"/>
univerſal conformity to his image and will?</p>
            <p>Are you crucified with Chriſt? Is the world
crucified to you, and you unto the world? Is the
<hi>old man</hi> ſlain, and all your earthly members? feel
every limb of the old man, if there be not life
ſtill found in them; feel <hi>the heart</hi> of the old man,
is there not ſelf-will, ſelf-love, and the love of
this preſent world yet alive? feel <hi>the head</hi> of the
old man, is not pride and ſelf-conce it alive? what
plottings and contrivances, what great deſigns
are there carrying on for the fleſh and the world?
feel <hi>the gall and the ſpleen</hi> of him, is not bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and wrath, envy and malice yet alive? ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<hi>the eyes, and the ears, and the tongue, and the
habit, and the way;</hi> doth not the old man live in
all theſe? are not the eyes pleas'd with beholding
vanity, the ears itching after fleſhly fooleries?
Is not the ſound of him upon the tongue, the ſhew
of him in the countenance, the habit, and whole
way of life? feel <hi>the pulſes</hi> of the old man, his
breathings and pantings, is it not after earth
ſtill?</p>
            <p>Brethren, if there be any ſad remains of this
earth and fleſh in you, as doubtleſs there are, yet
is there an abatement of the power and vigor of
them? if the old man be not quite dead, yet is
he in a Conſumption? are the waters of luſt
fallen; yea, and ſtill falling lower? are you in
good earneſt [for] mortification, for the death of
every luſt? and are you impatient while they live?
are you come to this point, you'l never be the
friends of your fleſh, you'l never take its part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
againſt warnings, againſt reproofs, you'l ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
live in peace with it, but will wreſtle, and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:153788:151"/>
fight, and wait for the victory as long as you live?
This will give you good hope, that Chriſt is yours;
and good evidence that he calls to you, <hi>Come unto
the waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>In this Well of Salvation there is water of life:
Ye ſhall draw [water]</hi> that is, living water: In this
water is comprehended all things belonging to
life and godlineſs: Here is <hi>bread</hi> in this water;
he that is the Rock ſpringing in the earth, is the
bread that came down from heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 48. 50.
Here is <hi>bloud</hi> with the water; out of his ſide came
water and bloud. Here is <hi>wine and milk</hi> in this
water, <hi>Iſ. 55. 1. Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye
to the [waters,]</hi> come <hi>buy wine and milk.</hi> Come to
the waters, why what ſhall we get there? O
there's wine and milk in the waters; come to the
waters for wine and milk.</p>
            <p>What caſe is there of any of the Saints, but
here's that which is proper for it: Here's water
for the filthy, here's bloud for the guilty, here's
bread for the ſtrong, here's milk for the weak,
here's wine for the ſad; here's for meat, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
and delight; here's the flower of the wheat,
the healing balm, the ſweetneſs of the fig-tree,
the fatneſs of the Olive, the Tree of Life, Chriſt
is in theſe waters.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>This water of life is [to be drawn] out of this Well
of Salvation.</hi> Hence 'tis that we muſt come, every
man with his Pitcher. Faith is our Pitcher, what
need of a Pitcher if there were no water to be
drawn? unbelievers might then ſpeed as well as
believers.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Its a joy to the Saints to work at the Well. [With
joy] ſhall ye draw, &amp;c.</hi> We read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 6. that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:153788:151"/>
the people of God once drew other waters, and
out of another Well; <hi>they drew water, and poured it
out before the Lord.</hi> The Wells were their repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſorrow-bitten hearts, the waters were their
tears, which they poured out before the Lord:
theſe were bitter waters, and drawn with ſorrow;
the waters you are now come to, are pleaſant;
faith, and love, and joy, and praiſe, are here to be
both your work, and your waters; the three lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
are the pleaſures of the other world; the firſt
[Faith] is your Pitcher to fetch them in, and your
mouth to drink them down. God hath brought you
hither to prove the ſweetneſs of love, to taſte
what 'tis to love, and be beloved; God opens you
a Spring of everlaſting joy, thereby to dilate and
inlarge your ſouls in admirings and praiſes.</p>
            <p>4. The advantages we hence get againſt
the world; are amongſt others, theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>The precious things of Chriſt thus exhibited in
the Sacrament, will
<list>
                  <item>1. Quench our thirſt.</item>
                  <item>2. Renew our ſtrength.</item>
                  <item>3. Sharpen our weapons.</item>
                  <item>4. Set the reward before our eye.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>They will quench our thirſt after the world.</hi> The
world invites as Chriſt, <hi>Ho every one [that thirſteth]
come to my waters; If any man [thirſt] let him come
unto me and drink.</hi> God and the world are both for
the empty ſouls; he that's empty of God, there's
a man for the world; he that's empty of the
world, there's a ſoul for God; he that is ſurfeited
of the pleaſures of ſin, will nauſeate the joys of
Religion; he that is ſatiated with the pleaſures of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:153788:152"/>
Religion, will ſlight the joys of the world.</p>
            <p>John 4. 14. <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of the waters that
I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt;</hi> that is, either
when he is come up to the <hi>Well head,</hi> and ſhall
have drank his full draught, he ſhall thirſt no more
for ever, he ſhall be ſatisfied for ever; or elſe,
he that ſhall drink of my waters <hi>here,</hi> that ſhall
drink of the brook in the way, ſhall not be thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
after other waters; he that hath drank of the
<hi>upper ſprings,</hi> will better ſpare the <hi>nether ſprings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our intimate converſes with Chriſt, and thoſe
gracious ſavours and divine impreſſions they leave
upon our hearts, do naturally weaken and allay
our fleſhly appetites and inclinations: wiſdome
is not more neceſſarily expulſive of folly, light of
darkneſs, holineſs of ſin, then the love and joy of
the Lord, of the love and the luſts of this
world.</p>
            <p>Brethren, whatever divine touches, whatever
peace and joy you ſeem to feel upon your hearts,
if the world be not a looſer by them, if it ſtand
its ground, and maintain its intereſt and eſteem
in you, all that you ſeem to feel of God upon
you, look to it, that it prove not a fallacy, and a
dream: for my part, I ſhall ever ſuſpect that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy
my ſoul hath ſeem'd to get in heaven, and
all the pleaſure of it, if I be not the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to be a ſtranger in this earth: O my God
wilt thou draw forth the breaſts to me, let me
ſuck, and be ſatisfied; let the Lord God be my
ſatisfaction, and then let the world try the
ſtrength of its temptation.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>They will renew our ſtrength.</hi> This ſtaff of
bread will be the ſtrength of our hearts, they are
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:153788:152"/>
the weak ſouls whom the world conquers. But of
this having ſpoken in a former direction, I paſs it
over here with the naming.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>They will ſharpen our weapon.</hi> We never are
foil'd, but when our faith fails: <hi>This is our victory—
even our faith;</hi> this weapon of our warfare <hi>is
mighty through God:</hi> By how much the more our
faith is exercis'd on God, by ſo much the more
vigorous; believe and you ſhall be eſtabliſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and you ſhall be ſtrengthened, believe, and
all that you ſee before you ſhall be meat for your
faith to put it in heart.</p>
            <p>But how ſhall I believe? yea rather, how
ſhouldſt thou but believe? whoſe Table is this to
which thou art come? whoſe word was it that
ſaid, <hi>This bread is my body which was given for you;
This cup is the New Teſtament in my bloud which was
ſhed for you?</hi> This bread is <hi>the communion of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
this cup is <hi>the communion of my bloud?</hi> what is
this body, what is this bloud, but virtually all the
ſpirit and life of the Goſpel? what is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thoſe words, <hi>Take, and eat, and drink,</hi> but
that its the will of God, if it be your will alſo,
that all this ſhall be yours? would Chriſt ſay,
take, what he meant not to give? would Chriſt
ſay, eat, that which is not bread? will be feed
ſouls with <hi>common bread?</hi> did he bring you hither
to mock you? how ſhould you but believe?</p>
            <p>Believe, and you ſhall find <hi>his fleſh to be meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
his bloud to be drink indeed;</hi> this bread to be
Manna, this cup to come to you full of the ſpirits
of the Goſpel, which will ſo nouriſh and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
your faith, that <hi>as a mighty man refreſhed with
wine,</hi> it will rejoyce to run its courſe, and tread
down your Enemy under you.</p>

to that glory which he hath revealed.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Improve worldly proſperity this way;</hi> turn the

As the Lord, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7. 22. ſet <hi>Midian</hi> againſt <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi>

            <p>But how may this be done? hearken to me, and

for which you muſt give an account: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your ſelves as <hi>Stewards</hi> of all that you have;
you have nothing under your hand, but what is
your Maſters, and for which you muſt be reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible:
This is a truth written in nature, as well
as in Scripture; you may as well reckon your
ſelves your own <hi>Makers,</hi> as your own <hi>Lords;</hi> and
you may as well reckon your ſelves your own
Lords, as unaccountable for what you have.</p>
            <p>If you have an eſtate, if you have friends, if

<hi>Caſt ye the unprofitable ſervant into outer darkneſs, there

            </p>
            <p>The ſenſe of this will both <hi>ſtill</hi> your fleſh, from

            <p>Say to thy <hi>covetous heart,</hi> here's an opportunity
for thee to be rich; work as hard as ever thou
wilt, get as much as ever thou canſt, but when
thou haſt done, know that whatever thou haſt got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
is none of thine; thou doſt but get, that
thou mayſt have ſo much the more to uſe for God,
or to looſe for God; not an houſe, not a field, not
one peny of all that thou haſt laboured for, muſt
be ſpent upon thy fleſh; thy pride, or thy appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
or thy covetouſneſs, ſhall have never the more
for all thy ſtore, but all muſt go another way; tell
thy heart thus, that thy fleſh muſt not have the
ſpending of it, and then ſee how little pleaſure
'twill have in gathering.</p>
            <p>Tell thy <hi>ſlothful heart,</hi> here's an eſtate for thee,
here are honors, here is the love, and good will,
and good opinion of men for thee; if thou likeſt
it, take it, but know, that this is all <hi>to ſet thee the

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:153788:154"/>
which he gives thee with this charge, <hi>Occupy till I

look for it, that thou <hi>honor the Lord with thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;</hi>
and the more thou haſt, the more care
will it coſt thee, and the more labour to uſe it
well. Haſt thou <hi>dignities,</hi> and art thou ſet in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?
take heed and ſee to it, that thou be
<hi>good in thine office;</hi> woe to thee if thou neglect the
charge of the Lord, and what wilt thou do to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
it? Haſt thou <hi>the love and good will of men?</hi> this
gives thee the fairer opportunity, and thereby
impoſes on thee the greater neceſſity, to deal
roundly with them, in counſelling, admoniſhing,
and reproving them, as occaſion ſhall require;
they will take that from thee, which they will not
from another, and upon that account there's none
in the world that owes them ſo much of that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
nor ſhall pay ſo dearly for his neglect as
thou; and ſo whatever elſe thou haſt, wiſdome,
learning, natural parts, bodily health, the more
thou haſt of them, the more work they will find
thee: Tell thy ſlothful heart thus, and what thank
will it give thee for ſuch advancements whatever
they be.</p>
            <p>Tell thy <hi>voluptuous heart,</hi> here are pleaſures for
thee; here's meat, and drink, and fine cloaths,
and ſports, and paſtimes; here are Gardens and
Orchards, Apes and Peacocks; but what wilt
thou do with them, now thou haſt them? ſo much
as will help thee to be more uſeful, and ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the ends of thy being; to glorifie thy God,
to promote the ſalvation of thy ſoul, ſo much thou
mayſt take, but take more at thy utmoſt peril;
tell thy ſenſual heart, the more thou haſt of theſe
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:153788:155"/>
things, the more wilt thou be put to that hard du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>ſelf-denial;</hi> thou muſt vex, and torment, and
crucifie thy fleſh the more, by how much the more
thou haſt to ſatisfie it; whatever thou haſt before
thee, and how much ſoever thou luſteſt after it,
thou muſt not touch more then thy allowance;
though thou haſt it in thine hand, yet thou muſt
rather put a knife to thy throat, then thine hand to
thy mouth.</p>
            <p>What, ſayes the fleſh, Is this all that I gain by
having ſo much about me, only ſo much the more
labour, and vexation at preſent, and the heavier
account hereafter? May I have an eſtate, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
or pleaſures, and when I have them, muſt
they be none of mine? ſhall I be never the better
for them, never the richer for all my ſtore, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the higher for all mine honor, never the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
for all my pleaſures? I had even as good go
without them, as have them on ſuch terms as
theſe, even take them back again.</p>
            <p>Any man of underſtanding would reaſon thus,
why ſhould I ſo eagerly wiſh for more then I
have? have I not trouble enough already, labour
enough, and care enough already? have I not
enough to anſwer for already? is it ſo hard to be
<hi>faithful in my little,</hi> how then ſhall I do, <hi>if I be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
over much?</hi> Is it ſo hard to deny my fleſh when
I have not to ſatisfie it, how ſhall I ſay it nay,
when it luſts for what I have in mine hand? will
this be an advance to my contentment, to have,
and not to enjoy, to ſee and not to eat; not to
taſt what is at my mouth, nor to look on what is
before mine eyes? and yet muſt it be thus with
me, and the more I have, the more thus?
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:153788:155"/>
Well, the Lord who knows my frame, and what
condition I am beſt able to uſe, proportion out to
me, according to the good pleaſure of his will:
no more talents then he gives me power to uſe
well; no more money, no more honours, no
more love and reſpect from men, then will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
me for the work of God, and further me in
the way of life, and abound to my account ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day: away with that load, though of gold or
greatneſs, which is more then I can bear, without
the neglect of God or my Soul; let me be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
with nothing, but what I am able to ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
well; and what ever I have, let me be ſuch a

            <p>O brethren if we did ſee <hi>Talent</hi> written upon

            <p>What is it that makes proſperity ſo pleaſant to

drink be merry, here's enough for many years:

Pride, ſpare not for charges; put on thy attire,
deck thy ſelf with ornaments, crown thy ſelf with
garlands, fear not, thou ſhalt not want to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

            <p>2. <hi>Receive the proſperities of the world as tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
What God beſtows as <hi>Talents,</hi> the Devil
makes <hi>temptations;</hi> what God intends as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for ſervice, the Devil makes forage and
weapons of war; proviſion for luſt which fight,
againſt the ſoul, God ſaies, <hi>Make ye friends of the
Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, that when theſe fail you
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:153788:156"/>
may be received into everlaſting habitations,</hi> Luk. 16. 9.
Make God thy friend, make conſcience thy friend,
make Gods poor thy friends, make thee friends
<hi>for hereafter,</hi> with what thou haſt. The Devil ſaith,
<hi>make thee friends here,</hi> make the rich thy friends,
make thy companions thy friends, make thee
friends here, with what thou haſt, fear not for
hereafter, for when will theſe things fail thee?
God ſaies <hi>Honour the Lord with thy ſubſtance,</hi> Prov.
3. 9. Thou haſt received much, now think what
to return. The Devil ſaies, now thou mayſt kick
againſt God, and ſpurn with the heel; now thou
mayſt be merry and mad; 'tis for poor men to be
honeſt and ſober, to pray and ſeek God, thou
needeſt no ſuch wayes to ſupply thee: wherefore
is it better with thee then with others? wherefore
haſt thou mony, and houſes, and lands? is it, that
thou ſhouldſt bury all under a buſhel, or hide them
in a napkin? was it ever intended, thou ſhouldſt
be poor whileſt thou art rich? that thou that haſt,
ſhould be as thoſe that have not? why doth thy way
proſper? what's the meaning of all thy abundance?
doth it not call to thee, <hi>eat that which is good and
let thy ſoul delight it ſelf in fatneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Tim. 6. 9. They that will be rich fall into a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful
luſts, which drown men in perdition and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>He that falls into the hands of his riches, falls
into the hands of his fooliſh and hurtful luſts; he
that falls into the hands of theſe, falls into the hands
of the Devil, into temptation and ſnare; and a he
that falls into temptation, is ſwimming down the
ſtream into perdition and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>He that dreads not temptation, <hi>knows not himſelf
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:153788:157"/>
nor it.</hi> What art thou? what is temptation? doſt
thou know what thou art? what a weak and ſilly
thing thou art? how ignorant of Sathans devices?
what a ductile ſequacious ſoul thou art, apt to be
led away with every luſt? what a dry tree, what
tinder thou art, apt to take fire of every ſpark?
Brethren, if you know not your own weakneſs, if
you are not ſenſible how hard tis for you to reſiſt,
how eaſily you are overcome of temptation, you
are ſtrangers from your ſelves. Chriſt knew you
better when he bid you pray, <hi>Lead us not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
He knew well enough what work the
tempter would make with you, if he could but get
you within the reach of his net, and therefore
taught you to pray to be kept out. Have you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
prov'd your own weakneſs? do you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how you uſe to come off when you have
been tempted? have you no ſad experiences by
you, your broken peace, your wounded ſpirits,
your waſted Conſciences to remember you of it?
do you not ſtill uſe to come off by the loſs?</p>
            <p>Conſider friend, it may be thou art of a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
heart,</hi> and an earthly mind; and this, when it
meets thee in the preſence of God, what a ſhame
and ſorrow is it to thee? thou bewaileſt it, and
abhorreſt thy ſelf for it; thou confeſſeſt it to God,
prayeſt againſt it, covenants againſt it; and by
that thou haſt ſtood a while before the Lord, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
of the delights of his love, thou haſt gotten
thine heart a little raiſed to things above; thou
canſt ſcorn this earth, and hopeſt thou ſhalt never
be ſo taken with theſe beggarly things again; and
yet, no ſooner hath the Devil gotten thee abroad,
into thy houſe among thy treaſures, into thy field
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:153788:157"/>
among thy ſheep and oxen, but thine heart is gone
preſently after them; all the prayers and tears
and vows are forgotten and thou art as buſy and
eager upon the world as ever.</p>
            <p>It may be, thou art poſſeſſed of a <hi>ſlight and frothy
ſpirit,</hi> given to vanity, carnal mirth and jollity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and when thou comeſt to pray or to humble thy
ſelf; when thou art alone and haſt freedom to be
converſant about the matters of thy ſoul, thou art
for the time, gotten to be a little ſerious; the
ſenſe of eternity falling upon thee, thy ſoul taking
a walk to the grave, and looking over to thoſe
deeps that are on the other ſide, thy ſpirit is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
conſolidated and gotten into a more ſober
frame; and then preſently thou hopeſt thou ſhalt
never evaporate into ſuch froth and folly again:
and yet behold, as ſoon as ever thou falleſt into
company with vain perſons, and haſt been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a while with their unſavoury merriments,
thou quickly becomeſt as one of them.</p>
            <p>It may be, thou art of a <hi>pettiſh and froward ſpirit,</hi>
and this hath coſt thee dear; many tears and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of heart; and ſometimes poſſibly thou haſt
prayed and humbled thy ſelf into more meekneſs
and patience and quietneſs of ſpirit; and yet the
next croſs that comes, if but a very look, a diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful
word, nay, may be but a ſurmiſe or a
jealouſie of a ſlighting thought, will put thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
all thy patience, and ſet thee all in a flame.</p>
            <p>How many ſuch experiences haſt thou of thy
ſelf? haſt thou not often found it thus? muſt thou
not acknowledg it hath been thus again and again?
Have not theſe been ſometimes thy groans before
the Lord, at ſuch times when thou haſt felt thy ſelf
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:153788:158"/>
in a better frame, <hi>Oh that it might be ever thus? O
that this might hold; that I might never ſink into this
earthlineſs, that I might never ſwell with this froth or
fury again? O this ſlippery and unſtable heart; I
fear it, I doubt how it will ſerve me; if the world or
this fleſh do but call me away; if any temptation comes,
either to court me or to croſs me, I fear me, all this
calm and ſerenity will quickly become clouds and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts:</hi>
Speak Chriſtian hath it not been thus many
a time? O what a weak thing art thou?</p>
            <p>And what is <hi>temptation</hi> that you do not fear it?
if you know not I will tell you: there are theſe
four things in it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Deception.</item>
               <item>Infection.</item>
               <item>Seduction.</item>
               <item>Perdition.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Deception:</hi> temptation is an artifice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
on purpoſe to beguile and deceive us, <hi>Gen.</hi>
3. 13. <hi>The ſerpent beguiled me and I did eat:</hi> 'tis a
juggle, or a cheat, that carries a ſtinging tayle
under a fair face: that promiſes a kindneſs or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
but either hath <hi>nothing</hi> in it, or a <hi>miſchief:</hi>
there's no temptation, but its outſide and inſide,
its head and tayle hath as much difference, either
as ſubſtance and ſhadow, or as bait and hook.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Infection:</hi> the heart by reaſon of its filth and
rottenneſs, is apt to take infection ('tis dangerous
for perſons abounding with ill humours, to come
into ill aires) and temptation is as the air from
a plague ſore, that conveyes infection: tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
does ſo ferment innate corruption, that it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifies
into the more deadly malignity: our being
converſant with the pleaſures, and faſhions, and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:153788:158"/>
luſts of this World, our living in ſuch evil airs,
do leave ſuch corrupt impreſſions and diſpoſitions
upon us, as do ſuffocate our ſpirits, and deſtroy
the very vitals of religion in us.</p>
            <p>See it in experience: look what mens outward
condition, and their ordinary converſes are, ſuch
are their tempers and complexions: you may ſee in
their faces, and ſmell in their very breaths, where
they uſe to live. Thoſe that are dwelling, and
have their whole occupation in the earth, are they
not moſtly <hi>earthen ſouls?</hi> thoſe that dwell at eaſe,
and with the careleſs and idle, are <hi>ſluggiſh and
ſleepy ſouls:</hi> thoſe that live in pleaſure, in mirth
and jollity, what are their Souls but <hi>bladders of froth
and vanity?</hi> He that dwells in the pomps and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the world, <hi>proud and haughty, ſcorner is his
name,</hi> and according to his name ſo is the man:
he that is the companion of drunkards, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
with the adulterer, his very inwards often
become <hi>debauchery:</hi> poſſibly their wayes of life
at firſt found them in ſounder tempers; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
now they are all <hi>infected perſons:</hi> this earth
hath infected them, their eaſe hath infected them,
their pleaſures, and their pomps, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
have infected them, leavened them into
their own natures.</p>
            <p>Oh what ſad <hi>metamorphoſes</hi> do we ſometimes ſee,
even of the moſt promiſing ingenuous natures, by
their overbold or unwary converſes; ſpoil'd not
only of their moſt <hi>gracious</hi> inclinations, but of
all tinctures of <hi>good nature;</hi> grown proud, and
wanton, and froward, and rude, and perverſe,
who were once loved for their humility, ſobriety
and meekneſs; and all this by the infection they
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:153788:159"/>
have received from their ways, or companions.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that will run into temptations, that will
adventure themſelves any where whither their luſt
leads them, that will not firſt enquire, <hi>Is it good
for me to be here?</hi> is it ſafe for me to walk thus?
are as mad and fooliſh, as thoſe that will run into
a Peſthouſe, or lodge amongſt Lepers. Doſt thou
not ſee what thy boldneſs hath already coſt thee?
Is not the hew of thy Society already grain'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy face? art thou not become as one of them
thou converſeſt withall? has not the Infection
ſeiz'd on thine heart, and does not the Leproſie
appear in thy forehead? take heed fooliſh ſoul, if
it be not already, in how little time, may this
diſeaſe be incurable.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Seduction.</hi> Leading aſide to errors and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes,
to believe a lye: there are temptations
that corrupt the judgement, as well as the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that change <hi>the principles,</hi> as well as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.
When the heart is leavened into vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
it muſt have a Religion that's ſuited to it; its
vain ways muſt be all made right in its eyes: when
the heart is become a Libertine, all its principles
muſt be <hi>latitudinarian:</hi> What ſay the great men,
and wiſe men? what ſay many of the wits of the
world, the men whoſe eyes are opened, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of whom all their fathers were but chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and knew nothing at all? are theſe for
this ſtrict and circumſpect ſelf-denying life? do
they not teach us better doctrines? the Spirit of
Religion is not nice and moroſe, nor ſo ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac'd
as repreſented by ſome, but more Noble,
and generous, and free, not feeding men with
fears and jealouſies, not loading them with heavy
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:153788:159"/>
burdens, nor limiting them within narrow
bounds, nor impoſing on them ſuch ſeverities as
ſome others plead for; that is, in other terms,
(if ſome mens doings may be a Commentary on
their ſayings) Religion is for licentiouſneſs, a
Patron for luſt, a friend of the fleſh and fleſhly
liberties; as if Chriſt was out when he ſaid, <hi>Strait
is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life;</hi>
and his Apoſtles after him when they exhorted,
<hi>See that you walk circumſpectly: Paſs the time of your
ſojourning here in fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why may not theſe be in the right? this is
the eaſieſt and leaſt troubleſome way; O that
this might be Religion indeed! and why may it
not? theſe men ſee as much as others, and theſe
men have ſouls as well as others; well, I am for
them.</p>
            <p>And when our ſpirits are ſuited to carnal ways,
and our judgments are brib'd to give their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
for them, how eaſily doth our foot fix in
them: our luſts lead us aſide, and our evil prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
warrant our wandrings; our corrupt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
carry us into crooked ways, and our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
judgments will take upon them to make the
crooked ſtrait.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Perdition:</hi> that's the term, or Gulf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
theſe ſtreams are carrying us down; tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is deſtruction begun, and deſtruction is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
finiſhed: the Devil hath done his work,
temptation hath ſerv'd his turn, when it hath
drown'd the ſoul in perdition and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Well now, Is not temptation to be feared?
would you not fear to be deceived, to be infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to be ſeduced, to be deſtroyed? and is not
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:153788:160"/>
proſperity a temptation? will the devil be friend
you for nothing? is not this chaff a bait? is there
not a Net ſpread under? who is it that ſaid, <hi>The
proſperity of fools ſhall deſtroy them?</hi> and how doth
it deſtroy, but by firſt deceiving them?</p>
            <p>Can you rejoyce when you fall into temptation?
can you ſport your ſelves in your own decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
and bleſs your ſelves in your own deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
will you luſt, and covet, and lye, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and toil, and all to treaſure up <hi>gins, and
ſnares, and nets, and hooks,</hi> to take your ſouls with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and will you take theſe, as the reward of all
your labour?</p>
            <p>Are you <hi>temptation proof?</hi> are you gotten above
the danger of temptation? dare you challenge
the tempter into the field? when ſo many great
men, and wiſe men, and good men have ſo ſadly
fallen, and ſuffer'd ſuch unſpeakable loſs, are you
ſecure from any ſuch prejudice? are you gotten
to that pitch, that you can now <hi>touch pitch, and not
be defiled, or walk upon coals, and not be burnt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have you never ſuffer'd by your proſperity?
hath your ſoul never ſuffer'd, your conſcience
never ſuffer'd? have you never been deceived
and beguiled by it? have you never loſt ſome
better things, by your over-loving theſe? have
you been deceiv'd formerly, and is there no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being deceiv'd for the future? have you
been deceived, and is there no danger you may
be deſtroyed? hath the firſt work of temptation
proſper'd, and is there no fear but that it will
miſcarry in its laſt?</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, ſtudy throughly the miſchiefs of
temptations, and be convinc'd, that the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:153788:160"/>
of the world are the moſt miſchievous of
temptations; receive them as ſuch, and then ſee
if this will not cool your covetouſneſs.</p>
            <p>A little to quicken and give life to theſe two
particulars, ponder deeply, <hi>what a dreadful thing
'twill be to miſcarry in the Judgment.</hi> 'Tis not who
ſhall ſtand in the Synagogue, or ſit in the Palaces,
but who ſhall ſtand in the Judgement; 'tis not,
who hath been cloathed in Purple, fared ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
lived deliciouſly; 'tis not, who hath gotten
the faireſt houſes, the largeſt fields, the greateſt
flocks; 'tis not, who hath been the greateſt <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,</hi>
but who hath been the beſt <hi>Steward,</hi> that will
be the concerning queſtion: whatever thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts
have been, whether little or much, what if
thy Bill of accounts ſhould be rejected with this
under-written, <hi>Away from me thou evil and ſlothful
ſervant, thou haſt been unfaithful: Caſt ye the unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ſervant into outer darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping
and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What if this ſhould be thy caſe? to be fetch'd
down from thy high places, to be thruſt out of thy
Storehouſes, to be ſnatch'd out of thy ſhop, or thy
field, to be arreſted at thy table, in the middeſt of
the feaſt, and carried away before thy Judge, with
the account of an unprofitable ſervant, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
ſteward? oh how dreadful will be thy
appearance at that day? how wilt thou hide thy
ſelf, or how wilt thou bear the face of thy Judge,
before whom thy own Conſcience ſhall arraign
and accuſe thee, for a falſe and fooliſh ſervant?</p>
            <p>And what hazard is there that this may be thy
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſe, whoſe way does proſper? when the very
ſame things that are thy <hi>Talents</hi> to be accounted
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:153788:161"/>
for, are thy <hi>temptations</hi> to neglect thy account;
when the very matter of thy truſt is a temptation
to abuſe it; the more thou haſt, the more thou haſt
to anſwer for, and the leſs like to have what to
anſwer; the more thou haſt, the more will thy
fleſh be craving for it ſelf, every luſt will come
in for a ſhare; thy pride muſt have ſome, thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
muſt have ſome, thy paſſions muſt have
ſome, thy covetouſneſs would have all, and the
more they ſee in thine hand, the more clamorous
will they be for it; theſe beggars will neither
take a denial, nor an ordinary alms at a rich mans
door.</p>
            <p>How hard will thy caſe be, either to <hi>grant or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>
if thou deny, thou ſeem'ſt cruel to thine own
fleſh; if thou granteſt, thou art falſe to God and
thy ſoul.</p>
            <p>Were theſe things duly weighed, there would
not be ſuch ſcuffling after the world, nor ſuch whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
under its want; he that had leaſt would not
murmure at his poverty, and he that had moſt
would not boaſt of his riches; he that had leaſt
would be content, and he that had moſt would be
afraid; and all would conclude, that abundance is
leſs to be deſired, and want leſs to be feared.</p>
            <p>5. Hold your thoughts, affections, and ſenſes, under
conſtant government.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Your thoughts.</hi> Where the thoughts are, the
ſoul is, <hi>Pſa. 139. 8. When I awake, I am ſtill with
thee;</hi> that is, my thoughts are preſently with
thee, my meditations are of thee; and where my
thoughts are, there am I. When the thoughts are
with God, the ſoul is with God, when the thoughts
are in the earth and mud, the ſoul is all bemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:153788:161"/>
The ſoul goes forth, <hi>to view, to taſte,</hi> and <hi>to chuſe</hi>
for it ſelf; the thoughts <hi>take a view,</hi> the affections
and ſenſes <hi>taſte and take the reliſh,</hi> and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the will <hi>chuſes:</hi> The will ſhould na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
follow the underſtanding, and chuſe only
what the unbyaſſed judgment tells it is good; but
it does too ordinarily follow the affections and
ſenſes; theſe blind the reaſon, and ſo ingage the
will; we chuſe what we love, and what pleaſes,
rather then what upon an impartial deliberation,
we judge to be good.</p>
            <p>The things of both worlds work upon hearts
<hi>objectively;</hi> by the good or evil that is apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in them, they accordingly affect us; our
thoughts ſearch into things, what there is in them;
when our thoughts by ſearching find out God,
God is regarded; and when they are in ſearch
after the world, they make a ſhift to fancy this to
be good, and accordingly it is imbraced.</p>
            <p>The thoughts are <hi>the feet and the eyes</hi> of the ſoul;
<hi>the feet,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 1. <hi>keep thy feet when thou goeſt into
the houſe of God;</hi> that is, keep and look well to
thy thoughts. <hi>The eyes,</hi> Prov. 17. 24. <hi>The eyes of a
fool;</hi> that is, his thoughts, <hi>are in the ends of the
earth;</hi> the rovings of the thoughts, are <hi>the ſouls
compaſſing the earth,</hi> and its walking to and fro to
the ends thereof.</p>
            <p>Keep your thoughts in by the Lord, and you
keep your ſouls in; your thoughts will be in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
will be walking daily and hourly, ſome whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or other; there's no keeping them in, they
will abroad, either to heaven or earth: oh ſend
them to heaven daily, and hold them there, let
them have no leiſure to wander in this earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:153788:162"/>
Brethren, <hi>think</hi> your ſelves up to heaven; as
we may pray our ſelves up, and believe our ſelves
up to heaven, ſo we may <hi>think our ſelves thither:</hi>
worldly men think themſelves into pride, or
think themſelves into covetouſneſs, or think
themſelves into wantonneſs, are ſo long think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and thinking in fuel for luſt, till they have ſet
it all in a flame: as worldly men think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into wickedneſs, ſo let Chriſtians think
themſelves into holineſs, think themſelves into
humility, ſobriety, contentation, and heavenli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of mind; call off your thoughts from this
earth, and you will ceaſe to be earthly, call them
back from vanity, and you will ceaſe to be vain;
call them up to heaven, and you call them off from
what's below.</p>
            <p>Think on God more Chriſtians, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Kingdome; think on the way that leads to
it, on the dangers that lie in the way, on the
dread of periſhing in the way, on the beauty, and
pleaſure, and comfort of being upright in the
way, of the goal and prize that is at the end of
the way.</p>
            <p>Take up ſuch thoughts as theſe; Is not God
better then the world? that is, is not all things
better then nothing? Is not grace better then ſin?
that is, is not fair better then foul? Is not peace
better then wrath, peace with God, then friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with the world? are not the fillings of Gold,
better then heaps of earth?</p>
            <p>Is a little grace ſo good, and is not more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable?
can there be much grace, where the deſire
is ſo divided betwixt it and vanity? Is gold in the
Our ſo precious, as gold out of the fire? Is the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:153788:162"/>
twilight pleaſant, O what is the day light? Is a
mixture of fleſh and ſpirit, of heaven and earth,
as deſirable as all ſpirit, all heaven? If grace be
ſo good, if peace with God be ſo precious, why
do I not ſeek it? if I have a little grace, if I have
a little peace, why do I not preſs for more? when
ſhall I increaſe, and grow rich towards God, if
I do not decreaſe towards this earth?</p>
            <p>Be thinking thus on heaven and heavenly
things, and if you will be thinking of earth too,
think of the <hi>dark places of the earth,</hi> and the dark
ſide of its brightneſs; think of the precipices, the
mariſhes, the quagmires, the barren Mountains,
and deſolate Wilderneſſes, the bryars, and thorns,
and wild beaſts of the earth; my meaning is, if
you will ſtudy the world, ſtudy its vanity and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
the danger you are in of being loſt, or
torn in pieces, or ſwallow'd up of them.</p>
            <p>How uncertain are theſe riches? how vaniſhing
is this mirth? how unconſtant are theſe friends?
what a blaſt are theſe honors? what a flaſh are
theſe pleaſures? what a bubble are theſe build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?
how long will they luſt? what will be left
of them a few years hence? But O the thorns, and
the bryars, the vexations, the cares, the fears, the
diſappointments, the croſſes, the ſweat, and the
ſorrows, that are mingled with theſe pleaſures
and poſſeſſions. But yet farther, O the darts, and
the arrows, and the ſtings that come after! O the
ſtabs, and the wounds that they give to the ſoul,
the darkneſs, and death, and damnation, that they
are dragging it into!</p>
            <p>If you will be thinking on the world, let it be
with ſuch thoughts as theſe, and then ſee if it
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:153788:163"/>
would be ſo hard to make an exchange of earth
for heaven.</p>
            <p>Brethren, the reaſon why it is ſo hard a work
for the Miniſtry to perſwade in ſouls to Chriſt is,
becauſe we cannot get them to entertain any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
thoughts of Chriſt, and of the bleſſedneſs
that comes in with him: the reaſon why we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fetch them off from the world, is, becauſe we
cannot perſwade them to think as they ſhould of
it, of the vanity of it, of the bondage it holds
them in, and the miſery it ſubjects them to: If
we could but ſet you a thinking once, what harm
would it be to me to hearken to Chriſt? what
will become of me if I do not hearken to him?
when ſhall I come to Chriſt, if I ſtill cleave to
this preſent world? what if I ſhould never come,
but ſhould ſtand at this diſtance from him to my
dying day? Can I ever hope for mercy from
Chriſt, if for the love of the world I now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
him? will he regard my cryes, when here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
I ſhall call, <hi>Lord open to me, Lord anſwer for
me, Lord ſave me;</hi> if I reject him when he calls,
<hi>Soul open to me, Soul ſubmit to me:</hi> How ſhall I ſtand
in the Judgment, if I have no Chriſt to ſtand with
me? will my eſtate, will my pleaſures, will my
friends be good Advocates for me in that day?
will this be a good Plea, Lord Jeſus appear for
me, let thy wounds plead, let thy bloud plead for
me, let me ſtand as one of thine, <hi>for I am he that
would none of thee;</hi> I ſet at nought thy counſels,
and deſpiſed thy Covenant, and trampled upon thy
bloud, and preferr'd my houſe, and my money,
and my pleaſures, and my luſts, before thy love?
I am he, whom when thou calledſt I would not
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:153788:163"/>
come, whom thou wouldſt have turned, but I
would not turn; when thou wouldſt have pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and healed me, I ſold thy pardon, and refuſed
to be healed, and wilt thou not plead for ſuch a one
as I? I have choſen [this] world for my portion,
I have lov'd it, and ſerv'd it, and when I ſhould
have been praying or hearing, minding my ſoul,
and laying up treaſure in heaven, I was loath to
be ſuch a bad husband, I was buſie in following my
affairs, looking to my Corn, and my Cattel, and
my Trade; and here I have gotten money and
Lands, and will not theſe plead for me? <hi>Is not a
rich mans Plea good?</hi> will not my gold, and my
ſilver, my honors, or my ornaments, get en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into thy Kingdome? if not Lord, this is
all I have to ſay for my ſelf, if this will not do,
who ſhall plead for me?</p>
            <p>O Brethren, if you would be perſwaded to
ſit down daily, and to think over ſome ſuch
thoughts as theſe, then there would be hope: If
we could but preach you upon this <hi>thinking,</hi> there
would be hope that you might think you into
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Hold your affections under government,</hi> Prov. 16.
32. <hi>He that ruleth his ſpirit,</hi> is better <hi>then he that
taketh a City:</hi> and no wonder, for he hath taken
the whole world captive. All victories imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
are ſumm'd up in this one victory, <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of the heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By ſpirit we are here to underſtand, <hi>the paſſions
or affections,</hi> the ſpirit of man is, as the Apoſtle
ſaies <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. the tongue of man is, <hi>an unruly evil;</hi>
impatient of ſubjection, and preſſing for domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:153788:164"/>
God hath placed our affections under government;
under the government of our reaſon, and thoſe
principles of heavenly wiſdom, faith, righteouſneſs
and holineſs, which we are indowed with; but theſe
(like an unbroken horſe, that will not go whither
the rider, but whither it ſelf liſteth) do riſe up and
rebel againſt reaſon, and will be the leaders and
not followers: and this unrulineſs of the paſſions is
the root of the diſtempers and diſorders of the
life: when men ſurrender up themſelves to be
lead by affection whither doth it carry them? rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
leads us up to God. It is the <hi>Candle of the Lord;</hi>
that lights us our way to him: our affections are
<hi>blind guides;</hi> love is blind, deſires are blind, and
whether will the blind lead us? If we could live
by faith, nay if we could but live more by reaſon
(by right reaſon) we ſhould get us up out of this
earthly country: even reaſon will tell us, that
God is better then creatures, and that the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
following of creatures, is the forſaking of
God.</p>
            <p>For the better holding your affections right,
take theſe two directions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Keep your ſelves in the love of God.</item>
               <item>2. Whatever you love in the world, let it be
alſo your fear.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Keep your ſelves in the love of God:</hi> let affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
follow the conduct of reaſon to Heaven, and
there let it dwell, but till reaſon lead it down
again: <hi>keep your ſelves in the love of God,</hi> Jude 21.
keep up a right underſtanding of God and that
will keep up your affections; keep up your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to God, and that will keep them off from the
world: the heart will ever <hi>be in love;</hi> and till it
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:153788:164"/>
find a better, this harlot muſt be its beloved: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
is as beauty whileſt beauty is out of ſight.
He ſaies in vain, <hi>ſet not your affections on the earth,</hi>
that does not firſt ſay, <hi>ſet your affections on things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</hi>
He that ſaies, <hi>ſet your affections on things above,
and not on the earth,</hi> if he be heard in the firſt, will
not be denyed in the ſecond: keep you in the love
of God, and you keep you clear of the love of the
world.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>What ever you love in the world, let it be alſo
your fear:</hi> fear will be loves bridle, and reaſon
would teach you to fear what ever you love here:
nothing hath ſuch an advantage upon us, to ſteal
away our hearts from God as the things we love.
The Lord is ſeldom ſuch a looſer as by his bounty,
when he lets down his ſilver cords of love, to draw
up our hearts, we make chains of them to fetter
us here below. His gold and his Jewels, his brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
and earrings, which he ſends us to allure our
love, are often molten into an Idol and engroſs
our hearts to them.</p>
            <p>Whatever thou loveſt in all the world, haſt thou
a wife or a child that thou loveſt, haſt thou a friend
or companion that thou loveſt, haſt thou an houſe
a pleaſant habitation, haſt thou gardens or orchards,
fields or vineyards that thine heart is pleas'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
O be jealous of them: <hi>Keep your diſtance come
not too near;</hi> thou commeſt for my Soul (my
child) my houſe, my mony my friends, I muſt
have an eye to you, you come to ſteal away mine
heart.</p>
            <p>What a ſad requital, and yet how commonly is
this the requital, which we make for bounty and
kindneſs? I ſhould have lov'd God better, if he
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:153788:165"/>
had not been ſo good to me: I ſhould have lov'd
God better, if he had not given me ſo good a wife,
ſo dear a child, ſo fair an eſtate, ſo many friends:
wilt thou fear ſuch unworthineſs? then fear what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thou loveſt.</p>
            <p>If what you love be not alſo your fear, it's like
to be your loſs and ſorrow. If <hi>Sampſon</hi> had fear'd
his Delilah whom he ſo loved, he had ſav'd his
locks, his God and his life: his love to that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
did him more miſchief, then all the armies of
the Philiſtimes. <hi>Solomons</hi> wives became his tears:
fondling children often revenge their parents do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
by becoming thorns in their ſides and ſwords
in their hearts: whatever thou overloveſt, look
for it, to find it thy <hi>croſs</hi> or thy <hi>curſe:</hi> what will
thy friends, or thy mony be, when either thou
haſt loſt them, or thy ſoul by them? what ever
thou overloveſt God will tear it from thine heart,
if ever he mean thee good, he will touch thee in
the apple of thine eye, he will try thee in thine
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> he will tear off that Jewel that entices thy
Soul from him: what thou canſt not part with,
look for it, that muſt go, or thy ſoul.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Set a ſtrict watch upon your ſenſes:</hi> By theſe 'tis,
that Satan with all his temptations, hath ſuch an
eaſy paſſage to our hearts: our ſenſes are the doors
of our hearts; <hi>the outlets of corruption, and the inlets
of temptation;</hi> they bring the outward objects, and
the inward luſts together; when the fuel and the
fire are layd together, then there is a flame.</p>
            <p>Both the <hi>Evil</hi> and the <hi>Good</hi> that is in us, came
in much by this way. How came Sin and Death
into this world, and all the plagues and miſeries
we are labouring under, or lyable to? which way
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:153788:165"/>
came they in? <hi>By the eye</hi> they came in: when the
woman [ſaw] the fatal apple, then ſhe luſted and
taſted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>How came life and immortality, grace and
peace, and all our glorious hopes in again? <hi>By
the Ear</hi> they came in. By this <hi>the promiſe</hi> entred,
by this <hi>Faith</hi> entred, <hi>Rom. 10. 17. Faith cometh by
hearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nihil eſt intellectu quod non fuit prius in ſenſu,</hi> ſaith
the Philoſopher, there's nothing in our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
and as little in our affections, whether
good or evil, but what made its way by our ſenſes.
If God hath our eye and our ear, he hath our heart;
if the Devil have gotten theſe once, 'tis not like
to be long, ere he be poſſeſſour of all: of ſuch
mighty conſequence is the keeping our ſenſes,
as Heaven and Hell amount to.</p>
            <p>Our ſenſes are now vitiated and corrupted; pre-occupated
by ſin and the Devil; ſhut againſt God,
and open to iniquity. Sin hath gotten the ſtart of
grace; and having gotten poſſeſſion of the houſe,
makes good the doors for it ſelf and friends:
whatever knocks for entrance, the word preſently
is <hi>who comes there:</hi> and if it be a friend, a friend
of ſin, there's free admiſſion: So that now in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
our ſenſes or leaving them at liberty to pleaſe
themſelves, we betray our Souls to the hands of
Hell: to be a Senſualiſt is next to being a Devil:
to leave our ſenſes unguarded, is to leave open
the floudgates of Hell: the Devil could not
wiſh our Souls in other hands, then to be given
up to our ſenſes: neither Devil or World need
doubt of entrance, while they have a friend at the
door; theſe <hi>earthen gates</hi> like that <hi>iron gate,</hi> will
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:153788:166"/>
open of their own accord to them, when ever
they come.</p>
            <p>Our depraved ſenſes are the great adverſaries
to Chriſtianity: whatever is ſaid of the <hi>enmity of
the world,</hi> of it's gains and faſhions, its pomps
and pleaſures, all lyes upon this ſcore, as they are
the objects that tickle and pleaſe the ſenſes, and
by theſe, deprave the mind and turn away the
heart.</p>
            <p>What is it that lyes in the way of the Goſpel;
that obſtructs it's paſſage and hinders it's work
upon Souls? why is it that Chriſt is not more
gladly and generally receiv'd? O this is it that
hinders; 'twould deprive us of many a ſweet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
of many a pleaſant draught, 'twould pull off
our vain habits, and wanton faſhions; 'twould
pare off our fleſhly pleaſures: no more indulging
to appetite, no more pleaſing our eyes, and ears,
and palates, if Chriſt be once entertained: now
we can take our liberty to make proviſion for the
fleſh, and let the fleſh take it's fill: we can feed
our ſelves with the fineſt, cloath our ſelves with
the beſt, we can ſoke our ſelves in all ſorts of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualities;
we can fetch in load upon load, and
make the beſt of what's before us: we can milk
every dug, we can ſuck every bottel, we can
dig in every mine, we can plough and reap in
every field that the world hath; there's nothing
but Chriſt can hinder us; once give ear to him,
and that will ſpoil all our mirth and marre all our
markets: then we muſt keep within bounds,
and neither get nor ſpend more then he allows
us: we muſt keep to our allowance and but a
ſhort allowance neither, ſuch as will be too
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:153788:166"/>
ſtrait for fleſh and bloud to ſubmit to.</p>
            <p>And hereupon our eyes and ears, which are ſo
open upon the World and it's vanities, do as it
were invite, and call in all the help the world can
make, to reſiſt Chriſt and his work; do call in all
the baits and temptations that the whole world
is furniſhed with, to divert and turn aſide the
heart from hearkning to Chriſt. <hi>Help World; help
O my carnal friends, help O my fleſhly pleaſures, help
O my houſe and money, Chriſt is come for mine heart,
I am loath it ſhould go there; can you do nothing to ſtay
it with you? help or it's gone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Friends, would you not that the world keep
Chriſt out, or draw you aſide from him? ſhut the
doors againſt it; make a covenant with your eyes
and ears, ſet a watch upon them; put a bridle
upon your appetite, and keep the door of your
lips; ſhut the world out; be deaf to it's flattery,
be blind to it's glory, wink it into darkneſs; ſhut
the doors and keep the world out, and then Chriſt
will be the better accepted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Live above the pleaſures of ſenſe.</hi> What have you
no higher pleaſures, no Nobler delights? have
you not a God to delight you in? have you no
ſoul delights? or are theſe they, wherein the
Bruits have as great a ſhare as you? Is meat, and
drink, and cloaths, and ſports, the food of ſouls,
your <hi>heart delights?</hi> muſt your immortal part live
at the Trough, and feed on ſwill and husks? where
is peace with God? where is the fellowſhip of
the ſpirit? where is the joy of the Holy Ghoſt,
and the hope of glory? where is the ſweetneſs of
ſincerity, and the peace of conſcience? are there
no ſuch things, or is there no pleaſure in them?
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:153788:167"/>
Are you content to take up with this mud, whileſt
thoſe pure ſtreams run by? or muſt you have
both? Is it not enough that your ſouls may rejoyce,
that your hearts may feaſt and ſing, unleſs your
fleſh alſo may frisk and frolick it out in it's brutiſh
mirth and pleaſure? Go taſte and ſee how good the
Lord is, drink of his rivers, acquaint your ſelves
with his pleaſures; and then ſee, if an Heaven ſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſoul can envy the brutes the pleaſures of ſenſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Make a ſolemn ſurrender of your ſelves and
ull that you have to the government and diſpoſal of God,
lay down all at his feet, and reſolve to take up nothing,

let it have never a meal nor a morſel more,
then is fit for a ſervant. Let it not have the
command of your eſtate, or be it's own carver,
but let it be at the finding of conſcience; let
never a penny be laid out upon it, either for food
or raiment but what conſcience allows. Let
your families be provided for, your friends en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
ſo, as that nothing be wanting, nothing
be waſted. Be provident but not penurious, uſe
hoſpitality but hate to be prodigals: give to all
their due and no more: and whileſt your fleſh hath
it's due, your friends and families their due, let
not Gods friends want theirs: whomever he
ſends to you for an alms, ſend them not away
empty, ſend portions to thoſe for whom nothing
is provided: feed, cloath, harbour, lend, give,
according as God hath communicated to you, and
ſhall command from you; and in giving thus to

things that are Gods.</hi>

            <p>Remember carefully this laſt direction: <hi>Lay
down all you have at the feet of God, and neither ſeek
nor uſe any thing, but according to his order and will.</hi>
Never let luſt ſet you on work, and leave nothing
to its diſpoſe: feed not your eye or your appetite,
feed not your pride or your covetouſneſs, till God
bids you feed them; and then you ſhall find your
luſts to ſtarve under your hands; and when world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
luſts are dead, the enmity of the world is ſlain,
it's temptations vanquiſhed, and from being your
Lord, it's henceforth become your ſervant: now

you may <hi>make your friends of the Mammon of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and when theſe fail, you ſhall be received into

            <p>1. <hi>Are you for the ſaving of your Souls?</hi> what are
you for? <hi>for Heaven or Hell?</hi> 'tis the ſame que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
as, are you <hi>for Heaven or Earth?</hi> ſpeak friends,
where would you that your lot ſhould fall? will
you be written in the earth, or amongſt the living
in <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> will you have <hi>your good things here,</hi> or
will you wait for them till hereafter? which do
you moſt regard, the joynt and eternal intereſt of
your bodies and Souls, or the ſingle and temporal
intereſt of your bodies? In a word, will you be
ſaved or damned?</p>
            <p>Do you ſo verily believe, a reſurrection from
the dead, and a judgment to come? that there is
another world? that this world ſhall vaniſh away,
and the other world ſhall abide for ever; that
there is an eternal ſtate of bleſſedneſs and miſery,
into one of which ſtates your Souls muſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
enter, as ſoon as they are looſened from this
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:153788:169"/>
body? that the future bleſſedneſs is unſpeakable,
that the future miſery is intollerable? Are you
Atheiſts or Infidels, or elſe do you ſo verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this, that it is the great aim and deſire of
your hearts, to obtain this bleſſedneſs, and to
eſcape thoſe torments?</p>
            <p>Deſcend into your hearts, conſider the choice
that's ſet before you, and come to a reſolution:
<hi>what do you chooſe?</hi> light or darkneſs? life or death?
eaſe or anguiſh? rejoycing or howling? lifting
up of the head or gnaſhing of teeth? eternal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
or eternal fire? <hi>With whom will you dwel?</hi> with
the Saints or with Serpents: with <hi>Michael</hi> or the
Dragon? in the joy of the Lord or in the terrours
of the Lord? <hi>What ſhall be your ſentence?</hi> Come
or depart? come ye bleſſed or depart ye curſed?
inherit the kingdom or away into the fire? what
ſay you? conſider and ſpeak, will you be damned,
or are you for the ſaving of your Souls? If you
ſay you are for ſalvation, then let me farther
ask you,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Is not the world an enemy to your ſalvation?</hi> Is
ſalvation poſſible without a victory over it?</p>
            <p>Is it not againſt the declared will and purpoſe of
God? <hi>Rom. 8. 30. Whom he did predeſtinate, them he
alſo called; whom he called, them he alſo juſtified;
whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified:</hi> who are the
juſtified and glorified? is it not, onely <hi>the called?</hi>
is there ever another man of the number? And
who are the called of God? is it all thoſe that are
<hi>bid to come?</hi> is he of them that <hi>makes light of it?</hi> that
ſaies, I cannot come: that ſaies, no Lord, I pray
thee call ſome other gueſts, and let me alone as I
am; to follow my oxen and my farm and my wife,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:153788:170"/>
I pray thee have me excuſed? is this one of the
called of God? If not, what hope of his ſalvation?
will God change his purpoſe and baulk his way, to
gratify thy carnal mind, and reconcile luſt and
eternal life?</p>
            <p>Is there not <hi>an inconſiſtency in the nature of the
things?</hi> to be ſaved, and left under the power of
the world, is to be ſaved, and yet left under the
power of the Devil? to be ſaved and yet left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified:
to be made free and yet left in bonds.
<hi>Doth it not enervate and reſiſt all the means of ſalvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doth not the <hi>world hinder the word,</hi> that that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
proſper with you? is not this it, the luſts and
love and cares of this life that <hi>choke the word that it
becomes unfruitful?</hi> Math. 13. 22. Hath not the
world hitherto dealt by you, as in the beginning of
this diſcourſe, I told you it would? <hi>darkned your
eye, that you could not ſee? deadned your ſenſe that you
could not fear? hung upon your hearts and about your
necks that you could not come to Chriſt?</hi> Have you
ſeen? have you feard? are you come to Chriſt?
or are you not yet in your ſins? why what is it
that hath hindred you, and kept you back from
Chriſt hitherto, but either the cares of this life,
or the deceitfulneſs of riches, or the pleaſures
and luſts of this preſent world?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doth not the world hinder prayer?</hi> hold you back
from going to God to ſeek your lives at his hands?
while you ſhould be with God <hi>to ſeek your lives,</hi> the
world calls you abroad <hi>to ſeek your livings:</hi> a little
praying muſt ſuffice a worldly heart; when the
tribes go up to pray before the Lord, how often is
the worldlings place empty? If I were to go in
ſearch for a worldlings heart, I would ſeek all the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:153788:170"/>
places of the earth firſt, ere I would ſeek him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the throne of grace: he is ſo ſeldom there,
that you may as well ſeek an idle ſhepherd in the
pulpit, as a worldly heart in the cloſet: O if
worldly men did no more diligently ſeek the
world, then they uſe to ſeek God, what poor men
would they be?</p>
            <p>Get you aſunder worldlings, let your Souls and
this harlot part, that Satan tempt you not for
your incontinence, that your prayers be not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred:
what praying whilſt the world is ſtill with
you? and what hope of ſalvation, whileſt no
praying?</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Is this enemy invincible?</hi> Is not victory over
it poſſible? is it not poſſible for thee to become
<hi>an enemy</hi> to this world? if thou art an enemy thou
art a conquerour. It's true thou haſt an hard field
to fight, and there's great hazard thou mayſt be
eternally loſt by it. It hath ſlain ſo many Souls, and
laid them up in everlaſting chains; there have been
ſo very few have eſcaped with their lives, that it's
a great queſtion, whether thy life may not alſo
go. Thou haſt been ſo long a captive, that it is
much to be doubted whether ever thou mayſt be
ſet at liberty. Thou beareſt ſuch a love to the
world, thou wilt ſo hardly be perſwaded, that 'tis
thine enemy, and art ſo apt to take it to be a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
friend then God is to thee; thou art ſo hardly
perſwaded, that he is a friend to thee, that doth
but tell thee, the world is an enemy, and art ſo
angry at any that offers to aſſiſt thee againſt it, or
but perſwades thee to take heed of it; thou art ſo
apt to take all the counſels, warnings, reproofs,
that are given thee, to put thee upon thy watch
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:153788:171"/>
againſt it, to be injuries, unkindneſſes; that it's
much to be feared, how it may go with thee.</p>
            <p>There have been ſo many charges made againſt
it without ſucceſs; the axe hath been ſo often
layd at the root of this tree; God hath been hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at it, conſcience hath been hewing at it, may
be, all thy life long; the word hath been fighting
againſt it, prayer hath been wreſtling with it, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
hath been conſidering about it; Thou
haſt been ſo often warned, <hi>Take heed and beware
of covetouſneſs; Love not the world, nor the things of
the world; mortify thy members which are upon the
earth; Flee youthful luſts; Get thee up from the tents
of theſe men, ſet not thine affections on the earth;</hi> Thou
haſt been ſo often told, <hi>That the faſhion of this world
paſſeth away; thoſe that will be rich fall into a ſnare;
the friendſhip of the world is enmity againſt God;</hi> and
after all this there is ſo little done; thy heart
is ſo much upon it ſtill, it holds to this day, ſo
ſtrong an hand over thee; thou art ſtill ſiding with
it and taking its part, againſt God and thine own
Soul; thou art ſo loath to hear, that 'tis a ſin to
be worldly minded, or to be convinced that thou
art a worldling; that I muſt tell thee, 'twill be
hard work for thee, to obtain the victory, and to
eſcape with thy Soul.</p>
            <p>Look to it, ſuch a diſeaſe which hath been ſo long
rooted in thy nature; ſuch an enemy that hath ſo
long lien in thy boſome, that thou wilt not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that 'tis thy diſeaſe, that 'tis thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
ſuch a diſeaſe will hardly be cured, ſuch an
enemy will hardly be conquered.</p>
            <p>But yet, is not a victory poſſible? Is this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
unto death, and is there no remedy? <hi>Is there
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:153788:171"/>
no balm in Gilead? is there no Phyſitian there?</hi> Is the
field loſt, and is there no recovery? who is it
that hath bid thee fight againſt this enemy? Is it
one that had a mind to mock thee? Look upon
the Captain of thy Salvation, hath not he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the world? Hath not he ſaid, <hi>Be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
look unto me, and be ſaved; come unto me, and
ye ſhall have reſt?</hi> Doth he not call to thee, <hi>Wilt
thou not be made clean; wilt thou not be made free:</hi> If
thou wilt thou mayſt, there lies all the difficulty,
that's all the doubt, whether thou wilt or no; as
hard as the victory is, if thou periſh by the world
at laſt, thy deſtruction will be laid at thine own
door; 'tis becauſe thou wilt not accept of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
<hi>if thou wilt thou mayſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Is not victory over this enemy deſirable?</hi> Is not
liberty deſirable? is not life deſirable? be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
and live, <hi>the world kills none but its friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would it not be well with you, if this ſpirit of
the world were caſt out, and God had given you
<hi>another ſpirit?</hi> would it not be a good exchange, if
for this carking, caring, anxious earthly greedy
heart, you had obtained a contented patient mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
ſpirit, an heavenly mind? would not the
matter be well mended with you, if for your
treaſure on earth, you could make God your
treaſure? could you not wiſh it were ſo?</p>
            <p>Can you ſay, <hi>I thank God I am yet a worldling?</hi>
I thank God my heart is ſtill below? I can mind
my pleaſures, and gains; I can ſatisfie my luſt,
and take my liberty, and follow my affairs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
troubling my ſelf about theſe higher matters
that I know not? Hitherto I thank God, this world
hath been too hard for the Goſpel; the devil hath
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:153788:172"/>
kept poſſeſſion, and hath kept Chriſt out? whileſt
others have puzled and amuſed themſelves with
their thoughts, and hopes, and fears about ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world, have made an adventure for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
riches, have been filling their heads, and
perplexing their hearts, with cares <hi>for hereafter,</hi>
and have neglected and ſtraitned themſelves here,
I thank God I have been no ſuch fool?</p>
            <p>While you may ſay, I thank God, [I have] an
eſtate in the world, I have friends in the world,
can you alſo ſay, I thank God this is my treaſure,
theſe are my delights? I can never trouble my
ſelf with thinking of, or ſerving any other God
but theſe, I can take theſe in exchange for my
ſoul? I thank God for that unrighteouſneſs, or
that unmercifulneſs, which he hath left me to, and
let me alone in, whereby I have gotten me an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
and preſerved it entire to me? it had been
worſe with me then 'tis, if I could not have ly'd
and defrauded; if I had made Conſcience of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,
of praying, and hearing, and ſpending ſo
much time this way as others do? I had been a
poor man had I taken this courſe, but I thank God
I was wiſer then ſo? Can you ſay thus?</p>
            <p>Chriſtians may, and will ſay, I thank God I am
crucified to the world, I thank God for Faith, and
Prayers, and Sabbaths, for a new heart, and a
new life; bleſſed be God that hath choſen me out
of this world, and called me by his grace; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be God for a part in Chriſt, and hope towards
God; bleſſed be the day, wherein my ſoul was
divorced from this world, and eſpouſed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Husband; I would not be in bondage to this
earth again, I would not be a fleſh pleaſer, a ſelf-ſeeker
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:153788:172"/>
again, if the devil would hire me with all
the Kingdomes of the world; there is not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
in the world but will ſay thus: But where is
the worldling that dares deliberately to ſay, I
thank God I am a worldling ſtill, God hath dealt
well with me, that he hath left me out, and let me
alone to follow mine own heart?</p>
            <p>Speak worldling, had it not been well for thee
if thou alſo hadſt been brought in to Chriſt? would
it not be well for thee, if yet thou mighteſt,
mighteſt ceaſe from this earth, and be a Candidate
for heaven, mighteſt ceaſe to be a drudge, and a
ſlave, and be delivered into the liberty of the
Sons of God? would it not be well with thee if
thou wert? would it not be well with thee if yet
thou mighteſt? doſt thou never wiſh, O that my
ſoul were in ſuch a caſe? why then wilt thou not,
in this thy day?</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Can this victory be bought too dear?</hi> There's
nothing in this world but may be over-bought:
An Army may be ſo weakned in the fight, that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
will not repair it; Crowns and Kingdomes
may be bought too dear; all the royalties and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of the world may be purchas'd at ſuch a
rate, that they may not be a ſaving bargain: But
can redemption from the world be over-bought?
will not the ſalvation of thy ſoul pay all thy char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges?
Its true, thy reſcuing from this enemy may
not be without much damage and loſs, <hi>not only of the
ſhip, and the lading, but of thy life:</hi> when thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quereſt
this enemy, thou wilt looſe a friend; in
thy conquering thou wilt purchaſe enmity; <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world hateth you:</hi> Thou wilt not only cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
thee <hi>enemies</hi> by thy Conqueſt, but <hi>wants, and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:153788:173"/>
ſtraits, and labours, and cares:</hi> when thou ceaſeſt to
be a ſervant to this world, think not to have an
eaſie idle life, thou wilt have more and harder
work then ever; the purſuing thine enemy that
he rally not again upon thee; the watching thine
heart, the guarding thine eye, the governing thine
appetite, that they run not again after it, the
pleaſing and following thy Lord in all things that
he commands thee; what day thou breakeſt with
the world, and joyneſt thy ſelf to the Lord, this
life of labour and care thou putteſt thy ſelf upon;
thou muſt no more thirſt after thy ſtoln waters,
nor taſte of thy forbidden pleaſures; thou muſt no
more traverſe thy moſt pleaſant ways, nor ſtick
at the moſt painful duties; nay, not thine eaſe
only, or thy pleaſure, but thy life alſo, and all
that thou haſt muſt go, when ever thy Lord calls
thee to it.</p>
            <p>What courſe ſhort of this, will either obtain,
or ſecure thee the victory? but how will ſuch a
life down with thee? how will thy ſpirit bear it?
when thy faint heart ſhrinks from it, when thy
proud or ſtubborn heart ſwells againſt it; when
thy old pleaſures and liberties, when thine old
friends and companions, when thy ſilver and thy
gold cry after thee, canſt thou leave us thus? can
thy ſoul part with us for ever? thou wilt then find
that this victory coſts thee dear.</p>
            <p>But is not thy ſoul more worth then all this?
wilt ſay, Better I were damn'd then ſav'd at ſuch
an hard rate; hell rather then this way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</p>
            <p>'Tis hard to be a Chriſtian, 'tis true; but bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be God my ſoul is eſcaped, my foot is gotten
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:153788:173"/>
out of the ſnare, liberty, liberty is brought to
this captive, and the opening of the priſon to the
bound; he whom I now ſerve, how hard ſoever
his work is, is no <hi>hard m<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſter,</hi> he gives good wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
were his work harder then 'tis, yet 'tis not
worthy to be laid in the balance with ſalvation: I
will not die for an eaſie life.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>What if this enemy ſhould reign till death?</hi> how
do you think your worldly life will look, when
you come to die? do you think you ſhall then ſay,
<hi>I have done well to be a worldling?</hi> it may be, if God
ſhould ask you <hi>now,</hi> doſt thou well to be covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
doſt thou well to be a ſelf-ſeeker? you
would anſwer him as <hi>Jonah</hi> did, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 9. when
God ask'd him, <hi>Doſt thou well to be angry?</hi> it may
be you would anſwer as he, yes, <hi>I do well to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,</hi>
I do well to be covetous, or proud, or ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
but do ye think you ſhall ſay thus at death?
ſhall you then think you ſay, I have done well, I
have done wiſely for my ſelf, I have coveted a
good covetouſneſs, 'tis well for me that I did not
hearken to theſe preachers, that I have lived in
pleaſure, that I have heaped up treaſure for theſe
laſt daies? if I were to begin the world again,
and were to live over my life the ſecond time, I
would take the ſame courſe I have taken; and I
could wiſh every friend I have in the world, every
companion I have, every child I have, to take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
by me, and to live as I have lived? would
you ſay thus? would you wiſh thus in that day?</p>
            <p>Sometimes we hear a dying Worldling to wiſh
all his friends, <hi>Take warning</hi> by me, O take heed as
you love your ſouls, that you ſpend not your daies
as I have done; but do you ever hear them ſay,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:153788:174"/>
               <hi>Take example from me,</hi> follow my ſteps; now I
find the comfort of my earthly-mindedneſs, now
I find the comfort of my luſts and pleaſures; O
that you might all have the comfort at your dying
day wherewith I am now comforted? when did
you hear of ſuch an inſtance?</p>
            <p>Speak worldling, let thy Conſcience ſpeak;
when death comes to arreſt thy ſoul, and to carry
it hence immediately before thy Judg, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thy ſentence according to what thou haſt
done in the body; is this the ſtate thou wouldſt be
found in? reeking in thy worldly luſts, ſoaked in
ſenſuality, eaten out of worldly cares, loaden with
worldly goods, and as empty of the knowledg and
grace of God, as thou art at this day? wouldſt thou
be content to ſay in reſpect of divine grace, as thou
muſt in reſpect of worldly goods, <hi>Naked I came into
this world, and naked I muſt go out of the world?</hi> would
you that death ſhould carry you thus before your
Judg? would you have that written on your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
when you come to ſtand before that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Tribunal, which was written on the Tomb of
that <hi>Edomite,</hi> Pſa. 52. 7. <hi>Lo this is the man, that took
not God for his ſtrength, but truſted in the abundance of
his riches, and ſtrengthened himſelf in his wickedneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do not your hearts tremble when ever you
give them leave to think of that day? do not the
fore-views of death, and thoſe anticipations of
Judgment you ſometimes feel in the Court of
Conſcience, uſe to ſhake you?</p>
            <p>But how will it be when it comes? when the
<hi>pale horſe</hi> comes to your door, and you are juſt
mounting for the other world; when your Judge,
whoſe eyes are as flames of fire, his feet as burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:153788:174"/>
braſs, with his ſharp two edged ſword in his mouth; when
your Judge ſhall be ſet on the bench, and your guilty Souls be
brought to the Bar? when he ſhall <hi>make inquiſition for bloud;</hi>
for the <hi>bloud of Chriſt,</hi> which hath been trampled under foot,
for the <hi>bloud of the poor,</hi> which hath been ſuck'd out of their
hearts; for the <hi>bloud of your Souls,</hi> which hath been ſold and
ſacrificed to luſt; when all your oaths and lyes, your frauds
and oppreſſions, your unrighteouſneſs and unmercifulneſs;
when your profaned ſabbaths, your neglected duties, your
waſted conſciences; when either <hi>the ruſt and the canker</hi> of
your riches, which you have wickedly gotten, or <hi>the waſt and
the aſhes</hi> of them, which you have as wickedly ſpent; when the
roul wherein all theſe things are written, ſhall be ſpred and
read before the Lord, and your Souls ſtruck dumb and ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
in his preſence; Judg Oh Judg what your thoughts will
then be of your preſent wayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly</hi> [will] <hi>you now become enemies to the world?</hi> Be
enemies and you are conquerours, will you <hi>deal</hi> with the world
as an enemy? will you fear it as an enemy? will you fly from
it, will you fight againſt it as an enemy? ſhall the Lord be
your God? ſhall the Lord be your friend? ſhall the Lord be
your treaſure? will you caſt away all your Idols and will you
come and be reconciled to God? what ſay you? will you be
crucified to this, and make an adventure for the other world?</p>
            <p>Now becavſe this is ſo great a queſtion, and ſuch as on the
anſwering thereof, the whole iſſue and ſucceſs of all that hath
been ſaid, depends, I ſhall give you the opportunity to pauſe
a while here, and deliberate upon it, ere you give in your
anſwer.</p>
            <p>Before you anſwer this queſtion, conſider yet farther,

                  <item>1. Doth not God call you off from the world?</item>
                  <item>2. What is there in your denyal?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. Doth not God call you off from the world? <hi>who is it that
ſaid,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 15. Love not the world nor the things of the
world? <hi>Conſider and compare theſe two Scriptures.</hi> 2 Cor.
5. 20. Now then we are Ambaſſadours for Chriſt, as though

the world is the enemy of God.</p>
            <p>What is the errand, upon which the Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
are ſent from the Lord unto you? I, it not to perſwade
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:153788:175"/>
you to be reconciled to God? the word which they preach, is
therefore called, <hi>the word of reconciliation</hi> Can you be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to God, whileſt you hold in with the world? Can any
thing be ſpoken plainer then this, <hi>He that will be a friend of
the world is the enemy of God?</hi> when we therefore warn you
be ye reconciled to God, do we not therein call you to make
war with the world? and doth not God himſelf call you by
us? warn you by us?</p>
            <p>But beſides the call of the word, do not both the <hi>goodneſs</hi>
and <hi>ſeverity</hi> of God call upon you?</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Doth not the goodneſs, the mercy and kindneſs of God
call upon you,</hi> Rom. 2. 4. <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and long ſuffering, and forbearance not knowing that
the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repentance?</hi> Rom. 12. 1, 2.
<hi>I beſeech you by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bodies
a living ſacrifice; holy acceptable to God, which is your reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
ſervice: and be ye not cenformed to this world.</hi> World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men mind worldly things, <hi>having their converſation in the
fl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh and of the mind;</hi> But
will you be conform to them? I beſeech you be not. I beſeech
you <hi>by the mercies of God,</hi> be ye not conformed to this world:
<hi>If there be any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love,
any fellowſhip of the ſpirit, if any bowels of mercies, be ye</hi>
otherwiſe <hi>minded.</hi> You profeſs that Chriſt is your conſolation,
that the love of God is your comfort, that the fellowſhip of
the Spirit is your rejoycing; Are there any ſuch things? Is
there any thing in them? then let theſe ſuffice you: will you
have your converſation, and take your portion, with thoſe who
are ſtrangers to Chriſt, and the comforts of his Spirit? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you by the mercies of God that you do not. Do you
hope for mercy? have you received mercy? do you live upon
mercy? hath mercy pitied you, ſpared you, pardoned you?
doth mercy feed you, cloath you, and comfort you, and will
you not hearken to its beſeechings?</p>
            <p>Why what doth mercy ſpeak? is this it's word, <hi>Continue in
ſin for grace hath abounded?</hi> now follow thy pleaſures, and thy
liberties; God is reconciled, thy ſins are forgiven, thy Soul is
ſecure; now thou mayſt ſlight the Lord, now thou mayſt
trample upon mercy, now thou haſt obtained it; is this the
leſſon that mercy teaches? or what doth it ſpeak? is not this
the voice of all the kindneſſes and compaſſions of the Lord,
come back from your vanities, come away from following
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:153788:175"/>
Idols, he ſacrifices to God, and proſtitute not your ſelves any
longer to the luſts of your fleſh? come away; for our ſakes
come; as you love mercy come, as you have received mercy
come, as you hope for mercy come. Is not this the voice of mercy,
and ſhall it not prevail? how ſhall mercy be heard when it
pleads for you, if it cannot be heard, when it pleads thus with
you? Is this the rate and price you put upon the grace of God,
that you will deny it, in thoſe little things it demands of you?
not a carnal pleaſure to be abated, not a vain companion to be
diſpleaſed, not a few handfuls of earth to be troden under foot,
for its ſake? Doth all the intereſt, that Chriſt and his grace
hath in you, come to no more then this?</p>
            <p>Brethren, where is ingenuity? is not goodneſs obliging?
will you ſhew what power mercy hath with you, how much you
can do, how much you can leave for love? you at leaſt, that
have obteined mercy, methinks your hearts ſhould be at your
mouth, ready to take their flight from this wilderneſs, to the
mountains of ſpices. Hath God given himſelf? hath God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me his Son, and granted me mercy unto life? now <hi>let him
take all;</hi> farmes and oxen, ſilver and gold, honours and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
let all go, and thou O my Soul become a ſacrifice to
the moſt high: my love where art thou, my deſires whither
run you? come back from theſe vanities, and get you up to
your God; mercy hath deſcended, let me aſcend with it, and
no longer dwell in the duſt.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Do not the ſeverities of God call you off?</hi> what mean the
Judgments of God, which he executes on the earth, but to
drive us up from our ciſterns to the fountain? what mean the
wormwood and the gall, but to wean us from theſe dugs?
wherefore are our diſappointments, vexations, diſtreſſes, but to
tell us, <hi>this is not your reſt?</hi> what ſpeak the winds and the
ſtorms, the flouds and the fires, the ſword and the famine, the
thief and the moth, but <hi>get you up, get you up out of this place?</hi>
of what uſe is the croſs but to crucifie? to crucifie us to the
world, and to crucify the world unto us?</p>
            <p>Brethren, have we not ſufficiently ſmarted for our folly?
what is it that makes us ſo many rods, and makes the laſhes of
them to cut ſo deep, but our unmortifiedneſs to this earth?
how eaſy would our croſſes lye were we dead to the world?</p>
            <p>That's the voice of the croſs, <hi>Be mortified, be crucified;</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the greater ſeverities of God: Be crucified or God will
crucifie you: Be crucified to the world or look to be crucified
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:153788:176"/>
by the world: Friends, would you have but one croſs in all
your lives? chooſe you whether you will have one or many;
get your earthly minds nayld to the croſs of Chriſt, and there's
an end of all your croſſes; every other croſs that comes, will
thenceforth be ſo eaſy, that it will even looſe its nature.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>What is there in your denyal to hearken to theſe calls of
God?</hi> Is there any thing leſs in it then this <hi>I will not be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to God!</hi> I chooſe rather that God be mine enemy, then
that the world be not my friend; I had rather have the worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
and the gall, then not the milk and the honey. God ſaies
<hi>give me thine heart,</hi> no he ſhall never have it, I have beſtowed
it on the world, and there let it go. God ſaies <hi>Take me for
thy portion,</hi> no I will not, let me have my portion in this life.
God ſaies <hi>take me for thy Lord,</hi> no I will not; I will not that
God ſhall reign over me. God ſaies, as thou hopeſt for mercy
hearken, as thou hopeſt for mercy ſubmit to me; refuſe at thy
peril; be a worldling at thy peril, be a ſenſualiſt at thy peril:
well <hi>at my peril</hi> be it, I will run the hazard of that; mercy
or no mercy, I cannot hearken to that word which is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to me.</p>
            <p>Is not all this comprehended in your denyal to come off
from the world? O tremble, and now at length come and
give in your anſwer.</p>
            <p>Are there any of you that will yet ſay to me as thoſe Jews,
<hi>Jer. 44. 16. The word which thou haſt ſpoken to us in the name
of the Lord we will not do?</hi> or as thoſe <hi>Jer. 2. 25. there is no
hope,</hi> as good hold thy peace, ſpeak no more to us about it, for
we will not hearken; <hi>we have loved ſtrangers and after them
we will go;</hi> we have loved our companions, and after them
we will go; <hi>There is no hope, but we will walk after our own
devices, we will walk after the imagination of our own evil
heart,</hi> Jer. 18. 12.</p>
            <p>Is there no hope indeed? would you henceforth be given
over as hopeleſs? would you that the Ambaſſadours of the Lord
keep ſilence, and for ever give you over as loſt men? ſhall
there be no more treaty with you about this thing? would you
that we ſhould preach no more to you, nor pray no more for
you, that you may be brought to a better mind?</p>
            <p>May there not be yet hope concerning you? may you not
yet be convinced? may you not yet be perſwaded?</p>
            <p>This once let me prevail with you; Oh might we hear ſuch
a word from you, We have done with all our Idols; to the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:153788:176"/>
Moles and to the Batts with them all: we have done with this
vain earthly life; no more ſuch madneſs to venture eternity
for minutes, to ſtake the everlaſting kingdom for pictures and
ſhadows. Come we will hearken to the Lord this day; hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
we have been written in the earth, henceforth for the
inviſible world: hitherto we have lived in pleaſures, we have
been ſowing to the fleſh, we have been labouring for the wind,
we have been laying up our treaſure on earth; we have been
gathering in dirt and throwing away Manna, we have fed upon
aſhes and trod upon pearls; our life hath been either a meer
play or a labour for bubles; Henceforth for ſubſtance, for the
durable riches, for the everlaſting pleaſures, for the bags that
wax not old, the treaſure in Heaven that faileth not.</p>
            <p>What ſay you brethren, ſhall this be your voice? will you
hearken to the Lord? at length give in your anſwer, will you
now become enemies to the world? will you indeed? ſhall
your Souls and it now be parted? <hi>Then go and draw up a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of divorcement, carry it before the Lord, and acknowledg it
as your act and deed;</hi> and giving your ſelves to him, go pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
and <hi>take your leave</hi> of all things under the Sun. Bid
farewell to thoſe that are with you in the houſe, farwel Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
farewel Child; farewel Husband, farewel Wife; Bid
farewel to all within doors and without; farewel Goods,
farewel Mony, farewel Sheep and Oxen, Lands and Livings;
farewel my pleaſant habitation, farewel my merry dayes and
eaſy nights; farewel my friends and dear acquaintance; fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
love friendſhip credit in the world, farewel liberty
and life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Go take your leave of all the world</hi> to day, <hi>ſtay not till to
morrow, leſt it again intangle you, and bewitch you into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mind; And this is the leave I would adviſe you to take
of all you have; Be able to ſay to them all,</hi> I am none of yours,
you are none of mine. I am none of yours, I have given my ſelf
to the Lord; you are none of mine, with my ſelf I have given
away you all: the Lord hath given you me, and to him I return
you, and ſhall not henceforth count you any thing to me, but what
you are to him. I have given him the <hi>right</hi> of you and when he
calls for it, I will give him poſſeſſion. I can enjoy you and I
can want you, I can be thankful for fruition and I can bear
your loſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with what I have I am content, if I have not, I will
be patient, whether I have or no, I am ſtill the ſame; and hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,
I will ſeek you as if I ſought you not, I will uſe you as if I
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:153788:177"/>
uſed you not; while you are with me I will rejoyce as if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
not, that I may weep as if I wept not when we muſt part,
and I muſt know you no more.</p>
            <p>Go thus and take your leave to day, or if you find it more
then one dayes work, as 'tis like you may, ſet to it every day,
let not your hearts be quiet till they and this world be thus
parted.</p>
            <p>And then ariſe, put on thy ſandals, and after thy crucified
Lord, Deny thy ſelf, take up thy croſs and follow him and
thou ſhalt have treaſure in Heaven.</p>
