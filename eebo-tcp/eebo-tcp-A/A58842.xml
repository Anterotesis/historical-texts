            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ON my Conſcience, this <hi>Poor Robin</hi> is
more troubleſome, than a <hi>ſilenc'd</hi> Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter;
the Town can never be at
<hi>Quiet</hi> for him, but he will ſtill be <hi>Holding-forth</hi>
his Pamphlets, and like a Man of Reformation,
<hi>Hinting</hi> his Uſes of Reproof; ſure he has got as
many <hi>Lives</hi> as a <hi>Cat,</hi> and like her too, is perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Mewing</hi> and <hi>Scratching.</hi> But could the bold
Fool think to ſtir a Waſps-neſt, and not ſting his
Fingers? or meddle with ſo terrible a Creature,
as he has repreſented a <hi>Scold,</hi> without expecting
ſome <hi>Billinſ-gate</hi> Repartees? How readily now
could I call the Pragmatical Villain, more <hi>Ill-names</hi>
than ever Puritan beſtow'd on the <hi>Pope,</hi> or one
<hi>Waterman</hi> upon another? deafen his <hi>Ears</hi> with a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55388:3"/>
Henbane Lurry, ſcratch out his <hi>Eyes,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath
his <hi>Guts</hi> to the uſe of a <hi>Country-Fidler.</hi>
But our Revenge ſhall be more <hi>Noble;</hi> and like
prudent <hi>States,</hi> we'll carry the War into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Country. We have obſerv'd how pleaſed
the <hi>Sots</hi> our Husbands were, with his late Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
how it tickled their ſpleens at every period!
<hi>That's right my Joan!</hi> quoth one, <hi>Exactly the

Looſers leave to ſpeak, <hi>we'll preſent it with

            <head>The Character of a
Bad Husband.</head>
            <p>A <hi>Bad Husband,</hi> is an inconſiderate piece of
<hi>Sottiſh</hi> Extravagance; for though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of ſeveral Ill-Ingredients, yet ſtill <hi>Good-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip,</hi>
is the <hi>Cauſa ſine quâ non,</hi> and gives him
the <hi>Ho-go:</hi> he is the <hi>Wiſe Mans</hi> ſcorn, the <hi>Shirks</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55388:3"/>
Exchequer, and the Wheadling Hoſteſſes <hi>Honeſt
Man;</hi> the <hi>Moth</hi> of an Eſtate, the <hi>Shipwrack</hi> of
a Family, or a Miſchief <hi>Three-ſtory high;</hi> for he
ſcandalizes his <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> ruines himſelf, and
<hi>ſtrangles</hi> the hopes of all his <hi>Poſterity.</hi> He throws
away his Wealth as heartily as young Heirs, or old
<hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and is ſo eager of a <hi>Jail,</hi> or a Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<hi>Wallet,</hi> that he will not wait Fortunes <hi>leiſure</hi>
to undo him, but rides Poſt to <hi>Beggars-Buſh,</hi> and
takes more <hi>pains</hi> to ſpend Money, than Day-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
to get it; whilſt ſtill his word is, <hi>Let's
not pinch whilſt we have it, ſince 'tis time enough
to want when we have it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He knows no difference between Prodigality
and Liberality, but is ſo fooliſhly free, that he
dries up the Springs of Bounty, by cutting down
the Banks, and letting the Streams run waſte; if he
pretend to Gentility, he thinks he can no way
make good that Ttile, but by paying (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he comes) the whole Reckoning; and every
Raſkal that can but cry, <hi>My Noble Maſter,</hi> is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of his <hi>Purſe;</hi> which <hi>Sucking Vermine</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
flutter about him as thick as <hi>Flies</hi> in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioners-ſhop.
If he go to Market, 'tis but to
purchaſe a Fox, and two days after returns, having
only truckt away his Corn for Drink, and put off
his Cattel to make himſelf a greater Beaſt.</p>
            <p>His firſt buſineſs after Marriage, is to pay Ale-houſe-<hi>ſcores</hi>
with his wives <hi>Portion;</hi> and his next,
to <hi>pawn her Clothes</hi> for ſupplies of freſh Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55388:4"/>
If he be a <hi>Citizen,</hi> he counts his Shop
a <hi>Priſon,</hi> till at laſt he is <hi>ſhopp'd</hi> in a Priſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
He pretends always extraordinary buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<hi>abroad,</hi> and muſt needs go to the <hi>Exchange,</hi>
when he has nothing to do there but change
<hi>Shillings</hi> into <hi>Sixpences,</hi> and reduce <hi>Guineys</hi> into
<hi>Farthings.</hi> He ſtill cries, 'tis too ſoon to go home
yet, and will trudge a mile about rather than
come near his own door, for fear he ſhould be
obliged to come in before his hour, which is Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
or paſt; for if he go home before, he ſays
he can never ſleep well. He is an <hi>Hogſhead</hi> ſet
on two <hi>ſtumps,</hi> fit for no uſe but to hold <hi>ſtrong
Drink;</hi> and if he be not at the <hi>Pot,</hi> is like a Fiſh
out of water, that does nothing but <hi>gape:</hi> He
thinks Nature gave him a Mouth not ſo much to
ſpeak, as to take off his Liquor; and his onely
enquiry is, <hi>Where dwells the beſt Sack and Claret?</hi>
He is a paſſionate lover of <hi>Mornings-draughts,</hi>
which he generally continues till Dinner-time;
a rigid exacter of <hi>Num-Groats,</hi> and Collector-general
for <hi>Foys</hi> and <hi>Beverage:</hi> He admires the
prudence of that Apothegm, <hi>Let's drink firſt,</hi>
and would rather ſell 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> to loſs, than
make a dry Bargain. You ſhall infallibly finde
him and his Tribe about the <hi>Fag-end</hi> of the day
at Rendezvouze, like a <hi>Conſtellation</hi> fixt in the
lower Region of a known Tavern, where their
<hi>Noſes</hi> appear like <hi>Comets</hi> that evermore portend
exceſſive <hi>drought:</hi> They go in upon Parole not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55388:4"/>
to exceed <hi>Three-pences;</hi> but ſeldome come out
under an Half-Crown-<hi>Club;</hi> and their Noiſe (for
Diſcourſe you cannot call it) is more nonſenſical
and impertinent than a She-Quakers Sermon, or
the tattles of an <hi>Vp-ſitting.</hi> Aſſoon as they are
accommodated with a private Room, an half
Pint, (for ſo they modeſtly begin) ſome clean
Pipes, and a Jordan, their firſt Argument is, the
goodneſs of the Wine, which being voted a
<hi>Flower,</hi> produces next a <hi>Bottle;</hi> and then <hi>News</hi>
is the ſubject of debate; or for want of that,
who was <hi>moſt drunk</hi> the night before, or reel'd
home with the greateſt <hi>gravity</hi> and decorum.
Though they live like Publicans, yet they imitate
<hi>Phariſees</hi> in their exactneſs of making clean the
<hi>inſide of the Glaſs;</hi> and their ſtricteſt Criticiſms
are, <hi>See it go round,</hi> and <hi>Take it off, Sir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this ſweet Society our truſty <hi>Trojan</hi> bears
his part till he has not diſcretion enough left to
know at which end to <hi>light his Pipe;</hi> then ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
away, (if he ſcape the <hi>Compter</hi>) 'tis for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to one but he meets with ſome little <hi>Town-baggage,</hi>
who picks his Pocket, and in requital
beſtows upon him a ſwinging <hi>Clap.</hi> In the mean
time the good Woman at home ſits lamenting till
twelve at night over a piece of mouldy Bread,
and a draught of <hi>Rot-gut;</hi> and the Children are
fain to go to bed without a <hi>Supper,</hi> becauſe the
vile <hi>Milkwoman</hi> is grown <hi>faithleſs:</hi> At laſt, when
her pretious Huſband comes with a breath that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55388:5"/>
ſtinks with Canary and <hi>Tobacco,</hi> worſe than Hell of
Brimſtone; he perhaps picks a cauſeleſs quarrel,
gives her a Remembrance with a Bed-ſtaff, that
ſhe is forc'd to wear the <hi>Northumberland Arms</hi> a
week after; which the good-natur'd Soul muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
by pretending an unlucky fall, or blaming an
innocent <hi>Door-latch</hi> for the injury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But put caſe he
go peaceably to Bed, what comfort is to be expected
from ſuch a Swine? Were not a Woman better be
Married to a <hi>Man-Drake,</hi> or take a <hi>Broom-ſtaff</hi>
for a Bed-fellow? yet this, forſooth, is our wit-leſs
<hi>Head,</hi> this the <hi>Tool</hi> we muſt <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Obey,</hi>
this the <hi>ſage and mighty</hi> Animal that Triumphs
over us, as the <hi>weaker</hi> Veſſels; that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all theſe Extravagancies of his own, reads
Lectures to us of <hi>Good-houſwifry,</hi> and after he has
fool'd away ſeveral Guineys abroad, worſe than
if he had made Ducks and Drakes with them,
comes home, and complains of the deſtruction of
a <hi>Candles end,</hi> for want of a Save-all, and rails
at his Wives <hi>Improvidence,</hi> for not managing
more thriftily the Income of the <hi>Kitching-ſtuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since this is our Condition, Gentlemen, and
that the beſt Arms Nature affords us are our
Tongues, I ſee no reaſon, why in ſo juſt a cauſe,
we ſhould not make uſe of them. This only we
beg, reſtrain theſe <hi>Extravagants,</hi> or infringe not
our Antient <hi>Liberties;</hi> either inlarge your <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lams,</hi>
