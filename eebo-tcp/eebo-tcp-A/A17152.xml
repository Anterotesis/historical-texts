            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR AS MVCH AS OF our selues we are desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all good thinges, and vtterly voyde of all necessarie helpes to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: the Lorde our GOD of his owne free mercy and goodnes, offereth himselfe to vs in Christ, and in him he giueth vnto vs, in the steede of our miserie, all felicitie, in the steede of our pouertie, the vnspeakeable ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his grace: he openeth vnto vs in him the treasures of heauen, that our Faith might wholy beholde him, and our Hope be fully fixed vppon him. In whome it hath pleased him that the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lnesse of his grace shoulde dwell, that from thence we might all drawe (as out of a most plentifull founteine) the waters of eternall life. This secrete and great miserie is reueiled to such onely, whose eyes the Lorde hath opened, to see light in his light. Therefore since we are taught by Faith that whatsoeuer wee haue neede of and is wanting in vs, the same is laid vp with God for vs in Christ: it remaineth that we seeke it in him, and with Prayer craue it of him. The Apostle therefore,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> to shewe that true faith cannot be separate from the inuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7408:11"/>
of Gods holy name, hath set this order, that as faith commeth by the Gospell, so by the same faith our heartes are stirred vp to call vpon the name of God: and therefore he saith, that the spirite of adoption, which sealeth in our hearts the witnesse of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, raiseth vp our spirites that they dare with boldnesse shewe foorth their desires: it stirreth vp in vs vnspeakable groninges, and causeth vs to crie with confidence: <hi>Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> By the benifite of prayer therefore wee attaine to those riches which God hath laide vp in store for vs: for thereby we haue fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar accesse to God, and boldlie entering into the sanctuarie of heauen, we put him in mind of his promises: so that nowe by experience we feele and finde that to be true in deede, which by the worde we did before but onely beleeue: nowe we inioy those treasures by prayer, which by faith wee did before but onely beholde in the Gospell of our Lorde Iesus.</p>
            <p>Nowe how necessarie and profitable this exercise of prayer is, it appeareth, in that the Lorde himselfe witnesseth our whole saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to consist in the calling vppon his name, whereby he is wholie present, with vs: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his prouidence and fatherly care by the which he watcheth ouer vs: by his power,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7408:11"/>
by the which he susteineth and succoureth our weakenesse, being euerie moment ready to perish: and by his goodnesse &amp; mercie, by the which he receiueth vs into fauour, being miserablie loade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; pressed downe with sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And hereby groweth singular rest and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to our conscience. For when wee haue disclosed to him our necessitie, herein wee finde most ioyfull and perfect quietnesse, that none of our euils are hidden from him, whom we are persuaded to be both most willing &amp; also most able to helpe vs.</p>
            <p>Now that our prayer may be made in such wise as it ought to be, firste we must see that we be in hearte and minde no otherwise pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, then becommeth those that enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to talke with God, as we are taught. Eccle. 18. <hi>Before thou pray, prepare thy selfe, and be not as one that tempteth God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We must consider therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we pray, in whose presence we stand, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we speak, and what we desire. We stand in the presence of the almightie creator of heauen &amp; earth, and all thinges therein conteined: to whose eternall maiestie innumerable thousandes of Angels doe assist, se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue and obey We speake vnto him, who knoweth the secretes of our hearts: before whom nothing is more odious then hypocrisie, and dissimulation. We aske
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7408:12"/>
those things which be most to his glorie and the comfort of our consciences. We must therefore diligen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly endeuour our selues to remoue all such thinges as may offende his diuine maiestie. And first, that we be free from al worldly cares &amp; fleshly cogitations, whereby our mindes are caried hither and thither, &amp; being drawne out of heauen, and from the pure beholding of God, are pressed downe to the earth.</p>
            <p>And here let vs call to minde how vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently we abuse the great goodnes of God, calling vs into familiar talke with him, when we haue not that reuerent feare of his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred maiestie, that we woulde haue of an earthly creature or a worldly Prince: but suffering our heartes to be caried away with wandering thoughts and worldly imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are otherwise occupied, and forsake him in the mids of our prayer.</p>
            <p>As God is a spirite, so he will be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in spirit and truth: that is, in the inward affections of the heart, &amp; with a true, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnfeined kind of worship. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as at all other times he requireth the heart: so specially in the time of prayer, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we shew our selues in his presence, &amp; enter into communication with him: &amp; therevpon when he promiseth to heare all those that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7408:12"/>
cal vpon him, he maketh a restreint &amp; saith: that call vpon him in truth. Seing therefore the chiefe dutie of prayer consisteth in the heart, we must with our whole heart poure out our prayers vnto God the searcher of hearts, &amp; with a sincere, vnfained, &amp; ardent affection &amp; opening of our heart before God call vpon him, or else we shall not find him.</p>
            <p>Let vs know therefore, that none prepare themselues rightly to prayer, but such as haue a reuerende feare of Gods maiestie, which they cannot haue that come not to it vnburthened of earthly cares &amp; affections. And thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is it that is ment in the Scriptures by the lifting vp of handes, that we should remember our selues to be farre off from God, vnlesse we lift vp our heartes &amp; mindes also on high. An therefore it is saide in the Psalme:<note place="margin">Psal. 25.</note> 
               <hi>To thee haue I lift vp my soule.</hi> The Scripture vseth also this manner of speach, <hi>To lift vp prayer</hi>: that they which desire to be heard of God, shold not haue their minds caried away with earthly cogitations &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. And though it be hard to be so bent to prayer, but that we shall finde that many bie thoughtes will creepe vpon vs to hinder our prayer: yet the more harde it is, the more earnestly wee must wrastle to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all lets and hinderances, &amp; labour with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7408:13"/>
inwarde groninges vnto the Lorde,<note place="margin">Psal. 86.</note> that he will linke our heartes fast vnto him, and not suffer vs to beledde away from him, by the vayne suggestions of Sathan, who at al times compassing vs about, is neuer more busie, then when we addresse our selues to prayer, secretly and subtilly creeping into our brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes and calling vs backe from God, so that oftentimes, when wee with all reuerence should speake to God, we find our harts, tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the vanities of the world, or with the foolish imaginations of our owne hearts.</p>
            <p>Finally we must be in christian charity, loue, and concorde with all men, seeking vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hearty, and brotherly reconciliation, if we haue offended any man, before we enter into prayer, or else God will not heare our prayers: yea they are otherwise execrable, &amp; full of damnable hypocrisie in Gods sighte. And this that is spoken of prayer, may be said also of hearing of Gods word, or any other seruice of God.</p>
            <p>We must therefore laye aside all malice, enuie, wrath, grudge, contention, wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, dissimulation, all guilefull, craftie, and subtile dealing, and with a single hearte doe to other, as we woulde they shoulde doe to vs,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> Peter willeth, that such as haue once tasted howe good and bounteous the Lorde
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7408:13"/>
is, and are become new creatures by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly regeneration, through the doctrine of the Gospell, shoulde like holy and innocent babes, lay aside all such workes of the flesh, which doe depriue a man of the kingedome of God.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> And S. Paul commaundeth vs, that <hi>laying aside those cursed vvorkes of darknesse, vve shoulde in the stead thereof, put on (euen as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God, holy and beloued) tender mercie, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, humblenesse of minde, meekenesse, long suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, forbearing one another, &amp; forgiuing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if any haue a quarell to another, as Christ for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue vs: and aboue all these things,</hi> (saith he) <hi>put on loue vvhich is the bonde of perfection, and let the peace of God rule in your heartes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 11.</note> 
               <hi>VVhen ye shall stande and pray</hi> (saith S.

               <note place="margin">Psal. 41. Psal. 38.</note>

               </gap> anguish and sorrowe, stirreth vp in Gods children a feruent desire to obtaine comfort, helpe, and succour at Gods hand, and therefore such as feele themselues op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with great calamities, hauing by the helpe of man no hope of deliueraunce, doe crye vnto God with afflicted heartes, as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid did in his distresse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>This is that godly sorrowe which S. Paul saith, worketh in Gods children repentance to saluation.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. Psal. 34.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord is nigh to them,</hi> saith Dauid, <hi>that are of a con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>euen vnto him (saith the Lord) that is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and broken hearted, and trembleth at my vvordes.</hi> Therefore Dauid calleth the time of trouble, the fit and conuenient time for the faithfull to fly vnto God by prayer. And albeit they bee not at all times in like distresse, or continually groaning vnder the

burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of present euils: yet must thei needs be euer in dread of new daungers, and carefully afraide of further troubles to followe. As trouble and feare therefore are the verie spurs to stir them vp to heartie and feruent prayer: so by occasion thereof, they haue more free accesse vnto God, as though he did thereby call them vnto him.</p>
            <p>This godly sorrowe for sinne, and feruent desire and longing for Gods louing mercie and fauour, commeth not of our selues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of the speciall goodnesse of God: for we are of our selues dull &amp; without all lust to pray: yea, so great is our imperfection, that wee know not how to pray as we ought, and therefore the spirite helpeth our infirmitie, instructeth vs what is right, and guideth our affections. <hi>He maketh intercession for the Saints</hi> (saith S. Paul) <hi>according to the vvill of God, and that vvith sighes and groninges vvhich cannot be expressed:</hi> that is, he stir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now although we knowe that it is the onely worke of the holy Ghost, thus to moue and incline our hearts to prayer, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7408:15"/>
we may not be negligent &amp; sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to dispose and stirre vp our selues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, but rather contrariewise, so often as we feele our selues, colde and not disposed to prayer as we ought to be, we must make our supplication vnto the Lorde, that it woulde please him to inflame vs with his holy spirit, whereby wee maye be framed to pray with such feruencie of minde, as we ought to doe.</p>

            <p>And although the Lord knoweth before we aske what we haue need of, &amp; is ready to giue liberally, yea and doth giue often times vndesired: and furthermore hath promised, that seeking first the kingdome of God &amp; the righteousnes thereof, all other things should be giuen vs: yet he commaundeth vs to aske corporall benefits, &amp; that for three causes.</p>
            <list>

               <item>SECONDLY, that we should be well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded of his good prouidence towardes vs,<note place="margin">Iosu. 1.</note> when wee vnderstand that he doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promise that he will neuer faile vs, but also hath his hand alwaies stretched out to helpe them that cal vpon him.</item>

            </list>
            <p>And herein we must specially &amp; aboue all things seeke the glory of God, &amp; therefore we must pray for these corporall thinges in such sort, that we may offer therwith our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience vnto God.

that it is the lotte of Gods children to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way vnder the crosse, and therefore concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning these corporall benefites, we knowe not how, or what to aske as we ought: wee must herein offer our obedience vnto GOD, abiding his good will and pleasure so longe as it shall seeme good vnto him to exercise vs in the want therof, who suffereth vs som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to be afflicted for our chastisement, and for the probation of our continuance, and also that we may receiue with greater glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (if to his diuine wisedome it seeme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for vs) that which with ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire we long looked for.<note place="margin">1.

(whereof the scripture is full) or of our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues (whereof we haue experience) are exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Gods promises.

            <p>But for as much as of our selues we are vnworthie to appeare in Gods sight, whose terrible maiestie comming once into our minde, it is impossible, but that we shoulde flie from him as a fearefull iudge: therefore he hath giuen vnto vs a mediatour, euen our Lorde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Of prayer there be two partes, Petition, and thankesgiuing. By petition wee poure foorth our desires before God, requiring first those thinges that may set foorth his glorie, and then such benefites as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and necessarie for vs. By giuing of thankes, we prayse and magnifie his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits bestowed vpon vs, acknowledging that whatsoeuer good thinges we enioie, we haue receiued them of his free goodnes and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie. Therefore Dauid ioyneth these two partes togither in one verse, when he saith: <hi>Call vpon me in the day of necessitie:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 5</note> 
               <hi>I vvill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer thee, and thou shalte glorifie me</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The scripture commaundeth vs to vse both, and that continually. For our necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is so great, our life is so full of troubles and calamities, and so many daungers hange ouer our heades euery moment, that wee haue all cause ynough, yea euen the most holy with sighes and groninges continually
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7408:24"/>
to flye vnto God, and to call vppon him in most humble wise. But this wee may better perceiue in things pertaining to the soule.</p>
            <p>For when shall so many great sinnes, whereof wee know our selues guiltie, suffer vs to bee without care and not to craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of GOD for the same? when will sathan giue vs reast and quietnes? when wil he cease to range about, seeking whome he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy? when shall our tentations giue vs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truce, so that we shall not need to hasten vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD for helpe? Finally, the desier of the kingdome and glory of God ought so to drawe vs wholy vnto it, not by fits, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, that all times should be fit &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for vs to pray. Wherefore, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause we are so often commaunded to pray continually. And though we be not driuen with like necessitie at al times to pray, yet in this case S. Iames teacheth vs what we ought to doe. <hi>Is anie man heauie or afflicted,</hi> saith he? <hi>Let him pray,</hi> that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, let him craue of God helpe and comfort: <hi>&amp; vvho so is merry, let him sing,</hi> that is, let him praise God.</p>
            <p>Moreouer the benefites and blessings of God, are large and plentifull towards vs, which way so euer we turne vs, that we can neuer want matter and occasion of prayse and thankesgiuing. And seeing wee ought
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7408:24"/>
to acknowledge God to be the authour and giuer of all good thinges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we should alway receiue the same at his hand with thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for to that end God continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth his good blessings and benefites v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, that we should continually shewe foorth his prayse, and be thankfull vnto him for the same, and so we render v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>o him his due honour. And S. Paul, when he saith, that they are sanctified by the worde and prayer, signifieth, that to vs they are not holy and cleane without the word and prayer; and therefore Dauid saith, when he had felt the liberalitie of the Lorde, that there was put into his mouth a newe song<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, a newe occasion of prayse and thankesgiuing. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he signifieth, that it is a wicked silence, if we passe ouer any of Gods benefites with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out praise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seing that as of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m. We shoulde therefore continually, that is, as much as is possible, at all times, in all places, and in all thinges, as occasions are continually offered vnto vs, lift vp our prayer vnto God in crauing helpe at his hand, and confessing his praise, whereby we may both obteine of him all good thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of vs, Christ himselfe teacheth vs by the parable of the three loaues, and of the widowe,<note place="margin">Lu. 11.18</note> and wicked Iudge: wherebie wee are taught to continue in prayer, with all earnestnesse and feruent supplication, and neuer to faint or giue ouer, vntill we be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured in our spirit, that our prayer is heard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The prayer of the humble,</hi> (saith the sonne of Sirach) <hi>goeth through the cloudes:</hi>

                  </gap>ce of my vveeping, the Lorde hath hearde my humble petition, the Lord hath receiued my prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe, concerning the forme and manner of praying, leaste wee shoulde followe our owne fantasie, being of our selues so blinde that we knowe not how to pray, or what is meete and expedient for vs, the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath sufficiently instructed vs: Who as he hath taught vs, throughout the whole scripture, how and for what thinges wee
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7408:25"/>
ought to pray: so hath hee set foorth one manner of prayer, in the which hee hath briefly comprehended all such thinges as wee ought, yea or in any wise may aske of God. Wherein hee hath expressed what is due, pleasing and acceptable to him, what is necessarie for vs, and what hee will graunt: so that there is nothing herein omitted, that might be thought vppon, to the prayse and glory of GOD, or come into the minde of man for his profit and commoditie. And this is that prayer that our Lorde Iesus Christ taught his Disciples:<note place="margin">Matth. 9. Luke. 11.</note> when they asked of him how they should pray.</p>
            <p>Whosoeuer therefore shal aske any thing that is not contained in this prayer, they presume to adde some thing of their owne to the wisedome of God, they are not obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his will: and they pray without faith, hauing no worde of God to warrante them, and therefore they shall obtaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. This praier, saith Tertullian, is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the wisedome of God, wherein hee hath taught whatsoeuer hee willed, &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led whatsoeuer was needefull. Albeit we are not so bound to this forme of prayer, that we should not vse any other kinde of words then the Lorde himselfe herein hath vsed. For there are elsewhere set forth in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7408:26"/>
many prayers farre differing from this in wordes, and yet written by the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and verie profitable to be vsed of vs. And many prayers also are continually vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered of the faythfull by the same spirite, which varie from the same in wordes. But this is required of vs, that none should looke for, seeke, or aske any other thing at all, then that which is brieflie comprehended in this praye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and which, though it differ in wordes, yet differeth not in sense and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: like as it is certaine that all the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which are founde in the scriptures, and which do continually proceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the harts of the faithfull, are referred by the direction of Gods spirite vnto this prayer, howsoeuer they differ in the varietie of words.</p>
            <p>Many good and godly men, euen in our dayes well exercised in prayer, haue left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs most worthie examples and testimonies hereof, furnished with ample and large mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to forme holy and true prayer, and full of power to inflame the hearte to a feruent inuocation of Gods holy name: whereof we haue giuen here some taste vnto the godly, and especially to the simple, not yet well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised.</p>

they are inflamed with continuall prayers and desires, that thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome might come euery where, and thy goodnesse might be both kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, and in life expressed of euery man.</p>
            <p>And bicause there are innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble many things, which as well in them selues, as in others, be against thy glorie, they are kindled with continuall prayer and desire, sighing vnspeakably in thy sight, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of thy spirit.

            <p>But bicause they knowe, that thou doest rule all thinges after thy good will, and that none other can helpe them in their need, they often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do goe aside, all businesse laide

which thy sonne Iesus Christe our Lord commanded to be made to thee in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chamber, the doore being shut.

This standeth in the affections of the heart, not in words and in the mouth. As thy children be endued with thy spirite, so frequent they this talke with thee.

            <p>Fiftly, they vse examples, howe that thou which art the God of all, and rich vnto all them that call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee in Christes name, hast heard and holpen others calling vpon thee.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, they vse the benefits gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them before they asked, thereby not onely prouoking them to aske more, but also certifying their faith, that if thou wast so good to graunt them many things vnasked, nowe thou wilt not denye them any thing they aske, to thy glorie and their weale.</p>
            <p>Last of all, they vse the reading and waying of Psalmes and other good prayers, bicause they knowe that thereby peculiarly, besides the other Scriptures, there is no small helpe: as may appeare by Paule, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7408:29"/>
5. Col. 3. where he willeth the congregation to vse Psalmes, hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and spirituall songes, but so, that in the heart we would sing and say them. Not that thy children doe not vse their tongues and wordes in praying to thee: for they doe vse their tongues, speach, and wordes, to stirre vp their inward desire and feruencie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde, ful wel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that else it were a plaine mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thee, to pray with lippes and tongues onely. Oh that I might feele nowe thy spirite so to affect me, that both with heart and mouth, I might heartily and in faith pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the things that are to be prayed for, thy children know, that the prayer taught by thy sonne, most liuely and plainely doth containe the same, and therfore they often vse it, first asking of thee their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7408:30"/>
heauenly father, through Christ, that thy name might euery where be had in holinesse and praise: then, that thy kingdome by regeneration and the ministerie of the gospel might come: &amp; so thirdly, that willingly, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and perpetually, they might stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to doe, yea doe in deede, thy will with thy holie and heauenly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and spirits. These things they seeke and pray for, namely thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and thy righteousnesse, before and worldly benefite.</p>
            <p>After which petitions, bicause all things, yea euen the benefits of this present life doe come from thee, they doe godly desire the same vnder the name of daily breade, being instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of thy wisedome, that after spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall benefites to aske corporall, is not vnséemely vnto thy children, which know both spiritual and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall to come from thy mercie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:7408:30"/>In the other petitions they pray for thinges to be taken from them, beginning with forgiuenesse of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: which were impudently prayed for, if that their heartes were not so broken, that they could forgiue all things to al men for their part. They adde their profession, that is, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whereby they professe, that they haue forgiuen all offences done to them.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, bicause it is not inough to haue pardon of that which is past, except they be preserued from newe offences, they pray thee, not to leade them into temptation, by permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to the peruerse suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sathan, but rather to deliuer them from his importunitie and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: vnderstanding Sathan the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of all euill. Oh (deare God) that thou wouldest endue me with thy spirite of grace and prayer with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7408:31"/>
thy children accordingly, to make this prayer alwaies when so euer I doe pray.</p>
            <p>As for outward euills, so long as they do not (as it were) inforce thy people to sinne, in that christian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection doth account them amongest thy benefites: thy Sonne hath not taught thy Church to pray for the taking away of them in this praier: for here he hath contained but those things, for the which all Christians generally and particularly may of faith pray at all times.</p>
            <p>It often commeth to passe, that exteriour euils, bicause they be not euils in deede, that is, they be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods grace in vs, therefore they cannot of faith be prayed for, to be taken away: for thy children that haue faith, doe alwayes preferre thy iudgement, before their owne. The which iudgement, when they know
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7408:31"/>
by that which hapneth to them, they submit them selues thereto wholy: although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirit make his vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gronings to helpe their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by prayer, not to haue them ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, but that they might haue strength and patience to beare the burden accordingly. Which burden, if it be too heauie in the better sense and feeling therof, they in their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers doe complaine something, rather then pray to haue it taken away, as our Sauiour did in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> garden, when he added to his complaint: <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So do thy people in al their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes adde, <hi>Not as we will, but as thou wilt:</hi> for they are taught by thy spirite, no otherwise to pray for the taking away of corporall euils, either from them selues, or from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, vnlesse they by the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite doe certainely see the same to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7408:32"/>
make to thy glorie: as did thine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and seruants, when abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and without condition they did aske health or miracle for any, when they healed or raised the deade by prayer: for they knewe, nothing can be better then when it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy will. Oh that I might alwaies know thy wil in al things, and for euer apply my selfe thereto.</p>
            <p>Hereof it commeth that thy saints and deare children, which loue their neighbours as them selues, doe yet notwithstanding, in their prayers aske vengeance of some (as we may reade in the Psalmes of Dauid) bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in praying and talking with thee, they see by thy holy spirite (for without it is no true prayer) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thy iudgements vpon some, which they perceiue to sin to death, and therefore ought not to be prayed for: bicause thy glorie can not be set
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7408:32"/>
foorth as it should be, without their destruction.</p>
            <p>Thy wil is alwayes best, and the thing whereto they frame all their desires. Therefore, when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that it is decreed with thee, such and such by their destruction to set foorth more mightily thy glorie, how should they but desire and pray for the same, and write it as <hi>Dauid</hi> hath done, that the godly in reading and waying such prayers, might receiue comfort, and the vngodly be afraide: else, when that they perceiue not so manifestly the determined iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, they in their prayers doe most heartily pray for them, as Samuel did for Saule, Moses for the Israelites, and Abraham for the Sodomites, Oh good father, for thy mercies sake, giue me the true loue of mankinde, but yet so, that I may loue man for thee, and in thee, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7408:33"/>
alwayes preferre thy glorie aboue all thinges, through Christe our Lorde.</p>
            <p>Nowe though thy children doe knowe that thy will can not but be done, and nothing can be done, but that thou of thine owne wil hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to doe, although no man should desire the same, yet are they earnest and frequent in prayer: first to render obedience to thee, which requirest prayer as a spirituall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to thee: secondly, bicause thou hast ordained prayer to be as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument and meane, by the which thou workest thinges with thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie decreed and determined.</p>
            <p>Thy children do vse prayer to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thee their seruice, if it shall please thee to vse the same: and as they doe eate and drinke, which is a meane ordained of thee for the conseruation of their life, not looking hereby to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7408:33"/>
lengthen their dayes aboue their boundes, which alreadie thou hast appointed, but as becommeth them, to vse thy meanes, which thou hast ordained to serue thy prouidence: so doe they (as men herein not curious to knowe thy prouidence further then thou reuealest it) vse prayer as a meane by the which thou art accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to worke many of thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens desire, that according to thy good will, thou mayest vse the same.</p>
            <p>They do not thinke a mutabilitie in thee (for thou art GOD, and art not chaunged, with thee there is no variablenesse,) and therefore they pray, not as men which would haue thy determinations and ordinances, (which are in most wisedome, and mercie) to be altered, but rather that they might submit their willes to thine, and make them more able to heare thy will and pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:7408:34"/>They knowe thou hast promised to helpe them calling vpon thee: wherefore they dout not, but so thou wilt doe, and therefore pray accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>They loue thee hartily, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can not but desire much to talke with thee, that is, to pray: euen as a well manered and louing wife will not take vpon her to aske any thing of her husband at all, but that she hopeth he will take in good part, &amp; doe of his owne freewill, although she had spoken nothing thereof.</p>
            <p>When she knoweth what her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands will is in things, she gladly talketh with him thereof, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as she seeth he is disposed to do, she will often desire him to do it. Euen so thy children (I say) which hartily loue thee, in that they knowe thy wisedome and will is best, howe can they but often talke with thee,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7408:34"/>
and desire thee to doe that which they know is best, which they know also thou wouldest do, if none shuld aske or pray for the same?</p>
            <p>Thy children vse prayer, as a meane, by the which they see plainly thy power, thy presence, thy proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, mercie and goodnes towards them, in graunting their petitions, and by prayer they are confirmed of them all. Yea thy children vse pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to admonish them, howe that all things are in thy handes. In prayer they are (as it were) of thee put in minde of those thinges which they haue done against thee, their good Lorde. By reason whereof repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ueth, and they conceiue a purpose to liue more purely euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes, and more heartily to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie them selues to al innocencie and goodnesse.</p>
            <p>Who nowe considering so many
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7408:35"/>
great commodities to come by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of prayer, would maruell, why thy children are much in prayer, and in laboring to prouoke others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto? For as none that is a suter to any other, will vse any thing which might offend or hinder his sute: so no man that vseth prayer, wil flatter him selfe in any thing that should displease thee, to whom by prayer he moueth sute, whensoeuer he praieth: so that nothing is a more prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all kinde of godlinesse then prayer is.</p>
            <p>As concerning outward thinges which thy childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pray for, although they know thy wil and decree is not variable, &amp; thy purpose must needes come to passe, yet do they receiue by their prayer no small commoditie. For, either they obtaine their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questes or not. If they doe obtaine them, then proue they by experience
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7408:35"/>
that thou doest the will of them that feare thee, and so they are more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to loue and serue thee. And in deed for this purpose thou art wont, when thou wilt doe good to any, to stirre vp their mindes to desire the same good of thee, to the ende that both thou and thy giftes may be so much the more magnified and set by of them, by howe much they haue bene earnest suters and petitioners for the same. For howe can it but inflame them with loue towardes thee, to perceiue and feele thee so to care for them, heare them, and loue them?</p>
            <p>If they doe not obtaine that they pray fort, yet vndoubtedly they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue great comfort, to see that the euils which presse them, and wherof they complaine still, doe not oppresse and ouercome them, and therefore they receiue strength to beare the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7408:36"/>
same the better. O good father helpe me, that I might heartily loue thee, complaine to thee in all my needes, and alwayes by prayer to poure out my heart before thee. Amen.</p>

the diuell him selfe: and therefore thy children pray to be deliuered from euill, vnderstanding thereby Sathan him selfe, the sower and supporter of all euill. And this thy children do as wel for others, as for them selues.

               <p>Againe, I may learne here, that to auoyde all daungers and euils, is not in the power of man, but onely

thy worke. By reason whereof, I should consider thy great goodnesse, which hitherto hast kept me from so many euils both of soule and bodie, yea of name, goods, &amp;c, as thou hast done in my infansie, childhood, youth, middle age, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I may learne here that I should be carefull for others, both that they might be deliuered from their euils, and that they might be preserued from temptation, &amp; from being ouercome in the same, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou teachest me not to pray, <hi>Deliuer me from euill</hi> simply, but, <hi>deliuer vs from euill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Last of al, I am taught hereby to see thy goodnesse towardes me, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che wilt deliuer me from euill, and from being ouercome in tentations: for thou wouldest not haue me aske for that which I should not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looke for at thy handes.

whereof thou wouldest haue me to be in a certaintie of my saluation for euer.

               <p>THat there is an euerlasting life none will denie, but such as wil denie God. For if he be true and iust, (which he must needes be, or els he is not God) then can there not be but an eternall life. That he hath both spoken it, and promised it, in Mat. 25. 1. Cor. 15. Heb. 4.11.13. 1. Pet. 1. it plainely appeareth &amp; else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in very many places. So that to deny an euerlasting life, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie God, to denie Christ and all that euer he did: also to denie all pietie and religion, to condemne of foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse all good men, Martyres.

A seruant it is, &amp; therfore it ought to obey to serue the soul, that the soul might serue God, not as the bodie will, neither as the soule it selfe will, but as God will, whose wil we should learne to know &amp; behaue our selues thereafter. The which thing to obserue is hard for vs nowe, by reason of sinne which hath gotten a mansion house in our

bodies, and dwelleth in vs as doth the soule. To the which (sinne I meane) we are altogether of our selues inclined, because we naturally are sinners and born in sinne, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son wherof we are ready as seruants to sinne, and to vse our bodies accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, making the soule to sit at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and pampering vp the seruant to our shame.</p>
               <p>Oh therefore (good Lord) that it would please thee to open this geare vnto me, and to giue me eyes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider effectually this my body what it is, namely a seruant lent for the soule to soiourne in, and serue thee in this life: yea it is by reason of sinne that hath his dwelling there, become now to the soule nothing else, but a prison, and that most streit, vile, stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, filthie, and therfore in danger of miseries to many in al ages, times and places, till death haue turned it
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7408:126"/>
to dust whereof it came, &amp; whither it shall returne, that the soule may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to thee from whence it came, vntill the day of iudgement come, in the which thou wilt raise vp that body, that then it may be partaker with the soule, and the soule with it inseparably of weale or woe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that is done in and by the same bodie here now in earth.</p>
               <p>Oh that I could consider often and hartily these things, then should I not pamper vp this bodie to obey it, but bridle it that it might obey the soule: then should I flie the paine it putteth my soule vnto by reason of sinne and prouocation to all euill, &amp; continually desire the dissolution of it with Paul, and the deliuerance from it as much as euer did prisoner his deliuerance out of prison: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onely by it the diuell hath a dore to tempt, and so to hurt me: in it I am

               <p>I see and acknowledge that there is in my selfe no helpe of saluation, but al my confidence, hope, and trust, is in thy rich mercie and goodnesse.

them to whome thou wilt not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute their sinnes, but wilt accept and take mee for righteous and iust, and to be an inheritour of euerlastinge life.</p>
               <p>Thou mercifull Lord wast borne for my sake: thou diddest suffer both hunger and thirst for my sake: thou diddest teach, pray, and fast for my sake: all thy holy actions, and works thou wroughtest for my sake: thou sufferedst most greeuous paines and tormentes for my sake: finally thou gauest thy most precious bodie and bloode to be shed on the crosse for my sake. Now, most merciful Sauiour, let all these thinges profite me, that thou freely hast done for me, which hast giuen thy selfe also for mee. Let thy blood cleanse and wash away the spottes and fowlenesse of my sinnes. Let thy righteousnes hide and couer my vnrighteousnes. Let the merites
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:7408:172"/>
of thy passion and bloudsheding be the satisfaction for my sinnes. Giue me Lord thy grace, that the faith of my saluation in thy bloude wauer not in mee, but maie euer bee firme and constant: that the hope of thy mercy and life euerlasting neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in me: that loue waxe not colde in me: finally, that the weakenesse of my fleshe be not ouercome with the feare of death.</p>
               <p>Graunt me mercifull Sauiour, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when death hath shut vp the eyes of my bodie, yet the eyes of my soule may still beholde and looke vppon thee: and when death hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the vse of my tongue, yet my heart may crie and say: <hi>Lord into thy handes I commend my soule: Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su receiue my spirite.</hi>

               </note>The olde man therefore is more stronger, lustie and stirring then is the newe man, because the birth of the newe man is but begun now, and the olde man is perfectly borne. And as the olde man is more stirring, lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, and stronger then the newe man: so is the nature of him cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the nature of the newe man, as being earthly and corrupt with Sathans seede, the nature of the new man beinge heauenlye and blessed with the celestiall seede of God.<note place="margin">

And as, in as much as he is an old man, he is a sinner and an enimie to God: so in as much as he is regenerate, he is righteous and holy, and a friende to God, the seede of God preseruing him from sinne, so that he cannot sin, as the seede of the serpent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is corrupt euen from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, inclineth him, yea, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him to sinne, and nothing else but to sinne.

our cecitie or blindenes, and corrupt affections doe often shadow the sight of Gods seede in Gods children, as though they were plaine reprobates. Whereof it commeth, that they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to their sense, but not according to the truth, desire of God to giue them againe his spirite, as though they had lost it, and he had taken it away. Which thing GOD neuer doth indeede although he make vs to thinke so for a time: for alwaies he holdeth his hand vnder his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their falles, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they lie not stil as other doe which are not regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. And this is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Gods children, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and electe before al times in Christ, and the wicked castawayes: that the elect lye not still continually in their sin, as doe the wicked, but at the length do returne againe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Gods seede, which is in them

hid as a sparkle of fire in the ashes: as we may see in <hi>Peter, Dauid, Paul, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Magdalen,</hi> and others. For these (I meane Gods children) God hath made all thinges in Christ Iesu: to whom he hath giuen this dignitie, that they should be his inheritance and spouses. This our inheritour Christ Iesus, God with God, light of light, coeternall &amp; consubstantiall with the father and with the holy Ghost, to the ende that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our husband (because the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and the wife must be one body and flesh) hath taken our nature vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, communicating with it and by it in his owne person, to vs all his children, his diuine maiestie, (as Peter sayth) and so is become fleshe of our flesh,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.</note> and bone of our bones substantially, as we are become flesh of his fleshe, and bone of his bones spiritually: al that euer we haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:7408:218"/>
to him, yea euen our sinnes, as all that euer he hath, perteining vnto vs, euen his whole glorie. So that if sathan should summon vs to answere in our debtes, and sinnes, in that the wife is no sutable person, but the husbande, we may well bid him euer his action against our hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Christ, and he will make him a sufficient answere.</p>
            <p>For this end (I meane y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might be coupled &amp; maried thus to Christ, and so be certaine of saluation, &amp; at peace with God in our consciences) God hath giuen his holye worde, which hath two partes (as now the children of God doe consist of two men:<note place="margin">
