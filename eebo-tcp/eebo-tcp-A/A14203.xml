            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The next day wee set upon our march, the <hi>Indians</hi> being retired into Swamps, so as wee could not find them, wee burnt and spoyled both houses and corne in great abundance: but they kept themselves in obscuritie: Captaine <hi>Turner</hi> stepping aside to a Swampe, met with some few <hi>Indians,</hi> and charged upon them, changing some few bullets for Arrowes, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe received a shot upon the breast of his Corslet, as if it had beene pushed with a pike, and if hee had not had it on, hee had lost his life.</p>

Upon serious considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Governour and Councell sent forth my selfe with 20. armed souldiers to supply the necessitie of those distressed persons, and to take the government of that place for the space of three moneths: reliefe being come, Captaine <hi>Iohn Mason</hi> with the rest of his company returned to the Plantation againe: we sometimes fell out with a matter of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie souldiers to see whether we could discover the enemy or no; they seeing us (lying in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush) gave us leave to passe by them, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering we were too hot for them to meddle with us; our men being compleatly armed, with Corslets, Muskets, bandileeres, rests, and swords (as they themselves related afterward) did much daunt them; thus we spent a matter of six weekes before we could have any thing to doe with them, perswading our selves that all things had beene well. But they seeing there was no advantage more to be had against the Fort, they enterprized a new action, and fell upon <hi>Water towne,</hi> now called <hi>Wethersfield</hi> with two hundred <hi>Indians</hi>; before they came to attempt the place, they put into a certaine River, an obscure small river running into the maine, where they incamped, and refreshed themselves, and fitted themselves for their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and by breake of day attempted their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, and slew nine men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:11819:12"/>
having finished their action, they sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly returned againe, bringing with them two maids captives, having put poles in their Conoos, as we put Masts in our boats, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them hung our English mens and womens shirts and smocks, in stead of sayles, and in way of bravado came along in sight of us as we stood upon <hi>Seybrooke</hi> Fort, and seeing them passe along in such a triumphant manner, wee much fearing they had enterprised some des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate action upon the <hi>English,</hi> wee gave fire with a peece of Ordnance, and shotte among their Conooes. And though they were a mile from us, yet the bullet grazed not above twentie yards over the Conooe, where the poore maids were; it was a speciall providence of God it did not hit them, for then should we have beene deprived of the sweet observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods providence in their deliverance: we were not able to make out after them, being destitute of meanes, Boats, and the like: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee proceed any further to a full rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the insolent proceeding of this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nation, give me leave to touch upon the severall accommodations that belong to this <hi>Seybrooke</hi> Fort.</p>

            <p>I told you before, that when the <hi>Pequeats</hi> heard and saw <hi>Seabrooke</hi> Fort was supplied, they forbore to visit us: But the old Serpent according to his first malice stirred them up against the Church of Christ, and in such a furious manner, as our people were so farre disturbed, and affrighted with their boldnesse that they scarce durst rest in their beds: threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning persons and cattell to take them, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they did: so insolent were these wicked imps growne, that like the divell their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, they runne up and downe as roaring Lyons, compassing all corners of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey for a prey, seeking whom they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure: It being death to them for to rest without some wicked imployment or other, they still plotted how they might wickedly attempt some bloody enterprise upon our poore native Countrey-men.</p>
            <p>One Master <hi>Tillie</hi> master of a Vessell, being

brought to an ankor in <hi>Conetticot</hi> River, went ashore, not suspecting the bloody-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of those persons, who fell upon him, and a man with him, whom they wickedly and barbarously slew; and by relation brought him home, tied him to a stake, flead his skin off, put hot imbers betweene the flesh and the skinne, cut off his fingers and toes, and made hatbands of them, thus barbarous was their cruelty: would not this have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the hearts of men to hazard blood, and life, and all they had, to overcome such a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked insolent Nation? but Letters comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bay, that this attempt was made upon <hi>Wethersfield</hi> in <hi>Conetticot</hi> river, and that they had slaine nine men, women and children, and taken two maids captives, the Councell gave order to send supply.

            <p>Christian reader, give mee leave to appeale to the hearts of all true affectioned Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether this bee not the usuall course of Gods dealing to his poore captivated chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the prisoners of hope, to distill a great measure of sweet comfort and consolation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their soules in the time of trouble, so that the soule is more affected with the sense of Gods fatherly love, then with the griefe of its captivity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sure I am, that sanctified afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, crosses, or any outward troubles appeare
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:11819:18"/>
so profitable, that Gods deare Saints are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to cry out, Thy loving kindnesse is better then life, then all the lively pleasures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the world: better a prison sometimes and a Christ, then liberty without him: better in a fierie furnace with the presence of Christ, then in a Kingly palace without him: better in the Lyons denne, in the midst of all the roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lyons and with Christ, then in a doune bed with wife and children without Christ. The speech of <hi>David</hi> is memorable, that sweet affectionate Prince and souldier, <hi>how sweet is thy word to my taste; yea, sweeter then the honey, and the honey combe</hi>; hee spake it by experience, he had the sweet relish of Gods comforting presence, and the daily commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he had with the Lord, in the midst of all his distresses, tryals, and temptations that fell upon him. And so the Lord deales to this day; the greater the captivities bee of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, the contentions amongst his Churches, the cleerer Gods presence is amongst his to pick and cull them out of the fire, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest himselfe to their soules; and beare them up as <hi>Peter</hi> above the water that they sinke not.</p>
            <p>But now my deare and respected friends and fellow souldiers in the Lord, are not you apt to say, if this be the fruit of afflictions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would I had some of those, that I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy these sweet breathings of Christ in my

soule, as those that are in afflictions; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of those thoughts, or else experience will teach all to recall, or to unwith those thoughts, for it is against the course of Scripture to wish for evill, that good might come of it, wee cannot expect the presence of Christ in that which is contrary to him, (a man laying himselfe open to trouble) but wee are rather to follow Christs example, <hi>Father not my will, but thy will bee done, in earth as it is in heaven</hi>; and when thou art brought thus, prostrate before the Lord like an obedient child, ready to suffer what hee will impose on thee; then if hee thinke good to trie us, wee may exclude no tryall, no captivitie though burdensome or tedious to nature, for they will appeare sweet and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in the issue, if they bee of the Lords laying on: specially when the Lord is pleased to impose trouble on his in way of tryall (as hee said to <hi>Israel</hi> of old; I did it to prove you, and to see what was in your hearts) whether a soule would not doe as the foolish young man in the Gospel, cling more closer to his honour, or profit, or ease, or peace, or liberty, then to the Lord Iesus Christ: and therefore the Lord is pleased to exercise his people with trouble and afflictions, that hee might appeare to them in mercy, and reveale more cleerely his free grace unto their soules. Therefore consider deare brethren, and erre

not, neither to the right hand, nor to the left and bee not as <hi>Ephraim,</hi> like an untamed hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that would not stoope unto the yoke: but stoope to Gods afflictions if hee please to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them, and feare them not when they are from God. And know that Christ cannot be had without a crosse; they are inseparable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you cannot have Christ in his Ordinances, but you must have his crosse. Did ever any Christian reade, that in the purest Churches that ever were, that Christians were freed from the Crosse? was not the Crosse carried after Christ? and <hi>Andrew</hi> must follow Christ, but not without a Crosse; he must take it and beare it, and that upon his shoulders, implying, it was not a light crosse, but weighty: Oh let not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians shew themselves to bee so forgetfull, as I feare many are, of the old way of Christ: case is come into the world, and men would have Christ and ease, but it will not be in this world; is the servant better then the master? no, he is not, neither shall he be. But you may demand what is meant by this crosse, wee meet with many crosses in the world, losses at home and abroad, in Church and Common wealth: what crosse doth Christ meane? was it a crosse to bee destitute of a house to put his head in? or was it his crosse, that hee was not so deliciously sed as other men? or to bee so meane, wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the course of the world, or to bee destitute of silver and gold, as it is the lot of many of Gods saints to this day: this was not the crosse of Christ, you shall not heare him complaine of his estate, that it is too meane, or his lodging too bad, or his garments too plaine; these were not the troubles of Christ, these are companions to the crosse. But the chiefe crosse that Christ had, was that the word of his Father could not take place in the hearts of those to whom it was sent, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for the truth of his Father, that was Christs crosse; and that is the crosse too, that Christians must expect, and that in the purest Churches: And therefore why doe you stand and admire at <hi>New England,</hi> that there should bee contentions there, and differences there, and that for the truth of Christ? Doe you not remember that the crosse followed the Church? hath it not beene already said that Christs crosse followed him, and <hi>Andrew</hi> must carry it: and that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> will contend together for the truths sake? And doth not the Apostle say, contend for the truth (though not in a violent way?) doth not Christ say, I came not to bring peace but a sword? and why should men won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at us, seeing that troubles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions have followed the purest Churches since the beginning of the world to this day? wherefore should wee not looke backe to the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11819:20"/>
Scriptures, and deny our owne reason, and let that bee our guide and Platforme, and then shall wee not so much admire, when wee know it is the portion of Gods Church to have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and contentions? and when we know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it is God that brings them, and that for good to his Church; hath not God ever brought light out of darknesse, good out of evill? did not the breath of Gods Spirit sweetly breathe in the soules of these poore Captives which we now related? and doe we not ever find the greater the afflictions and troubles of Gods people bee, the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent is his grace in the soules of his servants? You that intend to goe to <hi>New England,</hi> feare not a little trouble.</p>
            <p>More men would goe to Sea, if they were sure to meet with no stormes: but hee is the most couragious souldier, that sees the battell pitcht, the Drummes beate an alarum, and Trumpets sound a charge, and yet is not afraid to joyne in the battell: shew not your selves cowards, but proceed on in your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and abuse not the lenitie of our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prince, and the sweet libertie hee hath from time to time given to passe and repasse according to our desired wills: wherefore doe yee stoppe, are you afraid?

But I would referre you to <hi>Davids</hi> warre, when a people is growne to such a height of bloud, and sinne against God and man, and all confederates in the action, there hee hath no respect to persons, but harrowes them, and sawes them, and puts them to the sword, and the most terriblest death that may bee: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Scripture declareth women and children must perish with their parents; some-time the case alters: but we will not dispute it now.

Having received their desires, they freely promised, and gave up themselves to march along with us, where ever we would goe. God having eased us from that oppression that lay upon us, thinking wee should have beene left in great misery for want of our ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, we diverted our thoughts from going to that neck of land; and faced about, marching to the river where our vessels lay at ankor. One remarkable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. The <hi>Pequeats</hi> playing upon our flankes; One Sergeant <hi>Davis,</hi> a pretty couragious souldier, spying something black upon the toppe of a rock, stepped forth from the body with a Carbine of three foot long, and at a venture gave fire, supposing it to bee an <hi>Indians</hi> head, turning him over with his heeles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; the <hi>Indians</hi> observed this, and greatly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that a man should shoot so directly. The <hi>Pequeats</hi> were much daunted at the shot, and forbore appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching so neere upon us. Being come to the <hi>Pequeat</hi> river we met with Captaine <hi>Patrick,</hi> who under his command had 40. able souldiers, who was ready to begin a second attempt: but many of our men being maimed and much wearied, we forbore that night and imbarqued our selves, my selfe setting sayle for <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke</hi> Fort. Captaine <hi>Mason,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Patrick</hi> marching over land, burned and spoyled the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey betweene the <hi>Pequeat</hi> and <hi>Conetticot</hi> river, where we received them. The <hi>Pequeats</hi> having received so terrible a blow, and being much affrighted with the destruction of so many, the next day fell into consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, assembling their most ablest men together pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded these three things, first whether they would

set upon a sudden revenge upon the <hi>Narragansets,</hi> or attempt an enterprize upon the <hi>English,</hi> or flye; they were in great dispute one amongst another, <hi>Sasachu:</hi> their chiefe Commander was all for bloud, the rest for flight, alledging these arguments, wee are a people bereaved of courage, our hearts are sadded with the death of so many of our deare friends; wee see upon what advantage the <hi>English</hi> lye, what sudden &amp; dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blowes they strike? what advantage they have of their peeces to us which are not able to reach them with our arrows at distance? they are supplied with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing necessary, they are flote and heartened in their victory; to what end shall wee stand it out with them? we are not able, therfore let us rather save some then lose all; this prevailed. Suddenly after they spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all those goods they could not carry with them, broke up their tents and Wigwams, and betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to flight. <hi>Sasachus</hi> flying toward <hi>Conetticot</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, quartered by the river side, there he met with a Shallop sent downe to <hi>Seabrooke</hi> Fort, which had in it 3. men, they let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
