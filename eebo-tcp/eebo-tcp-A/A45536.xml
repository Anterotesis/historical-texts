            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In his Forenoone Course before that Universitie, upon the 22. day of <hi>November,</hi> in the yeare 1640, being the third Sunday after the beginning of this present PARLIAMENT.</p>

            <p>REader (whosoever thou art) that dost scruple or make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doubt of the truth of the thing, done in such manner, time and place, as the Title Page doth Preface; Know that this Sermon <hi>verbatim,</hi> being preach'd in the very beginning of this Parliament <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>efore the whole Universitie, and a good part of the Towne of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> there are many Hundreds of People, that can attest and justifie every tittle in the Title Page, yet living every where, howsoever distress'd, or wheresoever dispers'd, throughout this Spacious Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The Author is a Priest, and graduated in Divinitie, in the time of Ignorance, and Popery, before the Gospell here in <hi>England;</hi> otherwise, he is a Gentleman of a very good and ancient House, and Extraction. A Gentleman and a Schollar, note that; for Blood and Learning, Generositie and Breeding, they are the two intire constitutive Principles of a Malignant, as compleat as Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Forme of a Naturall Body. Out upon them both; for wheresoever they meet in one; there needs no further Proofe, you may certainly and infallibly conclude, such a Person an enemy to this our State, Reprobate, and altogether untractable to this Blessed Reformation.</p>
            <p>The Publishing of this Sermon, I assure thee (not upon the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Faith, but in the word of an honest man) is not with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Notice, much lesse his Consent; which indeed was never a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d, wee supposing it to be with him, as it is generally with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Malignants, who though they be no whit asham'd, yet are very much afraid of their Malignancy.</p>
            <p>It remaines then onely, that thou beest rightly inform'd why this Sermon, (being Preach'd so long agoe) came not to publique view long before; or why it is just now held forth.</p>
            <p>Not Before, because the publishing of it before might justly have beene interpreted very prejudiciall to the wisedome of the Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of this Holy Warre, as if they had not had sufficient Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb facs="tcp:106834:3"/>
of understanding and judgement to carry on this Holy Cause, and businesse of their Holy Covenant, unlesse they had had this Patterne or some such Copy set before their eyes, whereby to direct their whole Counsells and Actions.</p>
            <p>But now that the Worke is so done, as the most envious Malignant cannot say, that ever any of their Predecessours in any Age have gone beyond them; It is very seasonable, yea requisite and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry indeed, to present to all the world this following Discourse, and that for this re<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>son, which (if you marke it) will plainly inferre the necessity.</p>
            <p>For seeing that all the Orthodox, painfull and Godly ministers (put into the severall Benefices of this Kingdome by this Blessed Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) both in their single exercises upon their Cures, and when they have exercised some <hi>4</hi> or <hi>5</hi> one over anothers head upon solemne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation dayes, have wrought powerfully upon the dullest capacities both of City and Country, and contributed much, yea very much, by their labour in the Cause, and mannagement of this holy Warre: but more especially seeing that the Reverend Assembly of Divines did not only pray, preach, exhort and counsell to this effect, but also did worke wonders, dispense with Oathes, (as much as ever the Papists can boast their Pope to have done) and make the very Scriptures themselves, especially in the <hi>English, Welsh,</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Languages conformable and subordinate to this holy Warre, and holy Covenant, as much as to their owne Presbytery and beautifull Discipline: It is then most expedient and necessary, that this Sermon be now printed for the justification and vindication, both of the one and of the other, from the slander and obloquie of the Reprobate, Wicked, Cavalier-Prelatists, and of the Separatists, and Independents, that all the world may see, understand, attest, and give judgement, that neither the Parliaments Orthodox Ministers have taught, incited or stirr'd up the people to any thing, nor the Reverend Assembly of Divines have directed, or counsel'd any thing in this holy Warre, and this holy Covenant for which the word doth not both hint and hold forth a most cleer Text and warrant as you shall find it written, —</p>

These and many more examples in Histories may be good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veats to make us take good heed how we judge mens actions by their persons and outward appearances, that because their persons and lives at least in common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance are free from those noysom sins that infect the times, therefore their actions of affronting and rising up against their lawfull Soveraigne proceed from Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Conscience, and care of the Common good; No by no meanes: But our surest course is, to judge mens persons by their actions, if their actions be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound and irregular, if they gather themselves together against their Prince and Soveraigne, against Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Word and Commandement, be their outward appearance never so specious and glorious, we may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure our selves they neither feare God nor regard man, but onely to serve their owne turnes. These (they) in my text were <hi>famous in the Congregation,</hi> and <hi>men of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne,</hi> yet they prov'd impious Rebels, and came to a fearfull end.</p>

            <p>So that now this first part is very complete, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination strong, the <hi>Levite</hi> joyn'd with the <hi>Rubenite</hi>; the party's eminent, <hi>Princes of the assembly</hi>; their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour plausible, <hi>famous in the Congregation, and men of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne</hi>; and the people hook't in by wiles and trickes to serve the great mens turnes; so that there wants but a signall or watch-word and then they are up in Armes, and that belike was given, for in the next place you shall find them gather'd together.

So that 'tis no wonder that now they are rebelliously gather'd together against them, for murmuring is a neere disposition to Rebellion; when men take the libertie to complaine, and chide, and expostulate, and murmure against their Governours, urg'd many times by necessitie to some unpleasing and seeming rigorous actions, 'tis a bad signe and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends no good. When sudden gusts of wind begin to murmur upon the Seas, and the waves swell and tosse, 'tis a signe the storme is not farre off; The children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> here, after they had once learn'd to murmur, ere long they finde the way to Rebellion, &amp; are gather'd together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Et Congregarunt seipsos,</hi> Here begins their unruly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour and undutifull carriage, by an illegall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themselves together. What had they so soon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the Silver Trumpet, which but a little before was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the ordinance of Almighty God, for that very use and purpose, to gather the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on together? as you may read, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.3. At the sound of two Trumpets all the assembly were to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if but one Trumpet sounded, then the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, heads of thousands, were to be gather'd together to <hi>Moses</hi>; And the sounding of these Trumpets was by a perpetuall law appropriated to the sonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi>: Now these Princes take upon them the office both of <hi>Aarons</hi> sonnes and Trumpets too, and most disorderly and seditiously gather themselves together, not to, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> And indeed what else can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106834:10"/>
from such unruly assemblies? when people ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themselves together without any order or direction from their lawfull Governours, 'tis commonly for some bad end and purpose, the blasts of such winds ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd together are for the most part violent and feareful; In such assemblies are hatcht Treasons, Heresies, Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, Schismes, Conspiracies, and all manner of Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie; and therefore those who by their owne Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were counted cautelous Princes in the world, as <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the seventh of <hi>England</hi> King, by name, knowing the dangerous consequences of these unlawfull assemblies, scarce suffer'd any Parliament to passe in his time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some provision by Law against these disorderly courses of peoples gathering themselves together; and it seems it is not amisse for their owne securitie, as appears by these assemblers here; for when they had gathered themselves together, 'tis not <hi>ad</hi> or <hi>circa Mosen,</hi> but <hi>contra Mosen et Aaronem,</hi> and that's the third part, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But here, by the way you may discover a little want of art in mannaging this part of Rebellion, for they might have taken an opportunity to have beene gather'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the call of <hi>Moses</hi> his Trumpet, and then they had begun more legally, and perhaps might better have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended their actions against publick obloquies; and when they were once thus fairly and orderly gather'd together, their party being so potent &amp; stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, they might have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen whether they would have bin dissolved or no at <hi>Moses</hi> his command, untill they had attained their ends and purposes; so that this part of Rebellion might have been somewhat corrected and amended by foresight, but yet 'tis no great matter, for those that venture upon such enormous actions as these, need not stand upon such nice points of Law for their justification, and therefore

            <p>'Tis <hi>contra Mosen supremum Principem, &amp; Aaronem sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Pontificem, legitimas potestates.</hi> Morall vertues and vices are formally distinguished, and constituted, by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall acts limited and determined to speciall objects, either commanded or forbidden by some Law, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or Constitution; As for example, 'tis not every occision or killing that doth Constitute the sin of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, one may kill a beast, or a bird, or fish, or a creeping thing, and yet not be guiltie of this sinne; but if this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nericall act of killing be determin'd or limited to a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable creature, prohibited both by Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law to be killed, which is the <hi>Occisio hominis,</hi> the killing of a man, then 'tis Murder. So 'tis not every dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly gathering together doth Constitute the sinne of Rebellion, for had these here gather'd themselves onely <hi>in perturbationem ordinis vel pacis,</hi> the Assembly might

have prov'd but a plaine Conventicle; or had they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd themselves together onely to doe some unlawfull act, <hi>ad Terrorem populi,</hi> whereby either the peaceabler sort had beene feared by the fact, or the lighter sort emboldned by the example, and gone no farther, it had beene either but simply an unlawfull Assembly, or a Rout, or a Riot at most; but when they gather'd together, <hi>contra Mosen &amp; Aaronem,</hi> against their supreme and legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Governours, ordained by Almightie God, the Act specificated by this object, doth formally Constitute the sinne of Rebellion; so that here is presented unto us a perfect definition of Rebellion, <hi>Rebellio est congregatio subjectorum contra potestatem à Deo ordinatam.</hi> Now the vitiositie of this Act (<hi>i. e.</hi>) of the subjects gathering themselves together against the power ordained by God, can never be altered or changed by the goodnesse of the end or motive, because all sinfull actions contract their Vitiositie or badnesse primarily and chiefly from their principle and forme; Now the principle and forme of all sinne, according to S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>ut inde eveniat bonum, We must not doe evill, that good may come thereof</hi>; And of those that slanderously reported of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he should say any such thing as Let us do evill that good may come, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces this sentence as dis-avowing such a damnable conclusion, that <hi>their damnation was just. Vitium fit ex qualibet defectu</hi> (saith the Schoole-man) When any part or least circumstance that is requisite to the goodnesse of an action is defective, absent, or wanting, the whole action becomes vitious, much rather when the principle or forme is wanting, which consists in the conformitie of our actions to the Divine Law, which is the Originall, Principle, and Rule of all our Deeds, and the goodnesse of the end which doth but circumstantionate the action can never change the vitious nature or being of it. 'Tis not <hi>Saul's</hi> keeping the best of the Cattle for sacrifice can excuse him for the breach of Gods Commandement; and if God in absolute and unlimited termes pronounce, <hi>Whosoever resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God,</hi> I cannot see how the goodnesse of the end, be it Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Reformation, or the common good, can warrant any such resistance from the transgression of Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, except these or the like limitations had beene spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and annexed to the Command, Law, or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Almightie God. <hi>Vbi Lex non distinguit, nos non distinguere debemus</hi> (sayes the Civilian) Where the Law does not distinguish in what cases such a thing is to be done, or not to be done, we ought not to determine and define those cases of our own head and power, without the authoritie of the Law-giver. Either God could, or he could not have specified these particular cases, in which Subjects might have resisted the power; to say he could not, were in plaine termes to deny either his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscience,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106834:12"/>
or Omnipotency, either that he did not know all those particular cases, or that he could not transmit them either by word or writing, whereby we might know and observe them. To say he could, but would not, methinkes it sounds somewhat harsh, that God should impose such a hard obligation upon the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not to resist the power upon paine of death and damnation, and yet reserve some particular limitations within the secrets of his owne breast, to be found out by the uncertaine deductions of Humane Reason. It is not the wonted course of the goodnesse of Almightie God, to deale so closely and reservedly with mankind in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of so great Consequence, that so neerely concernes the salvation of mens soules, &amp; the conservation of peace and tranquillitie in his Church. And if there were any such reserv'd limitations in Gods breast, I wonder S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who knew the mind of Christ, and profest, that they <hi>shunn'd not to declare the whole counsell of God,</hi>

Or if these li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations have beene delivered over by tradition, to be put in practice by the more-flourishing times of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106834:13"/>
Church. I wonder in the time of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie (by the enemies Confession) had almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread the whole world, that so many thousand Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans would so quietly and patiently suffer their bloods to be spilt upon the ground for Christs sake, and yet not once draw a sword against that wicked Emperour in their Masters Cause. What? was there no zeale, no jealousie for Gods honour in these holy Martyrs and Saints of God? Or if yet the Church had not sufficient opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to put this Divinitie in practice. I wonder that <hi>Iulian's</hi> army, consisting for the most part of Christians, would suffer that Apostate in that scoffing manner to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride Christ and his Religion, when they had so faire oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions and opportunities, either to castigate, depose, or murther him. What? was there no spirit of fortitude in those valiant souldiers, so stout and daring in their Emperours Battell, and so remisse and cold in Christs Cause? And yet 'tis more strange, that for almost a thousand yeares after Christ we cannot find these limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in what cases it is lawfull to resist the higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, either in the practice of the Church, or in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of ancient Fathers and Orthodox Christians? 'Tis very well known, that 'twas the ambition of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> first taught and maintain'd this Divinitie in the world of resisting lawfull powers. And I wonder, that those of the Reformation, who could not so much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a Vestment or an harmelesse Ceremonie, <hi>eo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> for that very reason, because it had beene used by that Church, would so easily joyne with them in deposing of Princes, and rebelling against Soveraignes, that they would strain at a Gnat, and swallow a Cammell. Well, whatsoever motives or occasions others may lay hold of for resisting of the power I know not, I am sure these
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106834:13"/>
Rebels here could find but little in the persons or beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours of their Governours, to gather themselves thus rebelliously together against them, for 'twas:</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Contra Mosen mitissimum hominem &amp; Aaronem san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum Domini,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Levit. 20.26.</note> and this seems to be that part or portion of Gods word, which these Rebels here use or rather abuse for the inducement and bringing in of a puritie into the Church of God, and as a reason why <hi>Aaron</hi> should not be lifted up above the Congregation of the Lord. But here they use a palpable equivocation in the word <hi>Holinesse</hi>; for in regard that <hi>Holinesse</hi> is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of a person or thing from common use to and for the service of Almighty God, in regard of severall services of and to Almighty God, there are severall and distinct kinds of <hi>Holinesse</hi>; as in respect of persons, there is <hi>sanctitas Conversationis &amp; sancritas Functionis</hi>; of <hi>Conversationis,</hi> when men are separated from the vanities of this wicked world, as the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, &amp; the pride of life &amp; devoutly dedicated to the obedience and observance of Gods holy will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; and then there is <hi>sanctitas functionis,</hi> when certaine men are separated by divine institution from the rest of the Congregation to wait and attend Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to officiate at his Altars in the Priestly functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now though it be granted that all this Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were holy the first way as well as <hi>Aaron, (i. e.)</hi> sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated

from all other people by the gracious choice of Almighty God to serve him in their lives and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by obedience to those Lawes, Commandements and Ordinances which God had appointed for them: yet they were not Holy by way of <hi>Function</hi> and office as well as <hi>Aaron, (i. e.)</hi> separated and set apart by the call and election of Almighty God to officiate at his Altars, and to Minister before God in the Priestly office; for thus <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sons alone were Holy, as being but a little while before set apart for the Priestly office by the vocation of Almighty God himselfe, and consecrated by <hi>Moses</hi> to that Holy Function, in the view of the whole Congregation, as is plaine to be seen. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the fift vers. of this Chap. <hi>Moses</hi> told <hi>Korah</hi> and all his company,<note place="margin">Exod. 28.</note> saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>To morrow the Lord will shew who is his, and who is Holy,</hi> (i. e.) in office and function as the next words plainly declare, and who ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach near unto him (<hi>i. e.</hi>) as a Priest to offer Sacrifices, burne Incense, and performe other Sacerdotall Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And indeed the Lord shew'd it with a vengeance by the dismall destruction of these unhallowed Rebels; and so you see how these Rebels here most prophanely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and abuse Gods sacred word, because all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation were Holy, as being separated from all other people by the choice of Almighty God, to keep his Commandements and Ordinances, therefore by this ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocating tricke and shift, they would have set up this whole Congregation to stand in competition with <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> for the Priestly office, and so have thrust him out of that eminent place in the Church, to which God had called him.</p>
            <p>And by another Religious tricke, not unlike this, they give an heave at <hi>Moses</hi> their Prince and Governour, <hi>for

the Lord was amongst them,</hi> &amp; therefore there must be no <hi>Moses</hi> pretending here the honour and glory of God, for therein lies the force of their argument: The Lord was amongst them by day in a cloud, by night in a pillar of fire, and at other times in glorious appearances up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on speciall occasions, and therefore it was a derogation from the honour of Almighty God, that such an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour as <hi>Moses</hi> should take upon him and exercise autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity when the King of Heaven and Earth was present, and here most impudently they abuse God's honour to cover their unworthy and base practises, for they could not be ignorant that God himselfe had imposed this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Government and Superioritie upon <hi>Moses,</hi> and that with great reluctancy on his part, and had seene it confirm'd to him by many signes, miracles and wonders.

shewes to dazle the peoples eyes, that they might not pierce into the depth of their ambitious designes, and therefore they cryed out, <hi>All the Congregation are holy, and the Lord is among them, and so no</hi> Moses, <hi>no</hi> Aaron.</p>
            <p>And see here the corrupt nature of Rebellion; There is nothing so Holy, nothing so Sacred, nothing so Pure, but 'tis prophaned, polluted, and defil'd by her abmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Religion, that sacred bond tying God and man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, is made an instrument by Rebellion to undoe all Humane Societies, and the fairest vertue in mans soule is made a Maske to hide the deformities of the foulest Sin. When ambition swells, or discontent breakes out, or fury rages, then Religion must be used as decayed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe, <hi>Fucus</hi> and <hi>Cerus,</hi> for the basest offices to cozen and delude the world; And those who before, like the unjust Judge, <hi>Neither feared God nor regarded man,</hi> can now fawne upon those whom before in their pride they scorn'd; and to advance their owne ambitious ends, force themselves against their owne nature and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to seeme Religious: Nay, and make shift to wrap out a place of Scripture too, as the Devill did to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but most miserably wrested and abus'd to serve their owne lusts, as we must obey God rather than man.</p>

            <p>And indeed all the world may perceive, and so might this whole Congregation too, (had not they beene most miserably blinded and besotted) by the weaknesse and sillinesse of these mens Reasons, that their owne ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hopes, and not the peoples Good was their maine drift and end; for can any man with reason, thinke or imagine, that all the Congregation should have beene <hi>Aaron's,</hi> and Priests, because they were all Holy; or that they should all have bin Governours, &amp; Princes, and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and do what they lift because the Lord was amongst them?
